        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>We describe a second primase in human cells, PrimPol, which has the ability to start DNA chains with deoxynucleotides unlike regular primases, which use exclusively ribonucleotides. Moreover, PrimPol is also a DNA polymerase tailored to bypass the most common oxidative lesions in DNA, such as abasic sites and 8-oxoguanine. Subcellular fractionation and immunodetection studies indicated that PrimPol is present in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA compartments. PrimPol activity is detectable in mitochondrial lysates from human and mouse cells but is absent from mitochondria derived from <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> knockout mice. <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> gene silencing or ablation in human and mouse cells impaired mitochondrial DNA replication. On the basis of the synergy observed with replicative DNA polymerases PolÎ³ and PolÎµ, PrimPol is proposed to facilitate replication fork progression by acting as a translesion DNA polymerase or as a specific DNA primase reinitiating downstream of lesions that block synthesis during both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA replication.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA polymerases make and repair DNA, thereby controlling both the stability and variability of genetic information. Whereas both replication and repair employ DNA polymerases that maximize faithful DNA synthesis, other tasks such as lesion bypass come at the price of lower fidelity and are performed by the so-called âsloppyâ DNA polymerases (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Goodman and Tippin, 2000</xref>). In humans, 16 different DNA-synthesizing enzymes are dedicated to replication, repair, damage tolerance, and variability of nuclear DNA (reviewed in <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">HÃ¼bscher etÂ al., 2002</xref>). In stark contrast, only one DNA polymerase has been described in mitochondria (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bolden etÂ al., 1977</xref>), DNA polymerase gamma (PolÎ³), which has long been presumed to mediate every DNA synthesis reaction related to the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).</p>
      <p>None of the known 17 human DNA polymerases can initiate DNA synthesis, and, because RNA polymerases can polymerize ribonucleotides from a single nucleoside 5â²-triphosphate (NTP), RNA is widely used to prime DNA synthesis. In most cases, such RNA primers are produced by specialized polymerases or âprimasesâ (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Frick and Richardson, 2001</xref>). Primases can be divided in two evolutionarily unrelated families: DnaG-like (bacteria) and AEP-like (archaea and eukaryotes) (<xref rid="bib1 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Aravind etÂ al., 1998; Iyer etÂ al., 2005</xref>). The human primase operating at nuclear DNA is a heterodimer (Pri1+ Pri2) wherein Pri1 is the small catalytic subunit belonging to the AEP family. During nuclear DNA replication, the primase interacts with PolÎ±, forming a very stable complex (PolÎ±-primase) that triggers the initiation of DNA synthesis. The few primers made at ori sequences are further elongated by the leading-strand DNA polymerase (PolÎµ); conversely, other primers are synthesized repeatedly, much like those used to initiate the synthesis of Okazaki fragments in the antiparallel lagging strand.</p>
      <p>Exceptionally, RNA primers can be generated by the transcription activity of RNA polymerases, as in plasmid ColE1 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Itoh and Tomizawa, 1980</xref>) and during the replication of mtDNA (<xref rid="bib8 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Clayton, 1985; FustÃ© etÂ al., 2010</xref>). The replication of mtDNA (a small circle of about 17 kb in human cells) is a complex process involving multiple mechanisms (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Holt and Reyes, 2012</xref>). At the replication fork, the mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE opens the duplex, and the mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB) stabilizes the unwound DNA (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Falkenberg etÂ al., 2007</xref>), although the extent of coating of the lagging-strand template with mtSSB may be minimal because of the incorporation of processed transcripts (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Reyes etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) primes at one major initiation site on each strand, oriH and oriL (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">FustÃ© etÂ al., 2010</xref> and the references therein), and primer elongation is performed by PolÎ³ (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Falkenberg etÂ al., 2007</xref>). However, minor replication products of coupled leading- and lagging-strand mtDNA synthesis (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Holt etÂ al., 2000</xref>) would need frequent priming on the lagging strand. As long ago as 1985, a primase activity distinct from POLRMT was detected in human mitochondria, although the protein responsible has not yet been identified (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Clayton, 1985</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, ccdc111, a putative primase based on inÂ silico predictions (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Iyer etÂ al., 2005</xref>), is shown to have both DNA primase and DNA polymerase activities (and, thus, is renamed PrimPol) and a striking capacity to tolerate DNA damage. PrimPol was shown to be present at both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA compartments but is absent in mitochondria derived from a mouse PrimPol knockout (KO) model. RNAi experiments in human cells and analysis of <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) indicated that PrimPol plays a key role in mtDNA synthesis. A plausible hypothesis is that this primase/polymeraseÂ facilitates replication restart after programmed or damage-induced fork arrest.</p>

        <title><italic>CCDC111</italic>, an Ancient Eukaryotic Gene Predicted to Encode a Primase</title>
        <p>Human gene <italic>CCDC111</italic> (also known as FLJ33167), which is located on chromosome 4q35.1 and codes for <underline>c</underline>oiled <underline>c</underline>oil <underline>d</underline>omain-<underline>c</underline>ontaining (ccdc111) protein, was predicted to be a member of the AEP family (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Iyer etÂ al., 2005</xref>). ccdc111 contains the active-site motifs of AEP primases and a putative Zn finger similar to that of herpesvirus UL52 primase and other AEP-like enzymes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref> available online).</p>
        <p>Iterative BLAST searches with human ccdc111 and putative homologs indicated the presence of ccdc111 in a broad range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, unicellular microalgae, protists, choanoflagellates, fungi, and picoeukaryotes such as <italic>Ostreococcus</italic> (the smallest known free-living eukaryote with a single chloroplast and a single mitochondrion). Alignment of putative ccdc111 homologs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>) revealed 14 conserved regions, including the Zn finger domain and the motifs A, B, and C shared with AEP primases, nonhomologous end-joining primases, PrimPols, and Herpes and poxvirus-like primases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A, 1B, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>). All members of the ccdc111 family have the motif A variant DxE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>) instead of the DxD motif present in most members of the AEP superfamily. The DxE variant is also found in the PrimPol of plasmid pRN1 from <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic>, which has both primase and DNA polymerase activities (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lipps etÂ al., 2003</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ccdc111 Is an Active Primase that Can Initiate Nucleic Acid Synthesis with dNTPs</title>
        <p>In agreement with inÂ silico predictions (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Iyer etÂ al., 2005</xref>), purified human ccdc111 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>A) displayed RNA primase activity on a single-stranded circular DNA template (M13 ssDNA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C, left). Interestingly, the protein was dependent on manganese for RNA synthesis, yielding remarkably long primers (&gt;100 nt) that were not generated in the presence of magnesium (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>A, left). Strikingly, a similar primase activity was observed when NTPs were replaced by deoxynucleoside 5â²-triphosphates (dNTPs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>A, right). In general, primases make RNA primers, but the AEP-related primases of archea and some bacteria are exceptions to this rule (<xref rid="bib24 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lao-Sirieix etÂ al., 2005; SÃ¡nchez-Berrondo etÂ al., 2012</xref>) and use dNTPs as valid substrates for priming. This unusual RNA and DNA primase activity is not present in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and was demonstrated to be inherent to human ccdc111 by ablating the activity with a double mutation (AxA) in the two potential metal ligands (Asp<sup>114</sup> and Glu<sup>116</sup>, motif DxE) at the predicted active site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C), which was in agreement with enzymatic and structural studies of the PrimPol from plasmid pRN1 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lipps etÂ al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we evaluated the primase activity on a template oligonucleotide in which a potential recognition sequence (GTCC) was flanked by thymine residues (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cavanaugh and Kuchta, 2009</xref>). Such a tract of pyrimidines is the preferred template context for several viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic RNA primases (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Frick and Richardson, 2001</xref>). Again, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-activated synthesis of DNA primers and their extensive elongation were observed with purified human ccdc111 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>C). Ccdc111 primase recognized the 3â² GTCC-5â² sequence, preferentially forming initiating dinucleotides 5â² A-dG-3â² or 5â² dA-dG-3â² (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>D and 1E). There was no difference in the efficiency of initiation when providing either a ribo- or a deoxynucleotide at the 5â²position (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). Again, mutant AxA was inactive in this assay, supporting the intrinsic nature of the primase activity attributable to ccdc111 protein. In respect to the second nucleotide, ccdc111 displayed a marked preference for a dNTP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E, left). Mn<sup>2+</sup>-activated formation of a ribo-deoxy-initiating dimer (occurring at Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as low as 50Â Î¼M; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>B) is a hallmark of ccdc111, given that several other DNA synthesizing enzymes were unable to catalyze this reaction, and a conventional primase such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> DnaG displayed only a modest activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E, right).</p>

        <title>Ccdc111 Primase Is also a DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase</title>
        <p>Unlike eukaryotic primases, archeal primases are able to carry out the initiation and extension of both RNA and DNA chains of up to 1 or 7 kb, respectively (<xref rid="bib23 bib24 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Lao-Sirieix and Bell, 2004; Lao-Sirieix etÂ al., 2005; Chemnitz Galal etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Hence, these enzymes are both primases and polymerases, or PrimPols (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lipps etÂ al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether, in addition to its DNA and RNA primase activity, ccdc111 possessed DNA-dependent polymerase activity. ccdc111 was able to extend a DNA primer hybridized to M13 ssDNA by polymerizing dNTPs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Again, Mn<sup>2+</sup> was the preferred metal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A, compare panels 1 and 2), allowing the nonprocessive elongation of DNA chains up to 5 kb (data not shown). The enzyme also utilized NTPs, albeit with a much lower efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A, panel 3). As with the primase activity, the DNA polymerase activity was abolished in the AxA mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A, panel 4). Hence, the primase and polymerase activities of ccdc111 (compared in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B as a function of enzyme concentration) appear to share the same active site. Thus, in light of its identified activities, we propose that ccdc111 should be renamed PrimPol.</p>
        <p>PrimPol efficiently catalyzed DNA polymerization within a wide range of Mn<sup>+2</sup> concentrations (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>C). Even at the lowest Mn<sup>+2</sup> concentration tested (10Â Î¼M), PrimPol was more efficient than using a physiological concentration of Mg<sup>+2</sup> (10Â mM). Thus, Mn<sup>+2</sup> is a more than 1,000-fold better metal activator than Mg<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that it is likely to be the physiological cofactor of PrimPol. A similar behavior has been described for human PolÎ» (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blanca etÂ al., 2003</xref>). Independent of the metal cation, PrimPol behaved as a DNA-instructed DNA polymerase, preferentially inserting the complementary nucleotide dictated by the first available templating base (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). PrimPol provided a 1,000-fold bias toward correct Watson-Crick base pairs when extending a correctly-paired primer terminus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D, top). PrimPol could not excise a mismatched primer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D, bottom), demonstrating the absence of a proofreading 3â²-5â² exonuclease activity. This is in agreement with the lack of ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII consensus motifs, which form an evolutionarily conserved 3â²-5â²exonuclease active site in several DNA polymerase families (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bernad etÂ al., 1989</xref>). However, the extension of a mismatched primer terminus by PrimPol is about 1,000-fold less efficient than the extension of a correctly paired primer terminus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D).</p>

Biochemical fractionation of HeLa cells revealed that PrimPol was distributed between the cytosol (47%), mitochondria (34%), and nuclear (19%) compartments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). In order to determine whether the mitochondrial-associated PrimPol was inside the organelles, mitochondria from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were treated with trypsin and exposed to hypotonic buffer or digitonin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). As expected, a mitochondrial protein located in the outer membrane (TOM20) proved sensitive to trypsin, as did the portion of an inner membrane protein facing the intermembrane space (TIM23) after rupturing of the outer membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B), whereas matrix proteins (TFAM and HSP60) and PrimPol were resistant to trypsin in all cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). Hence, the fraction of PrimPol associated with mitochondria is inferred to be in the matrix.</p>

        <title>Mitochondrial PrimPol-Containing Fractions Show Primase Activity</title>
        <p>Fractionation of detergent-solubilized mitochondria of HEK 293T cells on an iodixanol gradient (IG) separated the majority of PrimPol and RNASE-H1 from mtDNA and mtDNA maintenance proteins such as TWINKLE and TFAM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). Formaldehyde crosslinking increased the amount of PrimPol and RNASE-H1 cofractionating with mtDNA but not other mitochondrial proteins, such as VDAC1 or ETFB (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D). These data suggest that PrimPol, like RNASE-H1, interacts with mtDNA transiently and that this interaction may be disrupted by the conditions used to lyse mitochondria. Importantly, in the absence of crosslinking, IG sedimentation completely separated PrimPol from the mitochondrial RNA polymerase POLRMT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A), thereby enabling the activities of the two enzymes to be assessed independently. When the different fractions from the IGs were subjected to a DNA primase assay with the use of oligo dT<sub>25</sub> as template, those fractions enriched in mtDNA (10â12) yielded a mixed pattern of products (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A) that can be attributed to the activities of PolÎ³ alone or in conjunction with POLRMT, terminal transferase(s), and poly-A polymerase; in contrast, fractions enriched in PrimPol (14â16) displayed a precise pattern of oligonucleotide products of â¼2â12 nt (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A, filled arrowhead, see also the zoomed-in area in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A<sup>â</sup>), whose relative abundance correlated with the amount of protein detected by immunoblotting and that could be further extended by Klenow DNA polymerase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A, right).</p>
        <p>To establish that PrimPol was responsible for the observed DNA primase activity, we subjected mitochondrial fractions from MEFS possessing (+/+) or lacking (â/â) the <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> gene (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>) to the DNA primase assay. In <italic>PRIMPOL</italic><sup>+/+</sup> MEF mitochondria, short DNA products of â¼2â12 nt were detected in gradient fractions 15 and 16 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B); i.e., the portion of the gradient where human PrimPol migrates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A).

        <title>PrimPol Tolerates 8oxoG and Abasic Sites in DNA</title>
        <p>By virtue of its primase activity, PrimPol might facilitate DNA replication by restarting DNA synthesis downstream of pauses or fork arrest due to damaged DNA, as has been shown to occur in bacteria, yeast, and human cells (<xref rid="bib16 bib27 bib6 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Heller and Marians, 2006; Lopes etÂ al., 2006; Callegari and Kelly, 2006, Elvers etÂ al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the distributive pattern of DNA polymerization and the lack of a proofreading exonuclease suggest that PrimPol might also perform translesion synthesis (TLS) in order to facilitate elongation across a damaged template. Considering its presence in mitochondria, TLS by PrimPol was tested on synthetic templates containing either an oxidized form of guanine (8-oxoguanine or 8oxoG) or an abasic (AP) site, given that these are the most frequent forms of damage occurring in mtDNA as a consequence of oxidative stress (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berquist and Wilson, 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>As a control, and as previously documented (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Graziewicz etÂ al., 2007</xref>), PolÎ³ dealt poorly with an 8oxoG lesion in the template (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>A). In contrast, PrimPol gave rise to similar elongation products with both damaged and undamaged templates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A), indicating that it was not hindered by the presence of the 8oxoG lesion. By using an oligonucleotide whose primer terminus was juxtaposed to the lesion (standing start conditions), the efficiency and fidelity of nucleotide insertion opposite the 8oxoG site was studied (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B). In agreement with an efficient TLS capacity, the error-free insertion of dC opposite 8oxoG by PrimPol paralleled that opposite an undamaged dG template, and the misinsertion of dA opposite 8oxoG was slightly more efficient (1.5-fold). Interestingly, PrimPol could also use cytidine 5â²-triphosphate (CTP) or ATP to bypass 8oxoG, although, in this case, the error-free insertion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C) was 10-fold more efficient than the error-prone one (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A).</p>
        <p>Mitochondrial PolÎ³ was unable to bypass AP sites (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>B), given that its 3â²-5â² exonuclease favors primer degradation near the site of the lesion. Conversely, human PrimPol efficiently polymerized across the AP site (indicated with an X in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C), although the accumulation of theÂ +3 elongation product indicated some delay at this point. PrimPol continued polymerization beyond the AP site in â¼80% of the molecules, which contrasts with the null bypass observed with PolÎ³. Interestingly, the size of the longest elongation product (+16) was 1 nt shorter than that obtained on an equivalent template with no damage (+17), suggesting that PrimPol does not insert a nucleotide opposite the AP site but skips the lesion, copying the next template base available (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5D). Moreover, the size of the main (+11) and other minor elongated products (+14) suggested that primer extension was occurring by a different mechanism. Strikingly, the AP site was flanked by a 4 nt (CTAC) repeat (gray boxes in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D). Given the difficulty to âcopyâ the AP site, the microhomology provides an opportunity for a partially extended (+3) primer terminus to be realigned ahead of the lesion. Further elongation of the relocated primer terminus would explain the most abundantÂ +11 product obtained (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D for additional details). This peculiar capacity of PrimPol to bypass a lesion in the template probably reflects its features as a primase (avidity for ssDNA regions and flexibility to accept very limited primers [even a single nucleotide]). Thus, the marked ability of PrimPol to bypass oxidative stress DNA lesions suggests that its DNA polymerase activity may have an important role in DNA damage tolerance during the replication of mtDNA.</p>

        <title>The DNA Primers Synthesized by PrimPol Can Be Utilized by PolÎ³ and PolÎµ</title>
        <p>In a first approach, we measured deoxynucleotide polymerization using circular M13 ssDNA as a template, an assay which strictly requires a primase activity in order to allow the start of DNA synthesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E); by only providing PrimPol, some incorporation was observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, lanes 2 and 5), but incorporation was not observed when PolÎ³ was independently provided (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, lanes 3 and 6). The simultaneous presence of both enzymes had a synergistic effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, lanes 4 andÂ 7), particularly when a physiological concentration of GTP (100Â Î¼M) was provided in order to maximize the primase activity of PrimPol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, lane 7). Moreover, under these optimized conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>F), much lower amounts of PrimPol (50Â nM; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, lane 5) or a very low concentration of manganese ions (10Â Î¼M; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, lane 9) were sufficient to detect the synergistic effect of PrimPol and PolÎ³, strongly suggesting their functional coupling. Very similar results were obtained when the synergy of PrimPol and PolÎµ was evaluated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>G). These experiments demonstrate that, during restart of DNA synthesis, the DNA primers made by PrimPol (and most likely its TLS products) can be efficiently extended by the mitochondrial and nuclear replicative polymerases PolÎ³ and PolÎµ, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>H).</p>

        <title><italic>PRIMPOL</italic> Silencing or Ablation Affects Synthesis of mtDNA</title>
        <p>The presence of PrimPol in mitochondria suggested that it might play a role in mtDNA replication and maintenance; therefore, we investigated the effect of gene-silencing <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> on mtDNA metabolism. <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> small interfering RNA (siRNA) in human cells caused mtDNA levels to decrease to half those of controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A), similar to Twinkle siRNA (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tyynismaa etÂ al., 2004</xref>), and prevented the recovery of mtDNA copy number after transient drug-induced mtDNA depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B). Both results suggest that mtDNA replication is impaired when there is an abrupt loss of PrimPol. We also analyzed mtDNA replication intermediates, given that the perturbation of DNA replication in mitochondria is typically associated with changes in their abundance and properties (<xref rid="bib18 bib37 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Holt etÂ al., 2000; Yasukawa etÂ al., 2005; Wanrooij etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Although RNA-containing intermediates (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yasukawa etÂ al., 2006</xref>) increased after 48Â hr of <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> siRNA, they returned to normal levels at later time points (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S6</xref>A and S6B). Because mtDNA copy number was decreasing between 48 and 96Â hr of <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> gene silencing, we inferred that replication was not progressing normally. To determine the extent of mtDNA replication after 72Â hr of <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> gene silencing, we analyzed BrdU incorporation into mtDNA in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-transfected cells after preincubation with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of nuclear DNA replication. Almost all the control cells (96%) incorporated BrdU into mtDNA after 24Â hr of labeling, whereas the figure was 13% for <italic>PRIMPOL</italic>-depleted cells (pÂ &lt; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C). Hence, <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> gene silencing in human cultured cells caused a profound arrest of mtDNA synthesis.

Although the mouse has adapted to the absence of PrimPol, mtDNA replication was adversely affected in cells derived from the PrimPol KO mouse, given that the rate of restoring mtDNA copy number after drug-induced transient depletion was 2.3-fold lower than in mouse cells with PrimPol (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Human ccdc111 (or PrimPol) possesses DNA and RNA primase and DNA-dependent DNA and RNA polymerase activities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>), demonstrating its functional relationship to archeal PrimPol enzymes and its role as a unique human enzyme capable of de novo DNA synthesis solely with dNTPs. Another remarkable feature of PrimPol is its capacity to tolerate lesions such as 8oxoG and AP sites in DNA. Some PrimPol is present in the nucleus, but a larger fraction is located inside mitochondria. <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> gene silencing in human cultured cells has multiple adverse affects on mtDNA, and mouse cells lacking PrimPol display inefficient mtDNA replication. However, given that a mouse lacking the gene is viable, <italic>PRIMPOL</italic> is not essential for mtDNA maintenance.</p>
      <p>POLRMT, and not PrimPol, is believed to provide the primers for leading-strand mtDNA synthesis at the heavy strand origin of replication in the major noncoding region and at the major site of second strand mtDNA synthesis known as OriL (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Falkenberg etÂ al., 2007</xref>), and this is compatible with PrimPol being a nonessential gene. Instead, PrimPol might participate in priming at disparate sites when mtDNA replication pauses or stalls due to damaged DNA. In respect of damaged DNA, PrimPol, as a TLS DNA polymerase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B), could assist PolÎ³ in âreadingâ template lesions (e.g., 8oxoG), and it has the potential to bypass unreadable lesions (e.g., AP sites) by realigning the stalled primer terminus to an alternative template position ahead of the lesion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). Alternatively or additionally, PrimPol could exploit both its DNA primase and DNA polymerase activities in order to facilitate replication fork progression by acting as a specific TLS primase in order to reinitiate replication at pause sites or downstream of lesions that block continuous synthesis by replicative DNA polymerases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>D). PrimPol would be very well suited for this task, given that using deoxynucleotides for priming would leave little or no RNA to be further processed. Hence, the properties and behavior of PrimPol fit well with the proposed roles in mtDNA metabolism. Finally, PrimPol might contribute to multipriming events (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A) occurring on the lagging strand during coupled leading- and lagging-strand mtDNA replication (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Holt etÂ al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has only recently been recognized that leading-strand DNA synthesis is not always continuous. Genotoxic damage has been linked to discontinuities in leading-strand synthesis that entail skipping the obstacle, resuming fork progression, and leaving a gap behind (<xref rid="bib22 bib27 bib16 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Langston and OâDonnell, 2006; Lopes etÂ al., 2006; Heller and Marians, 2006; Yeeles and Marians, 2011</xref>). Daughter-strand gap formation after DNA damage induction has been detected in yeast and mammals, suggesting that repriming is a universal mechanism for bypassing DNA lesions (<xref rid="bib28 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Meneghini, 1976; Prakash, 1981</xref>). In this regard, we believe that PrimPol's primase may play a direct role in replication restart during nuclear DNA replication, further supported by the functional coupling shown here between PrimPol and human PolÎµ. We have recently found that PrimPol is required for repriming synthesis at stalled replication forks in the nucleus and its downregulation in cells produced persistent replication stress andÂ genome instability (S.M., S. RodrÃ­guez-Acebes, M.I.M.-J., S.G.-G., E.S.C., L.B., and J.M. unpublished data). These findings give additional support to our hypothesis of a similar function for PrimPol in mitochondria, given that replicative stress is constitutive during mtDNA replication, most likely due to a highly oxidative environment.</p>
      <p>In summary, we identify and characterize a DNA primase/polymeraseÂ in human cells endowed with the unique ability to initiate synthesis using dNTPs and a remarkable capacity for translesion synthesis. Our initial analysis of its function in mitochondria suggests that PrimPol plays a key role in DNA metabolism, pointing to a greater level of complexity in mtDNA replication than previously recognized and implying that PolÎ³ is not the sole DNA polymerase in mammalian mitochondria. The presence of PrimPol in human mitochondria suggests that it represents an ancestral cellular response to genotoxic insults, including AP sites and oxidized bases, contributing to tolerance of the environmental damage inside mitochondria. Now, the challenge is to tease out its precise contribution to DNA damage tolerance in the two DNA-containing compartments of the cell.</p>

Alternatively, a 5â² [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled 13-mer oligonucleotide primer (5â²-CACTGACTGTATG-3â²) was hybridized to either control (undamaged) 30-mer oligonucleotide template (5â²-CTCGTCAGCATCT<bold>T</bold>CATCATACAGTCAGTG-3â²) or damaged templates (30- or 31-mer) containing an AP site (5â²-CTCGTCAGCATCT(<bold>AP</bold>)CATCATACAGTCAGTG-3â²). The synthetic AP nucleotide was obtained from LinkTech and used to customize oligonucleotide synthesis. The reaction mixture (20Â Î¼l) contained buffer R, 2.5Â nM template/primer DNA, dNTPs or NTPs at the indicated concentration, and either purified human PrimPol (200Â nM) or human PolÎ³ (20Â nM, kindly provided by Maria Falkenbergâs lab). In the latter case, the reaction was tested in the presence of 10Â mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. After incubation for either 60Â min at 30Â°C (PrimPol) or 15Â min at 37Â°C (PolÎ³), primer extension products were analyzed as described above.</p>

        <title>Subcellular Fractionation of HeLa Cells</title>
        <p>HeLa cells were lysed and fractionated with a MitoSciences Cell Fractionation Kit (ab109719), which allowed the isolation of mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions. Two different markers were used to assess the purity of each fraction: cytoplasm (MEK2 and Î±-tubulin), mitochondria (ATP synthase and Hsp60), and nucleus (CTCF and histone H3). The amount of PrimPol in each compartment was estimated with quantitative immunoblotting.</p>

        <title>Trypsin Digestion and IG Fractionation of Mitochondria</title>
        <p>Subcellular fractionation of HEK 293T cells was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Reyes etÂ al., 2011</xref>), and sucrose-gradient purified mitochondria were left untreated or subjected to hypotonic or digitonin treatment (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ohsato etÂ al., 2002</xref>) followed by incubation with 100Â Î¼g/ml trypsin (30Â min at room temperature [RT]) and heat inactivation of trypsin at 95Â°C for 5Â min in 0.1% SDS. For IG, sucrose-gradient-purified mitochondria (2Â mg/ml) were treated with 100Â Î¼g/ml of trypsin at RT for 30Â min. After repeated washing, mitochondria were lysed with 0.4% n-Dodecyl-Ã-maltoside and centrifuged (10Â min at 1,000Â Ã <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub>); the supernatant was loaded on a 20%â42.5% IG and centrifuged at 100,000Â Ã <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> for 14Â hr. In some cases, mitochondria were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 30Â min at RT prior to lysis. When indicated, HEK 293T cells were treated with 100Â ng/ml ethidium bromide for 72Â hr or exposed to UV light (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) and allowed to recover for 18Â hr prior to mitochondrial extraction and further IG fractionation. Nucleic acid was extracted from a portion of each fraction of the gradient and after southern blotting and hybridized to a radiolabeled probe. The remainder of each fraction was used for immunoblotting and primase assays.

        <title>siRNA-Mediated Depletion of PrimPol and mtDNA Copy Number Estimation</title>
        <p>For siRNA experiments, HEK 293T and human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and 10Â nM Stealth RNA as described previously (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Reyes etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Stealth RNA sequences are indicated in the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref>. Qiagen AllStars negative control siRNA was used. Mitochondrial DNA copy number was estimated by comparing the abundance of the mitochondrial COX<italic>2</italic> gene to that of the nuclear APP gene, as described previously (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tyynismaa etÂ al., 2004</xref>).</p>

        <title>BrdU Labeling of Mitochondrial DNA</title>
        <p>Parental or <italic>PRIMPOL</italic>-silenced HOS cells were incubated with 20Â Î¼M aphidicolin for 3Â hr in order to block nuclear DNA replication before the addition of BrdU (1:1,000; Roche). After 24Â hr, BrdU-labeled cells were stained with 60Â nM MitoTracker Orange (Invitrogen), fixed, and sequentially incubated with anti-BrdU and anti-mouse IgG fluorescein according to the manufacturerâs indications (Roche). Slides were mounted in DABCO (Air Products and Chemicals) supplemented with DAPI (200Â ng/ml) and visualized in a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Images were acquired with a 63Ã oil immersion objective and processed in Adobe Photoshop.</p>

        <p>Human ccdc111 Is a Unique RNA/DNA Primase</p>
        <p>(A) Modular organization of various AEP-like enzymes. A conserved AEP domain (green bar) contains the three conserved regions A, B, and C, which form the primase active site. <italic>Hs</italic>ccdc111 contains, in addition to regions A, B, and C, a Zn-finger-containing region also present in the viral, plasmidic, and bacterial specimens. Additionally, some APE enzymes contain additional activities and domains as helicases (red bars) or a combination of nuclease and ligase (blue bars). <italic>Hs</italic>ccdc111, human ccdc111 protein; HHV/UL52, herpes virus UL52 primase; Vaccinia/D5, vaccinia virus primase; pRN1/PrimPol, plasmid pRN1 ORF904 from <italic>S.Â islandicus</italic>; <italic>Bc</italic>MCM, PrimPol helicase from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>; <italic>Mt</italic>PolDom, LigD polymerization domain from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>; and <italic>Hs</italic>Prim1, small catalytic subunit of the human RNA primase. See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>.</p>
        <p>(B) Conserved regions in proteins having and AEP-related domain. Large dots indicate metal ligands (red), nucleotide ligands (purple), and demonstrated (cyan) or potential (light blue) cysteine residues forming a Zn finger. Small dots indicate invariant residues in each group of AEP-related enzymes. Residues that are either conserved or identical to those in ccdc111 are indicated in bold or red letters, respectively. See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref> for a more extensive alignment.</p>
        <p>(C) Primer synthesis on M13 ssDNA using either NTPs or dNTPs. A scheme of the primase reaction is shown. WT ccdc111 (but not mutant AxA) synthesized de novo RNA (left) or DNA (right) primers on the M13 ssDNA circular template in the presence of activating Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions. See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref> and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>.</p>
        <p>(D) Priming at an ori-containing oligonucleotide. The schematic shows the different (initiation and elongation) products synthesized by a primase that recognizes the central GTCC sequence as a starting ori, providing the indicated combinations of NTPs (in green) and dNTPs (in blue). The primase products obtained with ccdc111 were very similar when either ATP (left) or dATP (right) were provided as 5â² nucleotide (in addition to dGTP, provided as a common 3â²nucleotide). See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref> and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>.</p>
        <p>(E) The same primase assay as in (D) except that primase products were labeled with [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP as the 5â² nucleotide. dGTP was a much better alternative than GTP as 3â² nucleotide (left). In these preferred conditions, the formation of the ribo-deoxy dimer (and further elongation products) is a hallmark of PrimPol, which cannot be obtained with other DNA polymerases or conventional primases (right).</p>

        <p>ccdc111 Is a DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase</p>
        <p>(A) Elongation of a 17-mer primer annealed to M13 circular ssDNA in the presence of either 5Â mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> or 1Â mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> as metal activators. WT ccdc111 (but not mutant AxA) extended the primer producing elongation intermediates characteristic of distributive DNA synthesis. NTPs were worse substrates for polymerization by ccdc111.</p>
        <p>(B) Compared efficiency of primase and polymerase activities of PrimPol. The primase assay, using the 29-mer GTCC oligo (5â²-T<sub>15</sub>CCTGT<sub>10</sub>-3â²) as template, and the DNA polymerase assay, using a template/primer oligonucleotide, were carried out as described in the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>. Data are represented as meanÂ Â± SD (nÂ = 3). See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>.</p>
        <p>(C) Matched versus mismatched nucleotide insertion at the four template bases. The four template/primer structures used, differing in the first template base (X), are indicated. Nucleotide insertion on each template/primer was analyzed in the presence of each individual dNTP. PrimPol preferentially inserted the complementary nucleotide dictated by the first available templating base. The insertion of some errors (indicated with asterisks) can be detected.</p>
        <p>(D) Polymerization assays were carried out with either a matched (top) or mismatched (middle) template/primer and the indicated concentrations of a correct (dA) or wrong (dG) nucleotide. After incubation,Â +1 extension of the 5â²-labeled (<sup>â</sup>) strand was analyzed by denaturing gel and autoradiography.</p>

        <p>PrimPol Localizes at Both DNA Compartments, Mitochondria, and Nucleus</p>
        <p>(A) 5Â Ã 10<sup>6</sup> HeLa cells were fractionated (see the <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>) in order to estimate the distribution of PrimPol between the different subcellular compartments. The distribution, calculated as an average of three independent experiments, was 47% cytosolic (C), 34% mitochondrial (M), and 19% nuclear (N). WCE, whole-cell extract. Mek2 and tubulin are shown as controls for the cytosolic fraction, Hsp60 and ATP synthase are shown as controls for the mitochondrial fraction, and CTCF and H3 are shown as controls for the nuclear fraction.</p>
        <p>(B) Mitochondria isolated from HEK 293T cells were treated with hypotonic buffer or increasing concentrations of digitonin (2 or 5Â Ã10Â mg/ml) followed or not by tripsin digestion. The amount of PrimPol remaining after each treatment was determined by immunoblot. TOM20 and TIM23 were used as outer and inner membrane markers, whereas TFAM and HSP60 were used as matrix markers.</p>
        <p>(C) Mitochondria isolated from HEK 293T cells were subjected to lysis and fractionation on an iodixanol gradient (IG). DNA and protein were recovered from the different fractions and hybridized to a DNA probe specific for human mtDNA or antibodies against PrimPol and proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance, respectively.</p>
        <p>(D) Mitochondria isolated from HEK 293T cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde or left untreated and subjected to lysis and fractionation on an IG. Proteins were recovered from the different fractions and hybridized to antibodies against PrimPol, proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance (RHaseH1, TFAM, and POLG1), and controls for nonspecific crosslinking (VDAC1 and ETFB).</p>

        <p>(A) Mitochondria isolated from HEK 293T cells were treated with trypsin prior to lysis and fractionation on an IG. Primase assays were carried out from each sample with oligo dT<sub>25</sub> as template, and the resulting products were resolved in 7M urea-containing 8% polyacrylamide gels. Filled arrowheads indicate specific products detected in PrimPol fractions. The presence of mtDNA was confirmed by southern blot, whereas PrimPol and POLRMT were detected by immunoblotting.</p>
        <p>(B and C) Mitochondria isolated from PrimPolÂ +/+ (B) or PrimPol â/â (C) MEFs (see also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>) were fractionated in IG, and primase assays were carried out as in (A). Filled or empty arrowheads indicate specific products detected in PrimPol fractions or their absence, respectively. Zoom-in regions (A<sup>â</sup>, B<sup>â</sup>, and C<sup>â</sup>) contain PrimPol specific products from (A), (B), and (C), respectively.</p>

Selected mtDNA-, POLRMT- (11), and PrimPol-enriched (15) IG fractions were assayed in parallel to recombinant purified PrimPol (P) and no-protein control (NP) in the conditions described in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>E. The resulting products were resolved in 8M urea-containing 20% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography.</p>

        <p>PrimPol Tolerates 8oxoG and Abasic Sites in DNA and Functionally Cooperates with PolÎ³ and PolÎµ</p>
        <p>(A) Running start DNA polymerization by human PrimPol on a control template (left) or on a template containing an 8oxoG lesion (right). dNTPs were provided at 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 10Â Î¼M. The position of the lesion in the template strand is marked (X) in the top schematic as well as in the autoradiogram. Human PrimPol elongated the damaged template with the same efficiency as in the case of the undamaged template. See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref> for a comparison to PolÎ³.</p>
        <p>(B) Standing start DNA polymerization by human PrimPol on a control template (left) or on a template containing an 8oxoG lesion (right). The error-free insertion of either dCTP or CTP and the error-prone insertion of either dATP or ATP are compared at the indicated concentrations. The mobility of theÂ +1 extended (opposite the lesion) primers is indicated.</p>
        <p>(C) Running start DNA polymerization assay on a template containing an AP site. dNTPs were provided at 1, 10, and 100Â Î¼M. Human PrimPol bypassed a significant proportion of the templates containing the AP site (right) but generated incomplete bypass products. See also <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref> for a comparison with PolÎ³.</p>
        <p>(D) Schematics summarizing the origin and relative abundance of different bypass products shown in (C): (1) efficient copy of the normal template (+17), (2) polymerizationÂ + skipping of the AP nucleotide (+16), (3) elongation up to the lesionÂ + realignment beyond the lesion (+11), and (4) elongation and primer slippage before the lesionÂ + realignment beyond the lesion (+14).</p>
        <p>(E) Synergy between human PrimPol and human PolÎ³. Using circular M13 ssDNA as template and the indicated amounts of both enzymes (see the <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>), the RNA/DNA primers made by PrimPol were readily extended by PolÎ³. The PrimPol-PolÎ³ synergistic effect was maximal when GTP was provided in order to maximize the primase activity of PrimPol.</p>
        <p>(F) Synergy with PolÎ³ allowed the detection of PrimPol action at much lower enzyme (50Â nM) and manganese (10Â Î¼m) concentrations.</p>
        <p>(G) Synergy between human PrimPol and human PolÎµ. The DNA primers made by PrimPol on M13 ssDNA were efficiently extended by PolÎ³.</p>

        <p>Alternative Functions of PrimPol in DNA Replication</p>
        <p>(A) PrimPol can act as a âconventionalâ primase but is able to start DNA synthesis on its own.</p>
        <p>(B) PrimPol can act as a âclassicalâ TLS polymerase, reading lesions as 8oxoG.</p>
        <p>(C) PrimPol can realign the stalled primer terminus ahead of the lesion, acting as a âpseudoâ TLS polymerase.</p>
        <p>(D) PrimPol can reinitiate DNA synthesis ahead of the lesion, by means of its DNA primase activity, at the single-stranded region generated by continued helix opening after the replicative DNA polymerase got stalled at a lesion. Such a âTLS primaseâ activity would allow replication fork progression, but a lesion-containing gap would be left behind for later repair.</p>
