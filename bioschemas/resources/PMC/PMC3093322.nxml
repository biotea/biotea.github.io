        <p>We describe a new modality of interaction between coats and membrane tethers that provides insight into the question of what mechanisms define specific subcellular location of tethers.

        <p>Coats define the composition of carriers budding from organelles. In addition, coats interact with membrane tethers required for vesicular fusion. The yeast AP-3 (Adaptor Protein Complex 3) coat and the class C Vps/HOPS (HOmotypic fusion and Protein Sorting) tether follow this model as their interaction occurs at the carrier fusion step. Here we show that mammalian Vps class C/HOPS subunits and clathrin interact and that acute perturbation of clathrin function disrupts the endosomal distribution of Vps class C/HOPS tethers in HEK293T and polarized neuronal cells. Vps class C/HOPS subunits and clathrin exist in complex with either AP-3 or hepatocyte growth factor receptor substrate (Hrs). Moreover, Vps class C/HOPS proteins cofractionate with clathrin-coated vesicles, which are devoid of Hrs. Expression of FK506 binding protein (FKBP)âclathrin light chain chimeras, to inhibit clathrin membrane association dynamics, increased Vps class C/HOPS subunit content in rab5 endosomal compartments. Additionally, Vps class C/HOPS subunits were concentrated at tips of neuronal processes, and their delivery was impaired by expression of FKBPâclathrin chimeras and AP20187 incubation. These data support a model in which Vps class C/HOPS subunits incorporate into clathrin-coated endosomal domains and carriers in mammalian cells. We propose that vesicular (AP-3) and nonvesicular (Hrs) clathrin mechanisms segregate class C Vps/HOPS tethers to organelles and domains of mammalian cells bearing complex architectures.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Membranous organelles maintain their steady-state structural and functional identity despite the continuous flow of protein and lipids through them. Flow is dictated by departing carriers budding off organelles and incoming vesicles fusing with their targets. Thus fidelity in vesicle budding and fusion is central to generating and maintaining organelle identity. Coats and adaptors specify vesicleÂ­budding events by selecting cargoes loaded into vesicle carriers. In contrast, Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptors (SNAREs), rabs, and tethers determine vesicle fusion fidelity (Bonifacino and Glick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>). Vesicular and nonvesicular mechanisms regulate flow of macromolecules between endosomes in mammals. Flow between compartments along the endocytic pathway occurs by vesicle-mediated mechanisms (Stoorvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1996</xref>; Peden <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2004</xref>), and the processes of tubule-mediated transfer of cargoes (Delevoye <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>), kiss-and-run (Bright <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2005</xref>), and endosome maturation (Stoorvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1991</xref>; Rink <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2005</xref>; Poteryaev <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2010</xref>). Here we show that the coat clathrin interacts with endosomal tethers involved in endosome maturation and fusion (class C Vps/HOPS subunits) by means of vesicular (clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP-3 [Adaptor Protein Complex 3]) and nonvesicular mechanisms (clathrin and hepatocyte growth factor receptor substrate, Hrs).</p><p>Mammalian endosomes possess clathrin domains in the form of budding profiles that contain AP-1/AP-3 clathrin adaptors (Stoorvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1996</xref>; Peden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2004</xref>; Theos <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2005</xref>) or as flat lattices defined by the presence of Hrs (Raiborg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2006</xref>). Of these coats, buds containing AP-3 and clathrin mature into vesicles that transport their contents between early endosomes and late endosomal/lysosomal compartments (Di Pietro and DellâAngelica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>; DellâAngelica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2009</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> generates AP-3 vesicles at the Golgi complex destined for the lysosomal equivalent, the vacuole (Odorizzi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1998</xref>). This process is independent of clathrin in yeast (Seeger and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1992</xref>; Anand <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2009</xref>). Mutation of the human clathrin adaptor AP-3 causes Hermansky Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), in which lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes, dense-platelet granules, and lamellar bodies are defective. HPS patients exhibit pigment dilution, bleeding diathesis, and pulmonary fibrosis, and this pathology is directly attributable to defects in vesicular biogenesis (Di Pietro and DellâAngelica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>; DellâAngelica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2009</xref>). HPS phenotypes are triggered in mice when any one of 15 genes is defective. These 15 gene products assemble into protein complexes: AP-3, BLOC-1 to BLOC-3 (<underline>b</underline>iogenesis of <underline>l</underline>ysosome-related <underline>o</underline>rganelles <underline>c</underline>omplex), and tethering complexes constituted by class C Vps subunits (Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>). Vps33a mutant mice possess a phenotype similar to other HPS mutants, which might be explained by interactions of Vps33a with other HPS complexes (Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2003</xref>). Whether these genetic similarities underlie associations of Vps33a with HPS complexes, such as AP-3, into common complexes is presently unknown. This hypothesis is supported, however, by genetic and biochemical interactions between yeast class C Vps proteins and AP-3 (Anand <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2009</xref>; Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>; Salazar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian class C Vps protein Vps33a/b assembles into a core complex of class C Vps proteins including Vps11, Vps16, and Vps18. This core associates with Vps39 and Vps41 to form the HOmotypic fusion and Protein Sorting (HOPS) complex (Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Nickerson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2009</xref>; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2009</xref>). The class C Vps core complex could also associate with Vps8/KIAA0804 and Vps3/TGFBRAP1 to constitute a hypothetical mammalian CORVET complex, a molecular species so far only documented in yeast (Peplowska <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2007</xref>; Markgraf <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>). Class C core subunits and accessory HOPS subunits are critical for fusion events at the vacuole, a lysosome equivalent in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In this organism, HOPS orchestrates interactions with the GTPase ypt7, a rab7 ortholog, SNARES, and, recently, AP-3 to achieve selective membrane fusion (Ostrowicz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2008</xref>; Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>; Nickerson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2009</xref>; Wickner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). Association of AP-3 and HOPS occurs at the vesicle fusion step with the vacuole when incoming Golgi-derived AP-3âcoated vesicles reach the vacuole, the compartment where HOPS complexes reside in yeast (Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that mammalian Vps class C/HOPS subunits coimmunoprecipitated and/or colocalized with the endosomal coats clathrin, AP-3, and Hrs. Isolated clathrin-coated vesicles had Vps class C/HOPS subunits on them, yet they were depleted of Hrs. We also found that acute perturbation of clathrin dynamics on and off membranes using FKBPâclathrin light chain (CLC) chimeras (Moskowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2003</xref>; Deborde <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>) altered the distribution of class C Vps/HOPS proteins in two different types of mammalian cells. HEK293T cells with reduced clathrin function had elevated levels of Vps class C proteins in rab5-positive endosomes, suggesting that clathrin dynamics at vesicular AP-3â or nonvesicular Hrs-positive endosomal domains regulate Vps class C protein content on early endosomes. We hypothesized that coats in endosomal tether-coat complexes could contribute to polarized distribution of tethers, such as the HOPS complex. In support of this idea, differentiated neuroendocrine cells accumulated Vps class C/HOPS subunits at the growing tip of processes, where they were concentrated with clathrin. Targeting of Vps class C/HOPS subunits from cell bodies to neurites was sensitive to clathrin function perturbation. Our data suggest that vertebrate cells differ from yeast in that the vertebrates engage in novel interactions between class C Vpsâcontaining tethers and coats, perhaps for specialized demands such as polarized targeting in neuroendocrine and epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Subunits of the Vps class C/HOPS tethering complexes associate with clathrinâAP-3 adaptor subunits</title><p>We initially explored molecular interactions between tethering complexes and coats taking advantage of protein complexes affected in HPS. Mouse mutations on genes encoding the class C-Vps protein Vps33a or AP-3 subunits trigger a phenotype that recapitulates HPS (Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2003</xref>; Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>), suggesting that AP-3 and complexes containing Vps33a act on a common pathway. Consistent with this interpretation, subunits of the tethering HOPS complex interact with AP-3 in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>) and mammalian cells (Salazar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>). Despite this similarity, in mammalian cells, but not yeast, AP-3 shows interactions with clathrin (Seeger and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1992</xref>; DellâAngelica <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1998</xref>; Anand <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2009</xref>). This observation suggests that Vps class C/HOPS tethers interact with coats differently in vertebrates as compared with yeast.</p><p>We tested whether all four class C Vps proteins, class C Vps33a-b isoforms, and the two HOPS-specific subunits associated with AP-3 and clathrin complexes isolated from HEK293T cells. As described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>, we used in vivo cross-linking with dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DSP) coupled to immunoaffinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the AP-3 Î´ subunit or clathrin chains. DSP treatment decreases immunoreactivity of AP-3 Î´ subunit detected with a mAb against Î´ adaptin (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). Vps class C and HOPS subunits present in AP-3 or clathrin immune complexes were detected with antibodies either against endogenously expressed Vps33b or tags engineered in recombinantly expressed subunits (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18, Vps33a, Vps33b, Vps39, and Vps41). We expressed tagged recombinant proteins because available class C Vps or HOPS subunit antibodies failed to detect endogenous proteins in multiple cell types, including HEK293T cells (our unpublished data).</p><p>We first determined whether phenotypic similarities between mice carrying mutations in either the class C Vps protein Vps33a or AP-3 subunits were predictors of a biochemical interaction between Vps33a and AP-3. Recombinantly expressed Vps33a selectively coprecipitated with AP-3 immunocomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 5). This association was not restricted to Vps33a; similar results were obtained with tagged Vps33b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 6). The association of Vps33 isoforms with AP-3 could be due either to isolated Vps33 polypeptides interacting with AP-3 or Vps33 assembled into a Vps class C protein complex, such as HOPS. To discern between these hypotheses, we explored whether protein constituents of the HOPS complex were coisolated with AP-3 complexes together with endogenous Vps33b. Recombinantly expressed class C Vps proteins (Vps11, Vps16, and Vps18) or HOPS-specific subunits (Vps41 and Vps39) copurified with AP-3 and the endogenously expressed class C Vps protein, Vps33b. These associations were preferentially detected in the presence of DSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 5 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 8 and 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, lanes 14, 16, and 18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, E and F</xref>, lanes 10 and 12). The association specificity of AP-3 and these Vps subunits was probed using magnetic beads conjugated with antiâmouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G (beads alone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Vps18-Myc and Vps33b coisolated with AP-3 when these beads contained mouse AP-3 Î´ antibodies, yet none of these proteins were detected with beads alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 6 with 7â10). Second, we out-competed AP-3 Î´ binding to magnetic beads linked to mouse Î´-antibodies with the Î´ peptide antigen (Salazar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>). We monitored peptide competition by assessing the presence of AP-3 subunits (Î²3A or Î´) and clathrin heavy chain (CHC; an AP-3 binding partner) in immunoisolated cross-linked AP-3 complexes (DellâAngelica <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1998</xref>; Salazar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>). Pretreating beads displaying Î´-antibodies with the Î´-peptide abolished binding of AP-3 subunits, clathrin, and all Vps subunits to these beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, C, E, and F</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 8 with 10 and 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, compare lanes 8, 10, and 12 with lanes 14, 16, and 18). Abolished binding indicates that class C Vps and HOPS subunits interact with the beads by binding to intact AP-3 and not via some nonspecific mechanism. As a control, we showed that AP-1 complexes were not cross-linked to Vps33b, Vps16-HA (hemagglutinin), or Vps41-Myc, showing that the association of class C Vps and HOPS subunits with AP-3 was selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). AP-3-Vps subunit associations could result simply from abundantly expressed tagged proteins in endosomal compartments. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether the Vps33b-interacting protein Spe39 coisolates with AP-3 and clathrin complexes. We selected Spe39 because we previously demonstrated that Spe39 defines a subclass of Vps class C/HOPS complexes (Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2009</xref>). In fact, Spe39 is present in a discrete pool of the total Vps33b and other class C protein as determined by quantitative immunomicroscopy (Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2009</xref>). Importantly, endogenous Spe39 does not colocalize with AP-3 or CLCs (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B). Consistent with our immunomicroscopy, neither endogenous nor recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Spe39 coprecipitated with AP-3 immunocomplexes (Supplemental Figure 1, C and D). These results argue against nonselective DSP cross-linking of recombinantly expressed proteins to AP-3.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Association of class C Vps/HOPS subunits with the adaptor complex AP-3.

Consequently, we next looked for association of clathrin with Vps class C/HOPS in AP-3 cross-linked complexes. Cross-linked samples were treated with antibodies against CLC. Both Vps33 isoforms selectively coisolated with clathrin complexes isolated with CLC antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 3). We found that CLC consistently coimmunoprecipitated with CHC, the AP-3 Î´ subunit, endogenous Vps33b, and Vps41-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 7). Neither coats nor Vps proteins were detected with beads alone or beads coated with nonimmune IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lane 7).

We further assessed whether clathrin, AP-3, and Vps41-Myc form a complex together by performing sequential immunopurification of clathrin-containing AP-3 complexes from HEK293T cells stably expressing Vps41-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). First, cross-linked AP-3 complexes were immunoaffinity purified with AP-3 Î´ antibodies in either the absence or presence of Î´ antigenic peptide as a control of binding selectivity to beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). Cross-linked AP-3 complexes bound to beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 6) were then eluted in native conditions from magnetic beads using the Î´ antigenic peptide. These eluted AP-3-cross-linked complexes were subjected to a second round of immunomagnetic isolation with either nonimmune mouse IgG (control) or a monoclonal anti-CLC. The composition of complexes bound to CLC antibody-coated beads was assessed by immunoblot. CLC antibodies allowed coimmunoprecipitation of the AP-3 Î´ subunit and Vps41-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 8), indicating that at least a subset of AP-3, clathrin, and the HOPS subunit Vps41 exist in a multiprotein complex.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>CHC and CLC associate with class C Vps/HOPS subunits.

After 6 d, cells were incubated in the presence of DSP (lanes 1â6) and homogenized. Detergent cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with magnetic beads decorated with control mouse IgG (monoclonal SY38, lanes 3 and 4), or antibodies against CLCs (lanes 5 and 6).

After 6 d, cells were incubated in the absence (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) or presence of DSP (lane 1 and even lanes). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with magnetic beads decorated with AP-3 Î´ antibodies (lanes 3â10) either in the absence (lanes 7â10) or presence of an excess of Î´ antigenic peptide as a control (lanes 3â6).

These interactions suggest that AP-3 could bridge between the HOPS complex and clathrin in mammalian cells. We examined this possibility by performing shRNA down-regulation of either AP-3 Î´ or CHC, cross-linking in vivo with DSP, and immunoprecipitating cell extracts with CLC or AP-3 Î´ antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, D and E</xref>). As compared with control cells, AP-3 Î´ subunit shRNA treatment caused a â¼50% drop in the level of AP-3 Î´ polypeptide (49 Â± 4.6%), whereas CHC shRNA eliminated nearly all CHC (95.5 Â± 0.9% reduction, n = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, D and E</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). Immunoaffinity purification with CLC antibodies from mock shRNA treated control cells recovered clathrin complexes that were cross-linked to AP-3 subunits, Vps33b, and Vps41-Myc (and Vps39; unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 5). Although CLC antibodies failed to isolate AP-3 subunits from AP-3 Î´ shRNA-treated cells, there were no discernible effects on the levels of Vps33b or Vps41-Myc present in CLC-isolated cross-linked complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">FigureÂ 2D</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest that other tetrameric adaptors, such as AP-1, could mediate the association between Vps class C and HOPS subunits with clathrin. We did not detect, however, an association of Vps class C or HOPS subunits to cross-linked AP-1 complexes isolated from HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, cross-linked AP-3 complexes isolated from CHC-depleted cells, although devoid of clathrin, contained both endogenous Vps33b and recombinantly expressed Vps41-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 10) or Vps39-GFP (unpublished data). In fact, cross-linked AP-3 complexes isolated from CHC shRNAâtreated cells copurified with increased levels of Vps41-Myc and Vps33b. This effect may be attributable to an increased expression of Vps41-myc but not Vps33b in CHC-shRNAâtreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2; Vps41-Myc 255 Â± 18.5% of control shRNA, n = 2; Vps33b 138.5 Â± 42%, n = 4). These data indicate that, despite the fact that clathrinâAP-3âHOPS subunits form a complex, clathrin is not required for the binding of Vps class C and HOPS subunits to AP-3 complexes, nor is AP-3 necessary for their binding to clathrin complexes. In addition to AP-3, other clathrin-interacting molecules present in endosomes may interact with Vps class C/HOPS subunits. One such mechanism is the Hrs-clathrin flat coat present in endosomes (Raiborg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2006</xref>). Endogenous Hrs or recombinantly expressed Hrs-Myc coprecipitated endogenous CHC and Vps33b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, lanes 5â6 and 5â²-6â²). These interactions were selective as judged by the absence of Vps33b and CHC in GFP control immunoprecipitations as well as by the absence of transferrin receptor in all immunocomplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, lanes 3â4 and 3â²-4â²). Collectively, our results indicate that Vps class C/HOPS subunits copurify with at least two pools of clathrin present in early endosomes: clathrinâAP-3 and clathrinâHrs complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Vps class C and HOPS subunits are present in clathrin-coated organelles</title><p>Vps class C and HOPS subunits association with clathrinâAP-3 and clathrinâHrs predicts that these Vps proteins should be present in domains of early endosomes as well as clathrin-coated vesicle carriers. The presence of Vps class C and HOPS subunits in early endosomes and clathrin-coated carriers would be consistent with the observation that AP-3, AP-3âclathrin budding profiles, clathrinâHrs flat coats, Vps class C, and HOPS subunits are found in early endosomal compartments (Raiborg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2006</xref>; Peden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2004</xref>; Richardson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>; Theos <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2005</xref>). We determined the subcellular distribution of Vps class C and HOPS subunits by immunofluorescence using quantitative Delta deconvolution microscopy. We used antibodies against coats (clathrin, AP-1 Î³, and AP-3 Î´) and either the early endosome marker, rab5, or the late endosomal markers rab7, rab7b, and LAMP-1. Our rationale for including the late endosomal marker rab7b is that its depletion selectively increases the protein levels of AP-3 (Progida <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2010</xref>). We focused on endogenously expressed Vps33b and used Vps16-HA to further validate Vps33b results. In addition, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the HOPS subunits Vps39âGFP and Vps41âMyc in clathrin-positive compartments and endosomes. Endogenous Vps33b partially overlapped with puncta positive for AP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, B and C</xref>) and/or clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, E and F</xref>). Although partial, of these two coats, fluorescent signal overlap was more pronounced between Vps33b and clathrin than Vps33b with AP-3. One third of all Vps33b-positive pixels were positive for CHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, E, F, and J</xref>). Similar to Vps33b, Vps16-HA was preferentially found in puncta positive for CHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, G and J</xref>) or AP-3 Î´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>), where coats signals partially overlapped with class C Vps subunits.

Nonetheless, the two HOPS-specific Vps subunits, Vps41âMyc and Vps39âGFP, were localized to rab5- and CHC-positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p>The partial overlap between coats, Vps class C, and HOPS proteins suggests that domains of endosomes, rather than the whole organelle, contain these factors.

Of these Vps proteins, Vps41âMyc and Vps16âHA were clearly enriched in clathrin-coated vesicle fractions. We isolated clathrin-coated vesicles from control or CHC RNAiâtreated cells to define whether Vps class C and HOPS subunits cosedimenting with clathrin-coated vesicles correspond to true components of these carriers or just contaminants present on these membranes (Borner <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>). Coomassie Blue staining revealed that clathrin-coated vesicle fractions isolated from CHC down-regulated cells decreased the content of several polypeptides, including CHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, asterisks). Down-regulation of CHC precluded formation of clathrin-coated vesicles as determined by the absence or decreased levels of adaptor subunits from clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2, compare lanes 6 and 6â²; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, the levels of Vps33b, Vps16âHA, or Vps41âMyc were significantly reduced from clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from CHC RNAiâtreated cells indicating that Vps33b, Vps16âHA, and Vps41âMyc specifically reside in clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; Supplemental Figure 2, compare lanes 6 and 6â²; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

CHC down-regulation, which is achieved within several days of shRNA treatment, did not alter the distribution of Vps class C/HOPS subunits in rab5 or rab7b compartments, suggesting compensatory mechanisms controlling Vps class C/HOPS subunit subcellular distribution (unpublished data). To overcome possible compensatory mechanisms, we acutely perturbed clathrin function by using a chemical/genetic approach that uses chimeric CLCs carrying an oligomerization module, a modified FKBP 12 domain (Moskowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2003</xref>; Deborde <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). FKBP domains selectively oligomerize upon addition of the cell-permeant bivalent chemical AP20187. CLC oligomerization that follows incubation with AP20187 halts vesicle formation from donor organelles, such as plasma membrane or <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network by âfreezingâ clathrin onto membranes and aborted budding profiles (Moskowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2003</xref>; Deborde <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). Thus we used FKBPâCLC chimeras to trap clathrin at membranes. Tagged FKBPâCLC chimeras incorporated into 60.7 Â± 18.5% (n = 30) of all CHC-positive organelles in HEK293T cells as determined by deconvolution microscopy (Supplemental Figure 3A). Like endogenous CLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), chimeric mCherry-FKBPâCLC specifically coprecipitated class C Vps/HOPS subunits (Supplemental Figure 3D). Cell treatment with AP20187 for 2 h induced enlargement of CHC/tagged-FKBPâCLC dual-labeled organelles and the accumulation of endogenous and recombinant clathrin chains at the perinuclear region (Supplemental Figure 3, B and C). The perinuclear accumulation of CHC in HEK293T cells indicates that clathrinÂ­-Â­dependent processes are rapidly inhibited by FKBPâCLC chimeras (Moskowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2003</xref>; Deborde <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>).</p><p>We next determined the effect of chemically perturbing clathrin function in HEK293T- and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells on Vps class C/HOPS subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and Supplemental Movies 3â6).

The shared phenotypes suggests that associations between Vps33a and other HPS protein complexes participate in the same pathway, delivering membrane proteins from early endosomes to late endosomes/lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2003</xref>; Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>). Defects in this route trigger HPS in humans (Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>; Di Pietro and DellâAngelica, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>). Similarly, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologues of Vps class C proteins and AP-3 subunits participate in the delivery of cargoes to the vacuole. Genetic and/or biochemical interactions between AP-3 and HOPS subunits in yeast and vertebrates provide mechanistic insight into the molecular organization of this genetic pathway (Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010</xref>; Nickerson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2009</xref>; Salazar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2009</xref>). Our results are the first evidence of vertebrate Vps class C/HOPS proteins interacting with the early endosomal coats clathrin and AP-3 and the clathrin-binding scaffold Hrs. Moreover, we provide biochemical evidence of an interaction between Vps33a and AP-3 predicted from the phenotypic similarities between Vps33a- and AP-3-deficient mice. Clathrin and AP-3 highlight fundamental differences in the way that yeast and mammalian Vps class C and coats interact. In contrast with yeast AP-3, the mammalian ortholog of this adaptor complex interacts with clathrin (Seeger and Payne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1992</xref>; DellâAngelica <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1998</xref>; Anand <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2009</xref>). These observations suggest differences in the biochemical and functional architecture of mechanisms controlled by vertebrate Vps class C/HOPSâcontaining tethers and coats. Mammalian class C Vps proteins (Vps11, 16, 18, and 33a-b) and the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Vps41 establish specific interactions with clathrin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We identified Vps class C/HOPS proteins in isolated clathrin-coated carriers, clathrin-positive domains of rab5-positive early endosomes, and rab7b-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The association of clathrin with Vps class C/HOPS proteins has at least two modalities: one occurring with the AP-3 complex and another in which Hrs participates. ClathrinâAP-3âVps class C/HOPS and clathrinâHrsâVps class C/HOPS associations suggest vesicular and nonvesicular mechanisms controlling Vps class C/HOPS subunit subcellular distribution along the endocytic pathway, respectively.</p><p>We focused on the association between Vps class C/HOPS subunits and clathrin chains because quantitative fluorescence microscopy indicated a greater degree of overlap between Vps33b/Vps16 and CHC than with AP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). The functionality of Vps class C/HOPS proteinâclathrin interactions was demonstrated by acute perturbation of clathrin function (Moskowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2003</xref>; Deborde <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>). Chimeric CLC carrying the oligomerization module FKBP and AP20187 treatment rapidly redistributed CHC, class C Vps proteins (Vps18, Vps33b), and HOPS subunits (Vps39, Vps41) to organelles distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that, upon clathrin function perturbation, Vps33b content preferentially increased in rab5-positive over either rab7b-containing endosomes or AP-1âpositive organelles, such as the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and Supplemental Figures 4 and 5). These findings support a model whereby clathrin-dependent mechanisms acutely define the subcellular distribution of Vps class C/HOPS-containing tethers. We directly tested this model in human cortical neurons and in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, two polarized cellular models. We observed enrichment of class C Vps/HOPS subunits and clathrin at the tip of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). Moreover, acute perturbation of clathrin function led to a progressive depletion of Vps18âGFP and mCherry-FKBPâCLC from the proximal segment of neurites imaged in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9, B and C</xref>). We interpret this decrease in neurite Vps18âGFP and mCherry-FKBPâCLC fluorescence as the result of two concomitant processes: (1) inhibition of newly formed Vps18-clathrinâpositive organelles entering the proximal neurite from the cell body plus (2) Vps18-clathrinâpositive organelles already present in the neurite proximal segment at the time of drug addition progressively moving downstream toward the neurite tip.</p><p>Clathrin, AP-3, and Vps41 form a tripartite complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The association of Vps class C/HOPS subunits with clathrin, however, is independent of AP-3 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Conversely, association of AP-3 and class C Vps/HOPS proteins is independent of clathrin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). These independent associations suggest that Vps class C/HOPS subunits establish multipronged interactions with clathrin and adaptors, such as AP-3 and/or that other clathrin-interacting molecules in early endosomes may mediate clathrinâVps class C/HOPS subunit associations. We identified the early endosomal clathrinâHrs flat coat participating in clathrinâVps class C subunit interactions. Endogenous Hrs as well as recombinant Hrs coprecipitated endogenous clathrin and vps33b. Hrs and AP-3 mechanisms are likely independent because AP-3 is present in clathrin-coated vesicles yet Hrs is excluded from these coated carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore we propose that vesicular and nonvesicular clathrinâVps class C/HOPS protein complexes regulate the subcellular distribution of class C Vps/HOPS subunits along the endocytic route. Structural predictions point to the presence of CHC homology domains in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Vps 11, 18, 39, and 41, raising the possibility of multipronged associations between components of the coat and Vps class C/HOPS subunits (Darsow <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2001</xref>; Nickerson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2009</xref>). Irrespective of whether multiple clathrin-binding molecules, such as AP-3 and Hrs, vesicular or nonvesicular mechanisms, or multipronged interactions between coats and Vps tethers exists, however, the redistribution of Vps class C/HOPS subunits upon of acute perturbation of clathrin function indicates that significant pools of Vps class C/HOPS tethers are under control of clathrin-dependent mechanisms.</p><p>Angers and Merz have put forward an attractive model in which interactions between a tether, HOPS, and the coat AP-3 mediate docking of vesicles with the vacuole in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, a process that culminates with fusion of membranes. Donor compartment (Golgi) and incoming AP-3âcoated vesicles are devoid of HOPS complex in this model. HOPS complexes reside in the acceptor vacuolar compartments where coat and tether encounters occur to facilitate vesicle consumption (Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010</xref>). Our data suggest that, in addition to this mechanism, mammalian Vps class C/HOPS tethers are included in clathrin- and clathrin-AP-3âcoated carriers, suggesting a coat-dependent mechanism for delivering Vps class C/HOPS tethers. Perturbing clathrin function with FKBP-CLC/AP20187 caused an increase in the number and size of organelles positive for Vps class C/HOPS subunits and trapped Vps33b in rab5-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>; Supplemental Figure 4). We attribute these effects to inhibition of clathrin-coated vesicle budding, consistent with published data (Moskowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2003</xref>; Deborde <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>) and possibly to changes in the dynamic of flat clathrinâHrs coats in early endosomes. Alternatively, FKBP-CLC/AP20187 could possibly cause promiscuous recruitment of cytoplasmic Vps class C/HOPS protein pools to membranes by oligomerized FKBPâCLC. We do not favor this alternative hypothesis, however, because we do not detect an increased association of Vps33b to rab7b- or AP-1âpositive organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>; Supplemental Figures 4 and 5).</p><p>AP-3 budding occurs mainly, if not exclusively, from transferrin receptorâpositive endosomes (Peden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2004</xref>; Theos <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2005</xref>; Craige <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2008</xref>). Quantitative electron microscopy indicates that half of these AP-3 budding profiles possess clathrin on them (Peden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2004</xref>; Theos <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2005</xref>). Perhaps, the presence of clathrin allows coats and Vps class C/HOPS subunits to be recruited at early stages in the vesicle life cycle. In the absence of clathrin, tethers and coats could undergo late interactions at target organelles, as proposed previously for yeast (Angers and Merz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2010</xref>). Early inclusion of Vps class C/HOPS tethers into clathrin-coated carriers could serve a role for long-range delivery of tethers to polarized domains in mammalian cells. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that endogenous Vps33b and recombinantly expressed Vps18 and Vps39 display polarized distribution in the tip of neurites in human cortical neurons or differentiated PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). An alternative yet nonexclusive model is that Vps class C/HOPS subunits could play a role in cargo selection either through indirect effects of Vps proteins on cargo recognition by coats or by direct association of class C Vps/HOPS proteins with SNAREs and nonSNARE membrane proteins. Support for this interpretation was obtained recently when <italic>ema</italic>/CLEC16A, which is a lectin-type membrane protein, was shown to directly bind to Vps16A in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>).</p><p>At least four modalities of content delivery between stages of the endocytic route have been documented: vesicle-mediated (Stoorvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1996</xref>; Peden <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2004</xref>), tubule-mediated transfer of cargoes (Delevoye <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2009</xref>), kiss-and-run (Bright <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2005</xref>), and endosome maturation (Stoorvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1991</xref>; Rink <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2005</xref>; Poteryaev <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2010</xref>). Endosome maturation is kinetically defined by the conversion over time of the same endosome membrane from a rab5- to a rab7-decorated compartment (Stoorvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">1991</xref>; Rink <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2005</xref>; Poteryaev <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2010</xref>). This process depends on a switch mechanism in which a later acquisition of HOPS subunits promotes rab7 activation by interactors of the Vps39 subunit of HOPS (Nordmann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2010</xref>,; Poteryaev <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2010</xref>). Presently, it is unknown whether rab5 compartments can mature into rab7b compartments. We focused on rab7b because class C Vps/HOPS proteins were found in very low (background) levels in rab7- or LAMP-1âcontaining late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>), suggesting that Vps class C/HOPS subunit binding may be short-lived on them. In contrast, class C Vps/HOPS associates to rab7b compartments. Rab7b has been implicated in delivery of Toll-like receptors from the cell surface to lysosomes in macrophages as well as in retrograde transport between endosomes and Golgi complex in HeLa cells (Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2007</xref>; Progida <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2010</xref>). The presence of clathrin in rab7b-positive compartments and the observation that down-regulation of rab7b increases the expression level of AP-3 (Progida <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2010</xref>) suggest a role of rab7b in vesicle-mediated transport between early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes or in a specialized retrograde transport between endosomes and the Golgi complex. Irrespective of whether rab7b-clathrin compartments represent vesicles, endosomes, or a combination thereof, our findings suggest that maturation of clathrin-coated membranes in transit among endosomal compartments could occur.</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> class C Vps proteins (Vps11, 16, 18, and 33) form a core that incorporates into CORVET and HOPS complexes (Peplowska <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2007</xref>; Nickerson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2009</xref>; Ostrowicz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2010</xref>; Wickner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2010</xref>). Vps8 and Vps3 constitute the CORVET complex whereas Vps39 and Vps41 establish specific interactions with the core defining the HOPS complex (Peplowska <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2007</xref>; Markgraf <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2009</xref>; Ostrowicz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2010</xref>). The organization and subcellular localization of HOPS has been partially characterized in metazoans (Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Richardson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2009</xref>; Cullinane <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>). In contrast, metazoan CORVET has not been studied. Although putative human orthologues of CORVET subunits, Vps8/KIAA0804 and Vps3/TGFBRAP1, are present in databases, it remains unknown whether these gene products assemble with class C Vps proteins to form a mammalian CORVET complex. It is formally possible that mammalian class C Vps proteins, such as Vps33b and Vps16, identified in clathrin-containing organelles by biochemical and immunolocalization studies, may be part of both CORVET and HOPS complexes. The presence of class C vps subunits in both complexes might explain why there was a relatively higher colocalization between Vps33b/Vps16 (found in both CORVET and HOPS) and clathrin as compared with Vps41, Vps39, and clathrin (found only in HOPS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). If this were the case, our data suggest that perturbing clathrin function affects Vps class C proteins along rab5 and rab7b compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) by stalling maturation from a CORVET to a HOPS-positive-clathrinâcoated vesicle or endosome.</p><p>Our results demonstrate a unique functional architecture of mechanisms controlled by vertebrate Vps class C/HOPSâcontaining tethers and clathrin coats. We postulate that clathrin-dependent mechanisms provide long-range and directional delivery of class C Vps/HOPS tethers to organelles and/or specialized domains of mammalian cells bearing complex architectures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used in this study: polyclonal anti-myc (A190105A) and anti-HA (A190108A; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX); polyclonal anti-GFP (cat# GFP-1020, Aves Labs, Tigard, OR, and cat# 132002, Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany); monoclonal antiâLamp H4A3, anti-SV2, and anti-AP3Î´ SA4 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA); monoclonal antiârab7 ab50533 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA); monoclonal antiârab7b clone 3B3 (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan); monoclonal anti-rab5, antiâAP1Î³ adaptin, antiârabaptin 5, and anti-EEA1 (610724, A36120, 610676, and 610456; BD Bioscience Transduction Laboratories, Pasadena, CA); monoclonal antiâCHC X22 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA); monoclonal antiâCLC CON.1 (MMS423P; Covance, Berkeley, CA); polyclonal antiâmCherry dsRed (632496; Clontech, Mountain View, CA); monoclonal anti-AP2Î± adaptin and anti-actin (A4325 and A5441; Sigma, St. Louis, MO); polyclonal anti-AP3Î²1 (13384â1-AP; ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL); monoclonal antiâGFP 3E6 (A11120; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); monoclonal antiâHRS A-5 (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA); antiâsynaptophysin clone SY38 (Millipore, Billerica, MA); and monoclonal antiâtransferrin receptor H68.4 (136800; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA).

DSP is a homobifunctional reversible and cell-permeable cross-linker with a 12-Ã spacer arm that stabilizes labile protein interactions (Lomant and Fairbanks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1976</xref>). Plates of confluent HEK293T cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and then incubated with 1 mM DSP (cat# 22585; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) or dimethyl sulfoxide control in PBS/1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 2 h on ice. DSP was then quenched with 25 mM TRIS, pH 7.4, followed by two rinses with ice-cold PBS/1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Cells were lysed in Buffer A (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) + 0.5% Triton X-100 by incubation for 30 min at 4ÂºC.

Beads and lysate were incubated at 4ÂºC for 2 h and washed six times with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove nonspecifically bound material. The material that remained bound after these washes was then eluted by treatment with either the peptide antigen or SDSâPAGE sample buffer followed by incubation at 75ÂºC for 5 min.

Decreased detection of AP-3 Î´ by the SA4 mAb in immunoblots after DSP cross-linking likely reflects a chemical modification of the SA4 epitope by the cross-linking agent. The lysine and arginine present in this peptide are susceptible to modification by DSP. The SA4 antibody is used sequentially in immunoprecipitation and immunoblot, thus effectively magnifying the difference between (â) and (+) DSP samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunolocalization, microscopy, and quantification</title><p>Coverslips were prepared as previously described (Faundez <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1997</xref>).
