          <title>Background</title>
          <p>As a genetic disorder of abnormal pigmentation, the molecular basis of dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) had remained unclear until recently when ABCB6 was reported as a causative gene of DUH.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology</title>
          <p>We performed genome-wide linkage scan using Illumina Human 660W-Quad BeadChip and exome sequencing analyses using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kits in a multiplex Chinese DUH family to identify the pathogenic mutations and verified the candidate mutations using Sanger sequencing. Quantitative RT-PCR and Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the expression of the pathogenic gene, Zebrafish was also used to confirm the functional role of ABCB6 in melanocytes and pigmentation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Genome-wide linkage (assuming autosomal dominant inheritance mode) and exome sequencing analyses identified <italic>ABCB6</italic> as the disease candidate gene by discovering a coding mutation (c.1358C&gt;T; p.Ala453Val) that co-segregates with the disease phenotype. Further mutation analysis of <italic>ABCB6</italic> in four other DUH families and two sporadic cases by Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation (c.1358C&gt;T; p.Ala453Val) and discovered a second, co-segregating coding mutation (c.964A&gt;C; p.Ser322Lys) in one of the four families. Both mutations were heterozygous in DUH patients and not present in the 1000 Genome Project and dbSNP database as well as 1,516 unrelated Chinese healthy controls. Expression analysis in human skin and mutagenesis interrogation in zebrafish confirmed the functional role of <italic>ABCB6</italic> in melanocytes and pigmentation. Given the involvement of <italic>ABCB6</italic> mutations in coloboma, we performed ophthalmological examination of the DUH carriers of <italic>ABCB6</italic> mutations and found ocular abnormalities in them.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our study has advanced our understanding of DUH pathogenesis and revealed the shared pathological mechanism between pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a rare Mendelian disease, characterized by asymptomatic hyper- and hypo-pigmented macules in variable distributions and patterns, which was initially described by Ichikawa and Hiraga in 1933 <xref rid="pone.0087250-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Most DUH patients do not show other symptoms associated with the typical skin abnormalities, although high tone deafness, ocular abnormalities, photosensitivity, neurosensory hearing defects, learning difficulties, mental retardation, epilepsy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, erythrocyte, platelet and tryptophan metabolism abnormalities, and small stature had been found occasionally <xref rid="pone.0087250-AlHawsawi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As an autosomal dominant (OMIM 127500) or recessive disorder (OMIM 612715), the genetic loci of DUH have been mapped to chromosome 6q24.2-q25.2 <xref rid="pone.0087250-Xing1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and 12q21-q23 <xref rid="pone.0087250-Stuhrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> by the linkage analysis, but the molecular basis of DUH had remained unknown until recently when Zhangâs group reported ABCB6 as a causative gene of DUH <xref rid="pone.0087250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We performed linkage and exome sequencing analyses in a Chinese DUH pedigree and identified ABCB6 as the pathogenic gene of DUH almost at the same time as Zhangâs group. The expression of ABCB6 were demonstrated in human skin tissue and melanocytes and the knockdown of ABCB6 expression was shown to cause the reduction of the number of mature melanocytes in zebrafish, which provided solid and convincing evidences for ABCB6 to be a disease gene for DUH.</p>

        <title>ABCB6 Expression Analysis</title>
        <p>To confirm the functional role of <italic>ABCB6</italic> in pigmentation, we first investigated the expression of <italic>ABCB6</italic> in the skin tissues of four DUH carries of <italic>ABCB6</italic> mutations (III4,II4,IV4 from family 1 and IV3 from family 2) and four unrelated health controls using quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of <italic>ABCB6</italic> mRNA was detected in both DUH affected individuals and healthy controls, but no significant difference was found between the affected and unaffected individuals (Pâ=â0.44) <bold>(Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087250.s001">Text S1</xref>)</bold>. We then performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in human primary melanocyte cell line (HEM cell) and the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue of one affected individual (III4 from family 1) and one healthy control. The expression of ABCB6 protein was clearly detected in the HEM cell (<bold>Figure S4A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087250.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>). In human skin, ABCB6 could be detected in melanocytes, but not keratinocytes of the basal layer in both the affected and healthy control individuals (<bold>Figure S4C and E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087250.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>). Similarly, no significant expression difference was found between the patient and healthy control. The lack of the expression difference of ABCB6 in skin tissue between the patients and healthy controls is not surprising, because both the mutations identified here are missense mutations within the trans-membrane domain of ABCB6 that more likely influence the subcellular location of ABCB6 instead of its expression level, and thus cause a dominant negative effect on the development of disease phenotype.</p>

By counting the number of pigmented melanocytes present within the head region at 5 dpf, we observed a significant higher number of mature melanocytes in the uninjected control embryos (48.84Â±0.68, nâ=â57) than the injected embryos with the exon 6-morphants (23.38Â±3.20, nâ=â13, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087250-g004">

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A recent publication showed that two missense mutations of <italic>ABCB6</italic> (c.2431C&gt;G; p.Leu811Val and c.169G&gt;A; p.Ala57Thr) caused ocular coloboma <xref rid="pone.0087250-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. And also the co-exist of pigmentation and ocular abnormalities were reported to be observed in some cases <xref rid="pone.0087250-AlHawsawi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This prompted us to carry out careful ophthalmological examination of the DUH patient carriers of <italic>ABCB6</italic> mutations. Although no microphthalmia and anophthalmia were observed in the affected individuals, the detailed clinical examination, visual-acuity testing and ocular imaging revealed that II5 and III4 of the Family 1 had abnormal pitting lack of iris, and IV4 of the Family 1 had high intra-ocular pressure (L:24 mmHg; R:19 mmHg) (<bold>Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087250.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>). However, no abnormal eye manifestations were found in the IV1 of the Family 2.</p>
      <p>Although both Wang et alâs study <xref rid="pone.0087250-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and ours used zebrafish as a model to investigate the functions of ABCB6, experimental design is different between two studies. The morpholino in Wang et al targeted the ATG start codon and exon2-intron2 boundary, with the former aiming to block the translation of the whole protein, whereas our morpholinos targeted at exon 6 or exon 8 aiming to the deletion of specific domains of the protein. Analyzing the early stages of development at 36 hpf, Wang et al reported significant delay in development and coloboma-related eye defects in their morphants. Our experiments focused on late stage of development 5 dpf when mature melanocytes are fully differentiated in the zebrafish and found less pigmentation in the morphants. Although further studies are needed to confirm, these results may suggest differential functions of ABCB6 at different stages of development.</p>
      <p>It is very intriguing that the different mutations of <italic>ABCB6</italic> can cause diverse disease phenotypes, pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma. The two DUH mutations lie in the ABC transmembrane domain, whereas one coloboma mutation (c.2431C&gt;G; p.Leu811Val) located in the transporter-like domain, and the other one (c.169G&gt;A; p.Ala57Thr) did not lie in any established domain <bold>(</bold>

<bold> C)</bold>. This may suggest that ABCB6 protein has diverse biological functions, and mutations affecting its different domains may thus cause diverse disease phenotypes.</p>
      <p>
<italic>ABCB6</italic>, located at 2q36, contains 19 exons and is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. <italic>ABCB6</italic> is expressed ubiquitously, including in the skin. There are two conserved domains in the protein, namely ABC transmembrane domain and ABC transporter-like domain <bold>(</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087250-g002">
<bold>Figure 2C</bold>
</xref>
<bold>)</bold>. Sequence comparison of <italic>ABCB6</italic> across different species showed that both the amino acids affected by DUH mutations (c.1358c&gt;T;p.Ala453Val and c.964A&gt;C; p.Ser322Lys) are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087250-g002">
<bold>Figure 2B</bold>
</xref>), implying that these two residues are key to normal biological function of ABCB6. ABCB6 plays an important role in hemo-synthesis and multi-drug resistance as the porphyrin transporter <xref rid="pone.0087250-Krishnamurthy1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087250-Krishnamurthy3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It also functions as a glycosylated protein targeted to intracellular vesicular membranes and plays a critical role in cellular transition and metal homeostasis, especially copper homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0087250-Jalil1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Copper is thought to be particularly important for vertebrate pigmentation as a cofactor for the enzyme tyrosinase that is essential to catalyze the initial steps of melanin synthesis within the melanosome <xref rid="pone.0087250-Lutsenko1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0087250-Marks1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. While still being speculative, it is possible that the DUH mutations of <italic>ABCB6</italic> may result in abnormal copper homeostasis, which influence the activity of tyrosinase and further lead to the abnormal melanin synthesis. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular functions of the different domains of ABCB6 and the mechanisms underlying the involvement of <italic>ABCB6</italic> mutations in diverse disease phenotypes. Although the genetic methods we used for disease gene discovery are similar to Zhangâs group <xref rid="pone.0087250-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the functional validation of the identified disease gene is different between the two studies. In our study, zebrafish model was established to investigate the role of ABCB6 in pigmentation; while in theirs, subcelluar localization experiment was performed to detect the location of wild-type ABCB6 in a B16 mouse melanoma cells, and to show that disease-causing mutations of ABCB6 resulted in its retention in the Golgi apparatus. The two studies supported each other in some aspect. In addition, we found the co-existence of pigmentation and ocular abnormalities in our DUH patients, which provides critical evidence for the diverse role of ABCB6 in both pigmentation and ocular development.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have discovered <italic>ABCB6</italic> as a disease gene for DUH with solid genetic and functional evidences through genome-wide linkage, exome sequencing, and functional investigation in human tissues and zebrafish model. Our discovery has expanded the novel disease-causing mutations of ABCB6 to five, advanced our understanding of DUH pathogenesis and revealed the shared pathogenic mechanism between pigmentary DUH and ocular coloboma.</p>

        <p>We recruited five unrelated DUH families (four in China and one in Singapore, totalling 23 affected individuals and 16 unaffected family members), two sporadic case (one in China and one in Singapore, totalling two affected individuals and two unaffected family members) of Chinese ethnicity in our study. In addition, the dataset of 500 exomes and additional 1,016 unrelated normal controls of Chinese ethnicity were also analyzed in our study. After obtaining informed consent from all participants, all the family members were carefully examined by at least two experienced dermatologists, and the clinical diagnosis of DUH in all the cases is based on the generalized and random distribution of small hypo- and hyper-pigmented lesions.</p>
        <p>EDTA anticoagulated venous blood samples were collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes by standard procedures using FlexiGene DNA kits (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from skin biopsies of 4 DUH patients(III4, II4, IV4 from family 1, IV3 from family 2) and 4 health controls using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies).</p>
        <p>The study was approved by the institutional review board at Shandong Provincial Institute of Dermatology and Venereology and the National Health Group, Domain Specific Review Board for National Skin Centre, Singapore.

        <title>Genome-wide Linkage Analysis</title>
        <p>For the genome-wide linkage analysis, approximately 200 ng of genomic DNA of the 12 individuals from the Family 1 was used for the genotyping analysis by using Illumina Human 660W-Quad BeadChip. Briefly, each sample was whole-genome amplified, fragmented, precipitated and resuspended in appropriate hybridization buffer. Denatured samples were hybridized on prepared Illumina Human 660-Quad BeadChip. After hybridization, the BeadChip oligonucleotides were extended d by a single labeled base, which was detected by fluorescence imaging with an Illumina Bead Array Reader. Normalized bead intensity data obtained for each sample were loaded into the Illumina GenomStudio software, which converted fluorescence in tensities into SNP genotypes.</p>
        <p>After quality control filtering, 589,209 SNPs were remained for linkage analysis. Familial relationship check based on IBD sharing was carried out to confirm the collected pedigree information. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed in Merlin by using the pruned autosomal SNPs (with LD &lt;0.1 in population data) and assuming dominant inheritance with a disease allele frequency of 0.001, penetrance rate of 0.99 and phenocopy rate of 0.01. The linkage critical regions were determined by haplotype co-segregation analysis using Haplopainter.</p>

        <title>Exome Capture, Sequencing and Variant Detection</title>
        <p>We performed the exome capture using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kits according to the manufacturerâs protocols. Genomic DNA samples with high quality were sheared and randomly fragmented using the Covaris instrument with a base pair peak of 150â200 bp. The sheared DNA samples were purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads and tested with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The ends were repaired and the 3â² end of the fragments was added âAâ bases. Adapters were then ligated to both ends of the fragments. The adaptor-ligated templates were further purified using Agencourt AMPure SPRI beads and fragments with insert size 250 bp were excised. The adaptor-ligated library was amplified by ligation-mediated PCR, purified and hybridized to the SureSelect Biotinylated RNA Library (BAITS) for enrichment. Hybridized fragments were bound to the strepavidin beads, whereas non-hybridized fragments were washed out. The captured library was amplified, purified and then were tested using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to estimate the magnitude of enrichment.</p>
        <p>Each captured library was then loaded on a HiSeq 2000 platform, and paired-end sequencing was performed with read lengths of 100 bp, which provided 50Ã average coverage depth for each sample. Raw image files were processed by Illumina base-calling Software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters.</p>
        <p>Sequence reads from each individual were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using BWA(Burrows-Wheeler Alignment) version 0.5.9 rcl with default parameters. Reads that had duplicated start sites were removed; the remaining reads that mapped on or near the target were collected for subsequent analyses and variant calling. The consensus genotypes, SNP and indel variants in the target regions were called by Genome Analysis Toolkit v1.0.5974 with the recommended parameters. The filtering criteria were based on the âbest practice variant detection with the GATKv3â, that is âQD &lt;2.0â, âMQ &lt;40.0â, âFS &gt;60.0â, âHaplotypeScore &gt;13.0â, âMQRankSum&lt;â12.5â, âReadPosRankSum&lt;â8.0â for SNV, and âQD &lt;2.0â, âReadPosRankSum&lt;â20.0â, âInbreedingCoeff&lt;â0.8â, âFS &gt;200.0â for indel.</p>

        <p>Skin biopsies were obtained from DUH patient (III4 from family 1) and healthy control. All skin biopsies were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, and then subsequently embedded in paraffin. 4-Âµm sections of tissue blocks were microtome sectioned, mounted on glass slides and dried at 48Â°C for 4 h, then the sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with a series of graded ethanol. The antigen retrieval method for tissue sections is Heat Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) that was performed by heating the slides immersed in retrieval buffer, pH 6.0, for 4 minutes at 125Â°C in the pressure boiler. Next, the sections were immersed in potassium permanganate solution for 1 minute to removed pigmentations will TritonX-100 solution. Human primary melanocyte cell line HEM was maintained in MelM medium (Scien Cell) supplemented with 0.25% FBS (Scien Cell), penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were incubated on round coverslip for 12 h, and washed with PBS after the serum was removed. Then, the cells were fixed on the coverslip with 4% paraformaldehyde solution and permeabilized in 0.5%TritonX-100 solution.</p>
        <p>To inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections and cells were treated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBS for 10 minutes. For immunostaining, a primary rabbit polyclonal ABCB6 antibody (HPA046723, Sigma-aldrich) was employed in 1â¶15 dilution with PBS and incubated for 3 h at 37Â°C in a humid chamber. After several subsequent washing steps with PBS for at least 15 min, the sections and cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 30 minutes using the goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP Secondly antibody. Visualization was achieved using 3â²3-diaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride substrate (DAB).
