      <abstract>
        <p>Cellular signalling cascades regulate the activity of transcription factors that convert extracellular information into gene regulation. C/EBPÎ² is a ras/MAPkinase signal-sensitive transcription factor that regulates genes involved in metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, immunity, senescence, and tumourigenesis. The protein arginine methyltransferase 4 PRMT4/CARM1 interacts with C/EBPÎ² and dimethylates a conserved arginine residue (R3) in the C/EBPÎ² N-terminal transactivation domain, as identified by mass spectrometry of cell-derived C/EBPÎ². Phosphorylation of the C/EBPÎ² regulatory domain by ras/MAPkinase signalling abrogates the interaction between C/EBPÎ² and PRMT4/CARM1. Differential proteomic screening, protein interaction studies, and mutational analysis revealed that methylation of R3 constraines interaction with SWI/SNF and Mediator complexes. Mutation of the R3 methylation site alters endogenous myeloid gene expression and adipogenic differentiation. Thus, phosphorylation of the transcription factor C/EBPÎ² couples ras signalling to arginine methylation and regulates the interaction of C/EBPÎ² with epigenetic gene regulatory protein complexes during cell differentiation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The transcription factor C/EBPÎ² is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family that is composed of C/EBPÎ±, Î², Î´, Î³, É, and Î¶. C/EBPÎ² is expressed in a variety of cell types and participates in tissue-specific gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation in a hormone, cytokine, and nutrient-dependent manner. C/EBPÎ² controls important functions in liver homeostasis, regeneration, acute phase response, female reproduction, innate and adopted immunity, senescence, and receptor tyrosine kinase/ras oncoprotein-mediated tumourigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Roesler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Farmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sebastian and Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Nerlov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Zahnow, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>C/EBPÎ² carries at its N-terminus a modular, composite transactivation domain (TAD) that consists of four conserved regions (CR1â4), a composite regulatory domain (RD) consisting of CR5â7 at its centre that governs TAD functions, and a basic DNA binding and leucine dimerization domain (bZip) at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kowenz-Leutz <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Williams <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) (scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Three C/EBPÎ² protein isoforms are expressed from a single, intronless transcript by signal-dependent alternative translation initiation from in-frame positioned start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). These N-terminally variant C/EBPÎ² isoforms of 38, 35, and 20 kDa are termed LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1, LAP/C/EBPÎ²2, and LIP/C/EBPÎ²3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bundy and Sealy, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The C/EBPÎ² isoforms harbour distinct parts of the TAD and RD and display diverse or even opposite gene regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Timchenko <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baer and Johnson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Eaton <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). The two long isoforms (LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 and LAP/C/EBPÎ²2) differ by a conserved sequence of 21â23 N-terminal amino acids in different species that represents CR1. CR1 functions as a gene regulatory module involved in the recruitment of the chromatin-remodelling SWI/SNF complex and the transcription regulatory Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The short isoform (LIP/C/EBPÎ²3) lacks the TAD and part of the RD and represents a dominantly interfering protein that may neutralize both, transactivation and transrepression by all C/EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Zahnow <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Luedde <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The transcriptional activity of C/EBPÎ² is diversified by a multitude of interactions with other C/EBP family members, unrelated transcription factors, and transcription co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Sebastian and Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Nerlov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Zahnow, 2009</xref>). A major post-translational modification has been attributed to signalling through receptor tyrosine kinaseâras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that phosphorylates an evolutionary conserved MAPK consensus site in the C/EBPÎ² RD (Thr-235 in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Nakajima <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>), Thr-188 in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hanlon <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), Thr-220 in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kowenz-Leutz <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>)). In its non-phosphorylated form, the RD of C/EBPÎ² is involved in masking the TAD through intra-molecular interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kowenz-Leutz <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Williams <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) and in binding a repressive or attenuated form of the Mediator complex. Phosphorylation of the MAPK site is accompanied by a conformational change in the protein, exchange of interacting Mediator components, and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Alignment and sequence comparison of vertebrate C/EBPÎ² revealed a number of highly conserved arginine residues in their N-termini that we considered to be involved in regulating C/EBPÎ² activity. Here, we show that the TAD of C/EBPÎ² interacts with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT4/CARM1 that methylates C/EBPÎ² at the highly conserved arginine residue at position 3 (R3) in CR1. Methylation of R3 is inversely correlated to phosphorylation of the MAPkinase site in the RD. The R3 methylation status determines the interaction with the SWI/SNF complex and with the Mediator complex to regulate endogenous target genes and cell differentiation in an MAPkinase signalling-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>C/EBP<italic>Î²</italic> is methylated at arginine residues</title>
        <p>Alignment and sequence comparison of vertebrate C/EBPÎ² family members revealed several conserved arginine residues in low complexity regions of the N-terminus. We considered the possibility that arginine side chains of C/EBPÎ² are post-translationally modified by methylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 isoform was immunoprecipitated by an antibody specific to methylated arginine (Rme). No Rme-specific immunoprecipitation was observed in the presence of adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx, a homocysteine hydrolase inhibitor that blocks the regeneration of the cellular methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bartel and Borchardt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The two long C/EBPÎ² isoforms reacted with antibodies that specifically recognize asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (ASYM24) or symmetrically dimethylated arginine (SYM10) side chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). A small amount of the truncated LIP/C/EBPÎ²3 isoform was detected with the ASYM24 antibody, but not with SYM10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Metabolic labelling with <sc>L</sc>-[methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide and chloramphenicol revealed tracer incorporation only in the long C/EBPÎ² isoforms (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pless <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). These results supported the idea that C/EBPÎ² is post-translationally modified by both, asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylation on arginines. This notion was scrutinized by mass spectrometric analysis. A histidine-tagged LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 construct was expressed in fibroblasts and enriched under denaturing conditions by nickel chelating affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). C/EBPÎ² fractions were digested to peptides, separated on a nano-HPLC system and analysed by MS/MS mass spectrometry, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>. The mass shift (28 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) of the modified R3 residue in the b-series of fragment ions identified a dimethylated arginine at position 3. Multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry from cell lysates approved the occurrence of arginine dimethylation on R3 of endogenous LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 in cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>. As the N-terminally LAP<sup>*</sup>-specific peptide has a clearly defined modular function in chromatin remodelling and gene regulation, we focused on the molecular biology and functions of C/EBPÎ² R3 dimethylation; however, several other Rme/Rme2 residues were discovered and will be described elsewhere (data not shown). Taken together, the data showed that cellular C/EBPÎ² is modified by dimethylation of the conserved R3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, lower part).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Proteomic screening reveals C/EBP<italic>Î²</italic> R3 methylation-sensitive protein interactions</title>
        <p>Protein interactions with non-modified and R3 asymmetrically dimethylated peptides (aa 1â41) were analysed by proteomic screening of a UNIPEX human cDNA expression library that covers approximately one third of the human proteome. Bacterially expressed His-tagged recombinant proteins, immobilized in duplicates on PVDF membrane were screened in replicate libraries with C-terminally biotinylated peptides that encompassed C/EBPÎ² CR1â2 with R3 either in its unmethylated or asymmetrically dimethylated form (R3me2a), followed by detection with streptavidine coupled to horseradish peroxidase, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>. Numerous interactions detected with methylated and unmethylated peptides fall into three distinct categories: protein interactions with no preference for either peptide, interactions that favoured R3 methylation, and interactions that favoured unmodified R3 (data not shown). Thus, the methylation status of C/EBPÎ² R3 directs the interaction between CR1 and other proteins.</p>
        <p>Of particular interest was the interaction with two core components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, Brg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) and BAF47/Ini1 (data not shown). Both recombinant Brg1 and BAF47/Ini1 proteins interacted preferentially with non-modified peptide and weakly with the methylated peptide. Differential interaction between the SWI/SNF complex and unmethylated versus dimethylated peptide was confirmed in pull-down assays with cell lysates, as shown by retention of SWI/SNF subunits hBrm, BAF155, and BAF47/Ini1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, Mediator components MED23/Sur2 and MED26 (not contained in the proteomic library), earlier shown to interact with CR1, likewise bound to unmodified LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 N-terminal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). These results are in accordance with the earlier genetic and biochemical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and we conclude that methylation of R3 affects the interaction with SWI/SNF and Mediator complexes.</p>
        <p>The effect of R3 modifications on protein complex binding was examined by substituting R3 with alanine (R3A) or leucine (R3L) to eliminate the methylation target or to mimic increased hydrophobicity after methylation, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and GST-pull-down assays with LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 WT, R3A, and R3L mutants and SWI/SNF or Mediator components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3A and B</xref>) showed preferential interaction of the R3A LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 mutant with hBrm and with the Mediator component MED23, whereas R3L displayed decreased interactions with both complexes. Thus, the R3A and the R3L C/EBPÎ²1 mutant proteins reflect the binding specificity of the screening peptides and may serve as suitable tools for functional investigations.</p>

        <title>Alterations in R3 specify gene regulation by LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBP<italic>Î²</italic>1</title>
        <p>The interaction between CR1 and SWI/SNF is critical for the activation of a subset of C/EBPÎ² target genes, whereas other C/EBPÎ² target genes remain unaffected by CR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz, 1999</xref>). Therefore, the effects of R3 mutations were examined on the CR1-dependent endogenous myeloid target gene <italic>mim-1</italic> and the CR1-independent goose-type lysozyme gene <italic>#325</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, the R3A LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 mutant strongly activated endogenous <italic>mim-1</italic> expression in comparison with WT LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 that can be methylated at R3. In contrast, the R3L mutant was barely active. Importantly, WT and both mutants activated the <italic>#325</italic> gene to similar extends. Thus, the gene regulatory activity of R3A and R3L mutants reflected CR1-specific co-factor interactions and CR1 R3-specific functions on chromatin-embedded target gene regulation.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>PRMT4/CARM1 binds to and methylates C/EBP<italic>Î²</italic></title>
        <p>Lymphoid and myeloid cells that express C/EBPÎ² also highly express the protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT3, PRMT4/CARM1 (both: asymmetric arginine metylation), and PRMT5 (symmetric arginine methylation) (BioGPS). We, therefore, examined whether R3 of the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 isoform represents a target for one or more of these PRMTs. PRMT3, 4, and 5 were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, immunoaffinity purified from cell lysates, and incubated in the presence of <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>L</sc>-[methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]methionine with peptides P1, P2, P3, and P4, tiling the TAD of the rat C/EBPÎ² N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>; P1: aa 1â21; P2: aa 22â56; P3: aa 50â82; P4: aa 81â113). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, radioactivity was specifically incorporated with PRMT4/CARM1 in P1, representing CR1 of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1. Label incorporation was approximately 20-fold higher in P1 than in P2, P3, or P4 that also contained arginine and/or lysine residues. All three PRMTs were equally expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>) and functionally active, as determined by incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-methyl into recombinant GST-Histone H3 and H4 N-termini, but not into the GST moiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). These data show that PRMT4/CARM1 specifically methylates the CR1 N-terminus of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1.</p>
        <p>Methylation assays with the entire GST-C/EBPÎ² TAD (CR1â4; aa 1â113) showed that the C/EBPÎ²-WT, but not the R3A mutant TAD, was methylated by PRMT4/CARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). The PRMT4/CARM1 enzyme activity and the C/EBPÎ² GST-protein expression were approved by auto-methylation and protein staining, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). In summary, these data confirm R3 of C/EBPÎ² as a PRMT4/CARM1 methylation target.</p>
        <p>Immunoprecipitation of C/EBPÎ² from K562 cells revealed that endogenous PRMT4/CARM1 and C/EBPÎ² interacted in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitations of WT PRMT4/CARM1 or a catalytically inactive PRMT4/CARM1 mutant (amino-acids 189â191 VLD to AAA, dubbed PRMT4/CARM1<sup>mut</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) with LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 showed that interaction did not depend on the catalytic activity of the methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). Deletion mapping of C/EBPÎ² revealed PRMT4/CARM1 association with the C/EBPÎ² TAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>) and GST-pull downs showed that PRMT4/CARM1 interacts preferentially with C/EBPÎ² TAD CR3 and CR4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Examination of the functional consequences of PRMT4/CARM1 interaction with C/EBPÎ² showed that the catalytically defective PRMT4/CARM1<sup>mut</sup> enhanced activation of the myeloid LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 target gene <italic>mim-1</italic>, whereas WT PRMT4/CARM1 decreased activation of <italic>mim-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Expression of the CR1-independent <italic>#325</italic> myeloid gene remained indifferent to WT PRMT4/CARM1 or its mutant, excluding a general repressive effect of PRMT4/CARM1 on the transcriptional machinery or on C/EBPÎ² target genes. Importantly, co-expression of WT PRMT4/CARM1 did not suppress <italic>mim-1</italic> activation by the non-methylatable C/EBPÎ²1 R3A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>, right), providing further evidence that methylation of R3 specifically interferes with the activation of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 CR1-dependent target genes. The results suggest that the methylation status of the R3 side chain has a decisive function in the regulation of SWI/SNF complex-dependent target genes.</p>

        <title>C/EBP<italic>Î²</italic> phosphorylation abrogates PRMT4/CARM1 interaction</title>
        <p>C/EBPÎ² is a repressed transcription factor that can be activated by EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and ras signalling through the MAP kinase Erk1/2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Nakajima <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kowenz-Leutz <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Fan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation of the conserved MAP kinase site in the central RD of C/EBPÎ² is accompanied by a conformational change in C/EBPÎ² that alters interactions with protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Kowenz-Leutz <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Williams <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We, therefore, examined whether ras signalling also alters interaction between PRMT4/CARM1 and C/EBPÎ². As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, co-expression of activated ras<sup>V12</sup> with C/EBPÎ² increased phosphorylation at the MAPkinase site. Concomitantly, binding of PRMT4/CARM1 to C/EBPÎ² was diminished. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous C/EBPÎ² from K562 cells approved that PRMT4/CARM1 interacts with C/EBPÎ² in untreated, but not in phorbol ester (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, PMA)-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). MRM of endogenous C/EBPÎ² from K562 cells showed inverse correlation between phosphorylation of the MAPK-site and dimethylation of R3 of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 and disappearance of R3 methylation after PMA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Earlier, it was reported that EGF receptor tyrosine kinase signalling inhibits PRMT4/CARM1 methyltransferase activity and subsequent histone H3 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Higashimoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We, therefore, examined whether activated C/EBPÎ², as represented by the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 phospho-mimetic MAPkinase site mutant T220D, interacts with PRMT4/CARM1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>, interaction between PRMT4/CARM1 and C/EBPÎ² T220D was strongly diminished, as compared with WT C/EBPÎ². In accordance, the C/EBPÎ² T220D mutant activated adipogenic target gene expression and fat cell differentiation, as compared with WT, whereas the C/EBPÎ² T220A displayed strongly diminished activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that phosphorylation of the C/EBPÎ² RD abolishes the interaction between the TAD of C/EBPÎ² and PRMT4/CARM1 and as a consequence leads to abrogation of methylation of R3 LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1.</p>

        <title>Alteration of the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBP<italic>Î²</italic>1 R3 residue affects myeloid and adipogenic differentiation</title>
        <p>C/EBPÎ² associates with the human neutrophil elastase gene (<italic>hELA2</italic>) and activates <italic>hELA2</italic> expression in an MAPkinase signal-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Nuchprayoon <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lausen <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pless <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Myeloid gene activation in heterologous cells and reprogramming by C/EBPÎ² are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Laiosa <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Zahnow, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether the myeloid <italic>hELA2</italic> gene can be activated by LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 in fibroblasts. Expression of <italic>hELA2</italic> in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was strongly enhanced after PMA treatment with LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1, but not with LAP/C/EBPÎ²2 or LIP/C/EBPÎ²3. The LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 R3A mutant was significantly more active than WT LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1, yet barely induced by PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>, expression controls in 7B). These data are consistent with the rational that R3 in its unmethylated and methylated form is involved in activation and repression processes and that replacement of R3 (R3A) partially compromises both functions. The LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 R3L mutant did not display significant activity with or without PMA, consistent with the notion that replacement of R3 with leucine stabilizes the inhibitory state of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1. These data show that CR1 of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 has an important function in the activation of the endogenous <italic>hELA2</italic> gene in fibroblasts.</p>
        <p>Endogenous C/EBPÎ² in human U937 myeloid cells binds to a 117 bp fragment upstream of the <italic>hELA2</italic> TATA-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Nuchprayoon <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lausen <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and PMA-induced phosphorylation of the C/EBPÎ² MAPkinase site upregulates <italic>hELA2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pless <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>, both C/EBPÎ² and PRMT4/CARM1 were found associated with the <italic>hELA2</italic> promoter in U937 cells. Reciprocal re-immunoprecipitation of either C/EBPÎ² or PRMT4/CARM1 confirmed simultaneous occupancy of the <italic>hELA2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). PMA treatment abrogated association of PRMT4/CARM1 with the <italic>hELA2</italic> promoter, whereas C/EBPÎ² occupancy persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, the Mediator complex component MED23/Sur2 was associated with the <italic>hELA2</italic> promoter before PMA stimulation and increased after PMA treatment. In contrast, CDK8, a component of attenuated Mediator, was five-fold decreased after PMA treatment, probably reflecting the earlier described exchange between Mediator complex modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Taken together, these data support the notion that C/EBPÎ² phosphorylation is accompanied by dissociation from PRMT4/CARM1 and loss of the Mediator CDK8 module during <italic>hELA2</italic> gene activation.</p>
        <p>C/EBPÎ² also regulates adipogenesis and controls early activation of a cascade of transcription factors that finally orchestrate adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cao <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Yeh <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Mandrup and Lane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Birsoy <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).

We, therefore, asked whether stable expression of WT and mutant LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 isoforms in NIH 3T3 L1 cells alters adipogenesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref> (expression controls <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7F</xref>), fat cell differentiation was strongly enhanced by the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 R3A mutant, as indicated by upregulation of the adipogenic genes PPARÎ³, aP2, and adipsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref>), in the absence of the usually required hormone cocktail. In contrast, expression of the LAP/C/EBPÎ²2 isoform or the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 R3L mutant in NIH 3T3 L1 cells did not induce spontaneous differentiation. These results suggest that enhanced SWI/SNF recruitment by unmethylated R3 in LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 CR1 predisposes mesenchymal precursor cells to adipogenic differentiation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The transcription factor C/EBPÎ² functions at the interface of cell metabolism, stress, proliferation, and differentiation. Data presented here show that ras/MAPkinase signalling is coupled to R3 methylation and that the R3 methylation state specifies interactions between C/EBPÎ², SWI/SNF and Mediator. Our data show how extracellular signals initially converted to kinase signalling connect to arginine methylation of a transcription factor that in turn determines interaction with the epigenetic and gene regulatory machinery in the nucleus to regulate gene transcription and differentiation. The data are summarized in the conceptual model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>.</p>
      <p>A distinctive feature of the intronless single C/EBPÎ² transcript is that alternative translation initiation at consecutive in-frame start sites may generate three protein isoforms with different N-termini that display activator and repressor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The CR1 comprises 21â23 amino acids in different species and is contained in the largest LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 isoform. LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 regulates a subset of C/EBPÎ² target genes that are involved in mammary epithelial integrity, proliferation and cell differentiation, innate immunity, and potentially also fat metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Eaton <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bundy and Sealy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Uematsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Our data show that the conserved arginine at position 3 (R3) can be specifically methylated by PRMT4/CARM1 and that the methylation status of R3 determines the interaction between CR1 and other proteins. Proteins that interact with the unmethylated CR1 include components of the SWI/SNF complex and Mediator complex. Both multi-subunit protein complexes had been described earlier to mediate important functions of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 isoforms during chromatin remodelling and gene regulation.</p>
      <p>Mass spectrometry combined with mutational analysis, biochemical, molecular genetic, and cell biological data establishes that PRMT4/CARM1 interacts with the TAD of C/EBPÎ² and dimethylates CR1 specifically at the evolutionary conserved R3 residue. Methylation of R3 impairs the interaction with SWI/SNF and Mediator complexes and, therefore, attenuates activation of myeloid and adipogenic genes. It has recently been shown that adipogenic induction requires activation of C/EBPÎ² expression and that the LAP<sup>*</sup> isoform was able to bypass an early regulatory network of pro-adipogenic transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Birsoy <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). At the same time, genes that are not affected by the presence of CR1 are exempt from R3 regulation. This interpretation is in agreement with a modular and appendicular function of N-terminal CR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and is supported by a recent knock in study that shows that LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 may largely replace LAP/C/EBPÎ²2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Uematsu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Of particular attention is the finding of a functional crosstalk between ras/MAPkinase signalling, arginine methylation of C/EBPÎ² and recruitment of an epigenetic complex. Our data show that phosphorylation of a distal site and methylation of the N-terminal R3 has opposing functions on C/EBPÎ²-mediated gene activation. The interaction between PRMT4/CARM1 and C/EBPÎ² and their co-association on the <italic>hELA2</italic> promoter is abolished when LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 is phosphorylated. Concomitantly, the silent myeloid <italic>hELA2</italic> C/EBPÎ² target gene was activated in fibroblasts, reflecting epigenetic activation of myeloid gene expression by LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1. The R3A mutation in C/EBPÎ² that removes the methylation target displayed enhanced co-factor interactions, myeloid gene activation, induction of adipogenesis, and, importantly, resists the repressive effect of PRMT4/CARM1. We conclude that in the absence of signals, association of PRMT4/CARM1 specifically restrains LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 functions by R3 methylation, without repressing the overall C/EBPÎ² activity.</p>
      <p>Earlier, we had shown that C/EBPÎ² is also methylated on a highly conserved lysine residue by G9a and that methylation at K39 compromised its transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Pless <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Here, we show that MAPkinase-phosphorylated C/EBPÎ² is undermethylated. Accordingly, our data support the idea of a negative crosstalk between C/EBPÎ² phosphorylation and methylation and raise the possibility that in the absence of an activating signal, C/EBPÎ² becomes methylated and remains transcriptional inactive or displays repressor functions, whereas MAPkinase signalling transiently abrogates C/EBPÎ² methylation and permits co-activator recruitment and gene activating functions.</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation of the RD following receptor tyrosine kinaseâras/MAPK signalling has been shown to activate LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 by inducing a structural change that affects interaction and composition of associated Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Data presented here suggest that phosphorylation of the C/EBPÎ² RD also curtails interaction with PRMT4/CARM1 that is associated with inactive C/EBPÎ². In this context, it is interesting to note that in studies of promoter-specific PRMT4/CARM1 functions, enhanced expression of the C/EBPÎ² target genes Il6 and COX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akira <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Poli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Gorgoni <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) was observed in CARM1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Covic <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), supporting an inhibitory function of CARM1 for distinct C/EBPÎ² functions.</p>
      <p>PRMT4/CARM1 is primarily considered in gene transactivation; however, a repressive function on gene transcription has also been described for the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein that when methylated at the KIX domain failed to interact with the transcription factor CREB. In addition, methylation of the steroid receptor co-activator 3 complex leads to co-activator disassembly and decreased steroid receptor-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Feng <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Co-activator functions of PRMT4/CARM1 were described for nuclear hormone receptor-mediated target gene activation, including PPARÎ³-mediated adipogenesis, which is reduced by 40% in adipose tissue in PRMT4/CARM1 KOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Yadav <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). It, therefore, seems that the activity of PRMT4/CARM1 is dispensable for the early activation of adipogenic co-factors (supported by data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), whereas PRMT4/CARM1 is required as a co-activator for PPARÎ³ functions in terminal differentiation. In support of this notion is the observation that MAPkinase signalling and IBMX (enhances protein kinase-A signalling) supports early, but not late, adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Student <italic>et al</italic>, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kortum <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>A function of PRMT4/CARM1 is the methylation of histone H3 at R17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bauer <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Yadav <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Although PRMT4/CARM1 is not the only H3R17-specific methyltransferase, it would have been informative to monitor the H3R17 methylation status in the vicinity of C/EBPÎ²-binding sites in the genome. Unfortunately, attempts to determine the H3R17 methylation status failed, as available R17 methylation-specific antibodies were found to cross-react with methylated C/EBPÎ² (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of chromatin structure and C/EBPÎ² R3 methylation must, therefore, await the availability of more specific reagents that discriminate between histone and C/EBPÎ² R3 modification states.</p>
      <p>Interaction between the N-terminus of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 and the SWI/SNF complex was originally detected in chromatin-remodelling deficient yeast and confirmed biochemically and molecular genetically in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz, 1999</xref>). Differential interaction of SWI/SNF complex proteins was now found again by proteomic screening with peptides that represent unmethylated and methylated derivatives of the LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 N-terminus. These data confirm a modular function of CR1 in SWI/SNF recruitment and show the feasibility of proteomic expression screening approaches with transactivation modules that contain or lack post-translational modifications to uncover differential protein interactions.</p>
      <p>Methylation of arginine side chains may either enhance interactions by increasing hydrophobicity or act as a hydrogen donor (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Dacwag <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lee and Stallcup, 2009</xref>), although more often abrogation of interactions between proteins has been observed. For example, it has been shown that methylation of RUNX1 by PRMT1 interferes with binding of the SIN3A complex, thus leading to gene activation by removal of an inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, our proteomic screening results support the notion that methylation of R3 not only abrogates interactions, but also enhances protein interactions. Whether or not such interactions through R3 contribute to gene silencing effects by LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 is currently under investigation.</p>
      <p>In addition to modifications at R3, C/EBPÎ² may carry a multitude of modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, lysine, and arginine methylation at different sites, similar to the well-studied example of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Yang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Olsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Scoumanne and Chen, 2008</xref>). We, therefore, assume in analogy to a âhistone code' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Turner, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</xref>) a âtranscription factor code' of modifications that tunes transregulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sims and Reinberg, 2008</xref>). C/EBPÎ² might serve as a signal-dependent docking platform for epigenetic enzymes that once recruited may also alter the functionality of C/EBPÎ² by decoration with additional PTMs that, in further analogy to the histone code, may serve as docking/blocking/assembly sites for novel-interacting complexes. This notion has medical, pharmacological, and developmental implications, as âepigenetic drugs' might not only affect histone/chromatin modifications, but also transcription factor functions. The technical advance shown here, combining mass spectrometry with PTM-dependent proteomic screening, will help to establish a more general insight into the succession, interdependence, and functions of signal-dependent PTM patterns on C/EBPÎ² and interacting protein complexes.</p>

Peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography on a nano-Acquity UPLC (Waters) and analysed by electrospray ionization on a Q-TOF premier mass spectrometer (Waters). Peptide spectra were assigned using the MASCOT software (Matrix Science) and refined by hand interpretation. For quantification of endogenous C/EBPÎ² R3 modification by MRM of untreated or PMA-treated K562 or U937, cell lysates were prepared in 6 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mM Pefablock, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Fragment ion spectra were obtained by fragmenting an arginine R3 dimethyl-modified hC/EBPÎ² N-terminal peptide. The peptide was injected into mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization. Fragment spectra were recorded in an MDS/Sciex AB 5500 Q-TRAP mass spectromenter and analysed with the Analyst 1.5 Software (Applied Biosystems). Signature fragments were selected for the creation of a MRM method; 5 Î¼g of total cells extract were recorded with dwell times ranging from 5 to 100 ms. The intensities were integrated with the MRMPilot Software package (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to the actin measurement. Statistical analysis was performed using the R software package (V2.10).</p>

(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of C/EBPÎ² isoforms that arise by alternative translation initiation from in-frame start codons termed as LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1, LAP/C/EBPÎ²2 and LIP/C/EBPÎ²3. (<bold>B</bold>) LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 is precipitated by the ASYM24 anti-Rme2a antibody in the absence of AdOx. LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1-transfected fibroblasts were treated with adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx) for 12 h (as indicated) and immunoprecipitated with the ASYM24 antibody. Precipitated proteins were analysed by immunoblotting using an anti-C/EBPÎ² antibody. Right side shows expression controls in the absence and presence of AdOx. (<bold>C</bold>) Purification scheme of C/EBPÎ². Briefly, His-tagged C/EBPÎ² was purified under denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography on a nickel chelating resin. Blot shows purified fractions of C/EBPÎ². (<bold>D</bold>) Tandem mass spectrum of an R3me2 and oxidized N-terminal C/EBPÎ² peptide. b- and y-series of the LysC-generated peptides are indicated. Mass shifts indicate a 28 Da modification, corresponding to dimethylation at position R3.

        <p>Differential interaction of SWI/SNF and Mediator complexes with R3 methylated and unmethylated LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 N-terminal peptides. (<bold>A</bold>) The N-terminal sequence of LAP<sup>*</sup>/C/EBPÎ²1 was synthesized with R3 in unmodified form (1â41) or in asymmetrically dimethylated form (1â41 Rme2a). Peptides with covalently attached C-terminal biotin moieties (grey pentagons) were applied to UNIPEX proteomic libraries and interactions were revealed by streptavidin-HRP (SA-HRP) and ECL. Positive clones were identified as characteristic duplicate pattern per square. Libraries contained 48x48 squares with four duplicate clones on two PVDF membranes. A single square containing the brama-related gene 1 (Brg1) expression clone interacts with unmethylated, but not with methylated peptide (arrow heads). (<bold>B</bold>) Unmethylated and methylated C/EBPÎ² peptides (1 Î¼M), as shown in (<bold>A</bold>) were incubated with cell lysates and bound proteins separated by streptavidin Dynabeads. Cell lysates were prepared from Raji cells (top) or HEK-293 MED23-HA-transfected cell lysates (bottom). Western blots were incubated with anti-hBrm, anti-BAF155, anti-BAF47/Ini1, anti-HA, and anti-MED26 as indicated.</p>
