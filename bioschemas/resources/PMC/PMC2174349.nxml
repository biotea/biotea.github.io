      <abstract>
        <p>We report the identification of Î²IV spectrin, a novel spectrin isolated as an interactor of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase-like protein ICA512. The Î²IV spectrin gene is located on human and mouse chromosomes 19q13.13 and 7b2, respectively. Alternative splicing of Î²IV spectrin generates at least four distinct isoforms, numbered Î²IVÎ£1âÎ²IVÎ£4 spectrin. The longest isoform (Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin) includes an actin-binding domain, followed by 17 spectrin repeats, a specific domain in which the amino acid sequence ERQES is repeated four times, several putative SH3-binding sites and a pleckstrin homology domain. Î²IVÎ£2 and Î²IVÎ£3 spectrin encompass the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal halves of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, respectively, while Î²IVÎ£4 spectrin lacks the ERQES and the pleckstrin homology domain. Northern blots revealed an abundant expression of Î²IV spectrin transcripts in brain and pancreatic islets. By immunoblotting, Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin is recognized as a protein of 250 kD. AntiâÎ²IV spectrin antibodies also react with two additional isoforms of 160 and 140 kD. These isoforms differ from Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin in terms of their distribution on subcellular fractionation, detergent extractability, and phosphorylation. In islets, the immunoreactivity for Î²IV spectrin is more prominent in Î± than in Î² cells. In brain, Î²IV spectrin is enriched in myelinated neurons, where it colocalizes with ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270-kD at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. Likewise, Î²IV spectrin is concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier in the rat sciatic nerve. In the rat hippocampus, Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin is detectable from embryonic day 19, concomitantly with the appearance of immunoreactivity at the initial segments. Thus, we suggest that Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin interacts with ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270-kD and participates in the clustering of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and cell-adhesion molecules at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The spectrins were originally identified as rod-shaped molecules that are part of the lattice-like cytoskeleton underneath the erythrocyte membrane (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MarchesiandSteers1968">Marchesi and Steers 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ByersandBranton1985">Byers and Branton 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BennettandGilligan1993">Bennett and Gilligan 1993</xref>). This subplasmalemmal meshwork is required to maintain the shape and lipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane. The critical role of these proteins is best revealed by the evidence that several human genetic syndromes, such as elliptocytosis and spherocytosis, are caused by mutant spectrin alleles (for review, see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Marchesi1988">Marchesi 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="GallagherandForget1998">Gallagher and Forget 1998</xref>). The spectrins have also been proposed to participate in the trafficking of organelles along the secretory pathways (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BeckandNelson1998">Beck and Nelson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="DeMatteisandMorrow1998">De Matteis and Morrow 1998</xref>), and to play a role in regulated secretion (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Goodmanetal1995">Goodman et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sikorskietal1991">Sikorski et al. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sikorskietal2000">Sikorski et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>The spectrin molecule is a tetramer that consists of two Î± and two Î² subunits. A tight association between the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of an Î± subunit and the COOH-terminal domain of a Î² subunit forms a heterodimer, which assembles into a tetramer through a head-to-head association. The most distinctive feature of both subunits is the presence of multiple repeats, each consisting of â¼106 residues that assemble to form a three-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="SpeicherandMarchesi1984">Speicher and Marchesi 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yanetal1993">Yan et al. 1993</xref>). Î± spectrins include 20 spectrin repeats, two of which are less conserved, an SH3 motif between spectrin repeats 9 and 11, and a COOH-terminal domain with two EF-hand motifs. Î² spectrins, on the other hand, contain 17 spectrin repeats in between an actin-binding domain at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain towards the COOH terminus.</p>
      <p>Until recently, four genes encoding two Î± spectrins (Î±I and Î±II) and two Î² spectrins (Î²I and Î²II) were known in mammals. Î±IÎ£1 and Î²IÎ£1 spectrin are primarily expressed in erythrocytes, whereas Î±II Î£1 and Î²IIÎ£1 spectrin have a wide tissue distribution and are particularly abundant in the brain (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Goodmanetal1981">Goodman et al. 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Burridgeetal1982">Burridge et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Glenneyetal1982">Glenney et al. 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maetal1993">Ma et al. 1993</xref>). An alternative spliced isoform of Î²I spectrin, termed Î²IÎ£2 spectrin is highly expressed in muscle and brain (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Riedereretal1986">Riederer et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zagonetal1986">Zagon et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Winkelmannetal1990b">Winkelmann et al. 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Malchiodi-Albedietal1993">Malchiodi-Albedi et al. 1993</xref>). Similarly, an alternative spliced form has been found for Î²II spectrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hayesetal2000">Hayes et al. 2000</xref>). The number of Î² spectrins has recently expanded with the discovery of Î²III (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oharaetal1998">Ohara et al. 1998</xref>) and Î²V (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StabachandMorrow2000">Stabach and Morrow 2000</xref>) spectrin. Î²III spectrin, which is most abundant in brain and kidney, is concentrated at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stankewichetal1998">Stankewich et al. 1998</xref>), and may therefore represent one of the Golgi spectrins previously reported (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Becketal1994">Beck et al. 1994</xref>; for review, see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BeckandNelson1998">Beck and Nelson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="DeMatteisandMorrow1998">De Matteis and Morrow 1998</xref>). Î²V spectrin is an exception among mammalian spectrins, as it includes 30 repeats, similar to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Î² heavy (Î²<sub>H</sub>) spectrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dubreuiletal1990">Dubreuil et al. 1990</xref>). This large spectrin is most prominent in the outer segments of the retina and in gastric epithelial cells, while low levels are found in many tissues.</p>
      <p>Besides with Î± spectrins, Î² spectrins interact directly with many additional proteins, including actin, protein 4.1, and ankyrins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BennettandGilligan1993">Bennett and Gilligan 1993</xref>). Through the association with protein 4.1, Î²I spectrin interacts with the membrane proteins glycophorin C and the Cl<sup>â</sup>/HCO<sup>â</sup>
<sub>3</sub> exchanger (for review, see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Conboy1993">Conboy 1993</xref>). The binding to ankyrins provides Î² spectrins with an additional linkage to integral membrane proteins, such as the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel, CD44, and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BennettandGilligan1993">Bennett and Gilligan 1993</xref>). Finally, Î² spectrins can directly associate with membrane proteins via a domain located at the end of spectrin repeat 1 and with phosphoinositides through the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DavisandBennett1994">Davis and Bennett 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lombardoetal1994">Lombardo et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Godietal1998">Godi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yaoetal1999">Yao et al. 1999</xref>). Thus, Î² spectrins are essential in the generation of organized cytoplasmic and membrane microdomains.</p>
      <p>Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human spectrin, termed Î²IV spectrin, which was isolated in a two-hybrid screening in yeast as an interactor of the autoantigen of type I diabetes ICA512 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rabinetal1992">Rabin et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rabinetal1994">Rabin et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lanetal1994">Lan et al. 1994</xref>). ICA512 (also known as IA-2, PTP-35, PTPLP, and PTPN) is a receptor tyrosine phosphataseâlike protein of unknown function, which is associated with the secretory granules of neurons and peptide-secreting endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Solimenaetal1996">Solimena et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Leeetal1998">Lee et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Solimena1998">Solimena 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>). The association of ICA512 with Î²IV spectrin is consistent with previous studies suggesting that ICA512 interacts with the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ortetal2000">Ort et al. 2000</xref>). Our data indicate that Î²IV spectrin is most abundant in brain and pancreatic islet cells and undergoes extensive alternative splicing. In brain, Î²IV spectrin is colocalized with ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270-kD at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier of myelinated neurons, the axonal compartments responsible for the generation and regeneration of action potentials. Thus, we propose that Î²IV spectrin, in concert with ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270, is required for the anchoring of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and cell adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton and may play an important role in the physiology of nerve conduction.</p>

        <title>Antibodies</title>
        <p>Î²IV spectrin antisera were raised against two synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 2237â2256 (specific domain antiserum, SD) and 2542â2559 (COOH-terminal domain antiserum, CT) of human Î²IV spectrin, respectively. Both peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through an added cysteine at their NH<sub>2</sub> terminus and were injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera. Both antisera were affinity purified on their corresponding peptides that had been covalently linked to ECH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions of the antisera were eluted with 0.2 M glycine (pH 3.0), collected and dialyzed with Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The specificity of these antisera and affinity purified antibodies was tested by Western blot on Triton X-100 extracts from COS cells expressing a partial fragment of Î²IV spectrin (residues 2068â2559), termed B8.</p>
        <p>The following antibodies were from commercial sources: rabbit antiâLexA antiserum and mouse antiâV5 antibody (Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal antibody against ankyrin G 480/270-kD (Zymed Laboratories), mouse monoclonal antibody against glucagon (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal antibody against myelin basic protein (Sternberger Monoclonal Antibodies), antiârabbit and antiâmouse goat IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc.). A mouse monoclonal antibody against hemagglutinin (HA) was a kind gift of R. Collins (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Affinity-purified antibodies against the cytoplasmic or the ectodomain of ICA512 have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Solimenaetal1996">Solimena et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>Two-Hybrid Screening in Yeast</title>
        <p>A yeast two-hybrid screening was executed according to the protocol of <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Vojteketal1993">Vojtek et al. 1993</xref>. Briefly, the cDNAs encoding the cytoplasmic domains of human ICA512 (amino acids 601â979, ICA512cyt), human PHOGRIN (amino acids 640â1015, PHOGRINcyt) and ICA512 mutant allele (ICA512cyt AD/DA) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pLexA vector to create fusion proteins with the LexA DNA binding domain. The ICA512cyt AD/DA mutant was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis on human ICA512 in pRC/RSV (Invitrogen) with the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions (A877D, 5â² primer: CCTCAGCTGGCCGGACGAGGGCACACCGG, 3â² primer: CCGGTGTGCCCTCGTCCGGCCAGCTGAGG; D911A, 5â² primer: CGTGCACTGCTCGGCCGGTGCGGGGAG; 3â² primer: CTCCCCGCACCGGCCGAGCAGTGCAC). The cytoplasmic domain of human PHOGRIN was amplified by PCR from a human adult brain cDNA library in pACT2 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Automated sequencing of all constructs was carried out by the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>pLexA-ICA512cyt, pLexA-ICA512cyt AD/DA, and pLexA-PHOGRINcyt were independently transformed into the yeast strain L40 [partial genotype MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::(lexAop)-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)-lacZ GAL4] and AMR70 [partial genotype: MATÎ± his3 lys2 trp1 leu2 URA3::(lexAop)-lacZ GAL4]. Expression of the LexA-fusion proteins (baits) in yeast cells was verified by Western blotting using the anti-LexA antiserum (1:1,000). L40 cells expressing pLexA-ICA512cyt were cotransformed with 500 Î¼g of a human adult brain cDNA library in pACT2 (Clontech) that included an in-frame HA tag (Clontech). Double transformants were selected for His<sup>+</sup> and LacZ<sup>+</sup> phenotypes. After purging of the bait plasmid, L40 His<sup>+</sup> LacZ<sup>+</sup> cells were mated separately with AMR70 cells transformed with the following baits: LexA-ICA512cyt, LexA-ICA512cyt AD/DA, LexA-PHOGRINcyt, LexA-lamin, and LexA-MSS4. Since lamin and MSS4 are proteins unrelated to ICA512, they were not expected to share interactors with ICA512. Accordingly, only those pACT2 plasmids that reconstituted His<sup>+</sup> auxotrophy with LexA-ICA512 cyt, but not LexA-lamin or LexA-MSS4, in the mating assay were isolated and their cDNA inserts characterized by sequence analysis. The stringency conditions of the mating assay were increased by adding 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) (Sigma-Aldrich) to the plate media at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mM. To assess expression of bait and prey proteins in the mating assay, diploid cells were lysed by incubation for 10 min in 0.2 N NaOH/0.5% Î²-mercaptoethanol on ice. Lysates were incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice, and then spun for 10 min at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4Â°C. After precipitation in 100% acetone, the proteins were resuspended in 2% SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc.) to a final concentration of 200â400 Î¼g/OD. Protein concentration in tissue extracts was determined using the BCA assay procedure (Pierce Chemical Co.). 100 Î¼g protein from each lysate was run on 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-HA (1:10) and anti-LexA (1:1,000) antibodies followed by <sup>125</sup>I-Protein A (10<sup>5</sup> cpm/ml) and autoradiography.</p>

        <p>Cloning of the full length Î²IV spectrin cDNA from adult human brain was performed using standard molecular procedures (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sambrooketal1989">Sambrook et al. 1989</xref>). Briefly, a 325-bp fragment (6381â6705 bp in Î²IV spectrin) within the partial clone isolated in the two-hybrid screening was amplified by PCR (5â² primer: AGCCGGGAGCTGGGCAGCAGCGTG and 3â² primer: GGCGCACATACCCCACCCGAGTCC) and labeled with [Î±-<sup>32</sup>P-dCTP] (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Random Prime Labeling Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This probe was used to screen 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> independent phage clones of a Î»gt11 human brain cDNA library (Clontech) on nitrocellulose filters. Three independent phages were isolated whose sequences partially overlapped that of the original clone. Six additional screenings, each of 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> phages from a Î»gt10 human cerebellum cDNA library (Clontech), yielded 20 independent phages. Contig alignment of their inserts led to the assembly of 7,779-bp cDNA. The remaining 1,010 bp at the 5â² end Î²IV spectrin were cloned by PCR on a human brain Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) according to the manufacturer protocol using the following reverse primer: 5â²-CTCCCGAGGCACAAAGAGGCGACG.</p>
        <p>A 444-bp cDNA fragment of Î²IV spectrin was amplified by PCR from mouse pancreatic islet cDNA (gift of Dr. R.

        <p>Approximately 2.5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> purified human pancreatic islets were sonicated on ice in 200 Î¼l homogenization buffer (HB; 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM benzamidine, 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A, 1 Î¼g/ml antipain). The islet lysates were then solubilized in 2% SDS sample buffer to a final protein concentration of â¼2.5 mg/ml. SDS insoluble material was removed by centrifugation.</p>
        <p>Brain tissues were collected from adult rats, 15- (E15) and 19- (E19) d-old rat embryos and 1- (P1) and 10- (P10) d-old newborn rats. Tissues were homogenized on ice in HB (1:10 wt/vol). Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and solubilized in 2% SDS sample buffer to a final concentration of â¼1.2 mg/ml. PNS proteins (40 Î¼g/lane) were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Î²IV-SD (1:500) or Î²IV-CT (1:500) antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat antiârabbit IgG (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As controls, PNS proteins from adult rat brain were blotted with the preimmune rabbit sera as well as with Î²IV spectrin antibodies that had been preincubated with 100 Î¼g of the corresponding antigenic peptide.</p>
        <p>High-speed pellet (HSP) and high-speed supernatant (HSS) from PNS of adult rat brain were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4Â°C.

        <title>The COOH-terminal Region of a Novel Î² Spectrin Binds the Cytoplasmic Domain of ICA512</title>
        <p>ICA512 belongs to the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family, but does not display phosphatase activity towards conventional PTP substrates, because its cytoplasmic PTP homology domain differs in two critical residues from that of active PTPs. Specifically, in ICA512, the catalytic aspartate of conventional PTPs is replaced by an alanine (A877, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A), while an aspartate (D911) rather than the obligatory alanine is present at position +2 from the catalytic cysteine of active PTPs. The replacement of A877 and D911 with aspartate and alanine, respectively, is sufficient to confer PTP activity to the corresponding ICA512 mutant (ICA512 AD/DA) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Magistrellietal1996">Magistrelli et al. 1996</xref>). To gain insight into ICA512's function, we searched for proteins interacting with its cytoplasmic domain by performing a two-hybrid screening in yeast.</p>
        <p>L40 yeast cells were cotransformed with LexA-ICA512cyt fused to the DNA binding protein LexA and a human brain cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain in pACT2 as a source for preys. Screening of 10<sup>7</sup> L40 transformants led to the isolation of â¼540 colonies positive for the expression of both the reporter genes HIS3 and Î²-galactosidase. One of the preys that overcame histidine auxotrophy when expressed with LexA-ICA512cyt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B) was a novel peptide of 493 amino acids whose last 149 residues were &gt;40% similar to the COOH-terminal region of various Î² spectrins. This polypeptide, termed B8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A), also bound to a PTP active mutant of ICA512cyt (ICA512cyt AD/DA) and to the cytoplasmic domain of the ICA512-related protein, PHOGRIN (PHOGRINcyt) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WasmeierandHutton1996">Wasmeier and Hutton 1996</xref>). B8, on the other hand, did not interact with the unrelated control baits lamin and MSS4. When the two-hybrid assay was performed in more stringent conditions (i.e., in the presence of the HIS3 inhibitor 3-AT), B8 still associated with ICA512cyt, but not with ICA512cyt AD/DA or PHOGRINcyt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> C). Notably, cells expressed comparable amounts of B8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> E), but less ICA512cyt than ICA512cyt AD/DA or PHOGRINcyt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> D). These data indicated that the viability of yeast cells expressing ICA512cyt and B8 in the presence of 3-AT was not accounted for by a higher expression of the bait and suggests that ICA512cyt has a higher affinity for B8 than ICA512cyt AD/DA or PHOGRINcyt. Thus, the replacement of the two residues that prevent ICA512 from acting as a conventional PTP was sufficient to weaken its interaction with B8.</p>
        <p>The ability of ICA512 to bind B8 was further investigated by coimmunoprecipitations from extracts of COS cells cotransfected with the cDNAs encoding for full-length ICA512 and HA-tagged B8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> F). In these cells, pro-ICA512 accumulates as a triplet of â¼110 kD, while the ICA512 transmembrane fragment (ICA512 TMF) generated by the cleavage of the protein's ectodomain represents a minor species (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>). Immunoprecipitation with the Î²IV-SD antibody raised against a peptide within B8 followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antiâHA antibody allowed the detection of a single protein of â¼60 kD in transfected COS cells, but not in mock-transfected COS cells. The size of this protein corresponds to the predicted size of HA-tagged B8. The same protein was also immunoprecipitated from cotransfected COS cells using a monoclonal antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of ICA512. These data confirmed the interaction between the two proteins revealed by the two-hybrid assay.</p>

        <title>Cloning of Human Î²IV Spectrin</title>
        <p>Screenings of human brain cDNA libraries by filter hybridization and PCR allowed the contig assembly of an 8,789-bp cDNA, including a 5â²-untranslated region of 179 bp and a 3â²-untranslated region of 933 bp with a polyadenylation signal and a polyA tail (Genbank No. AF082075) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). By fluorescence in situ hybridization, this new gene, termed Î²IV spectrin, was localized on human chromosome 19q13.13 and on the synthenic region on mouse chromosome 7b2 (not shown). Through BLAST analysis, we matched the cDNA of Î²IV spectrin to a genomic sequence from human chromosome 19 in the High Throughput Genomic Sequence database (Genbank No. AC021625). Comparison of this genomic sequence, which corresponds to a first draft of 34 unordered pieces, with the cDNA of Î²IV spectrin revealed that the latter is generated from 36 exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). All exons, except for exon 17, are found in this genomic sequence and are flanked by canonical donor/acceptor intron sites. This genomic region still contains many gaps of unknown length, which may account for the apparent absence of the exon 17 (bp's 3819â4021) found in the cDNA sequences.</p>
        <p>A high degree of similarity was found between portions of the Î²IV spectrin cDNA and another genomic sequence of 100 unordered pieces from chromosome 16 (Genbank No. AC009140.4). This genomic draft contains 18 sequences that are bounded by donor/acceptor intron sites and are very conserved with 18 exons of Î²IV spectrin (exons 1, 8â11, 13, 15â17, 19, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 34â36) (not shown). This genomic draft, however, did not appear to include the remaining exons of Î²IV spectrin. Our cDNA contig for Î²IV spectrin and the genomic sequence on chromosome 19 only differed in three base pairs, possibly because of polymorphism or sequencing artifacts. In contrast, six of the Î²IV spectrin-related exons on chromosome 16 contained many base substitutions, deletions, or insertions compared with the related exons in Î²IV spectrin. These data confirmed that our cDNA contig was entirely derived from the Î²IV spectrin gene on chromosome 19. They also suggested, on the other hand, that a gene closely related to Î²IV spectrin resides on chromosome 16. Cloning and characterization of this gene, provisionally termed Î²VI spectrin, is in progress.</p>
        <p>The conceptual translation of the Î²IV spectrin cDNA corresponds to a protein of 2,559 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of â¼288 kD and an isoelectric point of â¼5.9. The putative starting methionine of Î²IV spectrin is not in the context of a Kozak sequence, but it is preceded in the 5â²-untranslated region by an in-frame stop codon. The domain structure of Î²IV spectrin closely resembles that of other Î² spectrins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Huetal1992">Hu et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Winkelmannetal1990a">Winkelmann et al. 1990a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Winkelmannetal1990b">Winkelmann et al. 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maetal1993">Ma et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oharaetal1998">Ohara et al. 1998</xref>), with the exception of Î²V spectrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StabachandMorrow2000">Stabach and Morrow 2000</xref>). It includes two calponin homology domains, followed by 16 complete spectrin repeats, a partial spectrin repeat (repeat 17), and a PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. d</xref>). Calponin homology domains are found at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of many proteins, including Î² spectrins, and mediate the interaction with actin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Karinchetal1990">Karinch et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Frappieretal1992">Frappier et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Banuelosetal1998">Banuelos et al. 1998</xref>). Each of the first 16 spectrin repeats of Î²IV spectrin follows the criteria defined for the repeat 14 of Drosophila Î² spectrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yanetal1993">Yan et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pascualetal1997">Pascual et al. 1997</xref>), and thus is predicted to assemble into three helices termed A, B, and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D). The repeat 15 of Î²IV spectrin, which in other Î² spectrins binds ankyrins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kennedyetal1991">Kennedy et al. 1991</xref>), is 43.8, 46.7, and 31.4% identical to the corresponding repeats of Î²I, Î²II, and Î²III spectrin, respectively. Unlike typical spectrin repeats, but similar to repeat 15 of other Î² spectrins, it does not include a tryptophan at position 17 in the helix A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D). As in all other Î² spectrins, the repeat 17 of Î²IV spectrin lacks the segment corresponding to the C helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D). This is consistent with the possibility that the A and B helices of repeat 17 of Î²IV spectrin form a three-helix bundle with the lone C helix at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of an Î± spectrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kennedyetal1994">Kennedy et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dengetal1995">Deng et al. 1995</xref>). The putative loop between the predicted helices A and B of repeat 4 contains a stretch of 15 residues that is not found in other Î² spectrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D). This insert is rich in glycines, consistent with a role as a helix breaker.</p>
        <p>The region of 294 residues between the repeat 17 and the PH domain is specific for Î²IV spectrin as it shows no similarity with regions present in other Î² spectrins. This domain is rich in prolines (15% of the residues), is very basic (pI: 10.5), and contains a motif of five residues (ERQES) that is repeated four times within a stretch of 90 residues (residues 2220â2309, henceforth defined as ERQES domain). An identical motif was not found in any other protein in public databases. The ERQES domain is highly charged (55.5% charged residues) because of its high content in glutamate (23.3%), glutamine (8.8%), and arginine (26.6%). The presence of only two aspartates (2.2%) and the absence of asparagines and lysines, however, indicates that there is a strong bias toward specific residues in this region. The equal spacing of 13 residues between the ERQES repeats 1â3 further suggests the repetitive nature of this domain. Interestingly, the sequence corresponding to the third ERQES repeat and the four following residues (ERQESAEHE) is 77% identical to the sequence ERLEKAEHE within spectrin repeats 1 of human Î²II (residues 397â405) and Î²III (residues 400â408) spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> E). The motif ERLEKAEHE is part of a domain that associates Î²II spectrin with membranes, presumably via proteinâprotein interaction (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DavisandBennett1994">Davis and Bennett 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lombardoetal1994">Lombardo et al. 1994</xref>). Prediction of the secondary structure of Î²IV spectrin suggests that the ERQES domain is exposed at the protein's surface (not shown) and, as such, might also engage in proteinâprotein interaction.</p>
        <p>Î²IV spectrin contains numerous putative SH3 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> D). Two of these proline-rich motifs (residues 1859â1864 and 2405â2411) are adjacent to putative membrane association domains. Specifically, the first of these motifs precedes the putative B helix in repeat 15, which may act as an ankyrin-binding site, while the second motif precedes the PH domain. The PH domain of Î²IV spectrin is very conserved with the corresponding domains in Î²IÎ£2, Î²II, and Î²III spectrins and is therefore likely to bind phosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hyvonenetal1995">Hyvonen et al. 1995</xref>).</p>

        <title>Î²IV Spectrin Is Alternatively Spliced</title>
        <p>Our data indicated that Î²IV spectrin undergoes alternative splicing. Specifically, one cDNA clone of â¼2.4 kb contained an insert of 88 bp between exon 17 and 18, which was not present in overlapping cDNA clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> F). This insert was also found in the Î²IV spectrin gene, where it is flanked by canonic donor and acceptor splice sites at its 5â² and 3â² ends. Insertion of this exon, termed 17B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. f</xref>), introduces a stop codon in the open reading frame of Î²IV spectrin, thereby causing its termination in spectrin repeat 9. The conceptual translation of this cDNA corresponds to a polypeptide of 1,302 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of â¼145 kD. In a different reading frame, on the other hand, exon 17B encodes for a methionine that is preceded by a stop codon in exon 17 and is in frame with the remaining COOH-terminal portion of Î²IV spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. f</xref>). Recognition of this methionine as a novel initiation site for translation would generate an additional polypeptide of 1,307 amino acids with an expected molecular weight of â¼149 kD. It is conceivable that the inclusion of exon 17B gives rise to a bicistronic mRNA, whose translation produces two different Î²IV spectrin proteins. Based on the established nomenclature for spectrins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WinkelmannandForget1993">Winkelmann and Forget 1993</xref>), the originally cloned Î²IV spectrin has been termed Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, and hence we will refer to these two variants as Î²IVÎ£2 and Î²IVÎ£3 spectrin (Genbank No. AY004226).</p>
        <p>In an additional clone, an insert of 315 bp (exon 30B) followed exon 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. f</xref>). This insert encodes 42 amino acids and a stop codon, contains a polyadenylation site, and was found in the Î²IV spectrin gene, where it is flanked by canonic 5â² and 3â² splice sites. The isoform including this exon corresponds to a polypeptide of 2,149 amino acids (expected molecular weight: â¼242 kD), which contains the calponin-homology domain and all 17 spectrin repeats, but lacks the specific domain and the PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> F). This isoform has been termed Î²IVÎ£4 spectrin (Genbank No. AY004227). A search in publicly available databases revealed the presence of a partial cDNA clone (Genbank No. AL133093) of 1,444 bp from human testis that is 100% identical to Î²IV spectrin in the region corresponding to nucleotides 4850â6082, but differs from it in the remaining 211 bp at the 3â² end. This divergent sequence encodes 30 residues, followed by a stop codon and a polyA stretch of 109 bp. On chromosome 19, however, the 102 bp preceding the polyA stretch are found immediately after exon 27 of Î²IV spectrin, where they are not preceded by a canonic 5â² splice site. Furthermore, this sequence does not contain a polyadenylation signal. Thus, this clone includes a part of the intron following exon 27.</p>

        <title>Expression of Î²IV Spectrin mRNAs</title>
        <p>The expression of Î²IV spectrin was analyzed by Northern blotting on polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA from various human tissues using a 324 bp probe within the region encoding for the specific domain common to Î²IVÎ£1 and Î²IVÎ£3 spectrin. This probe hybridized with three transcripts of â¼9.0, â¼5.1, and â¼3.1 kb, all of which were predominantly expressed in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A). The relationship of these transcripts with Î²IV spectrin was suggested by their detection with a distinct probe derived from the 3â² untranslated region of Î²IV spectrin (not shown). A mRNA of â¼9.0 kb is in good agreement with the size of the Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin cDNA. Both the â¼9.0 and the â¼5.1 kb transcripts were also detected in various regions of the rat brain, including cerebellum, thalamus, midbrain, medulla, frontal, and posterior cortex and hippocampus (data not shown). Weaker signals for the â¼9.0-kb transcript were detected in human skeletal muscle and kidney, while the â¼5.1-kb transcript was barely detectable in pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A). Since pancreatic islets account for only â¼3% of the pancreas weight, we directly assessed the expression of Î²IV spectrin on polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA isolated from purified human pancreatic islets. In pancreatic islets, as in brain, the Î²IV spectrin probe hybridized with three transcripts of â¼8.5, â¼4.2, and â¼2.3 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C). The expression of Î²IV spectrin in pancreatic islets was confirmed by the amplification by PCR from mouse islets of a product whose cDNA (Genbank No. AF203696) was 98% identical to nucleotides 4223â4665 of human Î²IV spectrin.</p>

        <title>Î²IV Spectrin Proteins in Brain and Pancreatic Islets</title>
        <p>We further analyzed by Western blotting the expression of Î²IV spectrin in brain and pancreatic islets, tissues that are enriched in ICA512. To this end, we used two affinity-purified antibodies directed against peptides encoding amino acids 2237â2256 in the specific domain (Î²IV-SD) and 2542-2559 at the COOH terminus (Î²IV-CT) of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. These peptides were chosen on the basis of their predicted antigenicity and because they share no significant homology with sequences in other Î± and Î² spectrins. Both antibodies reacted by Western blotting with the Î²IV spectrin fragment B8 transiently expressed in COS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> F, and not shown). The Î²IV-CT antibody recognized two proteins of â¼250 and 160 kD in rat brain PNS and total extracts of purified human islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A), while it detected an additional protein of â¼140 kD in rat brain only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. B</xref>). Preincubation of the Î²IV-CT antibody with the antigenic peptide blocked its binding to these three proteins, supporting their relationship with Î²IV spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Taking into account the aberrant electrophoretic mobility displayed by all known spectrins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zagonetal1984">Zagon et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oharaetal1998">Ohara et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stankewichetal1998">Stankewich et al. 1998</xref>), the â¼250-kD protein might correspond to Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, which has a predicted molecular weight of â¼288 kD. The identity of the â¼160- and â¼140-kD proteins remains to be established. Accordingly, we will provisionally refer to these proteins as Î²IV spectrin 160 and 140. The Î²IV-SD antibody produced a similar immunoblot pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B), consistent with the possibility that the â¼250-, â¼160-, and â¼140-kD proteins originate from the Î²IV spectrin gene. The Î²IV-SD antibody, however, recognized much less prominently Î²IV spectrin 160 in brain, and even less in islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). The peptide used to raise the Î²IV-SD antibody is located within the ERQES domain and contains several optimal consensus sites for serine phosphorylation. We asked therefore whether the limited reactivity of the Î²IV-SD antibody toward Î²IV spectrin 160 could result from the phosphorylation of its epitope within this protein. Evidence that treatment of rat brain PNS with alkaline phosphatase dramatically enhanced the reactivity of the Î²IV-SD antibody toward Î²IV spectrin 160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B) corroborated this hypothesis. The labeling of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin and Î²IV spectrin 140, on the other hand, was unaffected. As expected, the reactivity of the Î²IV-SD antibody was completely blocked by the incubation with its immunogenic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B).</p>

        <title>Î²IV Spectrins Have Different Biochemical Properties</title>
        <p>Upon subcellular fractionation of brain homogenates, both Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin and Î²IV spectrin 140 were recovered in the HSP, while Î²IV spectrin 160 was distributed between the HSS and the HSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). Virtually all Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin partitioned in the HSP detergent-insoluble material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. B</xref>). Î²IV spectrin 160 and 140, on the other hand, were found in both the HSP detergent soluble and insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. B</xref>). Notably, the pools of Î²IV spectrin 160 in the HSS and HSP detergent soluble fraction did not react with the Î²IV-SD antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B), unless these fractions were preincubated with alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). These data suggest that phosphorylation of the ERQES domain is associated with the solubilization of Î²IV spectrin 160 and its dissociation from membranes. Treatment of the PNS with alkaline phosphatase did not affect the subcellular distribution of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, but allowed an increased recovery of Î²IV spectrin 140 in the HSP-soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D). This treatment also resulted in a shift of most of Î²IV spectrin 160 from the HSP to the HSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> D). Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of Î²IV spectrins with cytoskeletal and/or membrane proteins is modulated by phosphorylation.</p>

        <title>Localization of Î²IV Spectrin in Pancreatic Islets</title>
        <p>To rule out the possibility that our anti-Î²IV spectrin antibodies would recognize other Î² spectrins by immunocytochemistry, both antibodies were employed for the staining of CHO cells transiently transfected with V5-tagged COOH-terminal domains of Î²IÎ£2 (amino acids 2117â2328), Î²IIÎ£1 (2140â2365), Î²III (amino acids 2154â2390), or Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin (2222â2559). All four spectrin fragments were recognized by the anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody and partitioned, albeit to a different extent, between the cytosol and the nucleus of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A). Conversely, the Î²IV-CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A) and Î²IV-SD (not shown) antibodies only stained CHO cells expressing the COOH-terminal region of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin.</p>
        <p>The tissue and intracellular distribution of Î²IV spectrin was then investigated by confocal microscopy using the Î²IV-CT antibody. In rat pancreas, Î²IV spectrin immunoreactivity was restricted to pancreatic islets. Like ICA512, Î²IV spectrin was detected in both the insulin-secreting Î² cells as well as in the surrounding Î± cells that secrete glucagon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, AâF). In Î² cells, there was a fine punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm (not shown). A more intense cytoplasmic labeling was observed in the Î± cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, AâF), often in correspondence of rod-like perinuclear structures of several micrometers in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> G). These organelles did not significantly overlap with secretory granules, as shown by double labeling for glucagon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> H). The specificity of this staining was suggested by its complete disappearance when the Î²IV-CT antibody was preincubated with its antigenic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>. I). Î² Spectrins are known to associate with various intracellular compartments, including the Golgi complex, endosomes, and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Devarajanetal1997">Devarajan et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hoocketal1997">Hoock et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BeckandNelson1998">Beck and Nelson 1998</xref>). Thus, we compared the distribution of Î²IV spectrin with that of these various organelles in Î± cells. There was no significant colocalization of Î²IV spectrin with Î³-adaptin and TGN38, two markers of the trans-Golgi network, with the endosomal markers transferrin receptor and early endosomal antigen-1 or with the lysosome marker lgp120 (not shown). Thus, the identity of the Î²IV spectrin-immunoreactive structures in pancreatic islets remains to be established.</p>

        <title>Î²IV Spectrin Is Present at the Axon Initial Segments and Nodes of Ranvier in the Central and Peripheral Nervous System</title>
        <p>In brain, expression of Î²IV spectrin was first examined by in situ hybridization on adult rat brain sections using an antisense riboprobe corresponding to the partial Î²IV spectrin clone B8. The highest levels of expression were detected in the cell bodies of large myelinated neurons, such as pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). No signal was detected in nonneuronal cells, including glial and endothelial cells. Likewise, no signal was detected on sections incubated with the corresponding control sense riboprobe (not shown).</p>
        <p>By immunocytochemistry on rat brain sections, the Î²IV-CT antibody produced a strong labeling of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, and data not shown). This immunolabeling was most prominent in the axon initial segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. G</xref>) and nodes of Ranvier (D and H), while no staining was observed in the myelinated internodal segments, as visualized with an antibody against myelin basic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. C</xref>). A fine granular staining reminiscent of the labeling observed in pancreatic islets was appreciable in the perikarya of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> A). No immunoreactivity was detected in dendrites, axon terminals, glial cells, or blood vessels. The specificity of this labeling was supported by the absence of staining in sections incubated with the corresponding rabbit preimmune serum (not shown) and by the ability of the antigenic peptide to compete with endogenous Î²IV spectrin for the binding of the Î²IV-CT antibody (not shown). Immunocytochemistry on dissociated myelinated fibers from the rat sciatic nerve showed that, like in the central nervous system, Î²IV spectrin is concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> I).</p>
        <p>Previous studies demonstrated that, in neurons, the ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270-kD isoform (also known as ankyrin3) is selectively concentrated at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kordelietal1990">Kordeli et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kordelietal1995">Kordeli et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Petersetal1995">Peters et al. 1995</xref>). Here, it is involved in the clustering of the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels that generate the saltatory action potentials (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhouetal1998">Zhou et al. 1998</xref>). Double immunostaining for Î²IV spectrin and ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270 showed a perfect overlap of the two proteins at initial segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, DâF) and central (H) and peripheral (I) nodes of Ranvier. These data raise the possibility that Î²IV spectrin and ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270 bind each other in the brain as well as the peripheral nervous system.</p>

        <title>The Î²IV Spectrin Isoform Localized at the Axon Initial Segments Is Î²IVÎ£1 Spectrin</title>
        <p>Next, we investigated the expression of Î²IV spectrin during brain development. By Western blotting, Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin was first detected at embryonic day 19 and its expression level progressively increased until adult age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). Î²IV spectrin 140 appeared only after birth and, similar to Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, it was maximally expressed in the adult. Î²IV spectrin 160, instead, was already present at embryonic day 10, and its level appeared constant throughout development. These data further suggested that Î²IV spectrin 160 is not a proteolytic fragment of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin.</p>
        <p>The expression of Î²IV spectrin during brain development was also investigated by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). A weak immunoreactivity for Î²IV spectrin was detectable in the neurons of the developing hippocampus at embryonic day 15, but there was no staining reminiscent of axon initial segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> A). By embryonic day 19, however, the initial segments were clearly labeled both in the cortex and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> B). Many more initial segments positive for Î²IV spectrin were present by postnatal day 10 in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> C, and data not shown), with maximum immunoreactivity in the adult brain (D). Taken together, these data suggested that Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin is the specific isoform localized at axon initial segments.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have identified a novel spectrin gene in human, termed Î²IV spectrin, that is localized on chromosome 19q13.13. The longest product of this gene, termed Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, includes 36 exons and corresponds to a protein of 2,559 amino acids, whose domain structure closely resembles that of other Î² spectrins (for review, see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BennettandGilligan1993">Bennett and Gilligan 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Goodmanetal1995">Goodman et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="VielandBranton1996">Viel and Branton 1996</xref>). Specifically, Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin contains two calponin-homology domains at its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus and may therefore associate with F-actin and protein 4.1. Similar to other Î² spectrins, it may also interact with ankyrin through spectrin repeat 15 and with an Î± spectrin via its partial spectrin repeat 17, whereas its COOH-terminal PH domain could bind phospholipids. Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin also contains a specific domain between its partial spectrin repeat 17 and the PH domain. This very basic domain includes several putative SH3 binding sites and a unique ERQES domain in which there is a sequence of significant similarity with a motif within the membrane association domain of Î²II and Î²III spectrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DavisandBennett1994">Davis and Bennett 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lombardoetal1994">Lombardo et al. 1994</xref>). Thus, this specific domain could mediate the interaction of Î²IVÎ£1 with other proteins.</p>
      <p>The apparent size of the Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin transcript was â¼9.0 kb in brain and â¼8.5 kb in pancreatic islets. In both tissues, however, Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin was detected as a protein of 250 kD. The small discrepancy in the size of the transcripts may result therefore from tissue-specific differences in the untranslated region or from variations in the laboratory procedures, as the blot of human islets was prepared in our laboratory, while the blot including the brain sample was acquired from a commercial source.</p>
      <p>Similar to other Î² spectrins, the Î²IV spectrin gene undergoes alternative splicing. Specifically, we have identified three Î²IV spectrin splice variants in addition to Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. Two of these isoforms, Î²IVÎ£2 and Î²IVÎ£3 spectrin, originate from one messenger that contains an additional exon (exon 17B) between exons 17 and 18 of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. The predicted amino acid sequences of Î²IVÎ£2 and Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin are identical up to the middle of the C helix in repeat 9. The sequence corresponding to the last 23 residues of Î²IVÎ£2 spectrin is unique and does not follow the consensus for spectrin repeats, as it is very rich in prolines (6/23 amino acids). Accordingly, the last repeat of Î²IVÎ£2 spectrin (repeat 9) is not complete, and contains only helices A and B. This observation raises the intriguing possibility that this partial repeat, similar to the partial repeat 17 of other Î² spectrins, including Î²IV spectrin, interacts with the lone C helix at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of an Î± spectrin. An alternative possibility is that this partial repeat interacts in a head-to-tail fashion with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of Î²IVÎ£3 spectrin. Specifically, the first 19 amino acids of Î²IVÎ£3 encoded by exon 17 cannot be part of an Î± helix because they include six prolines. The next 10 amino acids together with the following 15 residues encoded by exon 18, however, are predicted to form a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lupasetal1991">Lupas et al. 1991</xref>). Similar to the partial NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal repeat of Î± spectrin, this domain contains an arginine at position 8, a residue that is thought to interact with residues 7 and 29 in helices A and B, respectively (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yanetal1993">Yan et al. 1993</xref>). This domain of Î²IVÎ£3 spectrin could therefore be equivalent to the single C helix at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of an Î± spectrin and pair with the predicted A and B helices at the COOH terminus of Î²IVÎ£2 spectrin. The fourth Î²IV spectrin isoform, termed Î²IVÎ£4 spectrin, extends only 42 residues beyond the partial repeat 17, because of the insertion of an additional exon (exon 30B) that contains an in-frame stop codon. Thus, Î²IVÎ£4 spectrin, similar to Î²IÎ£1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Winkelmannetal1990b">Winkelmann et al. 1990b</xref>) and Î²IIÎ£2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hayesetal2000">Hayes et al. 2000</xref>) spectrin, does not include a PH domain.</p>
      <p>Both the Î²IV-SD and Î²IV-CT antibodies are directed against peptides that are not found in Î²IVÎ£2 and Î²IVÎ£4 spectrin. Thus, the biochemical properties and localization of these isoforms remain to be determined. Both antibodies, on the other hand, recognize two proteins of 160 and 140 kD. Î²IV spectrin 160 and 140 show significantly different properties than Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. For instance, treatment of the PNS with alkaline phosphatase increased the pool of Î²IV spectrin 160 recovered in the HSS, and enhanced the detergent extractability of Î²IV spectrin 140. Conversely, Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin partitioned in all conditions in the HSP detergent insoluble material. Furthermore, Î²IV spectrin 140 was detected in brain, but not in islets. Finally, the temporal expression of Î²IV spectrins 160 and 140 during brain development was different from that of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. These data suggest that Î²IV spectrin 160 and 140 are not proteolytic fragments of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin.</p>
      <p>We have shown that the reactivity of the Î²IV-SD antibody with Î²IV spectrin 160 is significantly enhanced upon alkaline phosphatase treatment. Specifically, upon subcellular fractionation, this antibody reacts with the pool of Î²IV spectrin 160 recovered in the HSP detergent-insoluble material, but not with the pool present in the HSS and HSP detergent-soluble material, unless these fractions are incubated with alkaline phosphatase before immunoblotting. Since the antigenic peptide of the Î²IV-SD antibody contains an optimal consensus sequence for phosphorylation, these data suggest that the antigenic epitope within the ERQES domain is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation at this site affects the association of Î²IV spectrin 160 with membranes. This possibility is consistent with previous studies indicating that an increased phosphorylation of Î² spectrin during mitosis is associated with its redistribution from the detergent-insoluble to the detergent-soluble fraction and its dissociation from membranes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FowlerandAdam1992">Fowler and Adam 1992</xref>).</p>
      <p>Like ICA512, Î²IV spectrin is enriched in pancreatic islets and brain. In the Î± cells, Î²IV spectrin's immunoreactivity is concentrated in the cytosol, most often in perinuclear, rod-like structures. This compartment did not significantly overlap with the Golgi, endosomes, or lysosomes, three organelles along the secretory pathway where Î² spectrins have been found (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BeckandNelson1998">Beck and Nelson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="DeMatteisandMorrow1998">De Matteis and Morrow 1998</xref>). Thus, its identity remains to be determined. In rat brain and teased fibers of the sciatic nerve, Î²IV spectrin is concentrated at the axon initial segments and the nodes of Ranvier. Î²IV spectrin is the first spectrin that is selectively enriched in these specialized domains, in both the central and the peripheral nervous tissue. Î²II spectrin is present both in axons and synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Riedereretal1986">Riederer et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zagonetal1986">Zagon et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Trappetal1989">Trapp et al. 1989</xref>), while Î²IÎ£2 spectrin is found in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Riedereretal1986">Riederer et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zagonetal1986">Zagon et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Malchiodi-Albedietal1993">Malchiodi-Albedi et al. 1993</xref>), and post-synaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Malchiodi-Albedietal1993">Malchiodi-Albedi et al. 1993</xref>). Î²III spectrin is also expressed in brain, where it is enriched in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Oharaetal1998">Ohara et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stankewichetal1998">Stankewich et al. 1998</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest a role for Î² spectrins as potential organizers of different neuronal microdomains.</p>
      <p>The axon initial segments and the nodes of Ranvier share a common molecular organization and may have evolved from a common precursor (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Davisetal1996">Davis et al. 1996</xref>). Both compartments are characterized by an electron-dense cytoskeletal matrix beneath the axolemma (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MatsumotoandRosenbluth1985">Matsumoto and Rosenbluth 1985</xref>) and by a 40-fold enrichment of voltage-gated sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="RitchieandRogart1977">Ritchie and Rogart 1977</xref>), whose opening triggers the generation of action potentials and their conduction from one node to the next. Other proteins enriched at these sites are the cell adhesion molecules neurofascin and NrCAM (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Davisetal1996">Davis et al. 1996</xref>), ankyrin<sub>G</sub> 480/270-kD (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kordelietal1995">Kordeli et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lambertetal1997">Lambert et al. 1997</xref>), and an amphiphysin IIâlike protein (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Butleretal1997">Butler et al. 1997</xref>). The repeat 15 of Î²IV spectrin is similar to the corresponding ankyrin-binding repeat in Î²I and Î²II spectrins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kennedyetal1991">Kennedy et al. 1991</xref>). In view of their colocalization at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, it seems plausible that Î²IV spectrin and ankyrin<sub>G</sub> are associated and together mediate the anchoring of nodal membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
      <p>In the developing rat hippocampus, the immunoreactivity for Î²IV spectrin at the initial segments first appears at embryonic day 19 and progressively increases thereafter. This pattern closely resembles the developmental expression profile of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin in rat brain. A similar correlation may exist between the appearance of Î²IV spectrin 140 at postnatal day 10 and the progressive development of nodes of Ranvier during myelination after birth. The initial segments and the nodes of Ranvier play a similar role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials. Initial segments, in addition, act as barriers that prevent lateral diffusion of membrane proteins and entry of various organelles, including rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and lysosomes into axons, while allowing the progression of others, such as mitochondria and secretory vesicles. Although the molecular foundation of this selective diffusion barrier remains unknown, there is evidence that the actin cytoskeleton is essential in its establishment and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Winckleretal1999">Winckler et al. 1999</xref>). Thus, the localization of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin and Î²IV spectrin 140 at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, respectively, could correlate with the related and yet distinct functions of these axonal compartments. It would be interesting to determine whether a similar different localization occurs in the case of the ankyrin<sub>G</sub> isoforms 480 and 270 kD.</p>
      <p>We have identified Î²IV spectrin as an interactor of the RPTP-like protein ICA512 in a two-hybrid screening in yeast. The binding of ICA512 to the COOH-terminal domain of Î²IV spectrin has been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from transfected fibroblasts. Î²IV spectrin and ICA512 are both enriched in neurons and pancreatic islets, but their intracellular localization is different. This observation, however, does not preclude the possibility that ICA512, at one stage of its intracellular route, interacts with Î²IV spectrin. In steady state conditions, virtually all ICA512 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Leeetal1998">Lee et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>; our unpublished observations) is found on secretory granules (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Solimenaetal1996">Solimena et al. 1996</xref>), while it is not detectable in other compartments associated with the secretory and endocytic pathways. Taking into account the fact that ICA512 has a very short half life (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Leeetal1998">Lee et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>; our unpublished observations), it would be very difficult to detect by immunocytochemistry a transient colocalization of the two proteins in a compartment other than the secretory granules. More sensitive assays for proteinâprotein interaction in vivo, such as coimmunoprecipitation, were precluded by the fact that virtually all Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin and most of Î²IV spectrin 140 and 160 partitioned in the HSP detergent insoluble fraction. We have recently shown that, in insulinoma cells, ICA512 is associated with Î²2 syntrophin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ortetal2000">Ort et al. 2000</xref>). Î²2 syntrophin, in turn, interacts with the spectrin-related protein utrophin. These data, consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hermeletal1999">Hermel et al. 1999</xref>), suggest that ICA512 is associated with the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
      <p>Besides ICA512, the COOH-terminal domain of Î²IV spectrin bound the cytoplasmic domain of the RPTP-like molecule PHOGRIN (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WasmeierandHutton1996">Wasmeier and Hutton 1996</xref>). PHOGRIN (also known as IA-2Î², ICAAR, IAR, PTP-NP, and PTPX) has many properties in common with ICA512. Its cytoplasmic domain is 74% identical to the corresponding region of ICA512, and also contains an aspartate instead of an alanine in its inactive PTP âsignature motif.â Moreover, PHOGRIN is also enriched in the secretory granules of neurons and peptide-secreting endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WasmeierandHutton1996">Wasmeier and Hutton 1996</xref>) and is a major target of autoimmunity in type I diabetes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Luetal1996">Lu et al. 1996</xref>). ICA512 and PHOGRIN are not the only members of the RPTP family that interact with spectrin-related molecules. LAR, an RPTP expressed in numerous cell types including neurons, interacts through its distal, ânon-catalyticâ PTP domain with Trio, a protein that includes numerous spectrin repeats and two PH domains (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Debantetal1996">Debant et al. 1996</xref>). CD45, an RPTP involved in T and B cell signaling, binds Î²II spectrin through its âinactive,â distal domain. Notably, binding of spectrin increases the catalytic activity of its proximal PTP domain (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LokeshwarandBourguignon1992">Lokeshwar and Bourguignon 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Iidaetal1994">Iida et al. 1994</xref>). Like the âinactiveâ PTP domains of ICA512 and PHOGRIN, the distal PTP domain of CD45 includes an aspartate (D) rather than the obligatory alanine (A) at position +2 from the catalytic cysteine of canonic PTP domains. Overall, these data point to spectrin-related proteins as common binding partners of noncatalytic PTP domains of RPTPs.</p>

        <p>(A) Schematic representation of human ICA512. The protein includes 979 amino acids, including a signal peptide (SP), a single transmembrane domain (TMD), and a cytoplasmic domain with an inactive PTP domain. Cleavage at a consensus site for furin-like convertases between amino acids 448 and 449 (arrow) gives rise to an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment and a transmembrane fragment of 60â66 kD that includes the cytoplasmic domain. CHO, glycosylation sites. The residues in the PTP domain of ICA512 that distinguish it from active PTPs are indicated (A877, D911). (BâF) Interaction of the partial clone of Î²IV spectrin, B8, with ICA512cyt. (B and C) Yeast two-hybrid mating assay. L40 cells transformed with the prey plasmid pACTII-B8 were mated with AMR70 cells transformed with bait plasmids pLexA-ICA512cyt, pLexA-ICA512cyt AD/DA, pLexA-PHOGRINcyt, pLexA-lamin, or pLexA-MSS4 and grown on selective media in the absence (B) and presence (C) of 2 mM 3-AT. Cell survival reflects the interaction of the bait with the prey. (D and E) Expression levels of the different baits and B8 in L40-AMR70 mated cells as determined by Western blotting with an antiserum against LexA (D) and HA (E). (F) Coimmunoprecipitation of ICA512 and B8 from cotransfected COS cells. A mouse antibody directed against ICA512cyt or a rabbit antibody directed against the Î²IV spectrin specific domain (Î²IV-SD) were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) from Triton X-100 extracts of nontransfected (NT) and ICA512-B8 cotransfected (T) cells. Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted (WB) with affinity purified antibodies directed against the ectodomain of ICA512, Î²IV-SD, or a mouse antibody directed against HA. The arrows point to the immunoprecipitated ICA512 transmembrane fragment (ICA512 TMF) and B8, while a bracket indicates the position of pro-ICA512.</p>

Additional clones that did not affect the contig have been left out of the alignment. (B) Graphical representation of the genomic organization of Î²IV spectrin. Black boxes represent the 36 exons encoding the full-length Î²IV spectrin. Exons from alternative spliced isoforms are boxed in grey. The length of the intervening sequences is still undetermined. Translation initiation and stop codons of the four alternative spliced variants are indicated. (C) Schematic representation of the domain structure of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. CH, calponin-homology. (D) Primary amino acid sequence of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. The four major domains of Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin, numbered IâIV, are boxed. Domain I: the residues in the calponin-homology domain are in bold. Domain II: the arabic numbers on the left correspond to the spectrin repeats. Within this domain, the predicted A, B, and C helices are boxed separately and their conserved charged and aromatic residues are in bold. The glycine-rich region of 15 residues following the predicted A helix of spectrin repeat 4 is shown as an insert. Domain III: the four ERQES repeats in this specific domain are in bold. Domain IV: the residues in the pleckstrin homology domain are in bold. The proline-rich regions in spectrin repeat 15 and in the specific domain are underlined. (E) An alignment of the third ERQES repeat within the specific domain of Î²IV spectrin with sequences in the spectrin repeat 1 of Î²II and Î²III spectrin. (F) Schematic representation of the different isoforms of Î²IV spectrin. (Top inset) The amino acids at the boundary between exons 17 and 18 in Î²IVÎ£1 spectrin. (Middle inset, bold) The residues encoded by exon 17B in two distinct reading frames. The top sequence is in frame with the preceding exon 17 and includes a stop codon. The bottom sequence begins with a methionine and is in frame with the following exon 18. (Bottom inset) The amino acid sequence of exon 30B at the COOH terminus of Î²IVÎ£4 spectrin.
