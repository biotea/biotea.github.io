      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in the human gene <italic>ALMS1</italic> cause AlstrÃ¶m syndrome, a rare progressive condition characterized by neurosensory degeneration and metabolic defects. ALMS1 protein localizes to the centrosome and has been implicated in the assembly and/or maintenance of primary cilia; however its precise function, distribution within the centrosome, and mechanism of centrosomal recruitment are unknown. The C-terminus of ALMS1 contains a region with similarity to the uncharacterized human protein C10orf90, termed the ALMS motif. Here, we show that a third human protein, the candidate centrosomal protein KIAA1731, contains an ALMS motif and that exogenously expressed KIAA1731 and C10orf90 localize to the centrosome. However, based on deletion analysis of ALMS1, the ALMS motif appears unlikely to be critical for centrosomal targeting. RNAi analyses suggest that C10orf90 and KIAA1731 have roles in primary cilium assembly and centriole formation/stability, respectively. We also show that ALMS1 localizes specifically to the proximal ends of centrioles and basal bodies, where it colocalizes with the centrosome cohesion protein C-Nap1. RNAi analysis reveals markedly diminished centrosomal levels of C-Nap1 and compromised cohesion of parental centrioles in ALMS1-depleted cells. In summary, these data suggest centrosomal functions for C10orf90 and KIAA1731 and new centriole-related functions for ALMS1.</p>

The amino acid sequence of ALMS1 contains several notable features, including a large tandem repeat region and a putative leucine-zipper motif, but it bears no significant similarity to proteins of known function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Collin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The C-terminus of ALMS1 shares sequence similarity with the C-terminus of an uncharacterized human protein, C10orf90, and this region of similarity has been termed the ALMS motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Collin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). ALMS1 has been implicated in the function, formation, and/or maintenance of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Collin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>); however, its precise role is unknown.</p><p>ALMS1 localizes to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Andersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), an organelle comprising a pair of centrioles (termed mature and immature parental centrioles) embedded in a matrix of pericentriolar material (PCM). The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center in most animal cells and also has roles in, for example, regulating cell cycle transitions and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Doxsey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Azimzadeh and Bornens, 2007</xref>). During interphase, the two parental centrioles are thought to be linked by fibers emanating from their proximal ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). C-Nap1 (centrosomal Nek2-associated protein 1) has a role in maintaining this intercentriolar link (and hence the close association of parental centrioles) most likely by acting as the centriolar docking site for rootletin, a major component of the interconnecting fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bahe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Several other proteins have been implicated in structural or regulatory roles relating to centrosome cohesion, including Cep215, CPAP, dynamin 2, and Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bahmanyar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), suggesting the involvement of multiple mechanisms. However quantitative analysis indicates that C-Nap1 and rootletin are particularly important for the maintenance of centrosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007b</xref>).</p><p>C-Nap1 and rootletin dissociate from parental centrioles at the onset of mitosis, concomitant with centrosome separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Fry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Mayor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bahe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). At this stage each centrosome contains one parental and one progeny centriole, centriole duplication having begun during S phase with one procentriole being assembled orthogonally to each parental centriole. The progeny centriole remains attached to its parent until the end of mitosis, at which point the two disengage and concomitantly establish a rootletin-containing link between their proximal ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Azimzadeh and Bornens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Lim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The nature and regulation of the link between parental centrioles is therefore of interest in terms of understanding centrosome separation at the G2-M transition as well as centriole dynamics during interphase. Mechanisms controlling centriole duplication are also of considerable interest because strict control of centriole/centrosome number is required to maintain genome stability in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Tsou and Stearns, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Cunha-Ferreira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In most noncycling vertebrate cells the mature parental centriole attaches to the plasma membrane and becomes a basal body, which acts as the template for assembly of the primary cilium, a sensory cell surface organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Singla and Reiter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Dawe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The cilium, whose basic structure comprises a microtubule-based axoneme enclosed by a sheath of plasma membrane, is assembled and maintained by a microtubule motor protein-driven process termed intraflagellar transport (IFT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Silverman and Leroux, 2009</xref>). Recent data indicate that ALMS1 is required for the proper formation and/or maintenance of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), strongly suggesting that at least some features of AlstrÃ¶m syndrome are due to ciliary dysfunction, as is the case for numerous other human genetic disorders, now collectively termed ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Badano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Marshall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we further investigate the localization and function of ALMS1. We use high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy to determine its subcentrosomal distribution and generate deletion constructs to query which regions of the protein are required for centrosomal-targeting. We use RNA interference (RNAi) in cultured cells to investigate a potential role of ALMS1 suggested by its localization pattern within the centrosome. We also identify an ALMS motif in the candidate centrosomal human protein KIAA1731, analyze the subcellular localization of exogenously expressed KIAA1731 and C10orf90, and use RNAi to investigate the functions of both proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid Construction</title><p>The coding sequence of <italic>ALMS1</italic> was cloned by PCR in pCMV-HA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), providing an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. PCRs were performed on human cDNA or BAC DNA (Expand High Fidelity; Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, United Kingdom). Because of its large size, the coding sequence was initially cloned in sections. <italic>ALMS1</italic> deletion constructs were generated by restriction enzyme digestion of the full-length clone or by PCR cloning into pCMV-HA. The insert of cDNA clone KIAA1731 (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB051518">AB051518</ext-link>; Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) was transferred into pCMV-Myc (BD Biosciences), providing an N-terminal Myc tag. A two-base pair deletion in the open reading frame of the source clone was corrected by replacing a BglII/PmeI fragment with a corresponding fragment amplified by PCR from human cDNA. A MluI/KpnI fragment from IMAGE clone 4823075 (Geneservice, Cambridge, United Kingdom), encoding residues 243â796 of C10orf90 (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAG59968">BAG59968</ext-link>), was inserted into pCMV-Myc. The coding sequence of CP110 was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 5267904 (Geneservice) using restriction site-tagged primers and inserted into pCMV-HA. All constructs were verified by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture and DNA Transfection</title><p>U2OS cells (ECACC, Porton Down, United Kingdom) and HEK 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (reagents from PAA Laboratories, Yeovil, United Kingdom). hTERT-RPE1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F12 with the same supplements and conditions. Cells to be analyzed by immunofluorescence were seeded in Lab-Tek II chamber slides (VWR International, Lutterworth, United Kingdom). Plasmid transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom), and cells were processed for immunofluorescence 24 h later.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAi</title><p>Cells were seeded in chamber slides and transfected with siRNA duplexes (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, United Kingdom) at 50 nM using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were processed for immunofluorescence 96 h after transfection. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) target sequences (5â² to 3â²) were as follows: gtgaacatttcagatttcgaa (ALMS1_06), cagagagtaacttaaccgaag (ALMS1_07), cagaactttatacctgatgaa (ALMS1_7966, oligo 343 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>), caggttgacacctcttcctta (KIAA1731_4333), aacaattacttgaatatcaaa (KIAA1731_03), aatgtgggtcatcatatagta (C10orf90_07), cagcgctggaacccaggttta (C10orf90_08), tcagcttcgtgattctcag (PCM1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>), and ctggaagagcgtctaactgat (C-Nap1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bahe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). AllStars Negative Control siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. Preliminary attempts to rescue the dispersed-PCM1 phenotype observed in cells treated with <italic>ALMS1</italic>-directed siRNAs were hampered by the finding that transient expression of a control protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), could affect the subcellular distribution of PCM1, and we did not pursue this approach further. To monitor depletion of <italic>KIAA1731</italic> and <italic>C10orf90</italic> mRNA, siRNA transfections were performed in six-well plates and total RNA extracted 72 h later using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Poole, Dorset, UK). Oligo-dTâprimed reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen), and the resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR using primers for <italic>C10orf90</italic> (5â²-gagccctggcctgtccgaagac-3â², 5â²-gtcctcccaggtccaggtagtgtg-3â²) and <italic>HPRT</italic> (5â²-cctggcgtcgtgattagtgatgat-3â², 5â²-agcttgcgaccttgacca-3â²), or by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using predesigned Taqman Gene Expression Assays for <italic>KIAA1731</italic> and <italic>HPRT</italic> (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). qPCRs were performed in triplicate using an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems) and relative quantification. For immunoblot analysis, HEK 293 cells were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and subsequently were incubated on ice for 20 min in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C, and SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence Microscopy</title><p>Cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in chilled methanol for 5 min. When required for clear visualization of centrioles and/or ciliary axonemes, U2OS and hTERT-RPE1 cells were incubated on ice for 50 and 20 min, respectively (before fixation) to depolymerize cytoplasmic microtubules. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ALMS1<sup>TRD</sup> (1 Î¼g/ml; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>); mouse anti-HA, mouse anti-Î±-actinin BM-75.2, mouse anti-Î³-tubulin GTU-88, and rabbit anti-Î³-tubulin DQ-19 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich); mouse anti-acetylated Î±-tubulin 6-11B-1 (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich); mouse or rabbit anti-pericentrin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom); mouse anti-c-Myc, anti-Cyclin B1 GNS1, and anti-C-Nap1 (1:500; BD Biosciences); and rabbit anti-PCM1 (1:2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>).

Unlike many other centrosomal proteins, it has limited potential to form coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). To query if a particular motif or domain targets ALMS1 to centrosomes, we generated a panel of HA-tagged deletion constructs for immunolocalization analysis. We transiently expressed constructs in U2OS cells and compared their localizations to that of the centrosome marker Î³-tubulin. Briefly, this suggested that the C-terminal quarter of ALMS1 (represented in construct ÎN-3175) is important for efficient centrosome-targeting, but also implicated an internal region (residues 2261â2602; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, A and B, and data not shown). In general, specific and compact centrosomal localization of transfected ALMS1 constructs was observed at low expression levels, whereas additional diffuse intracellular staining was apparent at higher expression levels.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Deletion analysis identifies two potential centrosome-targeting regions in ALMS1.

Misfolded proteins can accumulate in the vicinity of the centrosome via the aggresome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Kopito, 2000</xref>). However, at low expression levels, construct 2261â2602 (and construct ÎN-3175) colocalized specifically with endogenous ALMS1 (Supplemental Figure S1), suggesting that at least a fraction of this construct assembles at the centrosome similarly to the endogenous protein. The antibody used to detect endogenous ALMS1 recognizes an epitope within the tandem repeat domain, which is not present in either construct 2261â2602 or ÎN-3175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

The ALMS motif appears to be the only region of sequence similarity shared by ALMS1, C10orf90, and KIAA1731. However, based on our deletion analysis of ALMS1, it seems unlikely that this motif acts as a discrete centrosome-targeting domain. C10orf90 and KIAA1731 may have additional structural homologies to ALMS1 that we have been unable to detect at the sequence level or may possess unrelated centrosome-targeting domains.

To examine its distribution in more detail, we analyzed immunostained cells by 4Pi microscopy. To visualize ALMS1 in relation to the immature parental centriole and basal body of ciliated cells, we used acetylated tubulin as a marker for centrioles, basal bodies, and ciliary axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Piperno <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>). This analysis revealed that ALMS1 specifically caps one end of both the immature parental centriole and the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The basal body was unequivocally distinguished from the distal tip of the cilium by additionally labeling cells for Î³-tubulin (analyzed by standard microscopy; data not shown). Because the ciliary axoneme is known to extend from the distal end of the basal body, these data demonstrate that ALMS1 localizes specifically to the proximal end of the basal body. This localization was confirmed by costaining cells for C-Nap1, a marker for the proximal ends of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Fry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), which revealed similar spatial distributions of ALMS1 and C-Nap1, with ALMS1 having a slightly more compact distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Colocalization of ALMS1 and C-Nap1 was also observed in nonciliated cells (analyzed by standard microscopy; Supplemental Figure S4).

Notably, a construct representing the N-terminus of KIAA1731, containing most of the Ddc8-like region of this protein, localized similarly to the full-length construct (Supplemental Figure S5A).

Global sequence alignment of KIAA1731 and Ana1 indicated only 15% amino acid identity (27% similarity) over their entire lengths, but did identify an additional conserved motif in the C-terminal half of each protein (Supplemental Figure S5B and data not shown). Taken together with the N-terminal sequence similarity and our RNAi data, these findings suggest that KIAA1731 is evolutionarily related to Ana1. Tagged C10orf90 also colocalized with centriolar acetylated tubulin, but appeared slightly more diffuse (Supplemental Figure S5A).

Also of note, this phenotype was not due to accumulation of cells in late G2 or M phase, because the majority of ALMS1-depleted cells that had low levels of centriolar C-Nap1 contained just two centrioles (as determined by acetylated tubulin staining) and showed noncondensed DNA staining. Centrosomal immunostaining of the PCM component pericentrin appeared to be slightly diminished in ALMS1-depleted cells (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E and data not shown).</p><p>Next we examined the effect of ALMS1 depletion on cohesion between parental centrioles, using direct depletion of C-Nap1 as a positive control. We chose to analyze cells in G1 to avoid including cells undergoing the physiological process of centrosome separation at the G2-M transition and also because siRNA-mediated depletion of C-Nap1 has been reported to induce G1-S arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Mikule <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We used cyclin B1 as a marker for cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). Cyclin B1 is undetectable in G1, begins to accumulate in the cytoplasm in S phase, and then at the centrosome in late S/early G2 phase, redistributes to the nucleus in prophase and is degraded at the metaphaseâanaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Pines and Hunter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bailly <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). In certain cell lines the immature parental centriole has been reported to be relatively free to move within the cytoplasm in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Piel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>); however, we found that in â¼95% of interphase cyclin B1ânegative hTERT-RPE1 cells the two centrioles were closely associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, AâC). Furthermore, treatment with <italic>C-Nap1</italic>âdirected siRNA led to a dramatic increase in the distance between centrioles in â¼65% of these cells, indicating that these conditions were suitable for analyzing C-Nap1âdependent association of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, B and C). Consistent with reduced levels of C-Nap1 at the centrioles of ALMS1-depleted cells, we noted an increase in the proportion of these cells with centrioles separated by &gt;2 Î¼m (referred to here as split centrosomes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, B and C). The increase was modest compared with that observed in cells treated with <italic>C-Nap1</italic>âdirected siRNA, possibly because of higher residual levels of C-Nap1 at the centrosome in ALMS1-depleted cells (Supplemental Figure S7C).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Depletion of ALMS1 causes centrosome splitting. (A) Cyclin B1 immunostaining was used to determine cell cycle stage, allowing cells entering mitosis to be excluded from analysis. Examples of control cells at the G2-M transition and in G1/early S phase are shown. Centrioles were visualized by costaining with an antibody to acetylated tubulin. Note the separating centrosomes (each containing one parental and one progeny centriole) at G2-M and the close association of the two parental centrioles in G1/early S phase. (B) Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of centrosome splitting in G1/early S phase cells. Cells were treated with the indicated siRNAs and costained with antibodies to cyclin B1 and acetylated tubulin. Interphase cells with undetectable cyclin B1 and with centrioles &gt;2 Î¼m apart were classed as having a split centrosome. (C) Quantification of centrosome splitting, after siRNA treatment, in interphase cells with undetectable cyclin B1. Depletion of the centrosome cohesion protein C-Nap1 was used as a positive control. The mean Â± SE of three independent experiments is shown; in each experiment at least 100 cells were counted for each condition. (D) Model of ALMS1 function in centrosome cohesion, based on the model of C-Nap1/rootletinâdependent centrosome cohesion proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bahe <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>. Depletion of ALMS1 causes, by an unknown mechanism, reductions in the level of C-Nap1 at centrioles. This is predicted to perturb docking of interconnecting or âentanglingâ fibers with the proximal end of each centriole, leading to centrosome splitting. Procentrioles, which assemble orthogonally to parental centrioles during S and G2 phase, are depicted by dashed lines. Note that C-Nap1 is not thought to localize to the interface between the procentriole and centriole or be involved in maintaining their attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Mayor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>); it is not known if ALMS1 localizes to this interface.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmk0211096280009"/></fig><p>Although these data imply that ALMS1 is required for localization of C-Nap1 to the proximal ends of centrioles, to date we have not been able to demonstrate coimmunoprecipitation of these two proteins, suggesting that ALMS1 might not be directly involved in physically linking C-Nap1 to centrioles. This led us to consider that diminished levels of C-Nap1 at centrioles could also result from disruption of PCM1-based intracellular transport, on which centrosomal recruitment of C-Nap1 has been reported to depend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Hames <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). PCM1 is a major component of centriolar satellites, nonmembranous 70â100-nm granules that are transported toward the centrosome via the microtubule-based molecular motor dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kubo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Kubo and Tsukita, 2003</xref>). In support of a functional interaction between ALMS1 and PCM1, we found evidence that the distribution of PCM1 granules was altered in ALMS1-depleted cells, particularly in cells treated with a siRNA duplex previously reported to cause ciliary abnormalities (Supplemental Figure S7A), that centrosomal levels of the PCM1-dependent protein pericentrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>) were also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E), and that the distribution of a cytoplasmic pool of ALMS1 may be altered in PCM1-depleted cells (Supplemental Figure S7B). However, we also found that, under the conditions used in our experiments, siRNA-mediated depletion of PCM1 did not significantly alter the level of C-Nap1 at the centrosome (Supplemental Figure S7C). These data suggest that although ALMS1-depleted cells may have a defect in PCM1-based trafficking, this defect is unlikely to account for the observed reduction in centriolar levels of C-Nap1.</p><p>In summary, these findings indicate that depletion of ALMS1 leads to a reduction in the level of C-Nap1 at the centrosome, resulting in compromised centrosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D), and implicate ALMS1 in PCM1-based intracellular transport.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>ALMS1 Centrosome Targeting</title><p>Our analysis of transiently expressed ALMS1 deletion constructs is consistent with and extends the previous finding that a construct representing the C-terminal half (approx. 2000 residues) of ALMS1 localized to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Andersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that transiently expressed constructs were recruited to the centrosome through interactions with endogenous ALMS1, we believe this to be unlikely because they appeared to displace the endogenous protein from the centrosome. It remains possible that other parts of ALMS1 contribute to centrosome targeting, because failure of some constructs to localize to the centrosome may have been due to misfolding of the relevant regions. Nevertheless, our identification of discrete regions that are capable of centrosome targeting may facilitate the discovery of binding partners involved in this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Likely Centriole/Basal Bodyârelated Functions of C10orf90 and KIAA1731</title><p>Combined with previous data for ALMS1 and KIAA1731 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Andersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Hearn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), our immunolocalization analysis of transiently expressed C10orf90 and KIAA1731 suggests that all three ALMS motifâcontaining proteins localize to the centrosome. Based on our deletion analysis of ALMS1, the ALMS motif may contribute to centrosomal targeting but seems unlikely to represent a discrete centrosome-targeting domain. The centrosomal localization of an N-terminal KIAA1731 construct supports the conclusion that the ALMS motif is not required for centrosome targeting. The observation that a short construct encompassing the ALMS motif of ALMS1 localized preferentially to the nucleus is of uncertain significance, because larger constructs containing this region did not show a similar pattern and neither did tagged C10orf90 or KIAA1731. Although confirmation that endogenous C10orf90 and KIAA1731 localize to the centrosome awaits development of suitable antibodies, our RNAi data implicating both proteins in centrosome-related functions provide additional support for such localization.</p><p>As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Blachon <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>, KIAA1731 shares an N-terminal region of sequence similarity with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ana1, a protein implicated in centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Goshima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Dobbelaere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Blachon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We have identified further evidence of similarity between KIAA1731 and Ana1, namely, the presence of a conserved motif in the C-terminal half of each protein, the centriolar localization of KIAA1731 suggested by analysis of a tagged construct, and the centriole-loss phenotype observed in KIAA1731-depleted cells. Although their overall level of sequence identity is low, these findings suggest that KIAA1731 is evolutionarily related to Ana1. Much progress has been made recently in understanding the molecular basis of centriole duplication, and a conserved core of essential proteins has been identified in worms, flies, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Kleylein-Sohn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Strnad and Gonczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>). Ana1 belongs to an additional group of candidate centriole-duplication factors recently identified by RNAi screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Goshima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Dobbelaere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Notably, a recent report suggests that Ana1 is unlikely to be an upstream regulator of centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our data are consistent with a role for KIAA1731 in centriole duplication, but this requires clarification. For instance it may be required for the structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies, similarly to the recently proposed function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ana3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Stevens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The likely role of KIAA1731 in the formation/stability of basal bodies, structures on which cilium assembly depends, together with our RNAi analysis of C10orf90, suggests that mutations in either <italic>KIAA1731</italic> or <italic>C10orf90</italic> could represent novel causes of human ciliopathies.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible Functional Connections between ALMS1, C-Nap1, and PCM1</title><p>The mechanism responsible for the apparent loss of centriolar C-Nap1 in ALMS1-depleted cells remains unknown. Notably, a role for ALMS1 in intracellular transport has been suggested by analysis of a murine model of AlstrÃ¶m syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Collin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and we have found evidence that siRNA-mediated depletion of ALMS1 disrupts PCM1-dependent intracellular transport. However, our data also suggest that defective PCM1-dependent recruitment of C-Nap1 is unlikely to account for its diminished intensity in ALMS1-depleted cells. On the basis of this finding and the similar localizations of the two proteins, we speculate that ALMS1 serves a structural role at the proximal ends of centrioles that is important, either directly or indirectly, for the retention of C-Nap1. Interestingly, C-Nap1/rootletin-mediated centrosome cohesion has recently been linked with the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bahmanyar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Hadjihannas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), a pathway reported to be restrained by the cilium and/or basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Gerdes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Corbit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; though see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Huang and Schier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Ocbina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The potential involvement of ALMS1 in this pathway requires further investigation.</p><p>Our data raise the question of how a diminished centrosomal level of C-Nap1, or a more generalized perturbation at the proximal ends of centrioles, might contribute to the pathogenesis of AlstrÃ¶m syndrome. In terms of causing a ciliary phenotype, it may compromise the ciliary rootlet (a supporting structure mainly composed of the C-Nap1âinteracting protein rootletin), which is thought to be important for the long-term stability of sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2005</xref>). However, such a defect is unlikely to underlie the ciliary phenotypes observed over the short-term in ALMS1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), particularly because siRNA-mediated depletion of C-Nap1 or rootletin does not appear to affect cilium formation or morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>).</p><p>Defective PCM1-dependent transport could contribute to a ciliary defect in ALMS1-depleted cells, because siRNA-mediated depletion of PCM1 is known to diminish ciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Mikule <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Nachury <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A possible functional interaction with PCM1 is of particular interest because PCM1/centriolar satellites associate with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Nachury <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), BBS being a ciliopathy with considerable phenotypic overlap with AlstrÃ¶m syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Badano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Because we observed a pronounced effect on the cytoplasmic distribution of PCM1 with only one <italic>ALMS1</italic>-directed siRNA, it will be important to exclude the possibility of an off-target effect by, for example, rescuing the phenotype. Differential targeting of alternatively spliced <italic>ALMS1</italic> mRNAs is a possible explanation for the less severe effects seen with two other siRNAs.</p><p>In addition to its transport function, PCM1 has been suggested to function as a chaperone, helping proteins to fold and assemble into complexes before transport to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Hames <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The cytoplasmic ALMS1-positive foci observed in PCM1-depleted cells may therefore represent accumulations of partially folded ALMS1 molecules, arising due to the absence of this chaperone function (though a PCM1-associated fraction of ALMS1 has yet to be demonstrated). The apparently normal levels of ALMS1 at the centrosomes of PCM1-depleted cells indicate either that depletion was not prolonged sufficiently for an effect to be detected or that assembly of centrosome-associated ALMS1 occurs via a different pathway, as suggested for Cep290 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008a</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it is noteworthy that siRNA-mediated depletion of PCM1 does not appear to result in the stunted or morphologically abnormal primary cilia seen in ALMS1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Graser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which are suggestive of an IFT defect. Localization of ALMS1 to the proximal end of the basal body is intriguing in this regard because, to our knowledge, the role of this part of the basal body in IFT is unknown. It would seem to exclude direct participation in docking of IFT particles, which is thought to occur at âtransitional fibersâ extending between the distal end of the basal body and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Deane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Silverman and Leroux, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this work shows that ALMS1 associates specifically with the proximal ends of centrioles and basal bodies and implicates it in C-Nap1â and PCM1-related functions. The findings also suggest involvement of the ALMS motifâcontaining proteins C10orf90 and KIAA1731 in primary cilium assembly and centriole formation/stability, respectively.</p></sec></sec>
