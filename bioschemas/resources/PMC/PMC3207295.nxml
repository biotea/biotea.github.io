      <abstract>
        <p>Circadian rhythms are generated in central and peripheral tissues by an
                    intracellular oscillating timing mechanism known as the circadian clock. Several
                    lines of evidence show a strong and bidirectional interplay between metabolism
                    and circadian rhythms. Receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a
                    coregulator for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors that represses
                    catabolic pathways in metabolic tissues. Although RIP140 functions as a
                    corepressor for most nuclear receptors, mounting evidence points to RIP140 as a
                    dual coregulator that can repress or activate different sets of genes. Here, we
                    demonstrate that RIP140 mRNA and protein levels are under circadian regulation
                    and identify RIP140 as a modulator of clock gene expression, suggesting that
                    RIP140 can participate in a feedback mechanism affecting the circadian clock. We
                    show that the absence of RIP140 disturbs the basal levels of
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> and other clock genes, reducing the amplitude of
                    their oscillations. In addition, we demonstrate that RIP140 is recruited to
                    retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR) binding sites on the
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter, directly interacts with RORÎ±, and
                    increases transcription from the <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter in a
                    RORÎ±-dependent manner. These results indicate that RIP140 is not only
                    involved in metabolic control but also acts as a coactivator for RORÎ±,
                    influencing clock gene expression.</p>

    <p>Many physiological processes exhibit diurnal variations that persist even in the absence
            of environmental timing cues. These rhythmic changes in physiology that operate to
            anticipate the needs of the organism and show a periodicity of about 24 hours are called
            circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are present in central and peripheral tissues and
            generated by an intracellular oscillating timing mechanism known as the circadian
            oscillator or molecular clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411401579">Duguay and Cermakian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730411401579">Kohsaka and Bass, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0748730411401579">Yang et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>The mammalian molecular clock relies on a transcriptional-translational feedback loop in
            which BMAL1 and CLOCK bind as heterodimers to regulatory elements on target genes,
            stimulating their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730411401579">Darlington et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748730411401579">Ripperger and Schibler, 2006</xref>). Among those genes are the repressor proteins
                <italic>PERIOD</italic> (<italic>PER</italic>) and <italic>CRYPTOCHROME</italic>
                (<italic>CRY</italic>) families. Once PER and CRY have reached a critical
            concentration and are appropriately modified, they inhibit the activity of BMAL1-CLOCK,
            thereby repressing their own transcription and that of the other BMAL1-CLOCK target
            genes. Following additional modifications, PER and CRY are degraded, and the cycle
            begins again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730411401579">Dardente and Cermakian,
                2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730411401579">Dibner et al.,
                2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730411401579">Dunlap,

                2001</xref>). A second interconnecting feedback loop involving orphan nuclear
            receptors of the Rev-erb and ROR families regulates the levels of expression of
                <italic>BMAL1, CLOCK</italic>, and <italic>CRY1</italic>. In this secondary loop,
            ROR members activate both <italic>BMAL1</italic> and Rev-erbÎ± expression, while
            in turn, Rev-erbÎ± represses transcription of both itself and
                <italic>BMAL1</italic>, closing the loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730411401579">Akashi and Takumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411401579">Duguay and Cermakian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748730411401579">Sato et al., 2004</xref>). These
            nuclear receptors are not essential for circadian rhythms but are thought to improve the
            robustness of the clock, affecting its period length and phase-shifting properties
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730411401579">Akashi and Takumi, 2005</xref>;
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). In
            addition, these nuclear receptors are thought to be links between circadian rhythms and
            metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411401579">Duguay and Cermakian,

                2010</xref>).</p>
    <p>Several lines of evidence show a strong interplay between metabolism and circadian
            rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411401579">Duguay and Cermakian,
                2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411401579">Eckel-Mahan and

            involved in metabolism are rhythmically expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730411401579">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748730411401579">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Mice devoid of a functional
            circadian oscillator develop metabolic syndrome, and mutations or ablations of clock
            genes are often associated with metabolic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411401579">Eckel-Mahan and Sassone-Corsi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730411401579">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748730411401579">Turek et al., 2005</xref>).
            Conversely, the dominance of feeding cycles as a zeitgeber (time cue) for peripheral
            clocks implies that metabolic signals impact the clock machinery itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730411401579">Arble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730411401579">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411401579">Eckel-Mahan and Sassone-Corsi,
                2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>Glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and adipose tissue exhibit circadian variations
            due, at least in part, to circadian expression of key enzymes in these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730411401579">Lamia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730411401579">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748730411401579">So et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748730411401579">Zvonic et al., 2006</xref>). The
            expression of these genes is regulated by several pathways including nuclear receptor
            signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730411401579">Christian et al.,
                2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730411401579">Laitinen et al.,
                2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730411401579">Lau et al.,
                2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748730411401579">Sonoda et al.,
                2008</xref>), and interestingly, a number of nuclear receptors are themselves
            expressed in a circadian manner. Thus, in addition to <italic>Rev-erb</italic>Î±,
            the expression of peroxisome proliferatorâactivated receptors (PPARs),
            estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) is subject to
            circadian control in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748730411401579">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of
            nuclear receptors to stimulate the expression of metabolic genes depends on the
            recruitment of coactivators whose activity and/or expression not only varies in response
            to environmental stimuli but that are also expressed in a circadian manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730411401579">Asher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730411401579">Nakahata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730411401579">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). For
            example, PGC1Î± and PGC1Î², which are coactivators for ERRs and PPARs, are
            responsible for the activation of catabolic gene expression in metabolic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730411401579">Handschin and Spiegelman,
            2006</xref>). The expression of these 2 cofactors is increased following exercise and
            stress or in cold temperatures, but it is also subject to circadian control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730411401579">Handschin and Spiegelman, 2006</xref>;
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>RIP140 is a corepressor for many catabolic genes and antagonizes the positive effects of
            PGC1 coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730411401579">Christian et al.,
                2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411401579">Hallberg et al.,

                2008</xref>). Thus, catabolism is increased in mice devoid of RIP140, and they are

            between this metabolic cofactor and the molecular clock. We have found that RIP140 is
            not only subject to circadian gene expression but also functions as a positive regulator
            of the molecular clock by potentiating the activity of retinoid-related orphan receptor

        <title>RIP140 Protein and mRNA Levels Exhibit Circadian Oscillations</title>
        <p>Inspection of a circadian gene expression database from mouse liver indicated
                    that RIP140 was subject to circadian oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730411401579">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730411401579">Panda et al., 2002</xref>). To
                    investigate whether this periodicity was cell autonomous, we analyzed RIP140
                    expression in synchronized HepG2 human liver cells. Cells were synchronized by a
                    serum pulse, and samples of mRNA and protein were collected every 3 hours for 51
                    hours. We found that RIP140 mRNA and protein were expressed in a circadian
                    fashion, indicating that this is an intrinsic property of liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411401579">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411401579">1B</xref>). It is interesting to
                    note that there was a phase difference between RIP140 mRNA and protein that is
                    typical for many clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730411401579">Dunlap, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). Initially, we
                    investigated whether BMAL1 directly controls RIP140 expression by depleting it
                    from U2OS cells using RNA interference (RNAi). As expected, the depletion of
                    BMAL1 led to a decrease in mRNA of its well-known target
                        <italic>Rev-erb</italic>Î±, but interestingly, it resulted in an
                    increase in RIP140 expression, indicating that RIP140 expression is not
                    activated by BMAL1 but may be subject to repression by Rev-erbÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411401579">Fig. 1C</xref>). While canonical
                    E-boxes were not evident within the <italic>RIP140</italic> locus, ROR binding
                    elements (RORE) were noted in intronic regions of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730411401579">Heim et al., 2009</xref>).
                    Consistent with these observations, the depletion of Rev-erbÎ± by RNAi
                    increased the levels of RIP140 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411401579">Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus, Rev-erbÎ± seems to
                    repress the expression of RIP140 and may mediate the effects of BMAL1 on RIP140
                    expression, but whether this repressive effect is direct cannot be ascertained
                    from these results alone.</p>

        <p>Given the oscillations in RIP140 expression, we examined the possibility that it
                    might participate in a feedback mechanism to signal back to the molecular clock.
                    We investigated the impact of RIP140 on the expression of <italic>BMAL1</italic>

                    collected at ZT2, and mRNA levels for different clock genes were measured by
                    RT-QPCR. At this time point, there was a consistent reduction in the RNA levels
                    for all clock genes studied in the AHT and of <italic>BMAL1, CLOCK</italic>, and

                    also led to a reduction in clock gene expression as compared with a scrambled

        <title>The Absence of RIP140 Influences the Level of Expression of Clock Genes in
                    Synchronized MEFs</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of RIP140 in circadian gene expression, we compared the
                    expression of clock genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from WT and KO
                    littermates. As in the mouse liver, AHT, and RIP140-depleted HepG2s,
                    unsynchronized MEFs devoid of RIP140 express less mRNA for several clock genes
                    including <italic>BMAL1, CLOCK</italic>, and <italic>CRY1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411401579">Fig. 3A</xref>). After serum
                    pulse synchronization, the circadian expression of <italic>BMAL1, CRY1</italic>,
                    and <italic>PER1</italic> was maintained in the absence of RIP140, but the
                    amplitude of the oscillations was reduced for <italic>BMAL1</italic> and
                        <italic>CRY1</italic>. Interestingly, a slight phase difference in
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> and <italic>CRY1</italic> expression between WT and
                    KO MEFs was also observed in the RT-QPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411401579">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, this observation was
                    not consistent with the phase of expression seen for <italic>PER1</italic>.
                    Because phase and period estimates based on sampling of RNAs followed by RT-QPCR
                    are limited by both the density of time points and the duration of experiments,
                    we generated stably transfected lines of RIP140 KO MEFs in which the
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter (pBMAL1-dLuc) was used to drive rhythmic
                    expression of firefly luciferase. In 7 independently derived clones, experiments
                    monitored during 6 days provided consistent phase and period determinations of
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> reporter activity in the RIP140 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411401579">Fig. 3C</xref>). The phase of
                    peak <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter activity on day 2 was 34.32 Â± 0.62
                    hours (2 standard deviations) after serum shock and is in agreement with prior
                    estimates of phase from the NIH 3T3 cell line (33.99 Â± 0.22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730411401579">Gamsby et al., 2009</xref>).
                    This phase falls within the region spanning the peaks for <italic>BMAL1</italic>
                    mRNA in RIP140 KO and WT littermate MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411401579">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that the apparent
                    phase differences mainly reflect biological variability. Thus, while RIP140 is
                    not required to maintain circadian rhythmicity, it contributes to the overall
                    expression and oscillation of <italic>BMAL1</italic> and

                    Î± (RORA) is a nuclear receptor well known to stimulate transcription

                    investigated the possibility that RIP140 might function as a regulator of its
                    activity. First, we examined whether RIP140 was able to modulate the ability of
                    RORA to stimulate transcription from a <italic>BMAL1</italic> reporter in HuH7
                    human liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411401579">Fig.
                        4A</xref>). RIP140 expression alone led to a small increase in
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter activity, potentially by means of endogenous
                    RORs, and significantly increased the activation of the promoter by exogenously
                    expressed RORA. RIP140 also increased the activity of RORC on the
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter, suggesting that this coregulator could
                    function as a general coactivator for this group of nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411401579">Fig. 4B</xref>). Importantly,
                    there was no increase in reporter activity when the ROR binding sites were
                    mutated to abolish recruitment of the receptor to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411401579">Fig. 4C</xref>). Depletion of
                    RIP140 using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411401579">Fig.

                    the absence of RORA failed to further reduce <italic>BMAL1</italic> reporter
                    activity, indicating that the presence of RORA is required for RIP140 function

        <p>Next, we examined the endogenous <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter in HepG2 cells

                    of ROREs on the <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter, as well as in other
                    RORE-containing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748730411401579">Ueda

                    were examined as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748730411401579">Fig. 6A</xref>). By sequentially
                    immunoprecipitating for RIP140-bound chromatin and then for RORA-bound
                    chromatin, we were able to demonstrate co-occupancy of RIP140 and RORA in the
                    vicinity of the <italic>BMAL1</italic> ROREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748730411401579">Fig. 6B</xref>). Finally, we investigated the
                    interaction between RIP140 and RORA by expressing epitope-tagged proteins and
                    performing coimmunoprecipitation/Western blotting experiments using antibodies
                    to the epitope tags. Thus, we expressed RIP140-V5 and RORA-HA and demonstrated
                    that the 2 proteins were able to interact either by immunoprecipitating with V5
                    antibodies followed by Western blotting with HA antibodies or vice versa but not
                    with an anti-GFP antibody used as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0748730411401579">Fig. 6C</xref>). We also demonstrated that the
                    endogenous proteins were able to interact, albeit weakly, but this might reflect
                    the relative avidities of the anti-RIP140 and anti-RORA antibodies to their
                    specific epitopes. Thus, we conclude that RIP140 stimulates transcription of
                        <italic>BMAL1</italic> and other clock genes by functioning as a coactivator
                    for RORA.</p>

      <p>RIP140 plays an important role as a coregulator for nuclear receptors in controlling
                energy expenditure in adipose tissue and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411401579">Leonardsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730411401579">Morganstein et al., 2008</xref>;

                In the liver, it regulates lipid and glucose homeostasis, acting either as a
                corepressor or as a coactivator, depending on the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730411401579">Herzog et al., 2007</xref>). Mounting evidence
                shows that the maintenance of circadian rhythms is essential to sustain a normal
                metabolic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411401579">Eckel-Mahan

                that an intact circadian clock in the liver is required to maintain systemic glucose
                homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730411401579">Lamia et al.,
                    2008</xref>). Here, we show that the metabolic regulator RIP140, while it is not
                essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity in cells, modulates clock
                gene expression by potentiating the activity of ROR nuclear receptors.</p>
      <p>RIP140 expression is circadian in the liver and synchronized liver cells.
                Interestingly, in synchronized liver cells, RIP140 protein oscillated in phase with
                    <italic>BMAL1</italic> mRNA, pointing to a possible transactivation of this gene
                by RIP140. We were unable to identify conserved E-boxes within the RIP140 gene.
                Depletion of BMAL1 led to an increase of RIP140, rather than a decrease, suggesting
                that it is a higher order clock-controlled gene instead of a direct target for
                BMAL1/CLOCK. The RIP140 locus extends over 100 Kbp with regulatory regions both
                intragenic and in the upstream promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411401579">Augereau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730411401579">Heim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730411401579">Nichol et al., 2006</xref>). RIP140 contains
                binding regions for RORs/Rev-erbs and other circadianly expressed transcription
                factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730411401579">Heim et al.,
                    2009</xref>). Depletion of Rev-erbÎ± in U2OS cells led to an increase in
                RIP140, suggesting that this nuclear receptor is a potential repressor of RIP140
                expression. As RIP140 seems to be repressed by Rev-erbÎ±, a well-known
                    <italic>BMAL1</italic> target gene, we propose that RIP140 could be a
                second-order clock-controlled gene.</p>
      <p>Under normal 12:12 light/dark cycles, RIP140 KO mice show significantly more activity
                recorded during the light phase, when the mice would normally be resting, as
                compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730411401579">Hudson-Davies et al., 2008</xref>). These data suggested the possibility of
                alterations in the circadian system. Here, we report many and varied effects of
                RIP140 on the expression of clock genes: <italic>BMAL1, CLOCK</italic>, and
                    <italic>CRY1</italic> were all found to be downregulated in the liver and AHT of
                RIP140 KO mice, while the effects on <italic>PER1</italic> and <italic>PER2</italic>
                varied depending on the tissue. As these measurements were carried out at a single
                time point (ZT2) instead of during a complete 24-hour period, we cannot conclude
                that this effect will be seen, or in fact will not change, at other times of the
                day. However, consistent with these data, the absence of RIP140 gave rise to a
                constant downregulation of <italic>BMAL1</italic> and <italic>CRY1</italic> in
                synchronized MEFs, and the knockdown of RIP140 in human liver cells led to the
                downregulation of several core clock genes, indicating that RIP140 can impact
                elements within the circadian clock.</p>
      <p>Despite the reduced expression of several clock genes in synchronized RIP140 KO
                cells, these lines displayed relatively normal circadian periods and phases of
                oscillations in <italic>BMAL1</italic> gene reporters, indicating that RIP140 is not
                necessary for the oscillatory function of the molecular clock. Nevertheless, it has
                been suggested that smaller amplitudes of expression of clock genes, such as those
                seen here, can lead to decreased stability of the clock, culminating in either
                increased sensitivity to time cues or loss of rhythmicity after introduction of
                constant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411401579">Eckel-Mahan
                    and Sassone-Corsi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0748730411401579">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is an
                interesting possibility to be tested in the future whether loss of RIP140 may render
                animals more sensitive to external factors, such as nutrition, that can affect the
                circadian system.</p>
      <p>There are several metabolic similarities between the RIP140 KO mice and the
                    <italic>staggerer</italic> mice (<italic>sg/sg</italic>) that express a dominant
                negative form of RORA. Both strains are lean and protected against diet-induced
                obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730411401579">Lau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411401579">Leonardsson et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, RIP140 and RORA share several
                target genes in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730411401579">Jetten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730411401579">Journiac et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we show that in liver cells, RIP140
                interacts with RORA and potentiates RORs activity on the <italic>BMAL1</italic>
                promoter, providing a mechanism to explain the lower levels of clock genes in RIP140
                KO animals and cells. It is important to note that not only <italic>BMAL1</italic>
                but also <italic>CLOCK</italic> and <italic>CRY1</italic> are consistently
                downregulated in the absence of RIP140 in tissues and cells and that all these genes
                are also known targets for RORA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411401579">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Rev-erbÎ±, the negative component in the
                subsidiary feedback loop of the molecular clock, competes with RORA for the ROR
                binding sites and represses the expression of <italic>BMAL1</italic> by recruiting
                corepressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748730411401579">Yin and Lazar,
                    2005</xref>). Therefore, we tested the alternative possibility that RIP140 may
                potentiate <italic>BMAL1</italic> expression by blocking the ability of
                Rev-erbÎ± to function as a repressor. The positive effect of RIP140 was not
                affected by a reduction on Rev-erbÎ± levels, indicating that the presence of
                this nuclear receptor is not necessary for RIP140 action. On the other hand,
                overexpression of Rev-erbÎ±, displacing RORA from its binding sites, blocked
                the effect of RIP140.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that other nuclear receptor coregulators, among them
                PGC1Î±, can coactivate RORA, affecting clock gene expression in the liver and
                other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730411401579">Liu et al.,
                    2007</xref>). In other tissues, particularly in adipose tissue and muscle,
                RIP140 is known to suppress the catabolic effects of PGC1Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730411401579">Christian et al., 2006</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411401579">Hallberg et al.,

                    2008</xref>). Given these observations, it may seem surprising that both RIP140
                and PGC1Î± are capable of serving as coactivators for the molecular clock in
                the liver. However, both proteins can be induced in the liver by similar signals
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730411401579">Berriel et al., 2008</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730411401579">Puigserver, 2005</xref>),
                suggesting that a certain degree of cooperation between them may exist. Moreover, it
                has been shown that RIP140 and PGC1Î± can physically interact and that they
                can be simultaneously recruited to endogenous promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411401579">Hallberg et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand,
                RIP140 and PGC1Î± oscillate with different phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730411401579">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://expression.gnf.org/circadian">http://expression.gnf.org/circadian</ext-link>), which might lead to temporal
                compartmentalization and therefore absence of competition/interaction. The precise
                relation between these 2 cofactors remains to be elucidated. Finally, although
                RIP140 seems to regulate <italic>BMAL1</italic> and other clock genes via direct
                interaction with RORA, several other indirect mechanisms such as changes in the
                energy balance/oxidative status of the RIP140-depleted cells cannot be ruled out as
                possible causes of changes in clock function.</p>
      <p>In summary, we showed that RIP140 is a clock-controlled gene and protein whose
                circadian regulation is cell autonomous and that its absence reduces the basal
                levels of expression of clock genes that are targets for RORs. This suggests that
                RIP140 can participate in a feedback loop that connects metabolism to circadian
                rhythms and that the absence of RIP140 might affect the robustness of the system and
                its sensitivity to external stimuli.</p>
