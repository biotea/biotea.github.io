      <abstract>
        <p>In the present study, we investigated the 3â² untranslated region (UTR) of the mouse core clock gene <italic>cryptochrome 1</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic>) at the post-transcriptional level, particularly its translational regulation. Interestingly, the 3â²UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA decreased its mRNA levels but increased protein amounts. The 3â²UTR is widely known to function as a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element of mRNA degradation. The 3â²UTR also provides a binding site for microRNA and mainly suppresses translation of target mRNAs. We found that AU-rich element RNA binding protein 1 (AUF1) directly binds to the <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR and regulates translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA. AUF1 interacted with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit B and also directly associated with ribosomal protein S3 or ribosomal protein S14, resulting in translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA in a 3â²UTR-dependent manner. Expression of cytoplasmic AUF1 and binding of AUF1 to the <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR were parallel to the circadian CRY1 protein profile. Our results suggest that the 3â²UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic> is important for its rhythmic translation, and AUF1 bound to the 3â²UTR facilitates interaction with the 5â² end of mRNA by interacting with translation initiation factors and recruiting the 40S ribosomal subunit to initiate translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The expression of most genes is regulated temporally and spatially. Although most of the regulation of gene expression occurs at the transcription step, the regulation of mRNA stability, localization and modulation of translation are crucial steps, particularly in developmental processes (<xref rid="gkt1379-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and biological clock systems (<xref rid="gkt1379-B2" ref-type="bibr">2â5</xref>). Expression profiles of mRNA or protein are not matched in many cases, implying that translational control is a dynamically regulated mechanism, which is not a silent step (<xref rid="gkt1379-B6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref>). Recent work had shown that the majority of regulation that dictates protein levels is at the level of translation (<xref rid="gkt1379-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In most cases of transcript-specific translational regulation, mRNA-binding proteins bind to <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the 3â² untranslated region (UTR) of the target transcript, resulting in translational activation or repression (<xref rid="gkt1379-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The 3â²UTR is widely known to function as a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element that regulates the mRNA half-life (<xref rid="gkt1379-B11" ref-type="bibr">11â13</xref>), leading to greater or lesser protein levels. Along with the translational control by the 5â²UTR, the 3â²UTR is also important for translational initiation by making a âclosed-loopâ or âcircularâ structure of mRNA through association of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (EIF4G) (<xref rid="gkt1379-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, the 3â²UTR provides a target region for specific microRNAs, leading to translational repression (<xref rid="gkt1379-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)âthis is an active area of investigation.</p><p>Here, we suggest a novel regulatory process involving the expression of CRY1 (which is encoded by one of the core circadian clock genes), <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR-mediated translation. The physiological processes of all living organisms from bacteria to humans are governed by the daily cycle (<xref rid="gkt1379-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Transcriptional and post-translational regulations are mainly focused on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of sustained oscillation (<xref rid="gkt1379-B19" ref-type="bibr">19â21</xref>). At the molecular level, a circadian rhythm is generated and regulated by various componentsâso-called âclock genesââand the robustness of the periodicity is based on the interlocked transcriptional feedback loops of such participants. CRY is one of the most important clock components in the mammalian circadian circuit, functioning as a negative limb of the transcriptional feedback loop (<xref rid="gkt1379-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). CRY is necessary for dimerization of the PER (PERIOD)/CRY (CRYPTOCHROME) heterodimer, and its nuclear localization represses the transcriptional activity of the BMAL1 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like)/CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) heterodimer. Additionally, CRY1 and CRY2 are indispensable for the maintenance of behavioral rhythmicity (<xref rid="gkt1379-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In contrast to transcription and post-translational modification, few studies have focused on the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Cry1</italic> (<xref rid="gkt1379-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>Cry1</italic> is an important core clock gene and shows rhythmic expression that is not fully explained by transcription or protein modification. Nevertheless, translational control of <italic>Cry1</italic> has not yet been studied. Here, we suggest another regulatory process of <italic>Cry1</italic> expression, <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR-mediated translation. The 3â²UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic> increased translation efficiency. Specifically, AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1), also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (HNRNPD), interacted with the 3â²UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic>, and its knock-down decreased CRY1 levels. AUF1 showed circadian time-dependent cytoplasmic expression, and binding to the <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR was rhythmic. Indeed, AUF1 associated with translation initiation factors and also directly interacted with the 40S ribosomal protein RPS3 or RPS14. In the present report, we concluded that the rhythmical RNA-binding protein AUF1 on the 3â²UTR recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5â² end of mRNA by associating with EIF3B, leading to time-dependent expression of CRY1. Our study may expand the roles of the 3â²UTR and RNA-binding proteins for the translation system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Mouse <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR (<italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR) was amplified from the pcNAT-wt610 plasmid, which was previously reported (<xref rid="gkt1379-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), using Pfu polymerase (Solgent), and the sequence was confirmed by sequencing.

The circadian rhythmicity of CRY1 protein showed a delayed peak or trough time of approximately 4 h compared with that of mRNA oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). The discrepant oscillation pattern between mRNA and protein of <italic>Cry1</italic> indicates that an important regulation step may exist, particularly at the post-transcriptional step. Post-transcriptional regulation is mainly controlled by the UTR of mRNA; thus, we focused on the UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic>. First, <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (Rluc) was fused to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR (RL-Cry1-3U) to confirm the function of mouse <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR in mRNA stability and translation compared with the Rluc control vector (RL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Generally, the 3â²UTR is related to mRNA degradation, and we observed decreased luciferase mRNA levels of reporters that harbour <italic>Cry1-</italic>3â²UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>C). We also determined protein levels of the reporters to identify the relationship between mRNA and protein levels of <italic>Cry1</italic>. Interestingly, reporters carrying <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR showed increased luciferase activity compared with control reporters lacking 3â²UTR sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>D). We thought that protein levels of the reporters mirrored mRNA levels; specifically, we assumed that <italic>Cry1-</italic>3â²UTR-conjugated reporters may show reduced protein levels because <italic>Cry1-</italic>3â²UTR decreases <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA levels. However, the results overturned a common sense that <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA is a prerequisite for CRY1 protein with a correlated expression pattern. We wanted to know whether mRNA stability of <italic>Cry1</italic> could be affected by its translation or not. Transcription produces new mRNAs, and the newly produced mRNAs should be excluded when we measure the stability of pre-existing mRNAs. To check mRNA stability except transcriptional effect, we treated cells with Actinomycin D (Act.D), which blocks transcription elongation by binding to DNA at the transcription initiation complex (<xref rid="gkt1379-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the presence of Act.D endogenous <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA level was reduced together with <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>E and F). This means that 3â²UTR is a destabilizing element in <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA. If the translation is linked to mRNA stability as weâve hypothesized, mRNA level should be affected by translation status. Thus, we treated cells with CHX to block translation process and then checked the mRNA stability. In this study, we treated cells with Act.D and CHX together to investigate the exact mRNA level change related to translation without transcriptional effect. Co-treatment with Act.D and CHX retarded degradation of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA and <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>E and F). However, CHX could block synthesis of a labile mRNA degradation factors. To complement this experiment, we performed another experiment. Transfection of <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR fused reporter mRNAs containing a m<sup>7</sup>GpppG-cap, which activates translation, showed reduced reporter mRNA levels. Related to ApppG-capped <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR reporters, which cannot bind to the translation initiation factor eIF4E, stability of reporter mRNA was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>G and H). From these results, we like to suggest that translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> may be activated by the 3â²UTR, and <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA levels can be regulated by 3â²UTR-mediated translation.

Indeed, we confirmed the function of AUF1 in <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA degradation: knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> stabilized <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Similar to the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D, <italic>Auf1</italic> knock-down stabilized <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA but dramatically reduced CRY1 protein levels. This contradictory effect on mRNA and protein levels by AUF1 was confirmed using the reporter system. Knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> decreased reporter activity that was elevated by <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR, whereas <italic>Auf1</italic> knock-down could not elicit a significant effect on the control reporter RL lacking the 3â²UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We confirmed the knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> decreased not only the reporter activity of <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR but also endogenous CRY1 protein levels. We also confirmed the function of AUF1 by knock-down and rescue experiment. Transfection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets 3â²UTR of <italic>Auf1</italic> (sh_Auf1) reduced CRY1 protein levels, but overexpression of Flag-AUF1 rescued CRY1 protein levels in sh_Auf1 transfected condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>E). To exclude any transcriptional effect of <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR, we generated reporter mRNA constructs containing a cap structure and poly(A)<sub>30</sub> with or without the 3â²UTR. The <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase reporter mRNAs were used for transfection control. Regarding the control reporter mRNA construct, luciferase activity was not changed with knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>F). By contrast, the reporter mRNA harbouring <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR showed decreased translation under <italic>Auf1</italic>-reduced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>G). We also confirmed knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>FâH). To exclude the possibility that the reduced translation under the <italic>Auf1</italic> knocked-down condition originated from changes in mRNA transport or shuttling, we checked cytoplasmic and nuclear <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA levels under con_si- or Auf1_si-transfected conditions. We confirmed <italic>Auf1</italic> knock-down and the obtained mRNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>J). We observed no alteration of the <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA fraction whether or not AUF1 was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>I). Likewise, knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> did not change the protein stability of CRY1 (data not shown). The results suggest that AUF1 accelerates CRY1 translation by acting on the 3â²UTR.

Indeed, it was reported that AUF1 functions as an ITAF and activates IRES-mediated translation in a 5â²UTR-dependent manner (<xref rid="gkt1379-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We confirmed the IRES activity of <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR to investigate whether the dynamic post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Cry1</italic> is modulated by the 5â²UTR. To investigate the existence of an IRES in <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA, we inserted the 5â²UTR of mouse <italic>Cry1</italic> into a bicistronic reporter vector (<xref rid="gkt1379-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>). The vector produces a bicistronic RNA encoding Rluc in the first cistron and firefly luciferase (Fluc) in the second cistron. The translation of Rluc is served by cap-dependent translation, whereas the translation of the second cistron Fluc reflects the IRES activity of the inserted 5â²UTR sequences. As previously reported, the 5â²UTR of mouse <italic>Period homolog 1</italic> (<italic>Per1</italic>) showed IRES activity (<xref rid="gkt1379-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); however, <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR showed no IRES activity compared with the pRF control (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3B</ext-link>).

We checked the binding between the 3â² or 5â² UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic> and AUF1 via biotin-RNA affinity precipitation. AUF1 was co-precipitated with biotin-labelled <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>A). AUF1 bound to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR was dramatically decreased by non-labelled cold <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR competitor RNA. Regarding <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR, we observed no AUF1 binding. The results indicate that AUF1 specifically binds to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR but not to <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR. We also checked other RNA-binding proteins to confirm the findings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>A. The binding of PTBP1, a known regulator of translation and splicing, was specific for <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR but not for <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4A</ext-link>). Additionally, SYNCRIP (synaptotagmin binding, cytoplasmic RNA interacting protein), which can also reduce CRY1 protein levels, more specifically bound to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR than to <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4B</ext-link>). We also confirmed the binding of AUF1 to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR using a UV-crosslinking assay because UV-crosslinking detects only direct binding between RNA and protein: AUF1 was specifically bound to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>B). We confirmed the AUF1 band using an AUF1 knock-down approach. In UV-crosslinking, very small amount of protein can be detected. It means that knock-down effect is hardly visible in UV-crosslinking assay. As there are more AUF1 in the nucleus than cytoplasm, we could observe more dramatic difference of AUF1 intensity, so we used nuclear protein extract. When we used <italic>Auf1</italic> knocked-down extract, the AUF1 band was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>C, arrow). To confirm the binding of AUF1 to <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR, immunoprecipitation of UV cross-linked proteins with radiolabelled <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR RNA was performed using anti-AUF1 antibody. AUF1 was immunoprecipitated from the UV cross-linked proteins by its specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 3). No bands were detected when control IgG was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 2). AUF1 is one of the ubiquitously expressed proteins that specifically binds to AU-rich RNA destabilizing elements (AREs) (<xref rid="gkt1379-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). AUF1 has four isoforms of different molecular weights (P37, P40, P42 and P45), all of which are generated by alternative precursor mRNA splicing (<xref rid="gkt1379-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref rid="gkt1379-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Additionally, to confirm the direct binding of each AUF1 isoform to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR, purified recombinant GST-AUF1 was used in UV-crosslinking. GST-P37, GST-P40, GST-P42 and GST-P45 specifically bound to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR in a concentration-dependent manner, but GST did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>D).

This means that knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> reduces CRY1 protein in a 3â²UTR-dependent manner, and we could exclude the possibility of AUF1 binding to <italic>Cry1</italic>-5â²UTR.

We hypothesized that the 3â²UTR-bound AUF1 recruits translation-related factors, and accelerates translation efficiency. To test this, we checked proteinâprotein interactions between AUF1 and translation-related factors. Flag-tagged AUF1 (Flag-AUF1) isoforms were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Flag-AUF1s were immunoprecipitated, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins, particularly translation initiation-related proteins, were evaluated. Interestingly, PABP and translation initiation-related factors EIF4G1 and EIF3B were co-immunoprecipitated with AUF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Regarding eIF4G1 and PABP, interactions with AUF1 were strong under RNase-inhibited conditions. However, RNase A treatment decreased their binding affinity. Conversely, EIF3B still showed a strong affinity to the AUF1 even in the absence of RNA. To verify the interaction between AUF1 and EIF3B under endogenous conditions, EIF3B was immunoprecipitated using a specific antibody. We observed co-immunoprecipitated AUF1 in NIH 3T3 cells regardless of the presence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F4">Figure 4</xref>C). We also observed the interaction between AUF1 and EIF3B in HEK 293A cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7</ext-link>). These data suggest that the interaction between AUF1 and EIF3B is a proteinâprotein interaction but not an RNA-mediated indirect interaction. We also overexpressed AUF1, and it increased CRY1 protein levels. But this increase of CRY1 expression was prevented by silencing EIF3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F4">Figure 4</xref>D). From these results, we suggest that AUF1 is involved in the translation machinery.

Orbitrap analysis, the advanced mass spectrometry that uses orbital trapping of ionized protein fragments, can overcome resolution limit and provide us an accurate binding candidates compared with conventional MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. From the data of the LTQ-orbitrap, we identified other HNRNPs as AUF1-binding proteins in an RNA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Interestingly, several ribosomal proteins, particularly 40S ribosomal proteins, were also identified as AUF1-binding proteins regardless of the presence of RNA. To verify the interaction between AUF1 and 40S ribosomal proteins identified by the LTQ-orbitrap, His-tagged recombinant ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14) and ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) were prepared. RPS3, RPS11, RPS14 and RPS18 proteins are located on the solvent side of the 40S subunit, which have more accessible surface area to other proteins (<xref rid="gkt1379-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). After incubation with His-fused 40S ribosomal proteins and GST-fused AUF1, protein complexes were pulled-down using GST pull-down assays. When all GST-fused AUF1 isoforms were precipitated, His-fused RPS3 and RPS14 proteins were co-precipitated with AUF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F5">Figure 5</xref>B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8AâC</ext-link>). Regarding RPS11, His-RPS11-purified protein was not co-precipitated with AUF1. His-RPS18 recombinant protein also did not interact with AUF1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that AUF1 directly associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit through proteinâprotein interactions. However, AUF1 did not interact with all 40S ribosomal proteins; it interacted selectively.

AUF1 was detected to be co-localized with RPS3 or RPS14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). In SIM-super-resolution images, not all AUF1 co-localized with RPS3 or RPS14, but some of AUF1 co-localized with RPS3 or RPS14. These data and previously shown data suggest that some portion of AUF1 that bound to specific target mRNA may interact with 40S ribosomal proteins. To verify the proteinâprotein interaction between AUF1 and 40S ribosomal proteins in cells, immunoprecipitation was performed using the RPS3 antibody with untransfected cell extracts. AUF1 proteins were co-precipitated with RPS3 under RNA-containing or RNA-free conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Because the 401e construct, a deletion construct of <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR, showed a dramatic decrease in AUF1 binding, we also checked the binding of RPS3 to the 401e-3â²UTR construct. RPS3 appeared to bind to full-length <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR but not to 401e-3â²UTR <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F5">Figure 5</xref>F). In the case of HNRNPK or SYNCRIP, the binding affinity to 401e-3â²UTR was slightly reduced compared with full-length <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR. These results suggest that AUF1 forms a complex with RPS3 under endogenous conditions, and RPS3 binding to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR may be mediated by AUF1. Because eukaryotic RPS3 is a highly conserved protein located on the solvent side of the 40S subunit on the beak of the head region (<xref rid="gkt1379-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), the proteinâprotein interaction between AUF1 and RPS3 may be reasonable. Taken together, we suggest that 3â²UTR-bound AUF1 recruits 40S ribosomal proteins, and these interactions may activate 3â²UTR-mediated translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Rhythmic cytoplasmic AUF1 regulates time-dependent CRY1 translation</title><p>We showed that AUF1 regulates translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> in 3â²UTR-dependent manner. Reporter mRNA transfection was also performed to exclude transcriptional regulation, and reporter mRNA harbouring <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR only showed reduced reporter activity under AUF1-decreased conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F2">Figure 2</xref>G). To verify the function of <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR-mediated translational activation under physiological condition of circadian rhythm, dexamethasone was applied to achieve synchronization of circadian time in NIH 3T3 cells. When we transiently transfected reporter mRNAs to dexamethasone-treated cells at certain time intervals, the translational activity of reporter mRNAs harbouring <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR seemed to be regulated rhythmically but not control reporter mRNAs lacking the 3â²UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). In addition, the time of translation activity of <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR was correlated with endogenous the CRY1 protein expression time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F1">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F7">7</xref>B and C). The results suggest that <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR activates translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> rhythmically. To clarify the rhythmic translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA, we studied polysome fractionation analysis. The overall profiles of ribosomes in sucrose gradient analyses were not altered by circadian time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>C, top panel). This was reflected in the levels of a control <italic>Tbp</italic> mRNA; the distribution pattern of <italic>Tbp</italic> mRNA was not changed by dexamethasone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>C, third from top panel). However, a shift of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA between heavy polysome and light polysome, reflecting a time-dependent translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA, was observed in cells treated with dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>C, second from top panel). To explain the rhythmic translation of <italic>Cry1</italic>, which occurred in a 3â²UTR-dependent manner, we assumed the AUF1 level may follow the CRY1 protein profile; however, the total level of AUF1 was relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F7">Figure 7</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9A</ext-link>). We speculated whether the cytoplasmic AUF1 levels could be rhythmic, as translation occurs in the cytoplasm. To test our hypothesis, we harvested synchronized NIH 3T3 cells at indicated time points, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionated extracts were obtained. From these extracts, we checked the AUF1 expression pattern. As correlated with our hypothesis, cytoplasmic AUF1 showed rhythmicity in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Indeed, the cytoplasmic AUF1 profile was matched to the CRY1 protein level. To further investigate this finding, we examined the interaction between cytoplasmic AUF1 and <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR. We performed a biotin-labelled RNA pull-down assay with dexamethasone-treated cytoplasmic cell extracts. The binding affinity was correlated with the CRY1 protein phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>E). We also checked if the interaction between AUF1 and endogenous <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA is rhythmic by using RNP immunoprecipitation and reverse-transcription assays. As cytosolic AUF1 showed rhythmic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>D), input lane of cytosolic AUF1 also showed circadian time-dependent expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>F). The immunoprecipitated AUF1 levels were rhythmic during their respective circadian time frames, and co-immunoprecipitated m<italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA with AUF1 changed with dexamethasone treatment time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>G). Therefore, the results suggest that rhythmic cytoplasmic AUF1 expression leads to its rhythmic binding to the 3â²UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA and subsequently triggers time-dependent 3â²UTR-mediated translation.

To analyse the physiological role of 3â²UTR-mediated translation of <italic>Cry1</italic> by AUF1 in circadian expression, we used the knock-down approach in NIH 3T3 cells.

Taken together, these results imply that the 3â²UTR-dependent translational activation by AUF1 allows robust expression of CRY1 in relation to the circadian period, and it may have fine tuning effect on the circadian system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Unexpectedly, we found that a reporter harbouring <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR showed increased reporter translation activity. Knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> decreased CRY1 protein levels. Although the main function of AUF1 is suggested to be acceleration of the degradation of diverse mRNAs by binding to AREs in the 3â²UTR, some reports have describe the function of AUF1 in translational regulation such as in increasing IRES-mediated translation or translation-coupled mRNA degradation (<xref rid="gkt1379-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, little mechanistic understanding exists regarding about AUF1-dependent translational activation via 3â²UTR (<xref rid="gkt1379-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B44" ref-type="bibr">44â46</xref>). To elucidate the role of AUF1 in translation related to the circadian system, we checked AUF1-interacting proteins and found that AUF1 directly interacts with RPS3 or RPS14. AUF1 also interacted with translation initiation factors, particularly EIF3B. Because AUF1 was also reported to be an ITAF (<xref rid="gkt1379-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), our finding regarding a direct interaction between AUF1 and ribosomal proteins or translation initiation factors may provide clues for the IRES-mediated translational mechanism that is regulated by AUF1 and may elucidate the role of AUF1 in the elaborate translational system. Indeed, along with the ternary complex of PABP, cap-binding protein EIF4E, and EIF4G, the interaction between AUF1 and translation initiation factor EIF3B may circularize mRNAs and subsequently accelerate translation efficiency.</p><p>In this study, all isoforms of AUF1 were detected in immunoblotting or immunocytochemistry. These isoforms are usually in the same protein complex. We found that p37, p40, p42 and p45 directly interacted with <italic>Cry1</italic> 3â²UTR as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F3">Figure 3</xref>BâD. Indeed, AUF1 interacted with endogenous <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F6">Figure 6</xref>F and G). From these results, all isoforms of AUF1 can interact with <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR. Because AUF1 has four isoforms, we wanted to determine which isoform was important for 3â²UTR-mediated translational activation. RPS3 strongly interacted with P40 isoforms compared with other AUF1 isoforms. Conversely, RPS14 showed strong affinity to P40 or P42 compared with other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F5">Figure 5</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8C</ext-link>). Indeed, RPS3 or RPS14 showed co-localization with AUF1, but only some of the AUF1 co-localized with RPS3 or RPS14. AUF1 isoforms may have differential interacting protein partners, which elicit different a translational function. Further study of interacting proteins of each AUF1 isoform will help to elucidate the role of AUF1 in translational activation. But the functions of each AUF1-interacting partners are related to translation. Indeed, AUF1 isoforms are mainly in the same protein complex; the function of AUF1 is needed to consider in the view of complex of AUF1 isoforms. So we think that AUF1 directly binds to <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR and may recruit translational systems.</p><p>We believe that not all mRNAs are regulated by AUF1-mediated translation, but some portions of mRNAs are regulated by 3â²UTR-dependent and AUF1-dependent translational activation. Knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> slightly changed mRNA expression of clock genes. Nevertheless, knock-down of <italic>Auf1</italic> did not lead to increasing <italic>Per2</italic> mRNA after 40 h of Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F7">Figure 7</xref>D). Indeed, the first cycle and second cycle of <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA are different (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S9D</ext-link>). Circadian system possesses diverse adjustable regulation mechanisms, such as transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. Moreover, there exist several factors such as clock gene homologs and another feedback loops, D-box loop and RORE loop, for circadian robustness. We think that the difference of other clock genesâ amplitude among the cycles may be originated from the tendency of compensation. But in this study we donât know whether AUF1 directly regulates other clock genes. To clarify the function of AUF1 in global circadian system, further study is needed.</p><p>As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Figures S2B</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">S4B</ext-link>, SYNCRIP also bound to only <italic>Cry1</italic>-3â²UTR, and knock-down of <italic>Syncrip</italic> reduced CRY1 protein levels like AUF1. Indeed, SYNCRIP also directly interacted with 40S ribosomal proteins (<xref rid="gkt1379-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Further study regarding SYNCRIP, AUF1 and other RNA-binding proteins may elucidate the concerted actions of 3â²UTR-binding proteins and clarify the sophisticated mechanisms of 3â²UTR-dependent translational activation.</p><p>RNA-binding proteins function as multiplayers. SYNCRIP was shown to rhythmically accelerate mRNA degradation of AANAT mRNA (<xref rid="gkt1379-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In other cases, SYNCRIP functioned as an ITAF and increased IRES-mediated translation of target genes (<xref rid="gkt1379-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). PTBP1 also activates mRNA degradation (<xref rid="gkt1379-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) but increases translation of specific mRNA (<xref rid="gkt1379-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). These RNA-binding proteins generally bind to the UTR region, and many RNA-binding proteins can bind to UTR simultaneously. We think that multiple functions of RNA-binding proteins originate within the context of proteins bound to the target RNA. To clearly demonstrate the function of RNA-binding proteins, the context of interacting proteins and subsequent recruitment of functional machinery, such as the exosome or translation processing factors, must be considered. Further investigation to characterize functional roles of mRNA-binding proteins may clarify the RNA-binding protein-mediated translational regulation.</p><p>Although cytoplasmic AUF1 shows rhythmic expression, the effect of AUF1 on m<italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA binding appears stronger. Several signalling systems may modulate post-translational modifications of AUF1. Phosphorylation of AUF1 is altered concomitant with changes in RNA-binding activity and stability of ARE-containing mRNAs (<xref rid="gkt1379-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1379-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Indeed, methylation of AUF1 may be essential for protein function (<xref rid="gkt1379-B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). We think that post-translational modification of AUF1 may also have an effect on the RNA binding affinity of AUF1, and this may lead to discrepancy between expression of AUF1 and mRNA binding affinity of AUF1.</p><p>AUF1 accelerates translation but promotes rapid mRNA degradation mediated by AREs in their 3â²UTRs. However, AUF1 alone does not exhibit ribonucleolytic activity. Binding of AUF1 to the ARE recruits exosomes for exonucleolytic mRNA degradation (<xref rid="gkt1379-B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). This contradictory function of AUF1 on rhythmic <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA and protein expression can be explained as illustrated in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1379-F7">Figure 7</xref>E). AUF1 binds to preexisting <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNAs. Ribosomes scan mRNA for translation or have a higher probability to meet the initiation codon immediately after their recruitment to the 5â² end of mRNA by interacting with AUF1. As EIF3B and other translation initiation proteins form circularized mRNA by interacting with PABP, AUF1 may help provide 40s ribosomal proteins to the 5â² end of mRNA, and translation efficiency may be increased. Thus, CRY1 protein gradually increases and finally reaches peak levels. AUF1 may also interact with the exosome and be displaced from the 3â²UTR in a complex with PABP. This may allow the mRNA to be exposed to the exosome machinery. Modifications in AUF1 or a change in the context of interacting partners may reduce the cytoplasmic AUF1 level and concurrent binding to the 3â²UTR of <italic>Cry1</italic> mRNA. This may produce inefficient recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit, causing decreased translation activity of <italic>Cry1</italic> and consequent decreased CRY1 protein levels.</p><p>The present study is the first report to reveal the functional role of AUF1 in 3â²UTR-mediated translation and the circadian system. The present study elucidates a new mechanism of rhythmic 3â²UTR-mediated <italic>Cry1</italic> translation that may be an important step in the regulation of the circadian clock. From these results, we suggest that posttranscriptional regulation plays an important role in the circadian rhythm. Indeed, the 3â²UTR-mediated translational activation mechanism will elucidate a new regulatory step in the circadian rhythmic system. Translation of other genes could be also regulated by the 3â²UTR and in an HNRNP-dependent manner. The current study may help explain the time gap between mRNA and protein production with the regulation of amplitude in the circadian rhythm. We hope that our findings may reveal hidden crucial aspects of the complex molecular system for achieving the tightly regulated 24-h cycle in mammals with a distinct translation activation mechanism. Moreover, our study may expand the roles of 3â²UTRs and RNA-binding proteins for the translation system.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1379/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</funding-source> [<award-id>20110027957</award-id>, <award-id>20120005830</award-id>, <award-id>2013R1A1A2058135</award-id>]; Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program [<award-id>PJ00950301</award-id>]; <funding-source>Rural Development Administration</funding-source>, and the Inter-ER cooperation project from the <funding-source>Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE)</funding-source>; <funding-source>Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT)</funding-source>; Brain Korea 21 plus program [<award-id>10Z20130012243</award-id>] of the <funding-source>Korean Ministry of Education</funding-source>.
