      <abstract>
        <p>Dynamic turnover of integrin cell adhesion molecules to and from the cell surface is central to cell migration. We report for the first time an association between integrins and Rab proteins, which are small GTPases involved in the traffic of endocytotic vesicles. Rab21 (and Rab5) associate with the cytoplasmic domains of Î±-integrin chains, and their expression influences the endo/exocytic traffic of integrins. This function of Rab21 is dependent on its GTP/GDP cycle and proper membrane targeting. Knock down of Rab21 impairs integrin-mediated cell adhesion and motility, whereas its overexpression stimulates cell migration and cancer cell adhesion to collagen and human bone. Finally, overexpression of Rab21 fails to induce cell adhesion via an integrin point mutant deficient in Rab21 association. These data provide mechanistic insight into how integrins are targeted to intracellular compartments and how their traffic regulates cell adhesion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cell adhesion and migration are pivotal to many biological and pathological processes, including development, inflammation, repair, and cancer metastasis. The regulation of cell adhesion and motility is very complex. It requires the coordination of adhesion receptorâmatrix interactions on the cell surface, trafficking of the receptors to and from the sites of adhesion (adhesion site turnover), and cytoskeletal reorganization inside the cell. Moreover, all these events have to be precisely orchestrated not only spatially but also temporally.</p>
      <p>Î±/Î²-Integrin heterodimers are key molecules involved in cell adhesion and migration. Binding of cell surfaceâexpressed integrins to specific ligands on the extracellular matrix is relatively well understood (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 2002</xref>). In contrast, much less is known about the turnover of integrin-containing adhesion sites and the intracellular traffic of integrins, although their importance in cell adhesion and migration is being increasingly recognized (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bretscher, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Huttenlocher, 2005</xref>). In particular, the mechanisms that target integrins to specific endocytic compartments remain unknown.</p>
      <p>Eukaryotic cells internalize cell-surface receptors by endocytosis. Integrins, like several other proteins lacking the AP-2 localization signal are internalized from the cell membrane via nonclathrin-derived structures, and some integrins have been shown to subsequently fuse with compartments containing clathrin-derived cargo proteins (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Naslavsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Upla et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Weigert et al., 2004</xref>). The endocytosed receptors are subsequently recycled back to the cell surface or targeted for degradation. Depending on the cell type and the stimulus, integrins have been shown to be transported through caveolin-1âpositive structures or early endosomes, either directly or via the perinuclear recycling compartment, back to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Rab proteins are small GTPases that regulate both endocytosis and exocytosis. Several members have been implicated to function on the endocytic pathway, in which the function of Rab5 is understood in more detail (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Miaczynska and Zerial, 2002</xref>). Rab5 regulates membrane traffic into and between early endosomes as well as vesicle transport along microtubules (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Integrin traffic is regulated by several kinases (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ivaska et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Woods et al., 2004</xref>) and motor proteins (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). However, very little is known about the mechanisms that target integrins to specific intracellular compartments and how this may be controlled. Although Rab proteins are known to bind a multiplicity of diverse effectors (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>), only a few examples demonstrate an interaction between a Rab GTPase and a cargo molecule (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Seachrist et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">van IJzendoorn et al., 2002</xref>). We identify Rab21 and Rab5 as integrin-associated proteins and positive regulators of integrin traffic.</p>

        <title>Identification of Î²1-integrins as Rab21-associated molecules</title>
        <p>To identify novel integrin-interacting proteins, we screened a mouse embryonic cDNA library using Î±2-integrin cytoplasmic domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The bait comprised the conserved membrane-proximal sequence shared by most Î±-integrin subunits followed by the Î±2-specific segment. Several positive clones encoded the COOH-terminal part of Rab21. Rab21 is a ubiquitously expressed and poorly characterized member of the Rab family that has recently been shown to function on the endocytic pathway (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>The ability of Rab21 to associate with integrins was further confirmed in human cells. GFP-tagged Rab21 coprecipitated with Î±2Î²1-integrin, a collagen binding molecule (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Takada and Hemler, 1989</xref>), in cells plated either on collagen or on plastic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), indicating a constant, rather than a matrix adhesionâinducible, association between the two proteins. Furthermore, Rab21 was found to associate with several Î±/Î²1-integrin heterodimers. Rab21 coprecipitated with chimeric integrins containing the extracellular domain of Î±2-integrin fused to the cytoplasmic domains of either Î±1- or Î±5-integrin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and endogenous integrins that were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Î±1, Î±2, Î±5, Î±6, and Î²1 subunits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1</ext-link>). These data suggest that the association involves the shared conserved membrane-proximal segment present in most Î±-subunit cytoplasmic domains. To get evidence for the association with an independent method, we performed yeast two-hybrid studies with Î±-tail mutants. In remating tests, we found that the COOH-terminal part of Rab21 (amino acids 95â222) was able to associate with the cytoplasmic tails of Î±2- and Î±11-integrin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Introduction of a proline residue adjacent to the conserved membrane-proximal sequence (Î±2P, to create a conformational change into the Î±2 tail) markedly weakened the association between the Î±2 cytoplasmic domain and Rab21, whereas mutagenesis of a conserved positive charge in Î±2A (K1160) and Î±11A (R1170) tails had no effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). To further characterize the Rab21âintegrin association, we generated several mutants of Î±2-integrin. All of these mutants were expressed and mediated adhesion to collagen in transiently transfected CHO cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref> and not depicted; see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). Mutagenesis of residue R1161 (in Î±2AA and Î±2AAKYA, removing another conserved charged residue) to alanine significantly reduced Î±2 tail association with Rab21 judged by yeast mating tests and immunoprecipitations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). In addition, F1159A mutation (Î±2AARA, possibly creating a conformational change) showed reduced association in the yeast assays, whereas in immunoprecipitations the reduction was not significant. These data on the mutant integrins suggest that the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain and residue R1161 of Î±2-integrin are important for the Rab21 association. Finally, endogenous Î²1-integrins readily associated with endogenous Rab21 and to some extent Rab5 proteins in vivo. These associations were specific, as Rab7 and Rab11 failed to coprecipitate Î²1-integrin from these cells, even though separately all proteins were efficiently immunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p>

        <p>Next, we studied the enzyme activity dependence of the association between integrins and Rab21. A Rab21 mutant (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2004</xref>) that has defects in GTP hydrolysis (Rab21 Q76L, designated Rab21GTP) showed a 10â73% increase in its ability to associate with integrins in different cell lines when compared with Rab21 wild type (WT). In contrast, a mutant having defects in the binding of GTP (Rab21 T31N, designated Rab21GDP) showed a 26â35% decrease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; and Table S1). In addition, Rab21 with a deletion in the COOH terminus (Rab21c-del; residues 1â144) demonstrated inefficient association with the Î²1-integrins in vivo (37 Â± 10% decrease; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Table S1).</p>

        <title>Rab21 regulates the subcellular localization of Î²1-integrins</title>
        <p>The cellular localization of endogenous Î²1-integrins, Rab5A, and Rab21 was studied in MDA-MB-231 cells. Î²1-Integrin was detected by the NH2-terminally binding antibody in the lumen of endogenous Rab5- and Rab21-positive large vesicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>, arrowheads). In addition, these cells also harbor large endogenous EEA1-positive endosomes that stained positive for Rab5A but showed very limited overlap with Rab21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>, arrows). Î±/Î²1- Integrin heterodimers can be expressed in active (extracellular domain detected by a monoclonal antibody HUTS21; active-Î²1 antibody) and inactive forms on the cell surface (extracellular domain of both forms detected by P5D2; pan-Î²1 antibody; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lenter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Luque et al., 1996</xref>). Expression of Rab21 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells altered the subcellular localization of the total pool of Î²1-integrins. Cells expressing GFP-Rab21 contained numerous Î²1-integrinâpositive vesicles (compare the nontransfected cell [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, asterisk] and the transfected cell [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>]). The majority of these had GFP-Rab21 on their limiting membrane (72 Â± 8% of pan-Î²1âpositive vesicles and 68 Â± 10% of active-Î²1âpositive vesicles; <italic>n</italic> = 20 cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). The recruitment of integrins to Rab21-positive intracellular structures was confirmed using two additional antibodies recognizing active-Î²1-integrin (12G10 [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Mould et al., 1995</xref>] and P4G11 [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wayner et al., 1993</xref>]; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, J and K</xref>). Similar to previous observations on breast cancer cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 1999</xref>), the ECM proteins collagen and fibronectin were also detected in the endocytic structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 L</xref> and not depicted). Interestingly, both Rab21 mutants induced marked alterations in the cellular distribution of Î²1-integrins. GFP-Rab21GTP showed a tubular- vesicular staining pattern that largely overlaps with the ER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>; and not depicted), and active-Î²1-integrin was detected in smaller and more irregularly shaped endocytotic integrin vesicles, whereas the pan-Î²1 antibody detected Î²1-integrin at the membrane, diffusely in the cytosol and accumulated in the large vacuolar structures. Strikingly, expression of GFP-Rab21GDP induced localization of active-Î²1 into large focal adhesions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>, arrows), which are rarely detected in these highly motile cells endogenously (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). GFP-Rab21GDP variant but not GFP-Rab21GTP was also seen at membrane ruffles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>, arrows).</p>

        <p>Proper membrane targeting of Rab21 was also mandatory for the regulation of integrin localization in vivo. Mutagenesis of the putative COOH-terminal prenylation motif (CCXXX; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Opdam et al., 2000</xref>) in Rab21 resulted in a complete loss of vesicular localization of Rab21 (GFP-Rab21CCSS; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, H and I</xref>) and a 55â62% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) less efficient association with Î²1-integrins as compared with the Rab21WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 M</xref>). Cells transfected with GFP-Rab21CCSS showed prominent focal adhesions (active-Î²1 antibody; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>, arrows) when compared with the vesicular pattern observed in the nontransfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>, asterisk). Interestingly, these effects on integrin distribution were almost indistinguishable from that of Rab21GDP mutant (see the previous paragraph).</p>

        <title>Rab21 regulates integrin traffic and associates with the internalized Î²1-integrin</title>
        <p>To analyze the dynamics of integrin internalization, we investigated the ability of different Rabs to coprecipitate surface-labeled integrin before and after internalization. Interestingly, Rab5 and Rab21 antibodies very weakly coimmunoprecipitated biotinylated â¼160-kD proteins located on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, no internalization). After 15 min of internalization, Rab5/21, but not Rab7, associated with biotinylated plasma membraneâderived â¼160-kD protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, internalization 15 min, lanes 1 and 2). Reimmunoprecipitation revealed that Î²1-integrin was present, possibly with other plasma membraneâderived proteins, in the biotinylated Rab5/21 coprecipitating fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, internalization 15 min, lane 3), indicating that integrins associate with Rabs mainly after internalization. Further colocalization and internalization studies showed that internalized Î²1-integrins originally traverse through the same compartment as transferrin but, subsequently, the integrin traffics into separate, mainly GFP-Rab21âpositive vesicles that can also contain caveolin, whereas transferrin remains colocalized extensively with GFP-Rab5 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1</ext-link>). In these cells, internalized integrin did not colocalize with GFP-Rab11 (not depicted).</p>

        <p>We also found that Rab5 and Rab21 regulated integrin internalization/recycling. The most rapid integrin internalization was observed in GFP-Rab5âexpressing cells, in which 82â100% of the surface-labeled receptor internalized within 5 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). GFP-Rab21 but not -Rab11 induced integrin internalization as well (74â86% after 10 min). Importantly, transferrin endocytosis was unaltered by Rab21 expression, suggesting that Rab21 does not influence the traffic of endosomally translocated receptors in general (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1</ext-link>). We are aware that we have not excluded the effects of Rab21 expression for all types of unspecific internalization (e.g., macropinocytosis), but at least its closest homologues (Rab5 and Rab22) have not been shown to affect macropinocytosis (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rosenfeld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kauppi et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the internalized receptor recycled rapidly back to the cell surface in Rab5- and Rab21-expressing cells with &gt;50% of the labeled pool being recycled during a 15-min chase (detected by the reduction in the amount of biotinylated receptor in these cells where cell surface biotin is cleaved). Integrin internalization was reduced by expression of GFP-Rab21GDP, whereas GFP-Rab21GTP induced a steady accumulation of the internalized receptor when compared with GFP-, Rab5-, Rab11-, and Rab21GDP-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, 30-min chase). Importantly, knock down of endogenous Rab21 reduced the amount of rapidly internalized integrin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> min).</p>
        <p>In density gradient fractionations, expression of GFP-Rab21 shifted the integrins toward the denser Rab-positive fractions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>), and GFP-Rab21 cofractionated with Î±2-integrin in fractions 3â9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). A further shift in the endogenous integrin pool (to fractions 5â11) was observed upon expression of GFP-Rab21GTP, and GFP-Rab21GDP was also observed in the denser fractions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). In the lighter fractions (3â5), GFP-Rab21 and integrin were found to cosediment with the Golgi-marker GM130, whereas in the denser fractions, cosedimentation was observed with the ER marker P115 (fractions 6â8) and EEA1 (fractions 7â9; Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1</ext-link>). This data, together with the abundance of integrin vesicles observed in Rab21-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), suggests that Rab21 targets integrins to the endocytic fraction in human cells.</p>
        <p>Further characterization of the large intracellular structures induced by GFP-Rab21 overexpression was performed by electron microscopy and immunogold labeling of GFP (Fig. S3, B and C). Overexpressed GFP-Rab21 was found predominantly on the limiting membranes of large multivesicular body (MVB)âlike structures and in numerous vesicles surrounding it (Fig. S3, B and C), thus resembling the doughnut-shaped structures observed by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

        <title>Rab21 expression induces motile GFP-integrin vesicles in live cells and displays bidirectional vesicle motility to and from the plasma membrane</title>
        <p>We used time-lapse imaging to visualize the kinetics of Rab21 in real time. GFP-Rab21 was detected in large, swollen endosome-resembling structures, as well as in motile, smaller vesicles, which moved bidirectionally between the cytosol and the cell edges at velocity ranging from 0.75â2.25 Î¼m/s (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, vesicles B and C; and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200509019/DC1</ext-link>). Small vesicles were observed interacting with each other and associating with bright Rab21-containing domains on the larger Rab21-positive structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, vesicle A) identical to the Î²1-integrinâcontaining vesicles seen in our immunofluorescence stainings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Fig. S1). The short-range motion of the Rab21 vesicles at the cell periphery was sensitive to the disruption of actin filaments with 20 Î¼M cytochalasin (unpublished data), and the long-range curvilinear movements observed in the cell body were abolished upon treatment with 5 Î¼M nocodazole (unpublished data), suggesting a role for actin and microtubules. Combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM; pseudocolored green) and conventional widefield epifluorescence analysis (pseudocolored red) showed GFP-Rab21 vesicles emanating from the membrane into the cell (changing from green to red/yellow) and back or vice versa (although formally this technique does not exclude the possibility that some vesicles will by chance come closer and further away from the plasma membrane). The intensity plots show rapid changes in the intensities of the signal in the green channel, whereas the signal in the red channel remains constant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref> and Video 2). No obvious diffusion of the bright Rab21 structures was seen using TIRFM, indicating either that the Rab21-labeled structures remain as distinct domains on the plasma membrane or that they do not fuse with the membrane. This former possibility correlates well with the observation that upon binding the small vesicles seem to remain as bright patches on the limiting membranes of the intracellular large Rab21-positive structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Real-time imaging and TIRFM confirmed that the intact GTP/GDP cycling of Rab21 was crucial for its vesicular traffic because motile small vesicles were not detected in GFP-Rab21GDPâtransfected cells and Rab21 was associated with rather static structures at the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref> and Video 3). These resemble YFP-talinâpositive structures detected by TIRFM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) and may represent adhesion structures that have reduced turnover because of the expression of GFP- Rab21GDP and possibly its association with Î²1-integrin.</p>

        <p>We also addressed whether Rab21 expression alters the motility of integrins in live cells.

        <title>Rab21 regulates cell adhesion and migration of breast and prostate cancer cells</title>
        <p>To investigate the importance of Rab21-mediated integrin traffic in Î²1-integrinâdependent cell adhesion, we studied MDA-MB-231 breast and PC3 prostate cancer cells having relatively high and low endogenous Rab21 expression, respectively (unpublished data). Of all the Rabs tested, overexpressed Rab21 was most efficient in increasing cell adhesion to collagen (86 Â± 8% in PC3 cells and 22% in MDA-MB-231 cells; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>) during the initial 30 min of adhesion. Rab21 expression did not enhance the initial adhesion step of cells plated on fibronectin or vitronectin (Fig. S2 B). Expression of Rab5 increased adhesion by 48 Â± 13% in PC3 cells. The GTP/GDP cycling of Rab21 was found to be important for supporting integrin function because the Rab21 mutants were unable to induce cell adhesion to collagen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). The lack of dominant effects of the mutants is probably due to the fact that their ectopic expression is not sufficient to interfere with the high number of endogenous associations between integrins and Rabs involved in regulating adhesion/migration, whereas introduction of Rab21WT supports adhesion to collagen by further increasing the endosomal traffic of Î±/Î²1-integrin heterodimers. Overexpression of GFP-Rab5, -Rab11, -Rab21, or -Rab21GTP did not influence the amount of Î²1-integrin detected on the surface of MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>) and PC3 cells (not depicted), suggesting that efficient transport of endocytosed integrins to newly formed sites of adhesion, rather than a change in the steady-state expression of integrins on the cell surface, is the basis of Rab21-induced cell adhesion. Interestingly, GFP-Rab21GDP caused a modest increase in Î²1-integrin surface expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Thus, Rab21GDP both inhibits integrin traffic and increases cell surface levels of integrins. This induction of two counteracting forces further explains the lack of dominant-negative effects on adhesion. Most important, specific silencing of Rab21 with two different RNAi oligos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>) resulted in a 30% reduction in the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to collagen. As no down-regulation of Î²1-integrin was observed, the effect of Rab21 knockdown is most likely due to inefficient integrin traffic. Finally, to demonstrate that Rab21âintegrin association is involved in Rab21-induced cell adhesion, we used the mutant Î±2-integrins with reduced Rab21 binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). CHO cells lack endogenous collagen receptors. Transient expression of Î±2WT, Î±2AA (deficient Rab21 association), or Î±2A (unaltered Rab21 association), together with Rluc, enabled equivalent adhesion of these cells to collagen (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>, bottom). Rluc-Rab21 induced adhesion to collagen when coexpressed with Î±2WT- or Î±2A-integrins but failed to do so with Î±2AA-integrin mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>, top). Furthermore, coexpression of Rluc-Rab21 induced vesicular localization of GFP-Î±2WT but had no effect on the cellular distribution of GFP-Î±2AA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report the discovery of a previously unknown association between integrins and Rab proteins. We show that Rab5 and Rab21 associate with internalized integrins. Furthermore, Rab21 expression is shown to regulate integrin-containing focal adhesions and adhesion and migration of breast and prostate cancer cells. Live-cell imaging revealed that Rab21-positive vesicles move between the plasma membrane and the cell body and that expression of Rab21 modulates vesicular motility of integrins in vivo.</p>
      <p>Although it is clear that the endocytic traffic of integrins involves a complex machinery of kinases, motor proteins, and members of the Rab family of GTPases, how integrins are actually targeted to the intracellular vesicles has remained enigmatic. The identification of integrin association with the putative early endosomal Rab21 led us to identify a functional relationship between integrin association with Rab21 and Rab5 and the regulation of cell adhesion. Several studies have demonstrated integrin endocytosis into intracellular vesicles and their recycling back to the membrane (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bretscher, 1989</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). In serum-starved cells stably adhering to tissue culture plastic, integrins have been shown to be transported to a perinuclear recycling compartment. Upon growth factor stimulus, internalized integrins either recycle very rapidly back to the plasma membrane from the perinuclear compartment (Î²1-integrins; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Powelka et al., 2004</xref>) or are completely rerouted to a short-loop trafficking pathway directly back to the membrane (Î±vÎ²3-integrin; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2004</xref>). The existence of a Rabâintegrin association, which positively regulates cell adhesion, provides a missing mechanistic link into the orchestration of this complex process. We show on one hand that the motility of Rab21 vesicles close to the plasma membrane requires the actin cytoskeleton and, on the other hand, that expression of Rab21 mutants with impaired GTP binding or membrane localization induce integrin targeting to the membrane and the formation of exaggerated adhesion sites. This is in agreement with the recent finding that integrins in newly forming protrusions travel on actin cables associated to motor protein Myosin X and that normal cell adhesion and spreading during the initial stages of adhesion seem to require the efficient motility of integrins close to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>There is only limited data available on the dynamics of integrins in cells. One study demonstrates the internalization of GFP-tagged integrin in live cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Laukaitis et al., 2001</xref>). However, no integrin movements back to the plasma membrane were seen. Although the role of Rab proteins was not addressed in the study of <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Laukaitis et al. (2001)</xref>, it is intriguing to note that the large vesicles they described are remarkably similar to the structures induced here by the overexpression of GFP-Rab21. We show here that these large structures resemble MVBs. MVBs are generally thought of as being major protein sorting stations in the endocytic pathway. Proteins at their limiting membrane can be packaged into transport vesicles destined to the cell surface or to the TGN. Alternatively, proteins can be targeted to inwardly budding vesicles of the MVBs. These latter are considered to be the exosomes secreted after fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fevrier and Raposo, 2004</xref>). The observation that overexpressed GFP-Rab21 is seen mainly in the limiting membrane and vesicles surrounding the MVBs points to an involvement of the MVBs in recycling vesicles back to the plasma membrane. The enlargement of the MVBs and accumulation of the vesicles most likely is the result of overexpression of the Rab21 protein, indicating its role in traffic to the MVBs. Our data does not unambiguously show whether integrins and Rabs interact directly. The facts that the association was detected from a yeast two-hybrid screen and that it is abrogated by mutagenesis of the Î±-cytoplasmic domain suggest that it may be direct. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that as-yet-unknown proteins that are capable of binding to the integrin may serve as linkers between Rab21 and integrins. We were unable to detect direct interaction of GST-Rab21 with synthetic integrin cytoplasmic tail peptides. However, this does not necessarily mean that the interaction is not direct. It is possible that the peptides are not presented in a correct conformation for the interaction to occur. Evidence from detailed biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance studies (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stefansson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Vinogradova et al., 2004</xref>) indicates that upon integrin activation the membrane-proximal regions of the integrin cytoplasmic tails move out of the membrane into the cytoplasm, revealing the highly conserved residues to the cytoplasmic face and involving substantial structural changes in the cytoplasmic tails. We show that Rab21âintegrin association occurs downstream of the internalization step and that a substantial portion of the internalized integrin is in an active conformation as detected by the activation epitopeâspecific antibodies. This is in line with our data showing that the association is mediated via the membrane proximalâconserved segment of the Î±-subunit COOH terminus, with conserved residue R1161 being especially important, and that the association seems to be Î±-tail conformation sensitive.</p>
      <p>Prenylation-dependent membrane targeting of Rabs is crucial for Rab function as regulators of vesicle fusion in intracellular protein trafficking (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Desnoyers et al., 1996</xref>). We show that the mutagenesis of the putative prenylation motif in Rab21 results in complete loss of its vesicular localization. At the same time, this variant shows reduced association with Î²1-integrins and upon overexpression induces integrin localization on the plasma membrane and in large focal adhesions (by targeting the integrins or by blocking the internalization).</p>

        <title>Rab21 and integrin internalization routes</title>
        <p>Endocytosis encompasses several routes of internalization. The entry route of integrins remains somewhat unclear and may vary between different heterodimers. Integrins have been shown to internalize in a dynamin and PKCÎ±-dependent manner after ligand binding (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 1999</xref>). Internalized Î²1-integrins are then targeted to caveosomes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Upla et al., 2004</xref>) or transferrin-positive endosomes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Laukaitis et al., 2001</xref>) depending on the heterodimer, the cell type, and the stimulus used. Recent data showing that the caveolar and endosomal pathways intersect (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Pelkmans et al., 2004</xref>) and our data showing caveolin-1âpositive domains on Rab5- and Rab21-positive integrinâcontaining vesicles provide a possible explanation for these variable integrin trafficking routes. We show that several different integrin heterodimers associate with Rab21. This association may serve to target integrins that initially enter the cell via different routes to the same trafficking pathway.</p>
        <p>From the live-cell TIRFM studies, it is obvious that Rab21-positive structures traffic from the cell body to the plasma membrane, possibly delivering integrins to adhesion sites. This correlates well with the previous work showing that Î±5-integrin engagement initiates the newly forming adhesions and serves to organize proteins like paxillin in these sites (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Laukaitis et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>We show here that Rab21 expression induces cell motility and adhesion to collagen and to human bone in vitro. Importantly, Rab21 is also able to induce the endosomal traffic of integrins. Interestingly, emerging evidence implicates alterations in the Rab small GTPases and their associated regulatory proteins and effectors in multiple human diseases, including cancer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>). In conclusion, the identification of Rab21âintegrin association opens new opportunities for investigating the detailed mechanisms underlying the adhesion and migration of cells in vivo in diseases like cancer metastasis.</p>

For immunoprecipitations with endogenous proteins, confluent MDA-MB-231 cells (20 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) were collected from plastic plates with cold PBS. For analysis of association with cell surfaceâlabeled integrin, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes for 1 h and surface biotinylated with cleavable biotin (0.5 mg/ml EZ-sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in HANKS buffer) for 30 min on ice. After washings, cells were either lysed immediately or warmed for 15 min in HANKS +37Â°C to allow internalization. Cells were lysed in IP buffer (PBS with 1% octylglycoside, 0.5% BSA, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) on ice for 15 min. Postcentrifugation supernatant was precleared with BSA-blocked (IP buffer) protein Gâagarose beads and divided into five aliquots for immunoprecipitations with different anti-Rab antibodies or a control antibody and protein G beads (90-min rotation at 4Â°C). After three washings (IP buffer containing 0.3% octylglycoside), SDS sample buffer was added and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4%/10%) and immunoblotted for Î²1-integrin (MAB2252).
