        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial calcium accumulation was recently shown to depend on a complex composed of an inner-membrane channel (MCU and MCUb) and regulatory subunits (MICU1, MCUR1, and EMRE). A fundamental property of MCU is low activity at resting cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, preventing deleterious Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and organelle overload. Here we demonstrate that these properties are ensured by a regulatory heterodimer composed of two proteins with opposite effects, MICU1 and MICU2, which, both in purified lipid bilayers and in intact cells, stimulate and inhibit MCU activity, respectively. Both MICU1 and MICU2 are regulated by calcium through their EF-hand domains, thus accounting for the sigmoidal response of MCU to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] inÂ situ and allowing tight physiological control. At low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the dominant effect of MICU2 largely shuts down MCU activity; at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the stimulatory effect of MICU1 allows the prompt response of mitochondria to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated in the cytoplasm.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondrial calcium homeostasis bears unique properties in the orchestrated flow of the cation across plasma membrane and organelle channels. Indeed, the key biological function of mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation, requires the steady presence of a very large electrical gradient across the ion-impermeable inner membrane (â¼180Â mV), which represents a continuous, huge driving force for the accumulation of a divalent cation into the matrix (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Rizzuto etÂ al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, whereas pulsatile, transient increases in matrix [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>), which occur in stimulated cells, are essential for stimulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dehydrogenases and upregulating ATP production (<xref rid="bib9 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jouaville etÂ al., 1999; McCormack etÂ al., 1990</xref>), continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in resting conditions would on the one hand imply vicious cycling of the cation, with conspicuous energy drain, and on the other cause morphological alterations underlying the release of apoptotic cofactors and/or the bioenergetic dysfunction of necrosis (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Rizzuto etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (<xref rid="bib1 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Baughman etÂ al., 2011; De Stefani etÂ al., 2011</xref>), the uptake route of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into mitochondria, has long been known to have a sigmoidal response to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], with very low uptake rates at the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of the cytoplasm, which rapidly rise when the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the proximity of mitochondria reaches a threshold value (&gt;10Â Î¼M) (<xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib8 bib19" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 1999, 2010; Giacomello etÂ al., 2010; Rizzuto etÂ al., 1998</xref>). Thus, after its recent molecular identification, attention was directed toward the gatekeeping mechanisms of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, given the fundamental relevance of this process for the suppression of mitochondria-dependent cell-death pathways.</p>
      <p>Two recent elegant papers (<xref rid="bib5 bib12" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013; Mallilankaraman etÂ al., 2012</xref>) showed that molecular ablation of MICU1 leads to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation at low, near to resting cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], thus indicating that this protein, originally identified as a positive effector of MCU (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Perocchi etÂ al., 2010</xref>), is necessary also for inhibiting its activity at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. This observation, which implied a complex functional interaction between MCU and MICU1, was the starting point of this study, in which we demonstrate that MICU2 is the genuine gatekeeper of MCU. Indeed, MICU2 inhibits the channel activity of purified MCU in planar lipid bilayers and, accordingly, reduces channel opening at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in intact HeLa cells. In contrast, MICU1 has a stimulatory role in MCU activity, both in electrophysiological analyses of purified MCU and in agonist-challenged intact cells. In cells, MICU2 forms an obligate heterodimer with MICU1 located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In MICU1-silenced cells, MICU2 is also eliminated and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> gatekeeping is abolished, in agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="bib5 bib12" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013; Mallilankaraman etÂ al., 2012</xref>).</p>

        <title>MICU1 and MICU2 Form a 95Â kDa Dimer through a Disulfide Bond</title>
        <p>To unravel the extraordinary complexity of the role of MICU1 inÂ the control of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, we investigated the possibility that MICU1 is part of a higher-order complex including molecules with different effects on MCU function. MICU1 ablation could thus destabilize such a complex, accounting for a dual effect on MCU activity (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013</xref>). In search of the putative partner, we drew our attention to MICU2, a recently identified homolog of MICU1 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Plovanich etÂ al., 2013</xref>) that differs in molecular weight (45Â kDa versus 50Â kDa of MICU1) and has a sequence similarity of 42% at the protein level. Both MICU1 and MICU2 showed exclusive mitochondrial distribution, as revealed by colocalization with the mitochondrial marker Tom20 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). Moreover, in order to confirm the previously reported MICU1-MICU2 interaction (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Plovanich etÂ al., 2013</xref>), we performed a FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based protein-protein interaction assay in living cells. We thus generated and imaged different combinations of GFP- and mCherry-tagged MICU1 and MICU2 proteins. Significant FRET (evaluated by acceptor photobleaching as previously described; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Raffaello etÂ al., 2013</xref>) was observed in all tested conditions, thus confirming that MICU1-MICU2 interaction occurs inÂ situ in living cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B). Finally, we checked for the intraorganellar distribution of the MICU1-MICU2 complex: proteinase K protection experiments in isolated mitoplasts indicated localization in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C), in agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then investigated whether MICU1 and MICU2 are present as higher molecular weight complexes in conditions in which disulfide bonding is preserved. We thus carried out immunoblotÂ analyses in reducing and nonreducing conditions. In the latter case, MICU1 immunoblotting revealed essentially only a 95Â kDa band (instead of the predicted 50Â kDa band of the monomer), whereas in the presence of 100Â mM dithiothreitol (DTT) theÂ immunoblot revealed the unique presence of the 50Â kDa monomeric form (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Similarly, MICU2 immunoblotting revealed the same 95Â kDa protein in nonreducing conditions, suggestive of MICU1-MICU2 heterodimerization, and a 45Â kDa band, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the MICU2 monomer, in reducing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). We then independently silenced MICU1 and MICU2. In the former case, as expected, the MICU1 immunoblot showed a drastic reduction of the 95Â kDa and 50Â kDa bands of the nonreducing and reducing gels, respectively. Strikingly, when MICU1 was silenced, the MICU2 immunoblot revealed a dramatic reduction also of MICU2. This was not due to an off-target effect of the siRNA used, because the MICU2 mRNA levels were unaffected (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>A available online), indicating that MICU1 is required for MICU2 stability, as also previously reported (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Plovanich etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, when MICU2 was silenced, the reduction of MICU2 levels was not paralleled by a MICU1 decrease. Rather, a higher molecular weight band (â¼100Â kDa) appeared, suggestive of MICU1 homodimerization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>To test the hypothesis that the MICU1-MICU2 interaction depends on the formation of a disulfide bond, we generated epitope-tagged mutants of MICU1 and MICU2 in which a highlyÂ conserved cysteine was mutated (MICU1<sup>C465A</sup> and MICU2<sup>C410A</sup>). Then, epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant MICU1 or MICU2 was overexpressed alone or in combination and the effect on the formation of MICU1-MICU2 dimers was investigated. When MICU1-HA was overexpressed alone, it appeared as a prominent 100Â kDa dimer, with a minor fraction appearing as a monomer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). If, however, MICU2 was coexpressed, then the prominent band was at 95Â kDa (corresponding to the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer), again with a minor fraction as a monomer. Conversely, when MICU2 was overexpressed alone, it appeared mostly as a 45Â kDa monomer, with a very faint 95Â kDa band corresponding in size to the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). These data not only confirm the notion that MICU1 and MICU2 dimerize but also that MICU2, distinct from MICU1, only forms MICU1-MICU2 heterodimers. Then we expressed the MICU1<sup>C465A</sup> and MICU2<sup>C410A</sup> mutants. When expressed alone, they gave rise only to the 50Â kDa and 45Â kDa bands of MICU1 and MICU2, respectively. The same results, however, were obtained when they were coexpressed with the wild-type MICU2 and MICU1 counterparts, indicating that both conserved cysteine residues are necessary for the formation of MICU1-MICU2 dimers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Moreover, mutation of the other cysteine residues in MICU1 did not impair dimer formation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>B), confirming the specificity of the Cys<sup>465</sup>-dependent dimeric structure. The notion was corroborated by coimmunoprecipitation data. HeLa cells were cotransfected with epitope-tagged MICU1 and MICU2 moieties (MICU1-HA, MICU1<sup>C465A</sup>-HA, MICU2-Flag, and MICU2<sup>C410A</sup>-Flag) and lysed, and then the antibody to Flag-tagged MICU2 immunoprecipitated MICU1 and the antibody to HA-tagged MICU1 immunoprecipitated MICU2. Conversely, when the indicated cysteine residues were mutated no coimmunoprecipitation occurred, indicating that the MICU1-MICU2 interaction was lost (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>The last piece of information we derived from these biochemical analyses was the structural requirements for the interaction of the MICU complex with MCU. Based on recent, detailed analysis of MCU topology (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Martell etÂ al., 2012</xref>), which proposed that only a short protein loop of MCU is exposed in the intermembrane space (EYSWDIMEP), the interaction domain could in principle be mapped to a very defined region. For this purpose, we took advantage of an MCU mutant (MCU<sup>D260N,E263Q</sup>) in which ion permeation through MCU was altered by modifying critical residues of this short sequence (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Raffaello etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, whereas wild-type MCU could efficiently immunoprecipitate both MICU1 and MICU2, the MCU<sup>D260N,E263Q</sup> mutant was almost unable to bind MICU1-MICU2 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>A). For the interaction with MCU, the MICU1-MICU2 dimer appeared critical. Indeed, when dimer formation was abolished (e.g., by overexpressing MICU2<sup>C410A</sup>-Flag), MCU was not coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-Flag antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). Notably, MICU1 could still interact with MCU in the absenceÂ of MICU2, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation carried out in MICU2-silenced cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>B). Moreover, we verified that the overexpression of both the wild-type and mutant MICU1 and MICU2 did not alter the assembly of the MCU-containing complex through blue native PAGE (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>C). Overall, these data suggest that MICU2 necessarily dimerizesÂ with MICU1. We thus analyzed the functional role of this complex by dissecting the genuine contribution of MICU1 and MICU2 to the regulation of MCU in the next set of experiments.</p>

        <p>We initially characterized the effect of MICU1 on the isolated MCU protein. For this purpose, recombinant MCU and MICU1 were produced (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>A), and then MCU was inserted into planar lipid bilayers and electrophysiological recordings were carried out, as previously reported (<xref rid="bib6 bib18" ref-type="bibr">De Stefani etÂ al., 2011; Raffaello etÂ al., 2013</xref>). To rule out the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> itselfÂ on MICU1 activity, all experiments were carried out with Na<sup>+</sup> as the permeating ion. When MCU currents were recorded in a sodium-gluconate low-divalent solution (10 pM calculated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), channel activity with a conductance of 55 pS (versus 6.2 pS as previously reported; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">De Stefani etÂ al., 2011</xref>) could be observed at negative voltage ranges applied to the <italic>cis</italic> compartment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A, left), in accordance with the known characteristic of calcium channels to allow the flux of Na<sup>+</sup> upon removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Talavera and Nilius, 2006</xref>). Indeed, in agreement with results on MCU studied in mitoplasts (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Kirichok etÂ al., 2004</xref>), the conductance of the channel was significantly higher in the low-divalent solution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A) than in 100Â mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">De Stefani etÂ al., 2011</xref>), and even a small increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] resulted in the decrease of the unitary Na<sup>+</sup> current (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>B). Under low-divalent conditions (10 pM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), addition of MICU1 to MCU did not alter channel activity in terms of conductance and open probability (1.2Â Â± 0.3-fold change; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). In contrast, when MICU1 was added to MCU recorded in sodium-gluconate containing â¼1Â Î¼M free calcium a clear effect was observed within tens of seconds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D), namely the increase in open probability (3.1Â Â± 0.9-fold increase), whereas the conductance and sensitivity to ruthenium red inhibitor were unchanged (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>C). Overall, a clear stimulatory effect of MICU1 on MCU activity was observed in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> but no inhibitory effect at low or absent Ca<sup>2+</sup>, arguing against a direct gatekeeping mechanism.</p>

        <title>Both MICU1 Silencing and Overexpressing Increase Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> Loading</title>
        <p>We thus proceeded to studies in intact HeLa cells, in which MICU1 was either overexpressed or silenced. In the first case, the MICU1-HA construct was recombinantly expressed in HeLa cells. Parallel [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> measurements showed a marked enhancement of the transient rise evoked by stimulation with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonist histamine (100Â Î¼M; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A), in agreement with the stimulatory effect on MCU revealed by electrophysiological analyses. Then, MICU1-silencing experiments were carried out by using specific siRNAs. Under those conditions, the histamine-dependent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks were markedly greater (174% increase in MICU1 overexpression, 156% increase in MICU1 silencing), as revealed by a coexpressed aequorin-based mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). In addition, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading of nonstimulated cells, measured by coexpressing a high-affinity GFP-based fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (2mtGCaMP6m), was markedly increased (430% of control; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C). Finally, the intrinsic mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake efficiency of MICU1-silenced HeLa cells was verified in permeabilized cells. After permeabilization in EGTA-containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free intracellular buffer (IB/EGTA), Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation was initiated by switching the perfusion buffer to IB containing an EGTA-buffered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of 400Â nM. MICU1-silenced cells showed an 8-fold greater rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). As an additional control, we verified that MICU1 silencing does not alter mitochondrial morphology (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>) or the expression levels of other components of mitochondrial calcium uptake machinery such as MCU and the recently identified EMRE (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>A). Overall, in agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="bib5 bib12" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013; Mallilankaraman etÂ al., 2012</xref>), MICU1 silencing appears associated with the release of a constitutive MCU inhibition. However, considering that the electrophysiological data suggested that MICU1 itself is not the inhibitory subunit and that MICU1 silencing causes the ablation of the whole MICU1-MICU2 dimer, we focused our attention on the detailed role of MICU2 in the control of mitochondrial calcium uptake.</p>

        <title>MICU2 Is the Genuine Negative Regulator of MCU</title>
        <p>We thus investigated the effect of MICU2 silencing on agonist-dependent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> transients of intact HeLa cells. We first evaluated the effect of MICU2 silencing, namely the condition that not only removes the MICU1 partner, possibly endowed with an inhibitory effect on MCU, but also causes the formation of homodimers of the MCU stimulator, MICU1. Indeed, in MICU2-silenced cells, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peak evoked by stimulation with 100Â Î¼M histamine was markedly greater (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). Again, this effect is not secondary to changes in mitochondrial morphology (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>) or in the expression of MCU and EMRE (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>A). We then proceeded to the analysis of MICU2-overexpressing HeLa cells. When these cells were challenged with histamine (100Â Î¼M), the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peak was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B). These data, indicating an inverse correlation between MICU2 levels and MCU activity, strongly argue for a role of MICU2 as the authentic MCU gatekeeper. We thus proceeded to the direct investigation of the channel activity of purified MCU in the presence or absence of MICU2 purified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>). In order to fully appreciate the gatekeeping effect (i.e., channel activity at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), measurements were carried out in a sodium-gluconate low-divalent solution (10 pM calculated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) as described above. In these conditions, addition of MICU2 inhibits the MCU-dependent current (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5D). Overall, the data support the notion that MICU2 is a bona fide MCU inhibitor.</p>

        <title>Functional Crosstalk between MICU1 and MICU2</title>
        <p>Finally, we investigated the functional interaction between MICU1 and MICU2, and the putative regulatory mechanism of the heterodimer. In untransfected cells, the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer was the only detected protein form (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S6</xref> for quantification of protein levels in these series of experiments). When MICU1 was overexpressed, the MICU1 homodimer was predominant (higher 100Â kDa band) and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> transients were increased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). When MICU1 was overexpressed in MICU2-silenced cells, the MICU1 homodimer was the only available form, and histamine-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks were even higher (150% greater than in control; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). When MICU1 and MICU2 were both overexpressed (thus leading to an increase of the heterodimer only), the MICU1-dependent potentiation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> responses was almost abolished (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B). We thus tested the MICU2 gatekeeping properties by overexpressing its target, MCU. MCU-overexpressing cells not only showed greater agonist-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">De Stefani etÂ al., 2011</xref>) but also higher resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> values (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C), most likely due to the imbalanced overexpression of the channel without its gatekeeper. In this configuration, coexpression of MCU and MICU1 failed to recover normal resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>, showing just a modest reduction, probably due to partial MICU2 stabilization (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Plovanich etÂ al., 2013</xref>). On the contrary, the concomitant expression of MCU, MICU1, and MICU2, which substantially increased the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimers, efficiently rescued normal values of basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>, thus demonstrating the MICU2 requirement of guaranteeing gatekeeping capabilities (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Calcium-Dependent Functional Regulation of the MICU Complex</title>
        <p>As for the regulatory mechanisms, both the gatekeeper (MICU2) and the stimulator (MICU1) have conserved EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in their sequences that sense the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase of an agonist-stimulated cell. Mutation of these sites (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> for details) demonstrated their critical role for the function of both proteins, in agreement with the electrophysiological data. For MICU1, the mutant acted as a dominant negative, as overexpression of MICU1<sup>EFmut</sup> reduced the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D), thus genuinely uncovering the loss of cooperativity upon MCU opening (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013</xref>). The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> peaks were also markedly reduced with the MICU2 EF-hand mutant (MICU2<sup>EFmut</sup>), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding relieves the inhibitory effect of MICU2 on MCU (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The recent identification of MCU has opened the way to the molecular elucidation and experimental manipulation of a key event in calcium signaling, but has also raised new intriguing biological questions. The well-established notion that MCU is a highly selective channel with an enormous Ca<sup>2+</sup> carrying capacity (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Kirichok etÂ al., 2004</xref>) coupled to the constant presence of a huge driving force for cation accumulation into the matrix would suggest that mitochondria are being overloaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> in most conditions. However, experimental evidence shows that this is not the case; not only does resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> almost match that of the cytosol (â¼100Â nM) but mitochondria also promptly respond to any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing agonist by transiently increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> over a wide range, an event that is instrumental to specific organelle functions. It is thus clear that MCU needs on the one hand a gatekeeper that prevents channel opening at resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], avoiding energy dissipation and cell-death triggering, and on the other hand an activation mechanism that guarantees mitochondrial calcium uptake even when increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> are spatially and temporally limited. We here demonstrated that this sigmoidal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response of the organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake pathway is not intrinsic to the channel per se but is rather provided by the interaction of the MICU complex with MCU. Whereas three different MICU isoforms exist in vertebrates, only two are conserved in protozoa and plants. Moreover, whereas MICU1 and MICU2 have broad tissue expression, MICU3 appears to be expressed at significant levels only in theÂ nervous system. This suggests a tissue-specific role for MICU3, with MICU1 and MICU2 representing core regulators of MCU. The intimate relationship between MICU1 and MICU2 is supported by the demonstration that they form a dimer through a covalent disulfide bond (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A) at a specific, conserved, and homologous cysteine residue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>B, and S1C). Moreover, the dimer appears to be the elementary unit interacting with MCU, as demonstrated by several pieces of experimental evidence: (1) the dimer is apparently the only endogenous available form (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B); (2) when used as bait, MCU can immunoprecipitate the dimeric form only (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>A); and (3) dimerization-incompetent mutants of MICU2 cannot immunoprecipitate MCU (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). However, higher-order MICU complexes cannot be excluded, in particular considering that the functional MCU channel is a multimer (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Raffaello etÂ al., 2013</xref>) and both MICU1 and MICU2 possess EF-hand domains (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Plovanich etÂ al., 2013</xref>), suggestive of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes. Very recent data suggest that the interaction of the MICU complex with MCU is mediated by a component of the channel named EMRE (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Sancak etÂ al., 2013</xref>). This is compatible with our model, because we do not exclude that the interaction between MICU1-MICU2 dimers could be settled by other elements.</p>
      <p>As for the function of MICU1, apparently conflicting reports exist in the literature. MICU1 had been initially identified as a protein necessary for mitochondrial calcium uptake (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Perocchi etÂ al., 2010</xref>), thus suggesting a positive regulation of the channel itself. Later, Madesh and colleagues showed that MICU1-depleted cells have higher resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> with no apparent differences in stimulus-induced mitochondrial calciumÂ uptake (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Mallilankaraman etÂ al., 2012</xref>), thus clearly ascribing to MICU1 the role of MCU gatekeeper. Finally, HajnÃ³czky and coworkers added another piece to the puzzle, demonstrating a dual role of MICU1, confirming its inhibitory effect at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] but also uncovering MICU1-dependent cooperativity in MCU opening (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Thus, a highly complex picture emerged, with a single protein acting as both a channel closer and a channel activator, depending on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p>
      <p>However, all these studies preceded the identification of MICU2 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Plovanich etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, the silencing of MICU1 leads to a concomitant disappearance of MICU2 at protein (but not mRNA) level, indicating that MICU2 requires MICU1 for its stability, but not vice versa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>A). Most importantly, this opens the possibility that the apparent complex effect of MICU1 could be unexpectedly due to the loss of a second regulator. We thus tested this hypothesis in a clean inÂ vitro system, the planar lipid bilayer, and inÂ situ in living cells. In fact, the apparent dual role of MICU1 is the result of a binary complex composed by a bona fide inhibitor, MICU2, and an MCU activator, MICU1. Indeed, specific silencing of MICU2 leads to an increase in mitochondrial calcium transients, indicating the release of an inhibitory mechanism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). Consistently, its overexpression leads to a decrease of mitochondrial calcium uptake (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B), which is rather small in absolute terms, most likely because in this context MICU1 represents a bottleneck for MICU2 overexpression. Indeed, in the planar lipid bilayer, a condition where protein stability is not an issue, the inhibitory effect of MICU2 is unleashed and becomes clear (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5D). Interestingly, this inhibition can be appreciated when sodium is used as the permeating ion (thus mimicking low basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), further supporting the gatekeeping role of MICU2. Finally, we tested this hypothesis in living cells by measuring mitochondrial calcium levels in unstimulated cells. In these conditions, MCU overexpression substantially increased resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>, most likely due to the overexpression imbalance of MCU and MICU1/MICU2 levels. In this background, the reintroduction of only MICU1 cannot restore normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, but the concomitant expression of MICU1 and MICU2 completely recovers the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> value (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C), indicating that MICU2 is required for gatekeeping.</p>
      <p>As for MICU1, assessing its genuine role in living cells is complicated by the impossibility of specifically downregulating its expression without compromising MICU2 stability. However, its overexpression clearly shows a stimulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A) paralleled by the appearance of a specific band that represents the MICU1-MICU1 homodimer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S6</xref>). Along the same lines, the specific silencing of MICU2 led to the obvious decrease of the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer together with the appearance of the MICU1-MICU1 homodimer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S6</xref>). Interestingly, this condition leads to an increase of mitochondrial calcium responses that is quantitatively similar to the MICU1 overexpression alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). In addition, overexpressing MICU1 in a MICU2-silenced background makes the MICU1-MICU1 homodimer the only available form (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S6</xref>); importantly, this leads to an increase of mitochondrial calcium uptake that is even largerÂ than that due to the overexpression of the channel itself (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">De Stefani etÂ al., 2011</xref>), thus indicating that the MICU1-MICU1 homodimer has a genuine stimulatory effect on mitochondrial calcium uptake (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). Finally, MICU1 causes a net increase in channel open probability when added to a planar lipid bilayer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>), arguing for a bona fide stimulatory effect on MCU.</p>
      <p>Finally, in order to investigate the dynamic mechanism of this complex, we pointed our attention to the most obvious regulatory domain found in both MICU1 and MICU2, namely the EF hands. Mutation of these domains in either MICU1 or MICU2 leads to a decrease in mitochondrial calcium responses, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself is necessary for the regulation of the MICU1-MICU2 complex. On one hand, it appears necessary toÂ activate the stimulatory effect of MICU1, because (1) MICU1<sup>EFmut</sup> not only fails to increase mitochondrial calcium uptake in cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D) but also prevents MICU1-mediated enhancement of MCU opening, as previously reported (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">CsordÃ¡s etÂ al., 2013</xref>), and (2) MICU1 does not increase MCU open probability in planar lipid bilayers when measurements are carried out in a sodium-only-containing media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3B). On the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not necessary for the inhibitory effect of MICU2, as demonstrated by the strong decrease of MCU current in the planar lipid bilayer when sodium is the only available cation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5D). This notion is indeed confirmed inÂ situ, where MICU2<sup>EFmut</sup> strongly decreases mitochondrial calcium uptake, thus indicating that MICU2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domains are necessary to release MCU inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). Interestingly, the effect of the two mutations was additive, confirming specialized roles in MCU regulation by MICU1 and MICU2. Our data indeed suggest that increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] triggered by activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling have a dual role in the MICU complex: channel closure due to MICU2 is relieved and, in parallel, stimulation of MCU opening by MICU1 is triggered.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the data identify MICU2 as the genuine gatekeeper of MCU and unravel the mechanism responsible for the sigmoidal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response of the organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake pathway. MICU1 and MICU2, direct modulators of the pore-forming subunit (MCU) with opposite effects on channel activity, form a regulatory dimer. At low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the prevailing inhibitory effect of MICU2 ensures minimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the presence of a very large driving force for cation accumulation, thus preventing the deleterious effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and matrix overload. As soon as extramitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MICU2 inhibition and MICU1 activation guarantee the prompt initiation of rapid mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>), thus stimulating aerobic metabolism and increasing ATP production in stimulated cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Denton, 2009</xref>). The remarkable clarification, in a few years, of the molecular machinery of a crucial checkpoint of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling provides insight for understanding, and potentially affecting, disease conditions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Logan etÂ al., 2014</xref>) in which ATP deficiency and/or apoptotic or necrotic cell death play a pathogenetic role.</p>

      <p>All experiments were performed in HeLa cells. MICU1 and MICU2 were silenced using specific siRNAs. Mock vectors (i.e., pcDNA3.1 or pEGFP-N1) were used as controls in all overexpression experiments. In parallel, a nontargeting siRNA (i.e., siRNA-scrambled) was used as a control in all silencing experiments. We verified that any siRNA causes an â¼20% drop in mitochondrial calcium uptake when compared to cells transfected with the aequorin probe only or the aequorin probe transfected together with a mock vector (referred to as the âcontrolâ condition). Because this modest decrease can be reliably appreciated with a variety (&gt;5) of control siRNAs (with both scrambled and universal nontargeting sequences) we tested, we concluded this is due to a nonspecific effect whenever RNAi machinery is stimulated; as a consequence, a control siRNA (siRNA-scrambled) is always present in all silencing experiments because it represents the appropriate control.</p>

The coverslip with the cells was incubated with 5Â Î¼M coelenterazine for 1â2Â hr in KRB (Krebs-Ringer modified buffer: 125Â mM NaCl, 5Â mM KCl, 1Â mM Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1Â mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5Â mM glucose, 20Â mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) at 37Â°C supplemented with 1Â mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and then transferred to the perfusion chamber. All aequorin measurements were carried out in KRB. Agonists and other drugs were added to the same medium as specified in the text. The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100Â Î¼M digitonin in a hypotonic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-rich solution (10Â mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>O), thus discharging the remaining aequorin pool.

Representative traces are shown in the figures, whereas the full data set is included in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>. Alternatively, aequorin measurements were carried out on a PerkinElmer EnVision plate reader equipped with a two-injector unit.

After reconstitution with 5Â Î¼M coelenterazine, cells were placed in 70Â Î¼l of KRB and luminescence from each well was measured for 1Â min. During the experiment, histamine was first injected at the desired concentration to activate calcium transients, and then a hypotonic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-rich, digitonin-containing solution was added to discharge the remaining aequorin pool. Output data were analyzed and calibrated with a custom-made macro-enabled Excel workbook. In the experiments with permeabilized cells, a buffer mimicking the cytosolic ionic composition (IB) was employed: 130Â mM KCl, 10Â mM NaCl, 2Â mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5Â mM succinic acid, 5Â mM malic acid, 1Â mM MgCl, 20Â mM HEPES, and 1Â mM pyruvate (pH 7) at 37Â°C. IB was supplemented with either 100Â Î¼M EGTA (IB/EGTA) or a 2Â mM EGTA-buffered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of the indicated concentration (IB/Ca<sup>2+</sup>).

All voltages reported are those of the <italic>cis</italic> chamber, zero being assigned by convention to the <italic>trans</italic> (grounded) side. Currents are considered positive when carried by cations flowing from the <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>trans</italic> compartment. Data were acquired at 100Â Î¼s/point, filtered at 300Â Hz, and analyzed offline using the pClamp program set (Axon Instruments). Histograms were fitted using the Origin 7.5 program set (OriginLab).</p>

        <title>Mitochondrial Targeted GCaMP6m Measurements</title>
        <p>HeLa cells were grown on 24Â mm coverslips and transfected with 2mtGCaMP6m-encoding plasmids together with the indicated constructs. After 24 or 48Â hr, coverslips were placed in 1Â ml of KRB and imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 63Ã/1.4 N.A. Plan Apochromat objective. Excitation was performed with a DeltaRAM V high-speed monochromator (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75Â W xenon arc lamp. Images were captured with a high-sensitivity Evolve 512 Delta EMCCD (Photometrics). The system is controlled by MetaMorph 7.5 (Molecular Devices) and was assembled by Crisel Instruments. In order to test resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub> with high sensitivity, we developed a calcium probe based on the last-generation GCaMP probe (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Chen etÂ al., 2013</xref>) targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. We chose the GCaMP6m version, due to its highest calcium affinity, with its K<sub>d</sub> (167Â nM) in the range of normal resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mt</sub>. In order to be truly quantitative, we took advantage of the isosbestic point in the GCaMP6m excitation spectrum: we experimentally determined in living cells that exciting GCaMP6m at 410Â nm leads to fluorescence emission, which is not Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent. As a consequence, the ratio between 474 and 410Â nm excitation wavelengths is proportional to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] while independent of probe expression. HeLa cells were thus alternatively illuminated at 474 and 410Â nm and fluorescence was collected through a 515/30Â nm band-pass filter (Semrock). Exposure time was set to 200Â ms at 474Â nm and to 400Â ms at 410Â nm, in order to account for the low quantum yield at the latter wavelength. At least ten fields were collected per coverslip, and each field was acquired for 10Â s (1 frame/s). Analysis was performed with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Schindelin etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Both images were background corrected frame by frame by subtracting mean pixel values of a cell-free region of interest. Data are presented as the mean of the averaged ratio of all time points.</p>
        <p>Immunofluorescence and FRET were performed on a Leica TCS-II SP5 STED CW system equipped with a 100Ã/1.4 N.A. Plan Apochromat objective.</p>
        <p>Statistical data are presented as meanÂ Â± SD unless otherwise specified; significance was calculated by Studentâs t test, <sup>â</sup>pÂ &lt; 0.05.</p>

        <p>(B) Amplitude histograms were obtained by analyses of 60Â s long traces before and after addition of MICU1 to the <italic>cis</italic> side. Gaussian fits of the multipeak histogram (red), baseline current (yellow), and MCU current (green) were obtained using the Origin 7.5 program set (nÂ = 3).</p>
        <p>(C and D) InÂ vitro expressed MCU was incorporated into a sodium-gluconate medium containing 1Â Î¼M Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gluconate and activity was monitored at â120Â mV. Channel activity in this medium was detectable with much lower unitary current and open probability compared to the medium containing sodium and 5Â mM EDTA.

        <p>Schematic Representation of the Proposed Model</p>
        <p>In resting conditions (upper left), MICU1-MICU2 heterodimers act as the MCU gatekeeper, thanks to the prevailing inhibitory effect of MICU2; increases in calcium concentration (upper right) induce a conformational change in the whole dimer that releases MICU2-dependent inhibition and triggers MICU1-mediated enhancement of MCU channeling activity. Moreover, the removal of MICU1 with the consequent disappearance of MICU2 (lower left) leads to the loss of both gatekeeping at resting and cooperativity triggered by activation of calcium signaling. On the other hand, the selective removal of MICU2 (lower right) causes the loss of the gatekeeping mechanism but induces the formation of the MICU1-MICU1 homodimer that enhances mitochondrial calcium uptake after cellular stimulation.
