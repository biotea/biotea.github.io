      <abstract>
        <p>A trimeric complex formed by Tub4p, the budding yeast Î³-tubulin, and the two spindle pole body components, Spc98p and Spc97p, has recently been characterized in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We reasoned that crucial functions, such as the control of microtubule nucleation, could be maintained among divergent species. SPC98-related sequences were searched in dbEST using the BLASTN program. Primers derived from the human expressed sequence tag matching SPC98 were used to clone the 5â² and 3â² cDNA ends by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR. The human Spc98 cDNA presents an alternative splicing at the 3â² end. The deduced protein possesses 22% identity and 45% similarity with the yeast homologue. We further report that the human Spc98p, like Î³-tubulin, is concentrated at the centrosome, although a large fraction is found in cytosolic complexes. Sucrose gradient sedimentation of the cytosolic fraction and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p are in the same complex. Interestingly, <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm centrosomes, which are incompetent for microtubule nucleation before their activation in the egg cytoplasm, were found to contain similar amounts of both Spc98p and Î³-tubulin to human somatic centrosomes, which are competent for microtubule nucleation. Finally, affinity-purified antibodies against Spc98p inhibit microtubule nucleation on isolated centrosomes, as well as in microinjected cells, suggesting that this novel protein is indeed required for the nucleation reaction. </p>

  <body>
    <p>D<sc>espite</sc> differences in size and complexity throughout the evolutionary range of eukaryotes, centrosomes have similar functions. First, they promote microtubule growth from cellular tubulin, the nucleation reaction being either catalyzed or by-passed in their vicinity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Heidemann and McIntosh, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). The precise mechanism ensuring the nucleation reaction for microtubule assembly in vivo remains unknown. Second, they duplicate once during each cell cycle, and this has important implications for microtubule redistribution and spindle morphogenesis at mitosis.</p>
    <p>First discovered in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> as a suppressor of a temperature-sensitive Î²-tubulin mutation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Oakley and Oakley, 1989</xref>), Î³-tubulin is a low abundance protein that shows 35% identity to Î±- and Î²-tubulin and has been localized to the spindle pole body of <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Oakley et al., 1990</xref>). Homologues of this gene have subsequently been cloned in various eukaryotic species (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Stearns et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Maessen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sobel and Snyder, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Spang et al., 1996</xref>). Disruption of the essential Î³-tubulin gene in several organisms prevents the proper microtubule organization (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Oakley et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Horio et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sunkel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Marschall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Spang et al., 1996</xref>). Recent studies have focused on the role of Î³-tubulin in microtubule nucleation. In mammalian cells, antibodies directed against Î³-tubulin have been shown to block microtubule nucleation, and Î³-tubulin overexpression has been reported to induce a reorganization of the microtubule network (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shu and Joshi, 1995</xref>). Occasionally, Î³-tubulin is able to self assemble into Î³-tubules (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shu and Joshi, 1995</xref>). Although Î³-tubulin has been shown to be concentrated at the centrosome (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Horio et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Stearns et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1991</xref>), a large fraction is not associated with it but belongs to cytoplasmic complexes both in eggs and somatic cells (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Raff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). The so-called Î³-tubulin ring complex (Î³-TuRC),<sup>1</sup> isolated from mitotic <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, is able to nucleate microtubules in vitro (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). This complex contains several proteins distinct from Î³-tubulin, including Î±- and Î²-tubulin, and presents a ring structure with a left-handed helical shape. Ring-like Î³-tubulinâcontaining structures with a diameter similar to microtubules have been observed at the centrosome by tomography at the ultrastructural level (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Moritz et al., 1995<italic>a</italic>
</xref>,<italic>b</italic>). Two opposite models for the structure and activity of such a complex have been proposed (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Erickson and Stoffler, 1996</xref>).</p>
    <p>Similar complexes have been found in other species such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (Zheng, Y., D. Agard, R. Milligan, T. Mitchison, and B. Alberts. 1996. <italic>Mol. Biol. Cell.</italic> 7:207a) as well as in mammalian brain microtubule preparations (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">DÃ©traves et al., 1997</xref>). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Î³-tubulinâbinding proteins have been identified by genetic and biochemical studies. The essential SPC98 gene was first found as a dosage-dependent suppressor of a thermosensible mutation of the TUB4 gene, which codes for Î³-tubulin in budding yeast (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Geissler et al., 1996</xref>). Spc98p has been further found to interact physically with Tub4p. To find new Tub4p partners, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Knop et al. (1997)</xref> searched for extragenic suppressors of spc98 mutants and identified SPC97, a gene coding for a new spindle pole body (SPB) component. Furthermore, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Knop et al. (1997)</xref> presented convincing evidences for a trimeric complex formed by Spc98p, Spc97p, and Tub4p. Interestingly, Tub4p, Spc98p, and Spc97p have been localized to the outer and inner plate of the SPB, where microtubules appear to grow. It is noteworthy that these two yeast Î³-tubulinâbinding proteins have molecular weights compatible with two proteins observed in the Î³-TuRC. A similar trimeric complex has also been observed by Zheng et al. (1996. <italic>Mol. Biol. Cell.</italic> 7:207a) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos in addition to the large Î³-TuRC.</p>
    <p>Since important cellular functions are maintained throughout the evolutionary range of eukaryotes, it is reasonable to assume that functional protein complexes are also conserved. This conjecture led to the characterization of the human homologue of the budding yeast CDC31, which is involved in SPB duplication, at molecular and biochemical levels (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Middendorp et al., 1997</xref>). We have also identified, using a biochemical approach based on immunocytological cross-reaction, a human protein related to the yeast Spc110p (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tassin et al., 1997</xref>). </p>
    <p>In this work, we were interested in identifying Î³-tubulinâbinding proteins in mammalian cells. We thus carried out a search in the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database for conservation in animal cells of the two yeast Î³-tubulinâbinding proteins characterized by <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Knop et al. (1997)</xref>. We found human EST for both Spc98p and Spc97p. We report here on the isolation and functional characterization of the human homologue of the yeast SPC98 gene.</p>

        <title>Database Search and Cloning of HsSpc98</title>
        <p>SPC98-related sequences were searched in dbEST using the default parameters of the BLASTN program (Genomet, Tokyo, Japan). Primers derived from human ESTs matching SPC98 were used to clone the 5â² and 3â² cDNA ends by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR (5â² and 3â² RACE-PCR kit; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, poly-A mRNA obtained from HeLa cells was reverse transcribed using a gene-specific primer or an oligodT primer to obtain the 5â² and 3â² ends of the genes, respectively. Then, single-strand cDNAs corresponding to 5â² ends were elongated with a poly-C tail and amplified by PCR using a gene-specific primer and a poly-G primer. cDNAs corresponding to 3â² ends were directly amplified by PCR using a gene-specific primer and a poly-T primer. Finally, PCR products were submitted to a second round of PCR using a nested gene-specific primer. cDNAs were sequenced by Genomexpress.</p>

        <title>Production and Purification of Recombinant HsSpc98</title>
        <p>HsSpc98 partial cDNA (fragment 1006â2025) was cloned in pET3d bacterial expression vector after having introduced by PCR a six-histidine tag at the carboxy terminus of the cDNA to purify the recombinant protein on nickel-chelated agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA; Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The vector was then introduced into BL21 DE3 bacteria strain. Protein expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG for 3 h. Protein expression was analyzed by lysing the bacteria pellet in boiling Laemmli buffer followed by sonication.</p>

        <p>The Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTAâpurified 38-kD protein was injected into two rabbits (200 Î¼g in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed 2 wk later with 100 Î¼g of protein injected in incomplete Freund's adjuvant). The rabbits were injected once a month for an additional 3 mo. Serum was collected and tested in Western blotting of the recombinant protein, cellular extracts, and centrosomes. The serum or affinity-purified IgGs were used for immunofluorescence on HeLa cells.</p>
        <p>A polyclonal rabbit antiâÎ³-tubulin antibody has been produced against a bacterially expressed histidine tag full-length human Î³-tubulin. This antibody has been shown to map eight epitopes (collaboration with D. Job, Centre d'Etudes NuclÃ©aires de Grenoble, Grenoble, France).</p>

The pelleted cells were resuspended at a cell concentration of 1 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml in cold KHM buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 78 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, each at 1 mg/ml, and 1 mM PMSF). Cells were then disrupted using a Bill Balch homogenizer with a clearance of 33 Î¼m at 4Â°C. All the subsequent steps were performed at 4Â°C. The homogenate was immediately centrifuged at 150,000 <italic>g</italic> in an ultracentrifuge (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="beckman">Beckman Instruments</named-content>, Fullerton, CA) with a swinging bucket rotor (model SW55; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="beckman">Beckman Instruments</named-content>) for 30 min. After this centrifugation, the supernatant representing the cytosolic fraction was recovered. This fraction was quick frozen as aliquots using liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C. Mitotic HeLa cell extract was obtained as described above except that cells were first blocked in mitosis with a 24-h nocodazole block (5 Ã 10<sup>â7</sup> M).</p>

        <p>Cytosolic cell extract (2â3 ml) was applied to a 15â40% sucrose linear gradient (10 ml) prepared in KHM buffer in ultraclear rotor tubes (model SW41; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="beckman">Beckman Instruments</named-content>). Centrifugation was performed using a swinging bucket rotor (model SW41; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="beckman">Beckman Instruments</named-content>) at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 16 h.

A sample from each fraction was taken out and diluted with eightfold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without glycerol) and heated at 100Â°C for 5 min. The remainder of the fractions were stored at â80Â°C after freezing in liquid nitrogen. </p>
        <p>In some experiments, the Î³-tubulinâenriched fractions from the first SW41 sucrose gradient were pooled, concentrated by dialysis/concentration step against KHM buffer, and then layered on the top of a 4-ml 15â 40% sucrose gradient made in ultraclear rotor tubes (model SW55; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="beckman">Beckman Instruments</named-content>).

After a rapid centrifugation to eliminate trace aggregates, the primary antibody preadsorbed to protein GâSepharose beads (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia Biotech</named-content>, Piscataway, NJ) was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4Â°C. Protein GâSepharose beads were then sedimented. The supernatants were precipitated with cold methanol, and the proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100Â°C, 5 min). The sedimented protein GâSepharose beads were washed (five times) with 500 Î¼l of 1D buffer and with 1 ml of double distilled water three times. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized from the Sepharose beads by incubation with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100Â°C, 5 min) and centrifuged before loading the supernatant. </p>

After glutaraldehyde fixation and sedimentation on glass coverslips, microtubules were visualized using an antiâÎ±-tubulin antibody. To test the effect of anti-Spc98p antibodies on microtubule nucleation, we affinity-purified the rabbit serum against HsSpc98p and preincubated the pAb HsSpc98 immunoglobulins with centrosomes for 30 min at 4Â°C.

        <title>Cloning the Human Homologue of ScSPC98</title>
        <p>One human SPC98-related sequence (No. T55505) was found in dbEST, showing 38% identity and 58% similarity to the yeast protein. We cloned the corresponding full-length cDNA by reverse transcription PCR. Three successive rounds of reverse transcription using internal primers, as described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, were necessary to obtain the 5â² end. We further explored dbEST and GenBank using the full-length cDNA sequence. Some of the human ESTs found in this way are reported in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Surprisingly, we found one EST (No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AA081954">AA081954</ext-link>) and one sequence already cloned (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="L13801">L13801</ext-link>
<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="L12708">L12708</ext-link>) that from now on will be referred to as clone 02, which showed 100% homology to 52 and 78 bp, respectively, with the human cDNA and which were completely divergent in the 3â² region (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). From information obtained from the database, clone 02 is predicted to have a poly-A tail 1.1 kb from the 3â² end of the sequenced region, suggesting a different mRNA than that previously found. Several possibilities could explain this divergence at the 3â² end. To confirm the possibility that the new sequence was related to the previously characterized cDNA, we performed a PCR reaction using the 5â² primers that were already used to isolate the first 3â² end (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>) and 3â² primers found in clone 02 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, <italic>rev7</italic> and <italic>rev8</italic>). We also set up PCR reactions, using primers 1 and 2 and primers rev9 and rev10, to confirm our first 3â² end. Using the two sets of primers, we obtained bands of the expected sizes. We further cloned each of them in Bluescript vector and sequenced them. The sequence obtained for the new 3â² end is 100% homologous on 694 bp in its 5â² region, suggesting the possibility of an alternative splicing. This possibility was further tested using Northern blot analysis (see below). The protein derived from our first cDNA is slightly smaller than the one obtained from the second version. These proteins have predicted molecular masses of 94 and 103.7 kD, respectively, and pI's of 7.85 and 8.35, respectively. </p>
        <p>Sequence comparison between the human and the budding yeast Spc98p showed that these proteins are poorly conserved (22% identity, 45% similarity). However, the regions of homology are clustered in the central part of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). Interestingly, ESTs from three other species, including zebrafish and plant, are located in the same region. The highly conserved domain of Spc98p is present in those different species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>B</italic>), suggesting that a conserved function is probably located in this domain. The three ESTs are closer to the human sequence than to the yeast one (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). It is interesting to point out that HsSpc98p also presented homology (22% identity, 46% similarity) with the yeast Spc97p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>A</italic>), although the conserved regions are spread over the entire sequence. </p>

      <sec>
        <title>Northern Blot Analysis</title>
        <p>To substantiate the possibility of an alternative splicing of the 3â² end region, Northern blot analysis was performed. Three parts of the human sequence were used as probes to screen the Northern blot. The first probe was located in the common region (1084â1921), the second probe corresponded only to the divergent part of clone 02 (bp 80â 645), and the last one was in the second divergent region (bp 2450â2577 of the initial clone). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows the Northern blot obtained with the first probe. All tissues tested expressed an abundant messenger RNA of 4.4 kb in addition to three minor ones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, bands <italic>1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>4</italic>). The second probe labeled band <italic>1â3</italic>, while band <italic>4</italic> was only stained with the third probe (data not shown). These results suggested that the most abundant messenger RNA contained in those tissues has the 3â² end found in clone 02. The two minor forms represented by bands <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> were probably minor spliced messenger RNAs. Our initial 3â² end represented a minor and shorter spliced messenger RNA that was favored by the RACE-PCR cloning approach.</p>

        <title>Cellular Distribution of the Human Spc98p</title>
        <p>To characterize the human homologue of Spc98p at a cellular and biochemical level, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the most conserved domain of the protein (amino acids 362â673). This peptide was produced in bacteria in fusion with a histidine tag at the COOH terminus and purified on a nickel column before rabbit immunization. Sera strongly reactive with the recombinant peptide were used to analyze the cellular distribution of the protein in human cells after further affinity purification. When Western immunoblotting was carried out on Triton X-100âsoluble and -insoluble fractions (10 Î¼g protein each) and centrosomal protein (0.6 Î¼g protein), affinity-purified immunoglobulins reacted in all fractions with a unique band with an apparent molecular mass of 103 kD. This was in good agreement with the predicted size of the most abundant form of the protein. We further observed that HsSpc98p was highly enriched in the centrosomal fraction but that a significant signal was also detected in the Triton X-100âsoluble and -insoluble fractions. Such a distribution is similar to that of Î³-tubulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and was expected for a Î³-tubulinâbinding protein. Isolated centrosomes can be easily counted by immunofluorescence. As they are single-copy organelles, we could normalize with respect to cell number, the semiquantitative analysis obtained by a National Institutes of Health image program of the signals observed in the soluble, insoluble, and centrosomal fractions. Using our purest centrosome preparation, we could roughly establish that â¼6% of the HsSpc98p was associated with the centrosome, whereas 30 and 70% of the protein were present in the insoluble and soluble fraction respectively. </p>

        <title>Immunolocalization of HsSpc98p</title>
        <p>To further characterize the cellular distribution of HsSpc98p, we performed an immunolocalization experiment of HsSpc98p using a double immunofluorescence approach on methanol-fixed HeLa cells with or without Triton X-100 permeabilization. Affinity-purified antibody directed against HsSpc98p showed a centrosomal staining in all cells over a weak and homogenous background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, the labeling appeared more restricted to the centrioles than the one observed for pericentriolar material (PCM) with mAb CTR453 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bailly et al., 1989</xref>; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>C</italic>). At the G2/M transition, an increase in centrosomal HsSpc98p labeling was observed concomitant with the increase of the microtubule nucleation activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). In addition to the centrosome staining, a specific decoration of the polar microtubules in metaphase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>E</italic>) and of the midbody during anaphase was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>A</italic>, <italic>inset</italic>). All those features were reminiscent of that described for Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lajoie-Mazenc et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). </p>
        <p>When we attempted to compare the localization of Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p at the ultrastructural level, we realized that the epitopes recognized by anti-Spc98p and antiâÎ³-tubulin antibodies were either destroyed or occluded after aldehyde fixation, thus precluding postembedding immunolocalization as carried out previously (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). Preembedding staining has several drawbacks including a differential accessibility of antigens depending on their location, the most peripheral being preferentially recognized. We thus attempted a compromise by using preembedding staining after methanol fixation. Using this approach, we observed reasonably well preserved centrosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) in which HsSpc98p and Î³-tubulin had similar localization, as expected for interacting proteins: in both cases, gold particles were observed within the pericentriolar material (PCM), sometimes close to the centriole wall. It is interesting to note that both HsSpc98p and Î³-tubulin seemed to be present at the tip of subdistal appendages surrounding the mother centriole. No gold particles were observed when the first antibody was omitted. </p>

        <title>HsSpc98p and Î³-Tubulin Belong to the Same Cytosolic Complex</title>
        <p>The immunofluorescence localization of HsSpc98p and the cell fractionation suggested a possible interaction of HsSpc98p with Î³-tubulin in both the cytosolic and the centrosomal fractions. Biochemical experiments were undertaken to test this hypothesis. We first focused our attention on the cytosolic form of HsSpc98p and Î³-tubulin. It has been previously reported that Î³-tubulin from somatic cells is present in a cytosol fraction obtained by mechanical breaking of cells in the absence of detergent and subsequent high-speed centrifugation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). We checked for the presence of HsSpc98p in those cytosolic fractions after sedimenting them for 16 h at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> on a 15â40% sucrose gradient. HsSpc98p cosedimented with Î³-tubulin (data not shown). To improve the resolution of those gradients, the Î³-tubulinârich fractions were loaded on a second sucrose gradient. Interestingly, Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p still fully cosedimented (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). </p>
        <p>In an attempt to directly demonstrate the association of Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p in a complex, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments on the pooled sucrose gradient fractions. Silver staining of the immunoprecipitates using antiâÎ³-tubulin or anti-HsSpc98p showed a similar protein profile in which one could recognize some of the Î³-TurC proteins (Zheng, Y., D. Agard, R. Milligan, T. Mitchison, and B. Alberts. 1996. <italic>Mol. Biol. Cell.</italic> 207a). In control experiments with preimmune immunoglobulins, neither HsSpc98p nor Î³-tubulin was immunoprecipitated as determined by Western blotting. However, anti-HsSpc98 as well as antiâÎ³-tubulin antibodies coprecipitated HsSpc98p and Î³-tubulin, demonstrating the participation of both proteins to the same complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>B</italic>). Î±âÎ²-tubulin, which was present in the same gradient fractions, was not at a detectable level in the immunoprecipitate obtained with either anti-HsSpc98p or antiâÎ³-tubulin immunoglobulins. By contrast, immunoprecipitation carried out with antiâÎ±-tubulin antibodies precipitated a different protein profile as judged by silver staining (data not shown). In that case, however, both Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p, although in a low amount, were present in addition to Î±-tubulin (data not shown).</p>

        <title>The Centrosomal Forms of HsSpc98p and Î³-Tubulin</title>
        <p>We were interested to ascertain whether both proteins participated in the same complex in the centrosome as well. However, it is difficult to carry out coimmunoprecipitation experiments from centrosome preparations that require extreme dissociating conditions to be partially solubilized (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). These conditions are incompatible with the stability of most proteinâprotein interactions. Therefore, we investigated the interaction of both proteins in the centrosome by analyzing their behavior during centrosomal fractionation under dissociating conditions. Isolated centrosomes were incubated in different solubilizing buffers including salts, detergents, and chaotropic agents such as urea. Whatever the dissociating agent used, both proteins behaved in a similar manner, suggesting that they had similar solubility properties (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>C</italic>). Interestingly, when a partial solubilization was produced by treatment with detergents, the proportion that was solubilized appeared to be the same for both proteins. These results suggest that about half of both proteins are not very tightly associated to the centrosome, whereas the rest are more tightly bound. </p>

        <title>HsSpc98p as well as Î³-Tubulin Are Present in the Inactive Centrosome from Xenopus Sperm Cells</title>
        <p>To understand the function of Spc98p, we first ask whether this protein could act as an anchoring protein of Î³-tubulin on the centrosome. To address this question, we looked at whether Spc98p was associated with centrosomes incompetent for microtubule nucleation, i.e., to those present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm cells, which have been reported to be devoid of Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>). Our anti-HsSpc98p antibody was expected to react with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Spc98p homologue, as it is directed against the most conserved part of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>
<italic>B</italic>), which is also conserved in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> protein as recently reported by Gunawardane and Zheng (1997. <italic>Mol. Biol. Cell.</italic> 8:1553a). In agreement with this prediction, <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts were shown to contain a protein reacting with our anti-HsSpc98p and migrating at the expected molecular weight. Therefore, a double immunofluorescence was performed on <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm heads using affinity-purified anti-HsSpc98p antibody and the monoclonal antibody GT335 directed against the polyglutamylated forms of tubulin (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 1992</xref>). GT335 distinctly stained the two centrioles and a piece of axoneme attached to the distal centriole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>I</italic>). Anti-Spc98p antibody showed a distinct labeling surrounding each centriole with elongated X-shaped filaments corresponding to striated rootlets observed at the electron microscopy level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>H</italic>). This result suggested that Spc98p could act as an anchoring protein for Î³-tubulin. We attempted to confirm the absence of Î³-tubulin in <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm centrosomes. However, we observed that antiâÎ³-tubulin antibodies stained the <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm centrosome in the absence of egg extract, in a manner strikingly similar to that observed with anti-Spc98p antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). To fully demonstrate the presence of Spc98p and Î³-tubulin in <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm heads, 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> sperm heads and 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> centrosomes from KE37 cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Interestingly, similar amounts of Spc98p and of Î³-tubulin were revealed in the centrosomes from sperm and KE37 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>K</italic>). A similar observation was made for Cen3p (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Middendorp et al., 1997</xref>), which we used as an internal control (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>
<italic>K</italic>). We thus conclude that Spc98p codistributes with Î³-tubulin in sperm centrosomes also. </p>

        <title>Anti-HsSpc98p Immunoglobulins Inhibit Microtubule Nucleation by Somatic Centrosomes</title>
        <p>We further tested the involvement of HsSpc98p in microtubule nucleation using an in vitro nucleation assay. Therefore, isolated human centrosomes were preincubated with the affinity-purified HsSpc98p immunoglobulins (1.2 mg/ml) on ice, while control centrosomes were resuspended with PBS or control immunoglobulins for the same time period. Then, phosphocellulose-tubulin was added together with a GTP-containing buffer, and microtubules were allowed to polymerize for 4 min at 37Â°C. Centrosomes and microtubules were fixed and processed for double immunofluorescence using antitubulin and anti-PCM antibodies. Most centrosomes nucleated a microtubule aster in the control experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), whereas only one or two short microtubules were nucleated from centrosomes preincubated with anti-HsSpc98p IgG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). To confirm this result in vivo, we microinjected purified anti-HsSpc98p immunoglobulins into HeLa cells. After 2 h of cell recovery, microtubules were depolymerized for 2 h by nocodazole and allowed to regrow for 10 min. Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using antiâÎ±-tubulin. The microinjected cells were visualized using an antiârabbit immunoglobulin antibody. In cells heavily loaded with IgGs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, <italic>arrows</italic>), a few or no microtubules were observed, while noninjected cells had a centrosome-growing aster of microtubules. The situation was not so clear when cells were injected with less antibody: Some cells presented no microtubule, while others possessed a normal microtubule network. These results obtained in vitro as well as in vivo argue for the involvement of HsSpc98 in the microtubule nucleation reaction. The control for the microinjection has been performed using another rabbit antibody that recognizes a centrosomal protein (anti-Cen3p). This protein is probably not involved in microtubule nucleation indeed, but injecting this antibody represents a good technical control for our experiment. In all microinjected cells, the microtubule regrowth was similar to nonmicroinjected cells. </p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our aim was to obtain a molecular characterization of Î³-tubulinâinteracting proteins in mammalian cells. The discovery of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Î³-tubulin gene, TUB4, by the sequencing genome program coupled with the powerful genetic approach in this system has led to the identification of a functional trimeric complex containing two SPB components, namely Spc98p and Spc97p, in addition to Tub4p. These three proteins have been localized to the inner and outer plates of the SPB, which appear to be the site of microtubule nucleation. We report the molecular characterization of the human homologue of the yeast Spc98p. This has been achieved by searching an EST presenting homology with the yeast Spc98p and by isolating the human full-length sequence by reverse transcription PCR. By comparing the obtained sequence with dbEST and GenBank, we identified a 3â² divergent sequence, suggesting the existence of alternative spliced mRNA.</p>
      <p>Comparison of the human sequence with the yeast sequence shows that Spc98p is poorly conserved (22% identity), although a conserved central domain is found in the two proteins. The conservation of this domain is likely to be functionally significant because ESTs from divergent species located in the central domain show high homology with the human sequence. It does not come as a surprise that Î³-tubulinâbinding proteins are more divergent in yeast, since TUB4 itself is the most divergent Î³-tubulin gene among species. It will be interesting to isolate the full-length SPC98 cDNA from other species to appreciate the level of protein conservation during evolution. The presence of a central conserved domain in HsSpc98p suggests that the Î³-tubulinâbinding domain is probably located in this region. It is interesting to note that HsSpc98p, like yeast Spc98p, has also some homology with the yeast ScSpc97p. This result suggests that the two yeast genes SPC97 and SPC98 might be derived from a common ancestor.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that proteins involved in microtubule nucleation appear less conserved between human and budding yeast than are proteins involved in centrosome duplication (see <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Middendorp et al., 1997</xref>). This would suggest that centrosome duplication is under more evolutive constraint than microtubule nucleation. </p>
      <sec>
        <title>HsSpc98p Is a Î³-Tubulinâbinding Protein</title>
        <p>The strategy we used to isolate the human homologue of the yeast Spc98p assumed that HsSpc98p would be a Î³-tubulinâbinding protein as its yeast homologue. As expected, HsSpc98p was shown to have exactly the same cellular localization and the same fate as Î³-tubulin during cell fractionation. Both proteins are concentrated at the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. Like Î³-tubulin, HsSpc98p is localized to the polar microtubules in addition to the centrosome during metaphase. It is interesting to note that the NLS consensus sequence (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Dingwall and Laskey, 1991</xref>) observed in yeast Spc98p (amino acids 580â595; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Knop et al., 1997</xref>) is modified in the human protein. This sequence may not be functional since we did not observe significant nuclear staining, although, depending on the fixation procedure, some nuclear decoration could be detected. At the ultrastructural level, using preembedding immunostaining after methanol fixation, both proteins appear colocalized in the PCM, close to the centrioles. This type of fixation is not the best for ultrastructural preservation but permits a good accessibility to the antigens: We could observe, for example, that the tip of the subdistal appendages were decorated with both antiâÎ³-tubulin and anti-HsSpc98p antibodies. This result was not obtained previously using aldehyde fixation (see <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). These appendages could be sites where microtubules grow (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">ChrÃ©tien et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>Like Î³-tubulin, a large pool of HsSpc98p is not associated with the centrosome. The partition of both proteins in the different fractions are strikingly similar, suggesting that both proteins participate in a complex. This has been demonstrated by sucrose gradient sedimentation and by coimmunoprecipitation. Both antiâÎ³-tubulin and anti-HsSpc98p antibodies were found to coprecipitate a similar complex as judged by silver staining. It is noteworthy that the pattern was reminiscent of the Î³-TuRC described by <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. (1995)</xref> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs, or <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">DÃ©traves et al. (1997)</xref> in sheep brain. Interestingly, Î±âÎ²-tubulin did not participate in this complex, although it was present in significant amount in the density gradient fractions used to perform immunoprecipitation experiments (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>A</italic>). When immunoprecipitation was performed with antiâ Î±-tubulin, the immunoprecipitate showed a very distinct protein profile, as observed by silver staining, and contained a slight amount of both Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p only (data not shown; see also <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>). These results suggest that different Î±-, Î²-, Î³-tubulinâ and HsSpc98p-containing complexes can exist in the cell with similar sedimentation properties (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Melki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Archer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Geissler et al., 1998</xref>). Several possibilities could explain the fact that Î±âÎ²-tubulin was not found in the immunoprecipitate obtained by antiâ Î³-tubulin or anti-HsSpc98p antibodies: complexes without Î±âÎ²-tubulin are the most abundant within the cell, and/or Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p are not accessible in the Î±âÎ²-tubulinâcontaining complex. Alternatively, a partial dissociation of the complex could take place. </p>
        <p>The significance of such a cytosolic pool of Î³-tubulinâ and HsSpc98p-containing complexes in somatic cells is an important question. One possibility is suggested by recent reports that have significantly modified the current view on microtubule network turnover: many microtubules, and in some cells the majority of them (up to 75%), can be free in the cytoplasm, because of either their release from the centrosome, their breaking, or their spontaneous assembly (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rodionov and Borisy, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Vorobjev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997<italic>b</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yvon and Wadsworth, 1997</xref>; for review see <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). In many cases, the minus end of these free microtubules can be stable for long periods of time, or can disassemble, generating treadmilling. This suggests the presence of minus end regulatory factors. Î³-tubulinâ and Spc98p-containing cytosolic complexes are indeed candidates for such a role, as already suggested by others (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Vorobjev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). This could also explain why we find complexes free of Î±âÎ²-tubulin, and others containing Î±âÎ²-tubulin, which could represent the minus endâterminal subunits of free microtubules associated with the complexes.</p>

        <title>Does HsSpc98p Participate in the Microtubule Nucleation Reaction?</title>
        <p>This work demonstrates that although individual sequences for Î³-tubulin and Spc98p are divergent between yeast and human, the complexes formed by the two proteins are maintained during the evolution. Homologues of Spc98p have also been isolated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Wiesc, C., O. Martin, and Y. Zheng. ASCB/ EMBO/H. Dudley Wright Conference on Centrosome and Spindle Pole Bodies. Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies directed against the yeast Spc98p recognize the nucleus-associated body from <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> in immunofluorescence experiments (Euteneuer, U., personal communication). HsSpc98p could play a structural role defining a ring structure to which Î³-tubulin is binding (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>), or it could play a more direct role in the microtubule nucleation reaction. Our results show that in vitro as well as in vivo, antibodies directed against HsSpc98p inhibit the microtubule nucleation reaction or interfere with the stability of the microtubules, resulting in an absence of microtubule growth. However, these experiments do not permit us to distinguish between these two potential functions of HsSpc98p. It is interesting to point out that in yeast, the analysis of the phenotype of both tub4-1 and spc98-1 mutants (absence of a mitotic spindle under restrictive temperature) suggests that both proteins play an essential role in mitotic spindle formation.</p>

        <title>Regulation of the Nucleation Reaction and the Centrosome Inheritance</title>
        <p>The presence of a large cytosolic pool of HsSpc98p and of Î³-tubulin contrasts with the fact that the nucleation reaction is restricted to the centrosome. As emphasized previously (see for example <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oakley, 1995</xref>), this suggests that a regulatory event is able to turn on and off the nucleation reaction. A naive view would propose that an important parameter of this regulation is the local concentration of the components participating in the nucleating complex. In other words, a critical concentration of Î³-tubulin and of Î³-tubulinâinteracting proteins should be reached before any microtubule nucleation can take place. This might be necessary but is not sufficient because we have shown in this work that inactive centrosomes from <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm cells contain comparable amounts of Spc98p and Î³-tubulin to active human somatic centrosomes. The main differences with previous works (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>) are probably the affinity of the antiâÎ³-tubulin antibody used, the number of sperm heads analyzed, and more importantly, that an equivalent number of active centrosomes have been used as an internal standard. Recent studies on human or frog sperm cells has also reported the presence of Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Navara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Merdes and Cleveland, 1998</xref>). We thus conclude that a specific regulatory event must take place at fertilization to turn on the nucleating activity of the sperm centrosome.</p>
        <p>It has been proposed that the essential step of the centrosome activation reaction in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs is the Î³-tubulin recruitment from egg cytoplasm (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>). Our data do not eliminate the possibility that Î³-tubulinâcontaining complexes are recruited at the centrosome, but this cannot be the limiting step. This view is reminiscent of the conclusions of <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Masuda and Shibata (1996)</xref>, who showed that heterologous interphase centrosomes from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which do contain Î³-tubulin but are inactive, can be activated by a <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic extract fraction that does not contain Î³-tubulin. </p>
        <p>Our results also call for a reappraisal of centrosome inheritance during fertilization. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al. (1994)</xref> as well as <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stearns and Kirschner (1994)</xref> have put forward the idea that the centrosome is assembled at fertilization by a sort of complementation in which the centriole pair, inherited from the male gamete, binds nucleating components from the female gamete. Since sperm centrosomes, although inactive for microtubule nucleation, do not differ from active somatic centrosomes with respect to the presence of both Spc98p and of Î³-tubulin (this work), and since they apparently possess all the other centrosomal components that have been looked at so far, such as centrin (this work), CTR2611 antigen (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al., 1994</xref>), and Pericentrin (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>), we propose to return to the more classical view, according to which the centrosome organelle, and not simply part of it, is paternally inherited, and that fertilization triggers a switch in its activity.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we report the molecular characterization of a Î³-tubulinâbinding protein in mammalian cells and its involvement in the microtubule nucleation reaction. The precise function of this protein in the microtubule nucleation reaction will have to be further characterized. Many questions are still to be answered, the most important one being the definition of the real nucleation complex, which could be either the trimeric complex, as observed in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, or the large Î³-TuRC. The function of the other proteins in the complex is another important issue. The molecular characterization of all proteins of the Î³-TuRC complex will be necessary to understand the microtubule nucleation mechanism. How this complex is anchored to the centrosome remains unknown. Our results concerning the extractibility of both Î³-tubulin and HsSpc98p from the centrosome suggest that at least part of the complex is not tightly bound to the centrosome. In light of the data reported in yeast (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>), a possible candidate as an anchoring protein could be the human homologue of the yeast Spc110p (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tassin et al., 1997</xref>). The precise function of HsSpc98p in the microtubule nucleation reaction will require further experiments. Mapping the interaction of HsSpc98p with Î³-tubulin might be rewarding.</p>

In this way, only the microinjected cells are detected with the fluorescein antiârabbit secondary antibody. Note that the nonmicroinjected cells presented the usual centrosome-growing microtubule aster, while heavily microinjected cells did not show any microtubule (<italic>arrows</italic>). Note that in cells micronjected with an unrelated antibody (anti-Cen3p IgG), microtubule regrowth is not affected. Bars, 10 Î¼m.</p>
