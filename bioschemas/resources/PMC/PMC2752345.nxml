        <p id="P3">Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG like helicase (RLH) receptors are involved in innate immune antiviral responses. Here we show that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) can also function as a cytoplasmic viral PRR by triggering activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) and production of interferon-Î² (IFN). Following recognition of viral ssRNA genome, NOD2 utilized the adaptor protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) to activate IRF3. NOD2-deficient mice failed to produce IFN efficiently and exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virus-induced pathogenesis. Thus, the function of NOD2 as a viral PRR highlights the important role of NOD2 in host antiviral defense mechanisms.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P4">Innate immune antiviral responses are the first line of defense against virus infection <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Interferon-Î±/Î² (IFN) plays an important role during innate antiviral responses by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Virus-infected cells utilize pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize pathogen (virus) associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and to trigger phosphorylation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which then translocates to the nucleus to transactivate IFN genes <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. So far two classes of viral PRRs have been identified: the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and the RLH (RIG like helicases) receptors such as RIGI and Mda5 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P5">A third class of PRR includes members of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich-region (LRR) containing family (known as NLRs) of cytoplasmic proteins; these proteins respond to bacterial PAMPs to activate NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. For example, the NLR NOD2 detects bacterial PAMPs including muramyl dipeptide <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. However, to date, no NLRs were reported to respond to virus-specific PAMPs and activate an antiviral response.</p>
      <p id="P6">Recently it was demonstrated that the NLR family member NLRX1 interacts with IPS-1 to negatively regulate the IFN pathway <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Thus, members of NLR family of proteins may modulate (either positively or negatively) the host antiviral apparatus. In addition, NOD2 facilitates production of human Î²-defensin-2 (HBD2) after MDP stimulation, and HBD2 is also upregulated in human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infected cells <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P7">Here, to investigate the involvement of NLRs in innate antiviral response we examined the ability of various NLRs to activate IRF3 and IFN production following infection with RSV, a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome containing paramyxovirus that causes severe lung disease in infants, children, elderly and immuno-compromised individuals <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Among the various NLRs, NOD2 activated IRF3 and IFN production in RSV-infected cells. Activation of NOD2 by ssRNA resulted in signaling dependent on the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein (also known as IPS-1, VISA, CARDIF). Both synthetic and viral ssRNA genome were capable of activating the MAVS-IRF3-IFN pathway. The important physiological role of NOD2 in antiviral defense was evident from the enhanced RSV pathogenesis, lung disease and greater viral susceptibility in NOD2-deficient mice. Similar roles for NOD2 were observed in responses to influenza A and parainfluenza viruses. Thus, these studies revealed a previously unknown function of NOD2 as a viral PRR important for host defense against virus infection.</p>

        <title>ssRNA induces IFN production via NOD2</title>
        <p id="P8">To study the involvement of NLR proteins in antiviral responses, we expressed various HA-tagged human NLR proteins (e.g. NOD1, NOD2, IPAF, NAIP, NOD3) in 293 cells, which do not endogenously express most NLRs. We treated these cells with synthetic ssRNA and analyzed IFN production and IRF3 activation. We utilized ssRNA because several highly pathogenic viruses including paramyxoviruses (RSV, Sendai virus, human parainfluenza viruses, measles virus), rhabdoviruses (rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus) and orthomyxoviruses (influenza viruses) contain ssRNA genomes, and because ssRNA activates PRRs including TLR7, TLR8 and RIGI <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. NOD2 but not NOD1 facilitated ssRNA-induced IRF3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and IFN-Î² production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a, 1b</xref>). Such activation was lacking in cells treated with CpG DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a, 1b</xref>). HA-tagged NOD constructs were expressed in high amounts in transfected 293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>); in addition, HA-NOD2 and HA-NOD1 proteins were functional as they facilitated activation of NF-ÎºB in 293 cells treated with MDP or iE-DAP, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">To establish the physiological relevance of NOD2-mediated ssRNA-induced activation of IRF3, we next evaluated the role of endogenous NOD2 in inducing IRF3-IFN following ssRNA treatment. For these studies we utilized human lung epithelial A549 cells, since these cells are permissive to the majority of viruses that contain ssRNA genomes and endogenously express various PRRs. Treatment of these cells with ssRNA resulted in increased NOD2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>); NOD1 expression remained unchanged (data not shown). NOD2-specific siRNA diminished NOD2 expression in ssRNA-treated A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), and impaired ssRNA-induced activation of IRF3 and IFN-Î² production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">Similarly, ssRNA-induced IRF3 activation and IFN-Î² production was reduced in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) and mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) isolated from NOD2-KO compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). In contrast, wild-type and NOD2-KO BMM and MEFs produced similar amounts of IFN-Î² after treatment with poly-IC (dsRNA that activates TLR3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). The ability of poly-IC to induce IFN (via TLR3) in both wild-type and NOD2-KO MEFs showed that IRF3-IFN pathway is intact in NOD2-KO animals. Furthermore, poly-IC administration <italic>in vivo</italic> resulted in production of similar concentrations of IFN-Î² in wild-type and NOD2-KO animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Thus our results obtained with cell lines and primary cells demonstrated that activation of NOD2 by ssRNA results in IFN-Î² production.</p>

        <title>NOD2 facilitates virus-induced IFN production</title>
        <p id="P11">To further validate the ability of NOD2 to launch an antiviral response, we infected 293 cells with RSV. RSV induced activation of IRF3 and IFN-Î² in 293 cells expressing HA-NOD2 but not in 293 cells expressing HA-NOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, 2b</xref>). Inactivation of virion particles with ultra-violet (UV) light abolished the ability of RSV to activate IRF3 in NOD2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The inability of UV inactivated RSV to activate IRF3 indicated that an intact viral RNA genome is essential for NOD2 activation. The direct role of viral components in NOD2 activation was further confirmed by the loss of IRF3 activation following inhibition of RSV cellular entry with an RSV neutralizing antibody (specific for the RSV fusion or F protein) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">The functional significance of NOD2 in antiviral responses was established using the IFN -sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Plaque assay analysis of VSV titers obtained from 293 cells expressing HA-NOD2 or HA-NOD1 revealed a marked reduction in viral titer in cells expressing HA-NOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Like VSV, RSV titers were lower in NOD2 expressing cells compared to NOD1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Human parainfluenza virus type 3 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and VSV <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> also activated IRF3 in NOD2 expressing 293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). In contrast, vaccinia virusâa DNA virusâfailed to activate IRF3 in NOD2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). These results demonstrated that, like the RLH receptors like RIGI and Mda5, NOD2 can function as a cytoplasmic PRR for viral ssRNA.</p>
        <p id="P13">We next evaluated the role of endogenous NOD2 in inducing IRF3-IFN in response to RSV infection. Previous studies described activation of IRF3 and production of IFN-Î² from RSV infected A549 cells as early as 2h post-infection <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Although uninfected A549 cells did not express detectable amounts of NOD2, RSV infection resulted in increased NOD2 expression within 2h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). RSV infection failed to induce NOD1 expression (data not shown). NOD2 siRNA markedly diminished NOD2 expression after RSV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>) and resulted in reduced activation of IRF3 and production of IFN-Î² after RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). The effect was more pronounced during early (4h and 6h) compared to late (10h) time points after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This result suggests that NOD2 is critical for the early antiviral response, whereas during late infection time periods other PRRs (e.g. RIGI) may activate the IRF3-IFN pathway.</p>
        <p id="P14">Indeed, we (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>) and others <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> have shown that RIGI expression in A549 cells is detectable only at late time points post-infection with RSV. In addition, the early antiviral response was independent of RIGI because silencing of RIGI had no effect in IFN-Î² expression during early RSV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Like A549 cells, MEFs did not express abundant NOD2 until early time points after RSV infection, and RIGI was undetectable until late time points after RSV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Thus temporal expression of NOD2 and RIGI during early and late infection, respectively, may facilitate optimal sustained IFN production from virus-infected cells.</p>
        <p id="P15">Next we examined the role of NOD2 in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), as these cells constitute the major cell type infected by RSV in humans. RSV rapidly induced NOD2 expression in NHBE cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). NOD2 was essential for IFN production, as NOD2 siRNA markedly reduced IFN-Î² production from RSV infected NHBE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The critical role of NOD2 was further established by demonstrating that BMM, MEFs and alveolar macrophages derived from NOD2-KO mice produced less IFN-Î² than wild-type counterparts after RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3dâf</xref>). NOD2-KO MEFs and BMM also exhibited defective IFN-Î² production following influenza A/<italic>PR</italic>/8/34 (H1N1) virus infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Collectively these data reveal an important role for endogenous NOD2 in the induction of antiviral immune responses.</p>

      <sec id="S5">
        <title>NOD2 interacts with viral ssRNA</title>
        <p id="P16">We next investigated the role of the viral ssRNA genome (viral-ssRNA) in NOD2 activation. Viral-ssRNA isolated from purified RSV virion particles activated IRF3 only in NOD2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). An intact ssRNA genome was required for NOD2 activation since treatment of the viral-ssRNA with RNAse abolished IRF3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Viral-ssRNA utilizes NOD2 for IFN production, as diminished IFN-Î² production following viral-ssRNA treatment was observed in MEFs and BMM isolated from NOD2-KO compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P17">The role of viral-ssRNA as an activator of NOD2 was further demonstrated by observing interaction of viral ssRNA with NOD2 within a cellular milieu. We immunoprecipitated HA-NOD2 from RSV-infected 293 cells that were transfected with HA-NOD2, and amplified bound RNA with either GAPDH (control) or RSV nucleocapsid (N) protein specific primers. These experiments revealed association of NOD2 with viral but not control RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In a cell-free assay, HA-NOD2 bound to HA-agarose beads was incubated with RSV ssRNA genome or mRNA isolated from cells. After incubation, bound RNA was amplified with either GAPDH (control) or RSV nucleocapsid (N) protein specific primers; we detected interaction of NOD2 with RSV ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In contrast, GAPDH mRNA (which is enriched in total cellular mRNA) did not associate with NOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We also observed failure of NOD1 to interact with viral ssRNA genome (data not shown). These results demonstrate that interaction of viral ssRNA genome with NOD2 results in its activation and subsequent induction of IFN production.</p>

      <sec id="S6">
        <title>MAVS is required for NOD2-mediated responses</title>
        <p id="P18">We next focused on the mechanism utilized by NOD2 to activate IRF3-IFN. As both RIGI and NOD2 posses CARD (caspase recruitment domain) domains <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, we speculated that similar to RIGI, NOD2 may also interact with MAVS. In addition, a recent study showed that the NLR family member NLRX1 interacts with mitochondrial localized MAVS via its nucleotide binding domain (NBD), a domain also found in NOD2 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Interaction of NOD2 with MAVS was essential for NOD2- mediated activation of antiviral responses, as MAVS siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) diminished RSV-induced IFN-Î² production from infected NHBE cells to an extent similar as NOD2 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Similar observations were noted in MEFs derived from MAVS-KO mice that were infected with RSV or transfected with viral or synthetic ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Influenza A virus also required MAVS for IFN production, as IFN-Î² production from NOD2-KO and MAVS-KO MEFs was reduced to a similar extent following influenza A infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). These results demonstrate that MAVS is critical for virus-induced NOD2-mediated IFN production.</p>
        <p id="P19">We next examined interaction of NOD2 with MAVS. Initially we investigated the ability of activated NOD2 to translocate to the mitochondria. Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial extract from RSV-infected NOD2 expressing cells revealed that although approximately 6%â7% of NOD2 is localized in mitochondria in uninfected cells, RSV infection resulted in enrichment (40%â45% of total cellular NOD2) of NOD2 in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed co-localization of endogenous NOD2 with mitochondria in RSV-infected A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). To study the interaction of NOD2 with MAVS, 293 cells were transfected with HA-NOD2 and GFP tagged MAVS. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of NOD2 with MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), and this interaction was enhanced following RSV infection. Please note that high levels of GFP-IPS-1 was expressed in cells (as deduced by Western blot analysis of cell lysate with anti-GFP antibody) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <bold>lower panel</bold>) and substantial amount of HA-NOD2 was bound to the anti-HA-agarose beads that were used to pull-down HA-NOD2/GFP-IPS-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast to NOD2, NOD1 failed to interact with MAVS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>). Double labeled immunofluorescence studies with RSV-infected 293 cells expressing GFP-MAVS and HA-NOD2 confirmed co-localization of NOD2 and MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Similarly, RSV infection of A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>) and NHBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>) cells enhanced colocalization of endogenous NOD2 with endogenous MAVS. These results demonstrated that NOD2 interacts with MAVS during virus infection.</p>
        <p id="P20">NOD2 can activate NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways via the kinase RICK (also known as Rip2, CARDIAK, CCK and Ripk2) <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Bacterial products like MDP specifically stimulate NOD2 and result in NF-ÎºB activation via RICK. However, treatment of NOD2 expressing 293 cells with MDP did not activate IRF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). Likewise, MDP treatment of NHBE and BMM did not result in IFN-Î² production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10b,c</xref>). In addition, RICK may not play a major role in IFN induction by NOD2 since silencing endogenous RICK expression did not alter NOD2 mediated IFN-Î² production in RSV infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). We also examined the efficiency of interaction between NOD2 and MAVS compared to RIGI and MAVS. Although both NOD2 and RIGI associated with MAVS, the RIGI-MAVS interaction was slightly more efficient than NOD2-MAVS interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>). In addition, we also observed that in RSV-infected cells, NOD2 more efficiently interacted with MAVS than with RICK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). However, NOD2 efficiently interacted with RICK in cells stimulated with the well-established NOD2 stimulator MDP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). Thus, we speculate that NOD2 utilizes either RICK or MAVS depending on the stimulus (e.g. MDP vs. ssRNA) to activate either IRF3 or NF-ÎºB.</p>
        <p id="P21">In addition to IRF3, NF-ÎºB activation is required for IFN gene expression. Although IRF3 alone is capable of inducing IFN gene transcription, the transactivating function of NF-ÎºB synergistically acts with IRF3 to promote optimal IFN expression <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. This is also true for NOD2 mediated IFN expression, as suppressing NF-ÎºB activity in RSV infected cells diminished IFN expression via activated NOD2 by 30%â35%; as expected, expression of the NF-ÎºB-dependent TNF gene in RSV infected cells was reduced by 80% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Based on these results, we speculate that NOD2 activated by stimulation by viral ssRNA interacts with MAVS to induce activation of both IRF3 and NF-ÎºB in a manner similar to that of RLHs <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In contrast, NOD2 activated by bacterial products (e.g. MDP) activates NF-ÎºB via RICK. Further detailed studies are required to investigate the role of NOD2 in activating NF-ÎºB pathway during virus infection and the role of MAVS and RICK during these events.</p>

        <title>MAVS interacts with LRR-NBD domains of NOD2</title>
        <p id="P22">The CARD domain of RIGI promotes its association with MAVS, whereas NLRX1 utilizes its NBD domain to interact with MAVS. Thus, we next investigated the role of NBD, CARD and LRR domains of NOD2 in MAVS association. For these studies, we generated various His-Myc tagged versions of NOD2 deletion mutants â ÎCARD (NOD2 mutant lacking both CARD domains), ÎNBD (NOD2 mutant lacking the NBD domain) and ÎLRR (NOD2 mutant lacking the LRR domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). These mutants were expressed in 293 cells along with GFP-MAVS. Lysates obtained from these cells were precipitated with nickel-agarose beads and, after washing, the proteins bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GFP. While ÎCARD was capable of interacting with MAVS, both ÎNBD and ÎLRR failed to associate with MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Comparable amounts of GFP- MAVS protein were expressed in the various NOD2 mutant expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). In addition, similar amounts of His-Myc tagged NOD2 mutants were bound to the Nickel-agarose beads during the experimental condition used to study interaction of MAVS with NOD2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). These results indicate that unlike RIGI, the CARD domains of NOD2 are not important for its interaction with MAVS. However, the NBD and LRR domains of NOD2 are required for MAVS association.</p>
        <p id="P23">This conclusion was further validated by examining the functionality of the NOD2 mutants in activating IRF3. Infection of 293 cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant (ÎCARD, ÎNBD, ÎLRR) NOD2 constructs revealed that wild-type NOD2 and ÎCARD, but neither ÎNBD nor ÎLRR, induced IRF3 activation after infection with RSV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).</p>

        <p id="P24">Finally, we assessed the physiological role of NOD2 by infecting wild-type and NOD2-KO mice with RSV. The mouse model of RSV infection mimics virus infection in humans, as infected mice can develop disease states resembling pneumonia <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; in addition, mice induce a robust antiviral response characterized by production of IFN-Î² and expression of IFN-dependent genes like Mx during early RSV infection (within 12h post-infection) <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Moreover, RSV is sensitive to IFN in infected mice because as low as 200 units per ml of IFN inhibits RSV infection in mice by 100 fold <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. It is important to mention that during RSV infection of mouse respiratory tract, IFN is induced early during infection (at 12h-2d post-infection) but its production is lost at 3d post-infection <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.

We observed expression of murine NOD2 in RSV-infected lungs at 1d post-infection, and such expression was lost at 4d post-infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15a</xref>).

        <p id="P26">It is well known that RSV causes lung disease by inducing pneumonia, a massive inflammation of the lungs <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Higher virus burden ultimately results in enhanced inflammation and exaggerated lung disease due to flooding of alveolar spaces with edema fluid. This occurs as a result of enhanced permeability of the epithelial barrier due to apoptosis of airway epithelial cells. RSV infection resulted in more severe lung pathology in NOD2-KO mice (as deduced by H&amp;E staining of lung sections 3 and 5 days post-infection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). We noted massive peribronchial lymphocytic inflammation and filling of the lumen with exudates of infiltrating neutrophils and mucus. Neutrophils constitute the major immune cells infiltrating the lung of RSV-infected mice and humans and high number of these cells in the airway causes severe immunopathology associated with RSV clinical disease <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P28">In the current study we identified NOD2 as a viral PRR that can sense viral ssRNA genomes to activate IFN production and antiviral defense. Like RLH receptors NOD2 associated with MAVS to activate IRF3 and promote IFN production. The importance of NOD2 in host defense was evident from the ability of both immune (e.g. macrophages) and non-immune (e.g. epithelial cells, MEFs) cells to utilize NOD2 for IFN production. The <italic>in vivo</italic> importance of NOD2 in antiviral responses was evident from the enhanced RSV-induced pathogenesis in infected NOD2-KO mice.</p>
      <p id="P29">It is important to mention that other PRRs including RIGI may also be involved in activating an antiviral response against paramyxoviruses like RSV <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. For quite some time, the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of RIGI in antiviral function was not documented, due to the embryonic lethal phenotype of majority of RIGI-KO mice <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. However, one strain of RIGI-KO mice generated by crossing RIGI heterozygous mice with ICR outbred mice, followed by intercrossing of the resulting RIGI heterozygous mice <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, survived to adulthood. These RIGI-KO mice exhibited impaired IFN production and enhanced susceptibility to two positive sense ssRNA viruses: Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. However no studies were conducted to demonstrate the importance of RIGI in activating the antiviral host defense apparatus against negative sense ssRNA viruses (e.g. paramyxoviruses).</p>
      <p id="P30">NOD2 is expressed in low amounts in uninfected mice <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, and we showed that its expression increased after viral infection. Our observation is similar to previous studies demonstrating that majority of PRRs (for e.g. RIGI) are expressed at low abundance, but their expression is elevated following pathogen invasion <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Similarly, we observed viruses mediated induction of NOD2 in various cells. Although in our studies we noted induction of NOD2 in virus infected MEFs; one study reported an inability of MDP to induce NOD2 expression in wild-type MEFs, this observation may have been due to a defect in MDP transport to the cytoplasm <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. Several other studies showed that NOD2 expression is stimulated by various bacteria and bacterial components <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Similarly, expression of RIGI <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and Mda-5 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> in uninfected, unstimulated wild-type MEFs is negligible, but treatment of cells with PAMPs results in up-regulation of RIGI expression <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. This mechanism of restricting expression of PRRs in un-stimulated cells may be critical to prevent uncontrolled inflammation.</p>
      <p id="P31">Although NOD2 can be activated by MDP <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, so far no studies have demonstrated direct binding of MDP to NOD2; it is only known that lack of NOD2 expression results in loss of MDP responsiveness. Thus, MDP could directly interact with NOD2, or associate with protein(s) that form a complex with NOD2. In that context, the interaction of viral-ssRNA with NOD2 demonstrated here could also be mediated indirectly via âbridgingâ protein(s). Interaction of ssRNA genomes of viruses with RIGI has also been noted previously <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. In addition to NOD2, cryopyrin (also called Nalp3), another NLR protein, activates the inflammasome and leads to IL-1 production upon stimulation with bacterial and viral (influenza A) RNA <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Although NLRs like cryopyrin <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and NLRX1 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> play an important role in innate immunity by activating the inflammasome and inhibiting IFN production, respectively, no studies have determined whether other NLRs, like NOD2, can directly contribute to antiviral responses by inducing IFN production.</p>
      <p id="P32">Previous studies <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> have shown that transfection of NOD2 alone (in the absence of any stimulant) in wild-type MEFs resulted in substantial NF-ÎºB activation. However, we found that overexpression of NOD2 in 293 cells did not induce marked activation of IRF3 in the absence of external stimuli (e.g. RSV, synthetic or viral ssRNA). Thus, it appears that NOD2-mediated activation of IRF3 is stimulus dependent, whereas RICK activation is stimulus independent.</p>
      <p id="P33">In summary, our findings demonstrated that in addition to RIGI, Mda5 and TLRs, NOD2 can also function as a viral PRR and participate in inducing antiviral signaling. Distinct temporal activation of various PRRs may be required to generate optimal antiviral responses, and various viruses may trigger induction of different classes of PRRs.</p>
