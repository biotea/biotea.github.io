        <p id="Par1">Vesicluar transport of proteins from endosomes to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) is an essential cellular pathway, but much of its machinery is still unknown. A screen for genes involved in endosome-to-TGN trafficking produced two hits, the adaptor protein-1 (AP-1 complex), which facilitates vesicle budding, and WDR11. Here we demonstrate that WDR11 forms a stable complex with two other proteins, which localises to the TGN region and does not appear to be associated with AP-1, suggesting it may act downstream from budding. In a vesicle tethering assay, capture of vesicles by golgin-245 was substantially reduced in WDR11-knockout cells. Moreover, structured illumination microscopy and relocation assays indicate that the WDR11 complex is initially recruited onto vesicles rather than the TGN, where it may in turn recruit the golgin binding partner TBC1D23. We propose that the complex acts together with TBC1D23 to facilitate the golgin-mediated capture of vesicles that were generated using AP-1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalised into membrane-bound organelles, each with a distinct protein and lipid composition. Transport of molecules between compartments is initiated by the recruitment of coat proteins onto a âdonorâ membrane. The coat proteins package selected cargo into a vesicle, which then sheds its coat and moves through the cytoplasm along cytoskeletal tracks towards its destination. Docking of the vesicle onto the âacceptorâ membrane makes use of proteins that act as tethers, while fusion requires pairing between SNAREs residing in the two apposing membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Although many pathways make use of coats, tethers and SNAREs, the actual machinery is different for each pathway. For instance, clathrin coats, together with cargo-binding adaptor proteins, facilitate endocytosis and trafficking between the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, while other types of coats act at other membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Similarly, different types of golgins tether vesicles to different Golgi subcompartments, with <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi golgins capturing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi vesicles and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi golgins capturing endosome-to-Golgi vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, in most cases it is not clear how a vesicle formed using a particular type of coat is then recognised by a particular type of tether. This is especially pertinent for clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), because the coat falls off the membrane almost immediately after budding, long before the vesicle has reached its destination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">We recently carried out a gene-trap screen on KBM7 cells to identify cellular machinery involved in the sorting of acidic cluster-containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Acidic clusters are sorting signals found in several proteins that use CCVs to cycle between the TGN and endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The screen produced two robust hits. One was the medium subunit of the AP-1 complex (Âµ1), the major adaptor for intracellular CCVs (i.e., those that traffic between the TGN and endosomes). The other was a protein called WDR11.</p>
      <p id="Par6">WDR11 is a highly conserved protein but it is still relatively uncharacterised. Proposed functions include tumour suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, transcriptional regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, trafficking of endocytosed ricin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and control of viral assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. WDR11 has been reported to localise to the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, to autophagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and to the TGN;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> while proposed binding partners include the transcription factor EMX1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, the herpes simplex virus protein ICP0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and a protein of unknown function, C17orf75<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par7">In a subcellular proteomics study from our own laboratory, we proposed an interaction between WDR11, C17orf75 and another uncharacterised protein, FAM91A1, based on their remarkably similar fractionation profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, AP-1 and other CCV components were found to have very different fractionation profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, WDR11 and AP-1 show similar phenotypes upon depletion, both in our acidic cluster sorting screen and in a ricin toxicity screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, it seems likely that the two proteins contribute to the same pathway rather than physically associate with each other.</p>
      <p id="Par8">In the present study, we have used several approaches to learn more about what WDR11 actually does, and how it fits in with clathrin/AP-1-mediated vesicle budding. We find that WDR11 is part of a stable complex, which appears to be specific for vesicles generated using AP-1, and which contributes to the tethering of these vesicles by interacting indirectly with the TGN-associated golgin, golgin-245, via the recently described âbridging factorâ TBC1D23<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>

        <p id="Par9">Our forward genetic screening approach is shown diagrammatically in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. KBM7 cells were stably transduced to express a chimera containing the extracellular/lumenal and transmembrane domains of CD8 and a cytoplasmic tail derived from furin, which normally localises mainly to the TGN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The cells were then infected with a gene-trap retrovirus and sorted by flow cytometry for increased surface expression of the construct. Disrupted genes were identified by deep sequencing. Two robust hits were found, <italic>AP1M1</italic> and <italic>WDR11</italic>, both with three independent insertions into the first intron.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of WDR11 as a protein involved in acidic cluster sorting. <bold>a</bold> A CD8-Furin* chimera was constructed with a mutation in the YKGL sorting signal (AKGL). Blue: acidic cluster. Near-haploid KBM7 cells stably expressing this construct were infected with a gene-trap retrovirus. Mutant cells with increased surface expression of the construct were isolated by flow cytometry, DNA was extracted and viral insertions were identified by deep sequencing. Two hits were found, encoded by the <italic>AP1M1</italic> and <italic>WDR11</italic> genes. <bold>b</bold> The <italic>WDR11</italic> gene was disrupted in HeLa cells and the knockout was confirmed by western blotting, using clathrin heavy chain as a loading control. <bold>c</bold> A mixed population of wild-type and WDR11-knockout cells was double labelled for WDR11 and the AP-1 Î³ subunit. The insert shows that WDR11 (red) does not display the punctate peripheral labelling seen with anti-Î³ (green). Scale bar: 20âÂµm. <bold>d</bold> Wild-type and WDR11-knockout cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CD8-Furin* or CD8-CPD, together with a GFP-encoding plasmid to control for transfection efficiency.

        <p id="Par10">To investigate the phenotype of WDR11 deficiency in a more amenable system, we disrupted the gene in HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and two different guide RNAs (gRNAs). One clone was selected for each gRNA, and loss of WDR11 was verified by DNA sequencing and western blotting (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). To determine the localisation of WDR11, we mixed together wild-type cells and (as a control) WDR11-knockout cells, then double labelled for WDR11 and the Î³ subunit of AP-1 (AP-1 Î³; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Endogenous WDR11 was found to have a juxtanuclear pattern, consistent with a TGN localisation, and showed partial overlap with AP-1, at least at the light microscope level. However, WDR11 is more tightly juxtanuclear than AP-1, without the punctate peripheral pattern that has been shown to correspond to endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (inset). Moreover, unlike AP-1 and other components of the intracellular clathrin coat, WDR11 is not sensitive to brefeldin A (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These observations provide further support for the hypothesis that WDR11 contributes to the AP-1 pathway without being physically associated with AP-1.</p>
        <p id="Par11">To confirm that the loss of WDR11 causes an increase in the surface expression of acidic cluster-containing proteins, we transiently transfected wild-type and WDR11-knockout HeLa cells with plasmids encoding either the CD8-Furin* chimera used in our screen, or a CD8 chimera with its tail derived from carboxypeptidase D (CPD), another acidic cluster-containing protein sorted by AP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Flow cytometry revealed that there was an â¼3-fold increase in surface expression of both CD8-Furin* and CD8-CPD, in both of the WDR11-knockout cell lines (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), validating the KBM7 cell phenotype. We also found an increase in the surface expression of two endogenous AP-1 cargo proteins with acidic cluster sorting signals, the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) and a protein of unknown function, KIAA0319L, even though the overall levels of these two proteins were unchanged (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1eâg</xref>). Moreover, we were able to rescue the phenotype by transfecting the knockout cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged WDR11 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Together, these experiments demonstrate that in the absence of WDR11, proteins that are normally mainly intracellular become mislocalised and spill over onto the plasma membrane.</p>

        <title>WDR11 forms a stable complex with FAM91A1 and C17orf75</title>
        <p id="Par12">To identify binding partners for WDR11, we carried out immunoprecipitations under non-denaturing conditions, using our knockout cells as a control, and identified co-precipitating proteins by mass spectrometry (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Two proteins specifically came down in the wild-type cells, FAM91A1 and C17orf75, the same two proteins identified as potential partners by fractionation profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Double labelling with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either WDR11 or FAM91A1, and a mouse monoclonal antibody against C17orf75, demonstrated that the three proteins colocalise in the TGN region (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Identification of the WDR11 complex. <bold>a</bold> Extracts from wild-type and WDR11-knockout cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-WDR11, and precipitating proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The arrows on the Coomassie blue-stained gel indicate, from top to bottom, WDR11, FAM91A1, and C17orf75 (running close to the IgG heavy chain band). <bold>b</bold> HeLa cells were double labelled for either WDR11 (green) and C17orf75 (red), or FAM91A1 (red) and C17orf75 (green). The proteins have virtually identical localisation patterns. Scale bar: 20âÂµm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_2919_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e481"/></fig></p>
        <p id="Par13">Some protein complexes, such as AP-1, require all of their subunits for stability and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, while others contain subunits that are able to function autonomously. To investigate the relationship between WDR11, FAM91A1 and C17orf75, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout either FAM91A1 or C17orf75 in HeLa cells, then validated the gene disruptions by immunofluorescence, DNA sequencing and (in the case of C17orf75) western blotting. Immunofluorescence was then used to investigate the localisation of each of the subunits in cells that had lost one of them. Because of antibody incompatibility, we could not double label for WDR11 and FAM91A1; however, C17orf75 was lost from the TGN region in both WDR11-disrupted and FAM91A1-disrupted cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, asterisks), so in both cases we could identify the knockout cells by their loss of juxtanuclear C17orf75. We found that both WDR11 and FAM91A1 are essential for proper localisation of the complex. In contrast, knocking out C17orf75 did not affect the localisation of the other two proteins, indicating that it is more dispensable.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Interdependence of the subunits of the WDR11 complex. <bold>a</bold> The WDR11, FAM91A1 and C17orf75 genes were independently knocked out, then double labelling was used to investigate the localisation of binding partners in mixed populations of wild-type and knockout (asterisks) cells.

The WDR11 blot is the same one shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. <bold>c</bold> C17orf75 and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from wild-type, WDR11-disrupted and FAM91A1-disrupted cell lysates and analysed by mass spectrometry. In addition to revealing changes in protein stability and/or interactions, the data show that the FAM91A1 disruption was not a true knockout. <bold>d</bold> Summary of the results of <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>. <bold>e</bold> Eukaryotic tree of life showing the inferred point of origin of the genes encoding the three subunits, and which proteins are present in various modern organisms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_2919_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e530"/></fig></p>
        <p id="Par14">These findings were extended by probing western blots of control and knockout cell homogenates with antibodies against either WDR11 or C17orf75 (the antibody against FAM91A1 is not suitable for western blotting). We found that disrupting WDR11 did not affect the stability of C17orf75, while disrupting FAM91A1 affected the stability of both WDR11 and C17orf75 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). We also investigated the effect of the WDR11 and FAM91A1 disruptions by performing immunoprecipitations under non-denaturing conditions using the antibody against C17orf75, followed by mass spectrometry (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>). Consistent with our western blotting results, we found reduced levels of C17orf75 in the immunoprecipitates from the FAM91A1-disrupted cells but not from the WDR11-disrupted cells, as well as reduced levels of WDR11 in immunoprecipitates from the FAM91A1-disrupted cells. We also found less FAM91A1 in the immunoprecipitates from the WDR11-disrupted cells, indicating that it was either less stable or less able to assemble. In addition, we discovered that our disruption of the <italic>FAM91A1</italic> gene, which was verified by sequencing, was not in fact a true knockout, because we could still detect small amounts of FAM91A1 in the immunoprecipitates, which were presumably translated from a different start codon. Therefore, all subsequent experiments investigating knockout phenotypes were carried out on the WDR11-disrupted cells.</p>
        <p id="Par15">Analysis of the phyletic distribution of the three subunits showed that WDR11 and FAM91A1 are present in all five eukaryotic supergroups (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This indicates that both of these proteins were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor some 1.5 billion years ago. In contrast, C17orf75 was only found in Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta, suggesting that it originated just before these two supergroups diverged. The evolutionary history of the three subunits supports our hypothesis that C17orf75 is more dispensable than WDR11 or FAM91A1.</p>

Immunofluorescence labelling of a mixed population of WDR11-knockout and wild-type HeLa cells showed that loss of WDR11 causes endogenous CIMPR to move from a mainly juxtanuclear distribution to a more peripheral, punctate distribution (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). There were also changes in the steady-state localisation of CPD and KIAA0319L (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), which could be rescued with exogenous WDR11 (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Block in endosome-to-TGN trafficking in WDR11-knockout cells. <bold>a</bold> Widefield image of a mixed population of wild-type and WDR11-knockout cells double labelled for WDR11 and CIMPR.

        <p id="Par17">To identify the compartment containing the mislocalised cargo, we allowed wild-type and WDR11-knockout cells to endocytose fluorescent epidermal growth factor (EGF; EGF-A555) for either 10 or 45âmin, then labelled the cells with anti-CIMPR. There was substantially more overlap between the two signals in the cells lacking WDR11 at both time points (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, d</xref>), suggesting that knocking out WDR11 may cause a defect in endosome-to-TGN trafficking.</p>
        <p id="Par18">To test this hypothesis, we carried out antibody uptake assays. WDR11 was knocked out in HeLa cells stably expressing either CD8-CIMPR or CD8-CPD. The cells were then incubated with anti-CD8 for 15âmin at 37âÂ°C, washed, chased for 45âmin at 37âÂ°C, fixed and double labelled for endocytosed anti-CD8 and the Golgi-localised glycoprotein GLG1. In wild-type cells, much of the endocytosed antibody localised to the Golgi region, but in WDR11-knockout cells, the antibody accumulated in more peripheral structures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). To quantify these differences, we defined two areas, Golgi and non-Golgi, and then calculated the Golgi:non-Golgi ratio of mean CD8 fluorescence for each cell line (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We found a two- to five-fold decrease in Golgi-to-non-Golgi fluorescence in the WDR11-knockout cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par19">To visualise the missorting compartment at the electron microscope level, we carried out an antibody uptake assay under somewhat different conditions, in order to maximise labelling efficiency. Cells expressing either CD8-CIMPR of CD8-CPD were allowed to endocytose fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD8 for 3âh at 37âÂ°C, then the endocytosed antibody was localised with anti-FITC followed by protein-A coupled to colloidal gold (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). To quantify the labelling, each gold particle was assigned to an organelle. In wild-type cells, very little labelling was observed in multivesicular bodies (MVBs; 4.9% for CD8-CIMPR; 1.1% for CD8-CPD), but there was a dramatic increase in MVB labelling in the WDR11-knockout cells (15.4% for CD8-CIMPR; 21.8% for CD8-CPD), with a concomitant reduction in label associated with tubular and/or TGN compartments (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This indicates that in the absence of WDR11, the antibody was getting delivered to late endosomes. Together, these observations point to a role for the WDR11 complex in the trafficking of AP-1-dependent cargo proteins from early and/or recycling endosomes to the TGN.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Accumulation of cargo in MVBs in WDR11-knockout cells. <bold>a</bold> CD8-CPD-expressing cells were allowed to endocytose FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 for 3âh, then the endocytosed antibody was localised with anti-FITC using immunogold on cryosections.

        <title>BioID identifies proteins in proximity to the WDR11 complex</title>
        <p id="Par20">Although the only specific binding partners for WDR11 detected in our immunoprecipitations were FAM91A1 and C17orf75, we suspected that there might be additional interactions that were too transient to be captured by immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we used BioID to try to identify new binding partners. The BioID technique makes use of a promiscuous biotin ligase, BirA*, to biotinylate proteins within a ~10ânm radius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Five cell lines expressing BirA* constructs were generated: one for each of the subunits of the complex; and two control cell lines expressing either BirA* only or BirA*-tagged GFP. Correct localisation of the tagged proteins was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). The cells were incubated with biotin for 24âh, then the biotinylated proteins were affinity-purified from cell lysates and identified by mass spectrometry.

There was also strong enrichment of the cargo protein CIMPR (<italic>IGF2R</italic>) in all three data sets. Other proteins were enriched in only one of the data sets, and most of these are unlikely to be involved in membrane traffic. However, Rab6A was a hit in the WDR11 data set, and golgin-245 (<italic>GOLGA4</italic>) and TBC1D23 were hits in the FAM91A1 data set (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref> and Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

        <title>The WDR11 complex assists vesicle tethering via golgin-245</title>
        <p id="Par22">To test the physiological relevance of the link with golgin-245, we made use of the assay developed by Wong and Munro, in which golgins are ectopically localised to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where they are still able to capture vesicles. We first investigated the localisation of the WDR11 complex in cells that had been transiently transfected with mitochondrial golgin-245 (golgin-245-mito)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. WDR11 was found to be rerouted to mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), validating the BioID data. Next, we transfected golgin-245-mito into both wild-type and WDR11-knockout cells, then labelled for endogenous CIMPR (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). In the wild-type cells, much of the CIMPR labelling was found to colocalise with golgin-245-mito, as previously reported by Wong and Munro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, there was considerably less recruitment of the CIMPR to mitochondria in the WDR11-knockout cells, indicating that the WDR11 complex acts together with golgin-245 to facilitate vesicle capture.</p>
        <p id="Par23">Golgin-245 captures not only CIMPR but also other AP-1-dependent cargo proteins such as CDMPR and Vti1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, suggesting that it might specifically tether AP-1-derived transport vesicles. To test this possibility, we transfected golgin-245-mito into two independent AP-1-knockout clones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The phenotype was virtually identical to that of WDR11-knockout cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>), indicating that AP-1 may be needed to form the vesicles that are then tethered by the WDR11 complex. Neither knockout completely abolished the rerouting of CIMPR-containing vesicles to mitochondria, however, suggesting that some of the vesicles might be generated using other types of machinery, such as retromer and/or sorting nexins.</p>
        <p id="Par24">To what extent do the WDR11 complex and the AP-1 complex depend upon each other for function? Although we did not see any abnormalities in the distribution of AP-1 in the WDR11-knockout cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), we found that knocking out AP-1 caused WDR11 to adopt a much more diffuse distribution (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The total amount of WDR11 was unchanged, however (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), and subcellular fractionation indicated that much of it was still membrane-bound (Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). These observations suggest that without AP-1, the complex can still be recruited, but onto different membranes.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Characterisation of the WDR11-binding compartment. <bold>a</bold> Mixed populations of wild-type and AP-1-knockout cells, or AP-1-knockout cells and rescued AP-1-knockout cells, were stained for WDR11 and AP-1 Î³.

Scale bars: 20âÂµm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_2919_Fig7_HTML" id="d29e799"/></fig></p>
        <p id="Par25">What membranes does the WDR11 complex normally associate with? One possibility is that it may be recruited onto the TGN, by binding (directly or indirectly) to golgin-245, where it lies in wait for incoming AP-1-derived vesicles. Alternatively, it might be recruited initially onto the vesicles. We addressed this question in two ways. First, to localise WDR11 and golgin-245 more precisely, we used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM). Although the two labels still overlapped, there were distinct differences in the two patterns. In particular, the WDR11 antibody labelled a cloud of dots in the TGN region, which is unlikely to be background because we did not see such a cloud in WDR11-knockout cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>, asterisk). This suggests that much of the complex is associated with vesicles.</p>
        <p id="Par26">Our second approach was to make use of a cell line we had generated for an earlier âknocksidewaysâ study, which coexpresses FKBP-tagged gadkin (a palmitoylated AP-1-binding partner that also binds kinesin-1 and the Arp2/3 complex) and FRB-tagged Mitotrap (a mitochondrial trapping construct). Addition of rapamycin to these cells causes AP-1-derived vesicles to become crosslinked to mitochondria and pulled out to the cell periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Under these conditions, WDR11 was dramatically relocated to the perimeter of the cell, while golgin-245 remained mainly juxtanuclear (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). This observation provides further evidence that WDR11 is initially recruited onto AP-1-derived vesicles, which then become attached to golgin-245 at the TGN.</p>

        <title>The WDR11 complex may act upstream of TBC1D23</title>
        <p id="Par27">Shin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> provide compelling evidence that TBC1D23 links the WDR11 complex to golgins, including the demonstration that loss of TBC1D23 causes the complex to adopt a diffuse rather than a Golgi-localised distribution. Although at first this finding seems to suggest that TBC1D23 recruits the WDR11 complex onto membranes, an alternative explanation is that the WDR11 complex is still attached to membranes in the absence of TBC1D23, but those membranes are difficult to distinguish because they are in the form of small vesicles spread throughout the cell rather than concentrated in a particular region. The observation that WDR11-positive vesicles cluster at the cell periphery in gadkin knocksideways cells enabled us to carry out further investigations into the sequence of events.</p>
        <p id="Par28">First, we localised TBC1D23 in the gadkin knocksideways cells, and found that much of it was relocated to the cell periphery, where it colocalised with gadkin-FKBP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Next, we examined the effect of knocking down either TBC1D23 or a component of the WDR11 complex. Depleting TBC1D23 did not affect the colocalisation of the WDR11 complex with gadkin-FKBP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). However, when we depleted components of the WDR11 complex, TBC1D23 no longer moved to the cell periphery in gadkin knocksideways cells, but stayed in the Golgi region (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref> and Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9aâc</xref>). These findings suggest that the WDR11 complex may be recruiting TBC1D23 rather than the other way around.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Recruitment of TBC1D23 by the WDR11 complex. <bold>a</bold> Gadkin knocksideways cells were treated as in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref> and then labelled for gadkin-FKBP, TBC1D23 and golgin-245. Like WDR11, much of the TBC1D23 is relocated to the cell periphery. <bold>b</bold> Knocking down TBC1D23 does not affect the ability of the WDR11 complex to be redistributed in gadkin knocksideways cells. <bold>c</bold> In contrast, knocking down FAM91A1 prevents TBC1D23 from being redistributed in gadkin knocksideways cells, causing it to remain colocalised with golgin-245. <bold>d</bold> FAM91A1 knocksideways causes TBC1D23 to be relocated to mitochondria, while the localisation of golgin-245 does not change. Scale bars: 20âÂµm. Representative confocal images are shown from three independent experiments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_2919_Fig8_HTML" id="d29e860"/></fig></p>
        <p id="Par29">We also made use of the knocksideways system to relocate the WDR11 complex to mitochondria, by putting an FKBP domain onto FAM91A1 and coexpressing it with Mitotrap. Addition of rapamycin for 10âmin not only caused the complex to be rerouted onto mitochondria but also changed the localisation of TBC1D23, while golgin-245 remained in its usual position (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref> and Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9d</xref>). Thus, at least under these conditions, the WDR11 complex is capable of recruiting TBC1D23. Together, our findings suggest that the WDR11 complex acts upstream of TBC1D23, recruiting it onto AP-1-derived vesicles, which then use TBC1D23 for the next step, docking onto the TGN by interacting with golgins.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par30">In our gene-trap screen for machinery involved in the sorting of acidic cluster-containing cargo, we identified two hits: the Âµ subunit of AP-1 and WDR11. In the present study, we show that WDR11 facilitates vesicle docking. Thus, our screen turned up machinery acting at both ends of the endosome-to-TGN pathway: the initial vesicle budding stage and the final vesicle tethering stage.</p>
      <p id="Par31">Previous studies on WDR11 suggested it might play some sort of role in membrane traffic, but there was no consensus as to its localisation or function. By comparing wild-type and knockout cells, we were able to show that WDR11 localises to the TGN region and surrounding puncta, and that it facilitates endosome-to-TGN trafficking. Paradoxically, a screen for genes involved in ricin sensitivity showed that silencing WDR11 with short hairpin RNA increased the susceptibility of cells to the toxin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Ricin is trafficked from endosomes back to the ER via the TGN, so one might have expected the cells to become less sensitive to ricin, not more. However, the same study showed that knocking down other machinery involved in retrograde traffic, such as AP-1, retromer and COPI, also sensitised the cells to ricin. It is possible that some of these effects were indirect, caused by upregulation of compensatory pathways and/or the creation of bottlenecks that caused the toxin to take a different route.</p>
      <p id="Par32">Indirect effects may also explain why, in the present study, endosome-to-TGN cargo proteins accumulated on the plasma membrane and in late endosomes rather than in vesicles. A similar phenotype has been seen in yeast cells with deletions in genes encoding subunits of the GARP complex, which also acts as a tethering factor for endosome-to-TGN vesicles: cargo proteins were mislocalised to the vacuole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Clearly the cell needs to maintain homoestasis between vesicle budding and vesicle consumption, and it may do so by somehow allowing vesicles to fuse with the wrong compartment if necessary, rather than to build up indefinitely.</p>
      <p id="Par33">WDR11 is stably associated with two other poorly characterised proteins, FAM91A1 and C17orf75. Secondary structure predictions indicate that all three proteins are mainly folded, and WDR11 is predicted to consist of two seven-bladed Î²-propellers followed by an Î±-solenoid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/">http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred">https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred</ext-link>). This type of architecture is also seen in several of the subunits of the HOPS/CORVET tethering complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, as well as in vesicle coats, nuclear pore components and subunits of the intraflagellar transport complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Structural studies will be essential for resolving how the complex is put together and how it interacts with other proteins involved in tethering, in particular with TBC1D23, which links the WDR11 complex to golgins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par34">When does the WDR11 complex get recruited onto the membrane? The complex does not appear to be associated with CCVs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Borner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>), so we propose that it gets recruited onto vesicles some time after budding and uncoating. Evidence that these vesicles were made using AP-1 comes from the finding that all of the cargo proteins that have been identified by biotinylation, relocation to mitochondria and/or mislocalisation are also cargo proteins for AP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We think that recruitment of the complex occurs before the vesicles actually reach the TGN, because of our SIM microscopy and gadkin knocksideways experiments (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, d</xref>). The gadkin knocksideways experiments also indicate that TBC1D23 is recruited onto the vesicles by the WDR11 complex, rather than the other way around (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Once the vesicles arrive at the TGN, TBC1D23 links them to golgin-245<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the absence of WDR11, vesicles containing AP-1-dependent cargo are no longer able to be guided efficiently to the TGN, and the cargo proteins (including those containing acidic clusters) become mislocalised to other membranes, in particular the plasma membrane and late endosomes.</p>
      <p id="Par35">Even in the absence of WDR11, some CIMPR-containing vesicles can still be captured by golgin-245, although the levels are reduced (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Similarly, Shin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> show that there is still cargo capture in FAM91A1-deficient cells, but not in TBC1D23-deficient cells. We suspect that this is because there are distinct populations of endosome-to-TGN carriers, made with different types of machinery, including retromer and sorting nexins as well as AP-1. More than one of these population may make use of TBC1D23. This possibility is supported by the demonstration by Shin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> that TBC1D23 binds to the WASH complex, which is recruited onto membranes by retromer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par36">Perhaps the most fundamental question posed by the present study is how the AP-1-derived vesicles are recognised by the WDR11 complex. In some cases of vesicle budding followed by tethering, there is a direct interaction between coats and tethers: for instance, the Sec23 subunit of the COPII coat binds to the Bet3 subunit of the TRAPPI complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, this does not appear to be the case for AP-1, which is rapidly removed after the vesicle buds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A more likely scenario is one where the WDR11-containing complex recognises a component of the vesicle that was first put into place by AP-1, such as a rab or a SNARE. Candidates for such components can be found in the list of proteins associated with the AP-1-dependent population of vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, as well as in the list of proteins affected by gadkin knocksideways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. There is a great deal of overlap between the two lists, but importantly, the WDR11 complex and TBC1D23 appear as hits in the second list only.</p>
      <p id="Par37">However, recruitment of the WDR11 complex onto membranes is not necessarily mediated by a single docking site. A common theme that has emerged in membrane traffic is coincidence detection, where multiple low-affinity interactions help to ensure that a protein gets to the right place at the right time. For instance, recruitment of AP-1 and other intracellular adaptors onto the appropriate membrane requires small GTPases, phosphoinositides, cargo proteins and other coat components. Conformational changes and reversible modifications also contribute to membrane association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It seems likely that similar mechanisms may be involved in the recruitment of tethering proteins. Our discovery of a functional link between AP-1 and the WDR11 complex should help to uncover the mechanisms used by different populations of vesicles to find their targets.</p>

The beads were then pelleted and washed three times in 1âml RIPA buffer, twice with 1âml TBS, twice in 1âml then once in 200âÂµl 50âmM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. The proteins were then reduced in 10âmM dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide (50â55âmM) and digested with trypsin (1âÂµg; Roche). The eluted proteins were collected, spun at 15â000âÃâ<italic>g</italic> for 10âmin at room temperature, spiked with 1âÂµl of 100% trifluoroacetic acid and dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Eppendorf). The final protein pellet was analysed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative label-free quantification was performed across four biological replicate experiments.</p>
        <p id="Par61">Statistical analysis was performed using the Perseus MaxQuant analysis package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.perseus-framework.org/">http://www.perseus-framework.org/</ext-link>). The protein identification lists were filtered by removing matches to the reverse database, proteins only identified with modified peptides and common contaminants. Abundance ratios were then log<sub>2</sub>-transformed and the list was further filtered by removing proteins with fewer than two valid values in at least one group (control or WDR11 complex samples). Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed for all identified proteins, across all replicates versus the control data set. Volcano plot analysis was used to identify enriched proteins, with the criteria: FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic> value â¤0.01 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change â¥2.</p>

        <p id="Par62">Potential orthologues of each component of the WDR11 complex were identified from a broad, representative distribution of eukaryotic genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> using both Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)- and iterative HMM (jackhmmer)-based approaches with the human sequences as the initial query. Where no orthologues were identified in specific taxa, further searches were carried out using candidate orthologues from phylogenetically closer taxa as queries. Orthology of the candidate sequences was assessed using the reciprocal BLAST method against the non-redundant protein database as well as reciprocal jackhmmer searches using the candidate sequence as the initial query. Sequences were considered orthologous if they retrieved query sequences with an <italic>E</italic> value at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the next best hit from the same taxa. The full taxonomic distribution of WDR11 complex components across all taxa searched can be found in Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>
