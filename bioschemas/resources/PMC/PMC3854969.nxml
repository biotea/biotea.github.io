      <abstract>
        <p>Cilia are microtubule-based cell appendages, serving motility, chemo-/mechano-/photo- sensation, and developmental signaling functions. Cilia are comprised of distinct structural and functional subregions including the basal body, transition zone (TZ) and inversin (Inv) compartments, and defects in this organelle are associated with an expanding spectrum of inherited disorders including Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Meckel-Gruber Syndrome (MKS), Joubert Syndrome (JS) and Nephronophthisis (NPHP). Despite major advances in understanding ciliary trafficking pathways such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), how proteins are transported to subciliary membranes remains poorly understood. Using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and mammalian cells, we investigated the transport mechanisms underlying compartmentalization of JS-associated ARL13B/ARL-13, which we previously found is restricted at proximal ciliary membranes. We now show evolutionary conservation of ARL13B/ARL-13 localisation to an Inv-like subciliary membrane compartment, excluding the TZ, in many <italic>C. elegans</italic> ciliated neurons and in a subset of mammalian ciliary subtypes. Compartmentalisation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 requires a C-terminal RVVP motif and membrane anchoring to prevent distal cilium and nuclear targeting, respectively. Quantitative imaging in more than 20 mutants revealed differential contributions for IFT and ciliopathy modules in defining the ARL-13 compartment; IFT-A/B, IFT-dynein and BBS genes prevent ARL-13 accumulation at periciliary membranes, whereas MKS/NPHP modules additionally inhibit ARL-13 association with TZ membranes. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> FRAP analyses revealed distinct roles for IFT and MKS/NPHP genes in regulating a TZ barrier to ARL-13 diffusion, and intraciliary ARL-13 diffusion. Finally, <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 undergoes IFT-like motility and quantitative protein complex analysis of human ARL13B identified functional associations with IFT-B complexes, mapped to IFT46 and IFT74 interactions. Together, these findings reveal distinct requirements for sequence motifs, IFT and ciliopathy modules in defining an ARL-13 subciliary membrane compartment. We conclude that MKS/NPHP modules comprise a TZ barrier to ARL-13 diffusion, whereas IFT genes predominantly facilitate ARL-13 ciliary entry and/or retention via active transport mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Protruding from most cells surfaces is a hair-like extension called the primary cilium. This organelle functions as a cellular antenna, receiving physical and chemical signals such as light, odorants, and molecules that coordinate cell growth, differentiation and migration. Underscoring their importance, cilium defects underlie an expanding spectrum of diseases termed ciliopathies, characterised by wide-ranging symptoms such as cystic kidneys, blindness and bone abnormalities. A key question is how ciliary proteins are targeted to and retained within cilia. The best understood system is intraflagellar transport (IFT), thought to ferry proteins between the ciliary base and tip. Also, ciliopathy protein modules organise protein diffusion barriers at the ciliary base transition zone (TZ). Despite major advances, it remains poorly understood how proteins are targeted to cilia, and ciliary membrane subdomains in particular. Here, we investigated how Joubert syndrome-associated ARL13B/ARL-13 is compartmentalized at subciliary membranes. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes and mammalian cell experimental systems, we uncovered differential requirements for sequence motifs, IFT and ciliopathy modules in regulating ARL-13 ciliary restriction, mobility and compartment length. Also, we provide essential insight into how IFT and ciliopathy-associated protein complexes and modules influence ciliary membrane protein transport, diffusion across the TZ, the integrity of the ciliary membrane, and subciliary protein composition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Primary cilia are organized into specific subcompartments, defined by distinct ultrastructure, protein and lipid compositions, and include the basal body (BB), the adjacent transition zone (TZ), and axonemal regions consisting of doublet and singlet microtubules <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Fisch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Ciliary subcompartments are important for the organelle's structural and functional properties. For example, BB transitional fibers anchor the cilium to the plasma membrane and serve as a docking site for ciliary transport machineries, and the TZ is thought to act as a âciliary gateâ or diffusion barrier regulating protein access <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Multiple proteins linked to ciliopathies such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), nephronophthisis (NPHP), oral-facial digital syndrome (OFD) and Joubert syndrome (JS) are sequestered within specific ciliary subdomains. These include at least twenty MKS/NPHP/JS-associated proteins concentrated at the TZ, multiple ciliopathy proteins targeted specifically at the BB such as OFD1, and proteins such as NPHP2/INVS confined to a proximal ciliary subdomain called the Inversin compartment <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-WarburtonPitt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Functionally, many of these proteins regulate cilium-based signaling (e.g., via Sonic hedgehog and Wnt) that probably occurs at specific subciliary domains.</p>
      <p>Targeting of proteins to cilia depends on intracellular transport mechanisms. The best studied is intraflagellar transport (IFT), an evolutionarily conserved motor protein-driven bidirectional motility of macromolecular assemblies along ciliary axonemes, essential for cilium formation and function (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Blacque1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). Anterograde IFT (base to tip) is driven predominantly by kinesin-2 motors, the canonical motor being heterotrimeric kinesin-II, whereas a cilium-specific cytoplasmic dynein complex powers retrograde IFT (tip to base). Associated with the motors and essential for IFT are IFT-B (â¼14 proteins) and IFT-A (â¼6 proteins) complexes. Proteins required for cilium biogenesis, maintenance and function are thought to be delivered to cilia by IFT and a handful of specific âcargosâ with IFT-like motility have been uncovered, including axonemal tubulin subunits, a transmembrane TRPV channel (OSM-9) and Polycystin 2 (PKD2) <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Hao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Additional putative cargos are Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, which are known to regulate kinesin-2 motor (kinesin-II and homodimeric OSM-3/KIF17) association in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and flagellar export of signaling proteins in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Blacque2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Compartmentalisation of ciliary proteins is heavily influenced by events at the ciliary base, with BB transitional fibers and TZ Y-links forming structural blocks to vesicle entry, and periciliary and TZ membranes thought to serve as diffusion barriers to membrane proteins (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Nachury1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). Although the molecular basis of these barriers is unclear, multiple ciliopathy proteins are implicated in regulating TZ ultrastructure and ciliary protein composition <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Craige1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, two genetically separable TZ modules with redundant ciliogenic functions are defined; an NPHP module consisting of NPHP1 and NPHP4, and an MKS module consisting of at least MKS1, B9D1/MKSR-1, B9D2/MKSR-2, MKS-2/TMEM16, MKS3, and MKS6/CC2D2A <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. At the periciliary/BB region, septin GTPases, which form ring and cage-like structures, prevent exchange of ciliary transmembrane proteins with non-ciliary pools <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Ciliary âgatingâ may also involve nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery, which localise at the ciliary base and in cilia, and are implicated in targeting proteins to the organelle <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Kee1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Finally, the BB is where IFTA/B complexes, motors and cargo assemble into functional trains before moving into cilia.</p>
      <p>We investigate ciliary protein transport in <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory neurons. These highly polarised cells are ideal for ciliary transport studies since there is large spatial resolution between the various subcellular compartments and the primary cilium, which extends from distal tips of dendrites. Also, ciliary subcompartments are well defined. For example, amphid and phasmid channel cilia possess a degenerate basal body consisting only of transitional fibers, relatively long (â¼1 Âµm) TZs, and bipartite axonemal structures consisting of doublet microtubules (middle segment) or singlet microtubules (distal segment) <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Inglis1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Most <italic>C. elegans</italic> cilia are environmentally exposed, relaying chemosensory, thermosensory and osmosensory signals. Many ciliary transport and ciliopathy genes are conserved in worms, and loss-of-function alleles are available for most of them. Importantly, unlike other systems, some resemblance of cilium structure remains in most IFT and ciliopathy gene mutants, thus allowing ciliary protein targeting to be investigated.</p>
      <p>Despite major progress, the targeting and retention mechanisms regulating trafficking of cytosolic and membrane ciliary proteins are not well understood. For example, although IFT is an assumed driver of ciliary transport, only a handful of IFT cargos have been identified and there is evidence that a number of membrane proteins (e.g., PKD2) still localize to cilia in IFT disrupted cells, although ciliary abundance levels may be elevated <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Pazour1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Bae1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In particular, we know very little about how the various IFT subcomplexes and ciliopathy modules target proteins to specific ciliary membrane subdomains. To address these questions, this study focused on ARL13B, which is disrupted in a subset of Joubert syndrome patients (JBTS8; <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cantagrel1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). This membrane-associated small GTPase localises almost exclusively in cilia, and in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the ARL-13 orthologue is further refined to a proximal ciliary subdomain <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Caspary1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. ARL13B/ARL-13 is linked to a wide range of ciliary processes related to cilium formation, function and transport. These include the regulation of IFT, sonic hedgehog signaling, interneuronal migration, and chemosensation, as well as the entry, distribution and dynamics of ciliary signaling proteins <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we employed genetics, quantitative imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and affinity proteomics in nematode and cell culture models to investigate the mechanisms of ARL13B/ARL-13 transport and retention within a subciliary membrane domain. We show evolutionary conservation of ARL13B/ARL-13 localisation to an Inversin-like compartment and the requirement of RVVP and palmitoylation modification sequence motifs to prevent distal cilium and nuclear targeting in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We also show distinct roles for IFT, BBS and TZ modules (MKS, NPHP) in regulating ARL-13 compartmentalization and diffusion across ciliary membranes. Finally, we determined the composition of human ARL13B complexes and uncovered robust biochemical associations with IFT complex B via IFT46 and IFT74 interactions. Overall, this study represents a comprehensive analysis of the transport mechanisms organizing the ARL13B/ARL-13 ciliary signaling subdomain, and provides important insight into how IFT and ciliopathy-associated protein complexes and modules influence ciliary transport and diffusion, the integrity of the ciliary membrane, and subciliary protein composition.</p>

        <title>ARL13B/ARL-13 is restricted to an Inv-like ciliary membrane subdomain, where it undergoes diffusion and IFT-like motility</title>
        <p>Previously we found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 localises to the proximal ciliary region of amphid (head) and phasmid (tail) channel cilia <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We now extend these findings, showing that endogenous mouse Arl13B is also sequestered to a proximal ciliary subdomain in oviduct and tracheal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1A</bold>
</xref>). However, in agreement with published reports, Arl13b localises to the entire axoneme of proximal kidney cells (data not shown), thus Arl13b is excluded from distal regions of certain ciliary subtypes. Next we found that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 proximal ciliary domain in amphid and phasmid channel cilia corresponds to the middle segment (MS) and does not include the transition zone (TZ); specifically, ARL-13 is juxtaposed to MKSR-1/B9D1 at the TZ, and OSM-6/IFT52 basal body signals are separated from ARL-13 signals by an â¼1 Âµm âgapâ, which corresponds to the TZ length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1B</bold>
</xref>). Similarly in human retinal RPE1 cells, endogenous ARL13B is localised adjacent to TZ-localised MKS5/RPGRIP1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1C</bold>
</xref>). Together, these findings indicate evolutionary restriction in certain ciliary subtypes of ARL13B to a proximal ciliary compartment, excluding the TZ. This localisation is similar to that of Inversin (Inv) <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Shiba1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-WarburtonPitt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We noticed that the ARL-13 compartment in phasmid cilia appeared longer in young worms versus adults. More detailed analysis revealed that at L1 stage, when phasmid cells are 12â15 hours old, ARL-13 decorated the entire cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1D</bold>
</xref>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). At L2 stage, distal ciliary signals are dramatically reduced and by L3 stage, most worms show ARL-13 restriction to the proximal cilium (â¼3 Âµm), which elongates slightly during development to adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1D</bold>
</xref>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). This developmental pattern was not observed for the overlapping heterotrimeric kinesin-II compartment <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, which by L1 stage is fully restricted to the proximal cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1D</bold>
</xref>; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s001">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). Also, ARL-13 is excluded from the phasmid TZs of all larval stages and the TZ âgapâ between ciliary ARL-13 and basal body CHE-13/IFT57 appears shorter in L1 larvae versus adults, suggesting TZ elongation as the worm ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1D</bold>
</xref>). Thus, at least in phasmid cilia, the ARL-13 ciliary membrane compartment undergoes post-embryonic remodelling.</p>
        <p>Using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) approach, we investigated if <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 is mobile at MS membranes. Photobleaching 100% of ARL-13::GFP ciliary signals resulted in almost no recovery, indicating limited or slow exchange with the dendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1E</bold>
</xref>). However, bleaching of â¼40% of ciliary signals resulted in relatively rapid signal recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>â=â124 sec), concomitant with a reduction of the non-bleached ciliary signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1E</bold>
</xref>
<bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s001">Figure S1B</xref></bold>). Recovery is wave-like, emanating from the non-bleached pool, and re-establishes pre-bleach uniform distribution of ARL-13 across the MS (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s001">Figure S1B</xref></bold>). Thus, ARL-13 continuously exchanges at the MS membrane, but not between ciliary and dendritic membranes. These results are consistent with Arl13b FRAP dynamics in cultured cells <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Larkins1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although it was previously reported by us and others that ARL-13 does not undergo IFT in adult worms <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, bidirectionally moving particles containing ARL-13 can be detected in the amphid and phasmid channel cilia of young larval worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g001">
<bold>Figure 1F</bold>
</xref>
<bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s008">Movie S1</xref></bold>). Although motility was more prominent in the distal cilium, movement was also detectable in proximal ciliary regions. For various technical reasons (photobleaching and immobilizing young larval worms), it was difficult to obtain many usable video microscopy-derived kymographs to measure motility rates. Nonetheless, for the particles we could measure, an anterograde speed of 0.65Â±0.09 Âµm.s<sup>â1</sup> (nâ=â16) in phasmid cilia was determined, which is similar to reported MS anterograde IFT rates <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Snow1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, at least in developing or newly formed cilia, a proportion of ciliary ARL-13 appears to behave as IFT cargo.</p>

        <title>Sequence mechanisms restricting <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 to the middle segment membrane</title>
        <p>Previously we and others found that an N-terminal palmitoylation (Pal) modification motif and the disordered C-terminal tail restrict ARL-13 at ciliary membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>

<bold>Figure 2B, C</bold>
</xref>). Instead, and agreeing with published findings <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, deletion of the C-terminal tail (Î203â370 or Î285â370) results in an elongated ARL-13 compartment spanning middle and distal segment membranes, although TZ exclusion was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2C, F</bold>
</xref>). Î203â370 or Î285â370 signals are also found at periciliary and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2C</bold>
</xref>; data not shown). We mapped this function to a C-terminal RVVP motif, deletion of which caused a similarly expanded ARL-13 domain at all larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2D, F</bold>
</xref>). ÎRVVP and Î285â370 (and Î203â370) variants also showed punctate cell body accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2C, D</bold>

However, ÎRVVP (and Î203â370) cell body signals only partially colocalise with the TGN-marked SNARE protein, SYN-16 <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>; instead, most signals are juxtaposed, suggesting a transport block in cis-Golgi or another compartment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s002">Figure S2A</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>Next we found that Pal motif disruption caused nuclear targeting of ARL-13 in most sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2B</bold>
</xref>), suggesting that lipid modification inhibits a nuclear targeting pathway. This is consistent with a report showing that a 24 kDa C-terminal domain fragment (lacking the Pal motif) of mammalian Arl13b is nuclear targeted <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Larkins1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Although we could not find a nuclear import sequence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13, Arl13b possesses a KRKK-like nuclear targeting signature in the C-terminal tail <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Larkins1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus, either the equivalent motif in ARL-13 is cryptic, or the mechanism of nuclear import is distinct. Consistent with reported findings for human ARL13B <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Hori1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, a predicted GDP-locked variant (T38N) of ARL-13 was normally localised, indicating that GDP-GTP exchange is not required for restricting ARL-13 to middle segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2E, F</bold>
</xref>). We did observe, however, that unlike wild-type worms, the ARL-13 compartment of T38N and rPal-expressing worms did not extend to the ciliary tips in young larval L1 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g002">
<bold>Figure 2F</bold>
</xref>); thus, GDP-GTP exchange and lipid modification of ARL-13 plays a subtle role during compartment morphogenesis.</p>
        <p>Finally we investigated whether altered ARL-13 localisations disrupt its function. Consistent with normal localisations, an <italic>arl-13(T38N)</italic> transgene rescued the cilium integrity defect (measured by a dye-filling assay) of an <italic>arl-13(tm2322)</italic> mutant, indicating that GDP-locked ARL-13 is functional (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s002">Figure S2B</xref></bold>).

To further investigate this defect, a CHE-13/IFT57 marker was used to stain cilia, which revealed that ARL-13(ÎRVVP)-expressing amphid cilia were abnormally dispersed and mis-positioned; furthermore, axonemal CHE-13 signals were reduced or absent, indicating an IFT defect (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s002">Figure S2D</xref></bold>).

Since <italic>arl-13(tm2322)</italic> worms also possess misplaced amphid cilia and reduced ciliary signals for IFT proteins <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, we conclude that the IFT and ciliogenesis-related functions of ARL-13 involves the C-terminal RVVP motif <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Higginbotham1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, because reduced CHE-13 ciliary levels correlate with abnormal distal ciliary staining of ARL-13(ÎRVVP), IFT may prevent ARL-13 entry into distal segments.</p>
        <p>These data show that a C-terminal RVVP motif restricts ARL-13 compartment size by preventing leakage into distal segments and suggest that palmitoylation regulates shuttling of ARL-13 between the ciliary membrane and the nucleus. Furthermore, our findings indicate that these motifs are required for the ciliogenic and IFT-related functions of ARL-13.</p>

        <p>Despite PCM accumulations, all examined mutants possess significant ARL-13 ciliary signals. To address if the ARL-13 domain is structurally altered in these worms, we investigated its length and proximo-distal patterning in phasmid cilia. In most IFT-A, IFT-B and IFT-dynein short cilia mutants, the ARL-13 compartment was correspondingly short and extended to the ciliary tip. However, in IFT-related mutants with cilia closer to wild-type lengths (<italic>dyf-13/TTC26</italic>, <italic>klp-11/KIF3B</italic>, <italic>bbs-7</italic> and <italic>bbs-8</italic>), the ARL-13 compartment was modestly elongated, suggesting a role for IFT in restricting ARL-13 subdomain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g003">
<bold>Figure 3C</bold>
</xref>). With the exception of occasional <italic>che-3</italic>, <italic>xbx-1</italic> and <italic>dyf-13</italic> animals, ARL-13 signals were not found at the TZ membrane of most IFT-related gene mutants, indicating these genes are typically not required for TZ exclusion of ARL-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g003">
<bold>Figure 3A</bold>
</xref>
<bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s003">Figure S3C</xref></bold>). Conversely, ARL-13 was frequently observed at the TZ region of most <italic>mks-5</italic> single mutants, as well as <italic>mks-2;nphp-4</italic> and <italic>mksr-1;nphp-4</italic> double mutants, demonstrating that MKS/NPHP modules regulate the composition of the TZ membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g003">

</xref>
<bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s003">Figure S3C</xref></bold>). This TZ staining in MKS/NPHP mutants results in an elongated ARL-13 compartment, which in some worms appears to extend into distal ciliary regions also (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g003">
<bold>Figure 3C</bold>

        <p>Together, these data reveal overlapping and distinct roles for IFT and ciliopathy modules in defining the ARL-13 subciliary membrane compartment. IFT-A/B, IFT-dynein and BBS genes, and to a lesser extent TZ genes, prevent specific accumulation of ARL-13 at the PCM, whereas TZ genes inhibit ARL-13 association with the TZ membrane. In addition, IFT-related genes appear to restrict ARL-13 compartment length.</p>

Although some differences were observed between the N-SF-ARL13B and C-SF-ARL13B complexes, there was remarkable consistency across the experiments for IFT-B transport proteins, in terms of the specific proteins detected and the peptide counts obtained. Underscoring the specificity of the IFT-B associations, ARL13B complexes were devoid of IFT-A or BBSome proteins, and most proteins associated with MKS, NPHP or JS, the one exception being NPHP-linked Ataxin-10 <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Sang1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Few if any differences were found in ARL13B(T35N) complexes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s021">Table S2</xref></bold>), indicating that ARL13B associates with IFT-B independent of GDP-GTP exchange.</p>

        <p>To validate the ARL13B complex components identified by TAP and to increase sensitivity in order to detect additional, more labile and transient ARL13B module components, we employed stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), in combination with single step affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry. This allowed a quantitative comparison of SF-tagged ARL13B and the SF-TAP alone, or mutated SF-tagged ARL13B. After purification, eluates were combined and non-specific contaminants subtracted to detect potential interaction partners by their specific enrichment compared to the control <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Boldt1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. This approach led to the enrichment of several hundred potential ARL13B(WT) complex components, including most of the proteins (41 out of 47) detected by TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g005">

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To investigate mechanisms underpinning protein sequestration to ciliary membranes, we assessed how Joubert syndrome-associated ARL13B/ARL-13 is targeted to and restricted at ciliary membranes. We show that ARL13B/ARL-13 is compartmentalised within an evolutionarily conserved Inversin-like ciliary membrane subdomain and requires palymitoylation modification and RVVP motifs to prevent inappropriate targeting of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 to the nucleus and distal ciliary regions. We also uncovered differential requirements for TZ and IFT genes in preventing ARL-13 accumulation at TZ and periciliary membranes (PCM). Mechanistically, MKS and NPHP genes, as well as DYF-13/TTC26, appear to regulate a TZ barrier to ARL-13 diffusion, whereas most examined IFT proteins regulate ARL-13 ciliary entry and/or retention via active transport processes. Consistent with this conclusion, human ARL13B interacts biochemically with the IFT-B complex via IFT46 and IFT74 interactions, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 can be observed to undergo IFT-like motility.</p>

        <title>Cell subtype- and age-dependent variation in the ARL13B/ARL-13 subciliary domain</title>
        <p>Our localisation studies in oviduct and tracheal epithelial cells show that mammalian ARL13B joins a group of other ciliopathy proteins (Inversin/NPHP2, NPHP3 and NPHP9/NEK8) that localise to proximal ciliary compartments, excluding the TZ <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Shiba1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Shiba2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, thus extending our previous finding for proximal ciliary targeting of <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, these proximal ciliary compartments are not universal because in various motile and non-motile ciliary sub-types, the ARL13B domain extends to the ciliary tips <xref rid="pgen.1003977-GarciaGonzalo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Caspary1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Duldulao1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Also, ARL13B is not restricted to the same proximal compartment in renal epithelial cells as NPHP2, NPHP3 and NPHP9 (personal communication in <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>). An additional layer of compartment diversity stems from our finding that <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 extends to the ciliary tips of young larval cilia, before restricting to a proximal domain. Thus, the ARL13B/ARL-13 domain is differentially defined in different cell types and at different developmental stages, reflecting age and cell subtype-specific requirements for this G-protein. Another interesting age distinction is that we have only observed IFT-like motility for ARL-13 in young larval worms and not in later larvae or adults. Although there may be technical considerations that prevent us seeing ARL-13 processive movement in older worms (e.g., higher levels of diffusing signals obscuring IFT movements), our data indicates that as the cilium ages, the proportion of ARL-13 undergoing active transport may reduce compared to the fraction undergoing diffusion. Thus, for ciliary membrane proteins considered as potential IFT cargo, it may be fruitful to perform experiments on developing or newly formed cilia.</p>

        <title>MKS/NPHP modules and DYF-13 regulate the ARL-13 diffusion barrier at the TZ</title>
        <p>Our work showing that ARL-13 readily diffuses at the middle segment membrane but fails to enter the adjacent TZ membrane subdomain clearly demonstrates an ARL-13 diffusion barrier at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TZ. Using subcellular localisation and <italic>in vivo</italic> FRAP assays we were then able to show that this barrier is bidirectional and dependent on MKS and NPHP genes, but not most IFT genes. These observations are consistent with and extend published findings implicating a membrane diffusion barrier at the ciliary base, including a previous report by us and others showing that plasma membrane-associated RPI-2 (retinitis pigmentosa gene 2 orthologue) and transmembrane TRAM-1 (Sec61 ER translocon component) abnormally leak into the ciliary axonemes of TZ gene-disrupted worms <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Craige1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Indeed, our development of the first <italic>in vivo</italic> FRAP assay to measure barrier integrity and ciliary/periciliary exchange kinetics will help further dissection of ciliary âgatingâ at the TZ.</p>
        <p>Not all MKS, NPHP and IFT genes neatly fit our model, however. For example, the ARL-13 barrier appears mostly intact in TZ-associated <italic>nphp-4</italic> single mutants, despite previous findings that non-ciliary plasma transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins (RPI-2, TRAM-1) abnormally leak into the cilia of these worms <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, NPHP-4 possesses selective âgatingâ functions, required to prevent RPI-2 entry into cilia but not ARL-13 exit from cilia. In contrast, MKS-5 facilitates both these functions, indicating a more global function in TZ barrier regulation. Another example is <italic>dyf-13/TTC26</italic>, which is genetically and biochemically associated with the IFT-B complex <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Ou2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Follit1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Franklin1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Unlike other IFT mutants we tested, the TZ barrier is moderately disrupted in <italic>dyf-13</italic> single mutants, and even further compromised in <italic>dyf-13;nphp-4</italic> double mutants, suggesting a synthetic functional relationship between these genes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, DYF-13 has been placed in a distinct OSM-3/KIF17 accessory motor module with DYF-1/IFT70, on the basis that it is required for building at least part of the ciliary distal segment <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Ou2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Surprisingly, although DYF-13 undergoes IFT <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Blacque3" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, it is not yet known if this protein is required for IFT; thus it is possible that DYF-13 is peripherally associated with IFT complexes as a TZ-interacting cargo element, rather than a core component of the IFT machinery. Consistent with this notion, mammalian TTC26 is reported to be enriched at the TZ of mammalian photoreceptor and IMCD3 cells <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Future efforts focussing on the requirement of <italic>dyf-13</italic> for IFT and the integrity of the TZ in <italic>dyf-13</italic> and <italic>dyf-13;nphp-4</italic> mutants should be revealing.</p>
        <p>How MKS, NPHP and DYF-13/TTC26 define the ARL-13 membrane diffusion barrier at the TZ is unknown. The absence of TZ proteins from our biochemically defined ARL13B complexes makes it unlikely that the barrier involves direct inhibitory interactions between ARL13B and these proteins; however, we cannot discount weak or transient interactions, nor technical limitations with standard TAP in identifying interactions with TZ-associated proteins, most of which are membrane proteins. More likely is that MKS and NPHP modules regulate TZ membrane lipid compositions or steric properties. Indeed, the latter is at the heart of the âpicket fenceâ membrane diffusion barrier model, where cytoskeletal-anchored membrane proteins form an obstacle barrier to molecular diffusion <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Nakada1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Consistent with this notion, the TZ contains unusual membrane-associated ultrastructural features such as Y-link connectors, the ciliary necklace and ciliary bracelet, all of which may contribute to a highly restricted and compacted TZ membrane that blocks free diffusion. Further support to this model comes from studies in worms and algae showing that disruption of MKS, MKS and JS genes cause Y-link loss <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Craige1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>However, TZ ultrastructural features are not found elsewhere in the axoneme and cannot explain the diffusion barrier preventing <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 entry into distal segment membranes. Nonetheless, there is evidence in our data that this barrier may be partially dependent on MKS, NPHP and <italic>dyf-13</italic> genes, as well as BBS genes, because in the corresponding mutants we found a significant number of worms with weak ARL-13 signals in more distal ciliary regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003977.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>). Also, our finding of a correlation between distal segment localisation of an ARL-13(ÎRVVP) variant together with reduced ciliary levels of CHE-13/IFT57 is consistent with a possible role for IFT in restricting ARL-13 distal segment entry. The availability of hypomorphic IFT mutants retaining distal segments would help to further address this issue.</p>

        <title>Role of IFT in active transport of ARL-13 and regulation of ARL-13 intraciliary mobility</title>
        <p>A number of pieces of evidence from this study support our conclusion that IFT restricts ARL-13 to its compartment via active transport mechanisms versus more passive processes such as regulation of a TZ diffusion barrier. First, ARL-13 undergoes IFT-like motility. Second, the TZ diffusion barrier appears mostly intact in most IFT gene mutants (except <italic>dyf-13</italic>, discussed above). Third, human ARL13B interacts directly with IFT-B complexes via IFT46/74 interactions. The very specific accumulation of ARL-13 at the PCM of IFT mutants and not elsewhere in the cell suggests IFT facilitates ARL-13 trafficking from the PCM into cilia and/or prevents ARL-13 from exiting cilia and accumulating at the PCM. Although we have been unable to distinguish between these two non-mutually exclusive possibilities, our biochemical and IFT motility data suggests that the mechanism involves ARL-13 directly interacting with IFT trains as cargo. In the first scenario, PCM-localised ARL-13, derived from upstream transport or leakage out of the cilium, would be captured by IFT-B complexes at the basal body and then moved back into the cilium, across the TZ, by anterograde IFT. In the alternative scenario, ARL13B could be held in cilia by dynamic association with moving IFT trains, perhaps with rapid on/off rates. In both cases, IFT disruption would lead to PCM accumulation of ARL-13. Thus, as shown in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003977-g006">
<bold>Figure 6</bold>
</xref>), IFT functions in a distinct manner to TZ-associated modules in restricting ARL-13 to a subciliary membrane compartment. Whilst TZ modules establish the TZ barrier to ARL-13 diffusion, IFT modules actively transport ARL-13 across the barrier or retain it in cilia.</p>

            <title>Model of differential roles for IFT and transition zone modules in defining the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ARL-13 ciliary membrane subdomain.</title>
            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) In wild type cilia, MKS and NPHP modules ensure an intact transition zone (TZ) barrier to ARL-13 diffusion (blue arrows), preventing ARL-13 exchange between the periciliary membrane (PCM) and the middle segment (MS) membrane. Through interactions with the IFT-B complex, IFT facilitates ARL-13 ciliary restriction by trafficking PCM-localised ARL-13 (derived from upstream transport and/or leakage out of the cilium) across the TZ barrier into the MS. Alternatively, IFT trains in the MS could prevent ARL-13 from exiting cilia (double arrow). (<bold>B</bold>) In TZ module gene mutants, the TZ barrier is weakened (e.g., via loss of Y-link structures) and ARL-13 readily exchanges between PCM and MS membranes. Although IFT remains intact <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, it cannot fully compensate for the weakened barrier, thus a steady state pool of ARL-13 is observed at TZ and PCM membranes. Low level ARL-13 signals (pink shade) are found in distal segment (DS) regions, suggesting a partial defect in the diffusion barrier at the MS/DS boundary. (<bold>C</bold>) In IFT module gene mutants, the TZ barrier to ARL-13 diffusion is mostly intact; however, loss of IFT causes reduced entry of ARL-13 into cilia (or increased exit from cilia), resulting in PCM accumulation of ARL-13. IFT mutants also display increased ARL-13 diffusion kinetics (thicker blue arrows) in the cilium.</p>

        <p>Since the ARL-13 TZ diffusion barrier does not depend on IFT genes, we were surprised that ARL-13 diffusion rates were increased at the middle segment membrane of IFT mutants, suggesting that IFT restricts ARL-13 mobility in cilia. One possible explanation is that ARL-13 diffusion rates are retarded due to frequent interactions of ARL-13 with IFT trains as they move through the ARL-13 compartment. Alternatively, through its role in targeting proteins to cilia, IFT may regulate steric hindrance to free diffusion at the ciliary membrane. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, IFT regulates the mobility of transmembrane PKD2; however, unlike the increased FRAP rates we find for ARL-13 in IFT mutant worms, CrPKD2 displays reduced FRAP rates in <italic>fla-10<sup>ts</sup></italic> (kinesin-II) algae <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Another difference is that PKD2 ciliary concentrations are elevated in IFT-disrupted algae, worms and mice <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Pazour1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Bae1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, whereas this is not the case for ARL-13 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> IFT mutants (this study; data not shown). Thus, IFT appears to differentially regulate the ciliary transport and mobility of PKD2 and ARL-13. Future efforts using FRAP or photoconversion techniques will help to further tease out the role of IFT in regulating protein dynamics at the ciliary membrane.</p>

Furthermore, the IFT-B interaction is consistent with a reciprocal role for ARL-13 in regulating anterograde IFT, previously reported by us and others <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Interestingly, GDP-locked ARL13B, as well as the R79Q and R200C ARL13B patient variants, retained high affinity binding of the IFT-B complex, indicating that ARL13B/IFT-B associations do not require GDP/GTP exchange or R79/R200 residues. Our affinity proteomics data also indicate that wild type ARL13B complexes contain karyopherin-beta proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Since ARL-13/ARL13B is almost exclusively localised in cilia <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Caspary1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Cevik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, the karyopherin associations are likely occurring within cilia or en route to the cilium. Indeed, nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery (Ran, nuclear pore complex subunits and karyopherin beta/importin proteins) localise at the primary cilium of cultured mammalian cells, and are required for entry of proteins into cilia, including KIF17 <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003977-Kee1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Although more work needs to be performed, it is tempting to speculate that ciliary retention of ARL13B requires karyopherin-beta protein function; alternatively ARL13B could be a regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins operating in the cilium. Other interesting proteins with high affinity binding within ARL13B complexes are proteins associated with cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, namely DCAF8 (DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor) and CAND1/CAND2 (cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated). DCAFs are thought to facilitate the recruitment of substrates onto CRL4 scaffolds and CAND1/2 proteins are known to negatively regulate the E3 ligase activity of CRLs (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Sarikas1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>). Interestingly, it was recently shown that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is conjugated to, and functionally regulates, ARL-13/ARL13B <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Although speculative, our data could suggest that ARL13B is targeted for CRL4/DCAF8-mediated ubiquitination. Alternatively, and consistent with the CAND1/2 associations, ARL13B may regulate CRL-mediated processes.</p>

        <title>Concluding remarks</title>
        <p>We have performed a thorough analysis of transport mechanisms organising the ARL-13/ARL13B ciliary signalling subdomain. Our findings reveal differential requirements for sequence motifs, IFT-related complexes and TZ-associated ciliopathy modules in defining an ARL-13 subciliary membrane domain. We find that MKS and NPHP modules, as well as DYF-13/TTC26, regulate a TZ barrier to ARL-13 diffusion, whereas most IFT proteins facilitate ARL-13 ciliary entry and/or retention predominantly via active transport mechanisms. Furthermore, our protein complex and protein-protein interaction data represents a good starting point to further address mechanisms of ARL-13 ciliary protein transport and function, and provides new research avenues for investigating the pathomechanisms of Joubert Syndrome-related disorders.</p>

        <p>Early adult worms were immobilised with 0.1 Âµm polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences) on a 10% agarose pad and covered with a coverslip. Experiments were performed on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope fitted with a 100Ã1.4NA Plan APO VC objective (Nikon), a 50 mW 488 nm laser, and CSU-X1 spinning disk unit (Yokogawa). Samples were excited using the 488 nm laser at 50% and images were recorded using a charge-coupled device camera (iXon EM-CCD, Andor Technology) controlled by Andor Technology iQ 2.6 software. Samples were imaged pre-bleach, and then bleached using a single pulse of the 488 nm laser at 100% with a dwell time of 100 Âµs. Images were recorded immediately post-bleach, at 15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, 240 s, 360 s, 480 s, and 600 s for intraciliary FRAP experiments, and post-bleach at 15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, 240 s, 300 s, 600 s, 900 s, and 1200 s for periciliary membrane (PCM) and cilium compartment FRAP experiments. For intraciliary FRAP experiments EM gain was set to 6; for compartment FRAP experiments the EM gain was set to 20, with an exposure time of 50 ms in all experiments. Images were imported into ImageJ and converted into a stack. Photobleached and non-photobleached regions of the cilium were selected and intensity measured at each timepoint. After background subtraction, ratios of bleachedâ¶non-bleached regions were calculated. Ratios were normalised to pre-bleach ratio. Curves were fitted and half-time recovery calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. Most FRAP curves (saturation plots) returned high goodness-of-fit statistics (R-squared&gt;0.75), except for <italic>xbx-1</italic> (ciliary, PCM, and total FRAP), <italic>dyf-6</italic> (ciliary and total FRAP), <italic>che-2, dyf-13;nphp-4</italic> (total FRAP), and <italic>mks-5</italic> (total FRAP).

        <p>LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an Ultimate3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by a nano spray ion source. Tryptic peptide mixtures were automatically injected and loaded at flow rate of 6 Âµl/min in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in HPLC grade water onto a nano trap column (100 Âµm i.d. Ã2 cm, packed with Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18, 3 Âµm, 100 Ã, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 5 minutes, peptides were eluted and separated on the analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18, 2 Âµm, 100 Ã, 75 Âµm i.d. Ã25 cm, nanoViper, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by a linear gradient from 5% to 35% of buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.08% formic acid) in buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min over 80 minutes. Remaining peptides were eluted by a short gradient from 40% to 100% buffer B in 5 minutes. Eluted peptides were analyzed by the LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. From the high resolution MS pre-scan with a mass range of 300 to 1500, the ten most intense peptide ions were selected for fragment analysis in the linear ion trap if they exceeded an intensity of at least 250 counts and if they were at least doubly charged. The normalized collision energy for CID was set to a value of 35 and the resulting fragments were detected with normal resolution in the linear ion trap. The lock mass option was activated, the background signal with a mass of 445.12002 was used as lock mass <xref rid="pgen.1003977-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.

The peptide and protein false discovery rates were set to 1%. Contaminants like keratins were removed. Proteins identified and quantified by at least two peptides per experiment in at least two of three independent experiments were considered for further analysis. Because hundreds of proteins were enriched with ARL13B, we had to set a ratio threshold instead of using significance values determined by MaxQuant.
