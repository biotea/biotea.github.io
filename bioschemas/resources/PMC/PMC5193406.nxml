        <p><italic>SRY</italic>-mutation-caused sex reversal is a rare disease and mostly associated with a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation since the patients with defective <italic>SRY</italic> is infertile. There are many reports about <italic>SRY</italic>-mutation associated 46, XY ovarian disorder of sex development (DSD), but few described their molecular mechanism. Here we report a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation 224G&gt;T (R75M) in <italic>SRY</italic> associated with a phenotypic female, 46, XY karyotype and dysgerminoma. The wild and mutated <italic>SRY</italic> were cloned into recombinant plasmid and expressed in cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, the result showed the mutated SRY is greatly accumulated in cytoplasm while the wild type SRY is mostly localized in nucleus. To make sure no other genes were involved, we performed the trio-based whole exome sequencing using the DNA samples from the proband and the parents, and no mutations were identified especially in <italic>DHH</italic>, <italic>NR0B1</italic>, <italic>NR5A1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic> and <italic>MAP3K1</italic>, indicating the <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in <italic>SRY</italic> is the single defect responsible for the female sex reversal. We also used bioinformatics simulation analysis to predict impact of the mutation on <italic>SRY</italic> function, and find the R75 in wild type SRY can form a hydrogen bond with serine at 91 (S91) that make the SRY protein well fit into the minor groove of target DNA, while the M75 in the mutated SRY canât. Finally, we reviewed <italic>SRY</italic> mutations based on the available references and analyzed the mutation distribution patterns according to density and continuity, which may be useful for further study of the SRY structure, function, and its relatedness with DSD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>XY gonadal dysgenesis is also known as Swyer syndrome. The patients show a 46 XY karyotype but express a female phenotype externally. The patients with the syndrome also have a high risk of tumors such as dysgerminoma and gonadoblastoma in the gonads [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is believed that about 10â15% of the disease is caused by SRY mutation [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>SRY</italic> is an essential gene in male mammals to initiate male sexual differentiation and determine testis development [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It locates on the end of short arm of the Y chromosome and encodes a protein of 204 amino acids. Interestingly, it is not a typical eukaryotic transcript unit but a single exon-containing gene without intron. The SRY protein contains a single homeobox domain called high mobility group (HMG), which is the most important part in SRY, and majority of the reported mutations occur within it. SRY plays a role as transcription factor [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is assumed that SRY works as a DNA binding factor affecting local chromatin structure approximate to its target genes to boost transcription initiation [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In XY fetus, a defective <italic>SRY</italic> fails to activate its target genes, in turn the indifferent gonad canât differentiate into testes. Without testes, the XY fetus will develop into a baby with male-to-female sex reversal and high risk of bilateral or unilateral dysgerminoma and gonadoblastoma.</p>
      <p><italic>SRY</italic> is one of the genes with intensive mutations in human genome: a gene encodes 204 amino acids while 80 mutations were reported so far, and most of the mutations cause a defective phenotype, i.e., complete or partial SRY-related 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis. Even with so many mutations were reported, very little is understood about how the mutations affect SRY function at the molecular level.</p>
      <p>We report a novel missense mutation identified from a patient with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. The mutation, 224G&gt;T, locates in the N-terminus of HMG domain which changes the amino acid at position 75 from arginine to methionine (R75M). We performed whole genome trio-exome sequencing to exclude other genes involved, and then conducted GFP (green fluorescent protein)-SRY fused protein expression to observe its nuclear import function in transfected cells. We also conducted bioinformatics simulation to analyze how the mutation impacts on SRY-DNA interaction. Finally we reviewed the available references about SRY mutation. Here is our report.</p>

      <title>Case Report</title>
      <p>The patient is a 20-years old woman. Her main complaints are primary amenorrhea and abdominal masses. Physical examination showed 156cm in height and 56kg in weight, less subcutaneous fat than a typical woman, hypoplastic breast, and external female genitalia with public hair in inverted triangle. No touchable masses were found in bilateral canalis inguinalis and labium majus. The abdomen was soft and a smooth-surfaced mass was touched one each side which doesnât show any tenderness or rebound tenderness but a shifting dullness when percussed. A surgery of bilateral ovarian tumor hysterectomy was performed for the patient. The tumors was 10cmÃ6cmÃ5cm on right side and 25cmÃ22cmÃ10cm on left side, both were attached with streak gonad and normal fallopian tube. Histological examination revealed the tumors belong to dysgerminoma.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have reported a novel mutation in the <italic>SRY</italic> gene from an XY female with complete gonadal dysgenesis. This mutation takes place at nucleotide position 224 of the SRY coding region, where a guanine in the second position of the codon is replaced with a thymine (224G&gt;T). At protein level, this mutation substitutes an arginine with a methionine in amino-acid position 75 of the SRY protein (R75M). Genomic DNA sequencing shows the variant is not a familial trait, and trio-based whole exome sequencing confirmed the SRY mutation 224G&gt;T is the only genetic defect for the patient. Normal male sex determination in mammals is mediated by functional <italic>SRY</italic>, and a defective <italic>SRY</italic> can cause failure of testicular development that, in turn, results in gonadal dysgenesis and sex reversal phenotype.</p>
      <p>The mutation 224G&gt;T (R75M) locates at N-terminal of the HMG box, where exists a functional NLS [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our experiment showed the mutant protein was severely inhibited for nuclear import and greatly accumulated in cytoplasm. This is the first report about R75M mutation can block functional NLS with experimental evidence. In additions, codon 75 locates at the center of a cluster of 3 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting it may play a vital role in NLS. Beside nuclear import, we also find that the R75M mutation can diminish SRY-DNA binding because mutant R75M canât form a hydrogen bond with serine at position 91 so that the SRY conformation necessary for SRY fitting into DNA minor groove was aborted. We believe that the NLS and DNA-binding defects both contribute to sex reversal. Firstly, only partial SRY protein can access to nucleus which affects their efficiency to promote assembly of transcriptional complex; secondly, the DNA-binding defect adds up and causes an additive effect which doubly ensures the interruption of sex differentiation cascade. This is the first report to explain the molecular mechanism about how the R75M mutation can cause sex reversal through diminishing both NLS and DNA-binding capabilities of SRY in a molecular conformation level.</p>
      <p>For a transcription factor to exert its regulatory role, it must move and localize in the nucleus after it is synthesized in cytoplasm. This process is called nuclear import. Nuclear import is mediated by NLS motif which consists of short stretches of basic amino acids. In SRY protein, R75 stands side by side with R76 and K77 to form a trio basic amino acids RRK, which exactly satisfy the NSL sequence requirement [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is believed that the DNA binding domains in HMG-box consists of three alpha helices separated by loops [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on our prediction, R75 is one of the amino acids that locates at middle of the first alpha helix at Nâ-terminus and form a hydrogen bond with S91 from the second alpha helix which fits into the minor groove of the target DNA as a finger-like protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Our prediction meets the criteria for DNA binding domain in HMG perfectly. It is possible that NLS and DNA-binding motif may be mutual inclusive in SRY.</p>
      <p>It has been known that the SRY-specific target DNA sequence is AACAAAG [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or [T/A]AACAA[T/A] [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that are accommodated in a linear DNA duplex as B-type DNA. After SRY-DNA binding, the target DNA will produce a sharp bend with widened minor groove which facilitate alpha-helixes from SRY HMG box intercalating into it. The DNA bend will be recognized by transcriptional factors and a transcriptional complex will be assembled [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. R75M mutation distorts the natural conformation of the SRY alpha-helixes, so that it canât insert into minor groove of the target DNA to maintain a sharp DNA bend. As a result, the mutated SRY will lose its key function in the male sex differentiation cascade. Our findings are consistent with those references very well.</p>
      <p>To see if other genes involved in the sex reversal as we reported, we performed trio-based whole exome sequencing, and the result excluded such possibility. It suggests 224G&gt;T (R75M) mutation is the only genetic error to cause the described defect. Clearly, <italic>SRY</italic>-associated gonadal dysgenesis is one of the Mendelian disorders with high penetrace because majority of the <italic>SRY</italic> mutations can cause a defective and self-evident phenotype and only a few <italic>SRY</italic> mutations were reported not affecting sex development. It is estimated that human genomes typically contain ~100 genuine LoF (Loss of Function) variants with ~20 genes completely inactivated and approximately 5 common complete knockout genes in autosomes which may be associated with disorders or harmless [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0168484.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, we donât know how many complete knockouts happening in sex chromosomes, especially in Y-chromosome. <italic>SRY</italic> mutation may be one of the human knockouts occurred in Y chromosome.</p>
      <p>Human <italic>SRY</italic> is a simple gene package without any intron. It consists of three parts, i.e., N-terminus part (1-56codons), HMG domain (57â136, 80codons), and C-terminus part (137â204, 68codons). We collected and reviewed all available data on <italic>SRY</italic> mutation until recently [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A total of 80 mutations were reported in 204AAs of the full length SRY, which show 0.3921 mutation per codon at average (80/204). The mutations are not occurring as a random fashion. The 80 mutations occurred in 59 codons because of triple mutation in 1 codon (1.7%, 1/59), double mutations in 19 codons (32.2%, 19/59), and single mutation in 39 codons (66.1%, 39/59), which indicate some of codons mutate more often than others. We believe the more often mutated codons may carry more vital function in <italic>SRY</italic>. Among the 80 mutations reported, 66 mutations are concentrated in the HMG domain, which takes 82.5% (66/80) of the total mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The 66 mutations within the HMG domain actually occur in 46 codons, including 54 missense mutations (81.82%, 54/66), 12 nonsense mutations (18.18%, 12/66), 18 double mutations (39.13%, 18/46) and 1 triple mutation (2.1%, 1/46). Based on the continuity and density of mutations, the HMG can be divided into 4 sub-regions separated by 3 or more consecutive non-mutated codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The first sub-region covers 22 codons (from 57 to 78) that include 14 codons carrying 23 mutations due to 1 triple and 7 double mutations and 7 codons as mutation-free (Sub-domain-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). A cluster of 3 codons from 74 to 76 show consecutive mutations without interruption. The <italic>de novo</italic> mutation R75M occurs at middle of this cluster. The second sub-region spans 20 codons (from 82 to 101). Among them, 14 mutations were reported in a cluster of 10 consecutive codons from 87 to 96 due to 4 double mutations (Sub-domain-2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4</xref>), indicating all these amino acids exert an important function in a synergic way so that change of any one will result in a loss of function. The third sub-region covers 13 codons (107 to 119) with 11 mutations. Among them, 5 mutations were reported in a cluster of 4 continuous codons (107â110) due to one double mutation (Sub-domian-3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The fourth sub-region covers 12 codons (125 to 136) with 12 mutations. Among them, 10 mutations were located in a block of 7 consecutive codons (127 to 133) due to 3 double mutations (Sub-domian-4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Based on the mutation distribution patterns, we hypothesized that the N-terminus NLS may covers 22 amino acids from 57 to 78, and the C-terminus NLS may cover 12 codons from 125 to 136. The epitopes that determine the SRY-DNA interaction may be strongly associated with 10 codons from 87 to 96, and 4 codons from 107 to 110 respectively. This description is entirely inferential; and the actual identity is best determined experimentally. However, it is consistent with our prediction that the codon 91 encoding S91 to form a hydrogen bond with R75 exactly locates at center of subdomian-3 from codons 87 to 96.</p>
      <p>Interestingly only 9 mutations were reported upstream the HMG domain in the first 56 codons of <italic>SRY</italic>, which include 3 nonsense mutations and 6 missense mutations, and all of the mutations are occurred in the first 43 codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The nearest nonsense mutations were reported at 2nd and 4th codons, which are understandable; but the puzzle is that the nearest missense mutation occurs at 3rd codon and causes a XY, complete gonadal dysgenesis too [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Only 5 mutations were reported immediately downstream HMG from codons 137 to 163 including 2 missense mutation at codon 143 due to double mutations, 2 frameshift mutations at codons 158 and 159, and 1 nonsense mutation at codon 163 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). No mutations were reported so far in the last 41 codons from 164 to 204 that takes 20% (41/204) of the full length SRY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168484.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This observation suggests some amino acids proximal downstream HMG still play crucial roles to keep SRY functional; and the amino acids at distal downstream HMG may be less functional. However, the puzzle is that if the last 41 amino acids contribute little to SRY function, why the truncated SRY by nonsense mutation at codon 163 can cause XY complete gonadal dysgenesis as reported? [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The same situations can be applied to the frameshift mutation at codons 158 and 159. It is very interesting to know that the missense mutation S143C can diminish SRY-DNA interaction [<xref rid="pone.0168484.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], it mean the amino acids outside HMG domain can still influence <italic>SRY</italic> function by certain ways.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we identified a novel point mutation, 224G&gt;T (R75M), in <italic>SRY</italic> coding region that causes a 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis with bilateral dysgerminoma. We tested the impact of the mutation on <italic>SRY</italic> function and demonstrated the R75M mutation greatly blocks <italic>SRY</italic> nuclear import. Our bioinformatics analysis shows that the R75M mutation may damage SRY-DNA interaction by impeding hydrogen bond between R75 with S91. This is the first report about mutation R75M in <italic>SRY</italic> and the first to explain how the mutation R75M can block SRY-DNA binding at molecular conformation level. Our review summarized the available SRY mutation data and analyzed their distribution pattern in details, which will be helpful for further tackling of <italic>SRY</italic> function and its diseases-relatedness.</p>
