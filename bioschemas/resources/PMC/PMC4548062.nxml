        <p>Andersen et al. identify a novel genetic etiology of herpes encephalitis in an adult patient carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the IRF3 gene. This mutation results in impaired INF production in response to viral infection</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in children has previously been linked to defects in type I interferon (IFN) production downstream of Toll-like receptor 3. Here, we describe a novel genetic etiology of HSE by identifying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>IFN regulatory factor 3</italic> (<italic>IRF3</italic>) gene, leading to autosomal dominant (AD) IRF3 deficiency by haploinsufficiency, in an adolescent female patient with HSE. IRF3 is activated by most pattern recognition receptors recognizing viral infections and plays an essential role in induction of type I IFN. The identified IRF3 R285Q amino acid substitution results in impaired IFN responses to HSV-1 infection and particularly impairs signaling through the TLR3âTRIF pathway. In addition, the R285Q mutant of IRF3 fails to become phosphorylated at S386 and undergo dimerization, and thus has impaired ability to activate transcription. Finally, transduction with WT IRF3 rescues the ability of patient fibroblasts to express IFN in response to HSV-1 infection. The identification of IRF3 deficiency in HSE provides the first description of a defect in an IFN-regulating transcription factor conferring increased susceptibility to a viral infection in the CNS in humans.</p>

  <body><p>Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is the most common form of sporadic viral encephalitis in the Western world, with an estimated incidence of 1/250,000 individuals per year (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Whitley and Lakeman, 1995</xref>). HSE is caused by HSV-1 and is a devastating disease with a mortality reaching 70% when untreated, and remaining at 25% even in the presence of antiviral therapy with acyclovir (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Whitley and Lakeman, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Griffin, 2005</xref>). Although 80% of adults are seropositive for HSV-1, neuroinvasion and establishment of CNS infection during either primary or secondary infection is a rare event, and knowledge of determinants of disease has remained sparse. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for immune control of herpesviruses, including type I IFNs, NK cells, and cytotoxic T cells (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Paludan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The innate immune system utilizes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogenâassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to mount protective immune responses, including production of cytokines and IFN (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen, 2009</xref>). Different classes of PRRs are involved in recognition of virus infections, including membrane-associated TLRs, cytosolic RNA-sensing RIG-like receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensors (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen, 2009</xref>). Each of these classes of PRRs activate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through unique adaptor molecules, known as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, respectively, to which IRF3 binds to become phosphorylated (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylation of IRF3 at specific serine residues in the C-terminal domain leads to dimerization, nuclear localization, and transcription of genes, including IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), with antiviral activity. The IRF family of transcription factors is essential for induction of type I (IFN-Î±/Î²) and type III (IFN-Î») IFN expression, with IRF3 and IRF7 being ascribed particularly important roles (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</xref>). Importantly, IRF3-deficient mice are susceptible to HSV-1 infection in the brain (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Menachery et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, it has emerged that single-gene inborn errors of innate immunity are associated with enhanced susceptibility to specific infections (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Sancho-Shimizu et al., 2011a</xref>). Seminal studies have demonstrated that mutations in genes encoding proteins in the TLR3 pathway confer susceptibility to HSE in childhood (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Casanova and Abel, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Casrouge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">PÃ©rez de Diego et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sancho-Shimizu et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Audry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Herman et al., 2012</xref>). Most of the identified mutations are inherited by an autosomal dominant (AD) mechanism, but cases of autosomal recessive (AR) mutations in the TLR3 pathway have also been identified (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Casrouge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Sancho-Shimizu et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). These findings may help explain why HSV becomes neuroinvasive to cause encephalitis in a small minority of individuals. At present, mutations in <italic>UNC93B1</italic>, <italic>TLR3</italic>,<italic> TRAF3</italic>, <italic>TRIF</italic>,<italic> TBK1</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, and <italic>IKBKG</italic> (NEMO) genes have been identified in children with HSE. Notably, these genetic defects often appear to display incomplete penetrance (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Common to the identified genetic defects is that they lead to reduced IFN responses in cell culture after HSV-1 infection or stimulation through the TLR3 pathway. Moreover, a nonredundant role for TLR3 immunity has been demonstrated in induced pluripotent stem cellâderived CNS cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lafaille et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we identify a novel genetic etiology of HSE in an adolescent with HSE by demonstrating a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>IRF3</italic> gene and impaired IFN production in response to HSV-1 and TLR3 stimulation in patient cells.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of a heterozygous mutation in IRF3</title><p>The patient (P1) was a 15-yr-old adolescent, who was part of a larger study involving whole-exome sequencing (WES) of a total of 16 adults with previous HSE. For a detailed medical history of P1, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20142274/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1 and supplemental text</ext-link>. WES was performed on patient DNA followed by bioinformatical analysis of the sequence data. Because HSE occurs with low frequency, disease-associated mutations were assumed to be novel or rare (&lt;0.001 of the population). We identified a heterozygous mutation in <italic>IRF3</italic> (frequency &lt; 0.0001 in dbSNP) at base pair position 854, causing a G-to-A substitution in exon 6 of the molecule (NM_001571.5 IRF3 c.854G&gt;A), resulting in an amino acid change at the highly conserved position 285 from arginine to glutamine (R285Q; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). The identified mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). The R285Q mutation is located in the regulatory domain of the IRF3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>) and predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT software. Additionally, CADD software predicts a score of 21.8, indicating that the mutation belongs to the 1% of most deleterious mutations. The father was found to be a healthy carrier of the R285Q IRF3 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>), thus demonstrating incomplete penetrance. We did not have access to material from the patientâs mother, and there were no siblings. No mutations were found by analysis of WES data in the coding exons of <italic>TLR3</italic>,<italic> UNC-93B1</italic>, <italic>TRAF3</italic>, <italic>TRIF</italic>, <italic>TBK1</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic>, or <italic>IKBKG</italic> (NEMO) known to be involved in the IFN-inducing and -responsive pathways and previously associated with childhood HSE. Importantly, despite careful analysis of WES data, we did not find any homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. The expression of IRF3 protein in PBMCs from P1 was similar to a healthy age- and gender-matched control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of a heterozygous mutation in IRF3 by WES.</bold> (a) Summary of information on the <italic>IRF3</italic> mutation in P1.

All these viruses induced expression of IFN-Î² and -Î±2, and for HSV-2 and HHV8 we observed significantly lower responses in cells from P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, g and h</xref>). Interestingly, type I IFN expression in response to IAV infection was not reduced in cells from P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, g and h</xref>). IFNÎ»1 was only weakly induced by the three viruses, and only for HSV-2 was this response reduced in cells from P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 i</xref>). Finally, the levels of virus-induced TNF were not affected in patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 j</xref>). Thus, expression of IFNs and ISGs in response to HSV-1 infection was largely abolished in PBMCs and fibroblasts from P1. This may be because IRF3 is localized at a position downstream of several PRR signaling pathways, which may cause a more extensive inhibition of IFN production than an isolated defect of the TLR3 pathway. In addition, cells of the CNS may be particularly sensitive to reduced IFN responses, thus leading to more pronounced susceptibility to CNS infections as compared with systemic viral infections. The differential responses, including almost entirely abolished responses to HSV-1, partially reduced responses to other human pathogenic herpes viruses, and normal responses to IAV, are in agreement with the narrow infectious phenotype and medical history.</p></sec><sec><title>The R285Q IRF3 mutant is not phosphorylated, dimerized, or transcriptionally activated upon stimulation</title><p>With the aim to identify the molecular mechanism underlying impaired IFN production in cells harboring the R285Q IRF3 mutant, WT IRF3 and R285Q IRF3 were transiently expressed in IRF3-deficient HEK293T cells, which were infected with Sendai virus (SeV). Whereas expression of R285Q IRF3 only marginally enabled infection to increase IFN-Î² promoter activity, expression of WT IRF3 allowed robust IFN-Î² promoter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Likewise, expression of each of the three key IFN-stimulating PRR adaptor proteins TRIF, MAVS, or STING lead to markedly reduced IFN-Î² promoter activity in cells transfected with R285Q IRF3 as compared with IRF3 WT, with â¼30% of the activity of WT IRF3 in response to MAVS and STING overexpression and &lt;10% of WT IRF3 in response to TRIF overexpression, thus strongly suggesting that the TLR3âTRIF pathway is affected the most by the R285Q mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Finally, in IRF3-deficient THP1-derived monocytes, reconstitution with WT IRF3 but not R285Q IRF3 restored the ability of HSV-1 to induce IFN-Î² expression, whereas some degree of IFN-Î² expression was observed in R285Q IRF3âexpressing cells infected with SeV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>The R285Q IRF3 mutant is not phosphorylated, dimerized, or transcriptionally activated upon stimulation.</bold> (a, b, and f) HEK293T-derived, IRF3-deficient cells were transiently transfected with IFN-Î² promoter luciferase reporter, Î²-actin promoter, Renilla luciferase reporter, and plasmids encoding WT IRF3, R285Q IRF3, MAVS, STING, or TRIF as indicated.

Extracts were analyzed by native-PAGE and Western blotting. Interestingly, unlike WT IRF3, the R285Q IRF3 mutant did not form homodimers upon infection or pathway-specific stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 d</xref>). Furthermore, the R285Q IRF3 mutant failed to become phosphorylated at S386, which is involved in activation and dimerization of IRF3 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 d</xref>).

Thus, in the model systems used, the R285Q IRF3 mutant did not exhibit a dominant-negative effect upon WT IRF3.</p><p>Finally, we wanted to examine the effect of WT IRF3 expression in fibroblasts from the patient. The cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding GFP, WT, or R285Q IRF3 and stimulated with extracellular poly(I:C) or infected with HSV-1.

These data strongly suggest that the impaired IFN responses in patient cells are caused by the identified R285Q IRF3 mutation, thus proposing a causal relationship.</p><p>The HSE patient in the present study harbored a single base-pair mutation c854G&gt;A in <italic>IRF3</italic>, resulting in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution, and thus a change from a positively charged to an uncharged amino acid, at position 285 in the regulatory domain of the IRF3 protein. Our data demonstrated abolished S386 phosphorylation and no detectable IRF3 dimerization in cells expressing the R285Q mutant. This is in agreement with previous work demonstrating a critical role for IRF3 S386 as a target for TBK1-mediated phosphorylation required for IRF3 dimerization. (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Takahasi et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study showed that IRF3 is recruited to MAVS, STING, and TRIF through electrostatic interactions between a phosphorylated surface on the adaptors and a positively charged surface on IRF3, which includes R285 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). This positions IRF3 for phosphorylation by TBK1. We compared the efficiency with which R285Q IRF3 induced IFN-Î² promoter activity in response to overexpression of each of MAVS, STING, and TRIF and found the TLR3âTRIF pathway to be most extensively inhibited. This may explain why we I patient cells observed significantly impaired responses to HSV-1, where the TLR3 pathway is essential, in the setting of an almost normal response to the RNA virus IAV, signaling mainly through RLRs, and agrees with the infectious phenotype of the patient. Overall, differential impairment in the recruitment of mutant IRF3 to the adaptor molecules may explain different effects on these signaling pathways and the IFN-inducing ability of different pathogens.</p><p>The finding that the R285Q IRF3 mutation is of functional significance despite being heterozygous indicates a mechanism involving either dominant-negative activity of the mutant protein or haploinsufficiency, with the former previously being suggested in the case of AD <italic>TRAF3</italic> deficiency and AD partial <italic>TLR3</italic> deficiency in HSE (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">PÃ©rez de Diego et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Herman et al., 2012</xref>). Although cells from the patient exhibited largely abrogated responsiveness to HSV-1 infection and several PAMPs, we did not observe a dominant-negative effect of the mutant R285Q IRF3 in the HEK293T cell model system. However, we were able to fully reconstitute the IFN response of patient fibroblasts with expression of WT IRF3. RNA sequencing revealed equal transcription from the WT and mutant <italic>IRF3</italic> alleles (unpublished data). These data suggest that haploinsufficiency rather than a dominant-negative effect explains the infectious phenotype of the patient. This is in agreement with the father of the patient being a healthy carrier, because incomplete penetrance has been described in the majority of AD immunological conditions involving haploinsufficiency, including defects in the TLR3 pathway in HSE patients (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Rieux-Laucat and Casanova, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A panel of criteria has recently been proposed for deciding if clinical and experimental data suffice to establish a causal relationship based on only one case (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Casanova et al., 2014</xref>). Central among these is to rescue a normal phenotype from the disease-relevant phenotype by reintroducing the WT molecule in question. In the present work, we demonstrated that expression of WT IRF3 enabled P1 fibroblasts to produce IFN in response to HSV-1 infection. These data strongly argue for a causal relationship between the cellular and clinical phenotype of the patient and the identified R285Q IRF3 mutation. Other criteria fulfilled in the present case in favor of a causal relationship are that the identified mutation is very rare, that R285 is an evolutionarily highly conserved residue within IRF3, and that IRF3 is part of a known pathway well established in conferring increased susceptibility to HSE. In conclusion, the present study provides the first identification of a mutation in a member of the IRF family of IFN-inducing transcription factors in viral CNS infections in humans and adds a novel genetic etiology to HSE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Primary cells.</title><p>The 15-yr-old female patient of Danish (Caucasian) origin described in this study was identified within a study including a total of 16 adult individuals with previously diagnosed HSE by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (pleocytosis and detection of HSV-1 by PCR), as well as a clinical history in agreement with HSE.

THP1 cells were electroporated with the same plasmid combinations (2.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells with 5 Âµg of DNA) and sorted for mCherry-Cas9-positive cells. Exon 4 of IRF3 was targeted in the following region: 5â²-GGGGGTCCCGGATCTGGGAGTGG-3â². Subsequently, limiting dilution cloning was performed and, after 10 d, growing monoclones were selected by bright field microscopy. Identified clones were trypsinized and expanded in two separate wells. One well was used to recover gDNA and, subsequently, the target region of interest was amplified in a two-step PCR and subjected to deep sequencing, as previously described (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Schmid-Burgk et al., 2014</xref>).
