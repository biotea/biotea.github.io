      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">In response to DNA damage eukaryotic cells initiate a complex signalling pathway, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic BRAF to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. One of these factors is an F-box protein, FBXO31, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Here we study the cellular role of FBXO31, identify its target substrate and elucidate the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of FBXO31 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of G1 to S phase progression, resulting in G1 arrest. Cyclin D1 degradation results from a direct interaction with FBXO31 and is dependent upon the F-box motif of FBXO31 and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine-286, which is known to be required for cyclin D1 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of FBXO31 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by Î³-irradiation results in increased FBXO31 levels, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 by the DDR-initiating kinase, ATM. Significantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevents cells from undergoing efficient G1 arrest following Î³-irradiation and dramatically increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that diverse DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in FBXO31 levels, indicating that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal FBXO31 as a regulator of the G1/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest.</p>

    <p id="P3">We studied FBXO31 function in human SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells. We first tested whether, as in breast cancer cell lines<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, ectopic expression of FBXO31 could induce G1 arrest in SK-MEL-28 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed, as expected, that nocodazole treatment of SK-MEL-28 cells resulted in G2/M arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Ectopic expression of FBXO31 prevented the nocodazole-induced G2/M block and instead substantially increased the fraction of cells in G1. Identical results were obtained in cells ectopically expressing FBXO31 in the absence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of FBXO31 blocked DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Notably, ectopic expression of FBXO31 also markedly inhibited the growth of SK-MEL-28 cells in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) and SK-MEL-28 mouse xenografts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">F-box proteins are best known for their role as the substrate-recognition components of the SCF (SKP/Cullin/F-box protein) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. To investigate the basis by which FBXO31 induces G1 arrest, we analyzed a panel of cell cycle regulatory proteins by immunoblot analysis following ectopic expression of FBXO31. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref> shows that following expression of FBXO31, but not vector alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), the level of cyclin D1, a key regulator of the G1/S phase transition<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, markedly declined. By contrast, the levels of other G1 cyclins and the G2/M regulator cyclin B1 were unaffected. Ectopic FBXO31 expression also had no effect on the levels of all cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and CDK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) examined. As expected, the reduction in cyclin D1 levels was accompanied by an increase in the fraction of cells in G1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 in SK-MEL-28 cells resulted in a similar G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that FBXO31 induces G1 arrest through selective degradation of cyclin D1.</p>
    <p id="P5">We next sought to determine whether the FBXO31-mediated decrease in cyclin D1 resulted from proteasomal degradation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> shows that addition of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin blocked the ability of ectopically expressed FBXO31 to decrease cyclin D1 levels. Consistent with this result, cyclin D1 mRNA levels were unaffected by ectopic FBXO31 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Moreover, following ectopic expression of FBXO31 the half-life of cyclin D1 was substantially decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Proteasomal-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation on threonine-286<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. We therefore tested whether FBXO31-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 was dependent upon threonine-286 phosphorylation. SK-MEL-28 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged cyclin D1 or a cyclin D1 derivative bearing a threonine-to-alanine substitution at position 286 [cyclin D1(T286A)]<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and then transduced with a retrovirus expressing FBXO31. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> shows that ectopic expression of FBXO31 resulted in degradation of wild type cyclin D1 but not the cyclin D1(T286A) mutant. Importantly, following expression of cyclin D1(T286A), ectopically expressed FBXO31 failed to induce efficient G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>) or block DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">To test whether FBXO31 and cyclin D1 interact, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. SK-MEL-28 cells transduced with a retrovirus expressing myc-tagged FBXO31 were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged cyclin D1 and treated with lactacystin to prevent cyclin D1 degradation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> show the presence of cyclin D1 in the FBXO31 immunoprecipitate, which was most evident when lactacystin was added. A similar result was obtained in the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. By contrast, FBXO31 failed to interact with cyclin D1(T286A) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref> also shows, consistent with previous reports<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, that FBXO31 was part of the SCF complex as evidenced by its association with SKP1 and CUL1. The co-immunoprecipitation experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> shows that there was also an interaction between the endogenous FBXO31 and cyclin D1 proteins.</p>
    <p id="P8">To determine whether the F-box motif of FBXO31 was required for cyclin D1 proteolysis, we used an FBXO31 derivative in which the F-box had been deleted (FBXO31ÎF)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In contrast to wild type FBXO31, ectopic expression of FBXO31ÎF did not result in decreased levels of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Consistent with this finding, ectopic expression of FBXO31 but not FBXO31ÎF resulted in polyubquitination of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As expected, cyclin D1(T286A) was not polyubiquitinated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref> shows that FBXO31 directed polyubiquitination of cyclin D1 <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of any other F-box protein.</p>
    <p id="P9">As noted above, it has been previously shown that oncogene-induced senescence involves activation of the DDR<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. We therefore considered the possibility that in addition to its role in BRAF-induced senescence<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, FBXO31 might also be involved in mediating G1 arrest following DNA damage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref> shows that following induction of DNA damage by Î³-irradiation, the levels of FBXO31 increased and, consistent with previous reports<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, this was accompanied by a decrease in cyclin D1 levels. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed that following Î³-irradiation, FBXO31 and cyclin D1 mRNA levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Consistent with this finding, in untreated SK-MEL-28 cells the low levels of FBXO31 resulted, at least in part, from proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Significantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevented the decrease in cyclin D1 following Î³-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). In support of this conclusion, Î³-irradiation decreased the half-life of cyclin D1 in SK-MEL-28 cells expressing a control non-silencing (NS) shRNA but not an FBXO31 shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Most importantly, in FBXO31 knockdown (KD) SK-MEL-28 cells Î³-irradiation failed to induce G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine-286 can be mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK3Î²)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and through a MAP kinase pathway<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. We found that GSK3Î² was not required for cyclin D1 degradation following Î³-irradiation, whereas blocking MAP kinase signalling using a chemical inhibitor of MEK prevented cyclin D1 degradation following Î³-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">ATM is a serine-threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in the DDR<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In response to DNA double-strand breaks, ATM is autophosphorylated on several residues including serine-1981, and functions by phosphorylating, and in many cases stabilizing, a number of downstream protein targets that function in the DDR<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. FBXO31 contains two putative ATM phosphorylation sites at amino acids 278/279 and 400/401, the former of which is conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, top). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that FBXO31 and ATM interacted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). A GST-fusion protein containing the 278/279serine-glutamine site was phosphorylated by ATM <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, bottom), and an FBXO31 derivative bearing a serine-to-alanine mutation at position 278 failed to accumulate following Î³-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) or upon co-transfection with ATM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). In ATM KD SK-MEL-28 cells, FBXO31 was not induced following Î³-irradiation and, accordingly, cyclin D1 levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). Significantly, knockdown of FBXO31 substantially increased sensitivity of SK-MEL-28 cells to Î³-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that following Î³-irradiation ATM directly phosphorylates FBXO31, which results in FBXO31 stabilization and subsequent cyclin D1 degradation.</p>
    <p id="P12">Finally, we tested whether other DNA damaging agents also induced FBXO31. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4i</xref> shows that FBXO31 levels greatly increased and cyclin D1 levels declined to varying extents following UV irradiation, X-ray irradiation, oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), or addition of the chemotherapeutic DNA damaging agents etoposide, adriamycin, cisplatin or fluorouracil. Based upon these results we conclude that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress.</p>
    <p id="P13">Collectively, the results reported here show that FBXO31 is induced by DNA damage and, once stabilized, targets cyclin D1 for degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, leading to G1 arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>). Our results address a long-standing problem in the DNA repair field. It has been previously shown that G1 arrest following DNA damage occurs in a two-phase response, referred to as initiation and maintenance<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The maintenance phase is a slow response that is primarily due to p53-dependent transcription induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. By contrast, initiation is a rapid, p53-independent response that primarily results from cyclin D1 degradation. However, the mechanistic basis by which cyclin D1 becomes rapidly degraded after genotoxic stress remained to be determined. Our results indicate that initiation of G1 arrest following genotoxic stress is due to induction of FBXO31, which then interacts with cyclin D1 and mediates its degradation.</p>
    <p id="P14">Two other F-box proteins, FBXO4 (also called FBX4) and FBXW8, have been previously reported to mediate cyclin D1 degradation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. FBXO31, FBXO4 and FBXW8 likely function through a common mechanism as evidenced by the observations that all three proteins are incorporated into the SCF complex and require phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine-286 to direct cyclin D1 degradation. However, an important distinction between the three proteins is that FBXO4 and FBXW8 appear to be required for normal cell cycle progression<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, whereas we find no evidence for a cell cycle defect or decreased growth rate following knockdown of FBXO31 (ref. <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; see above and data not shown). Moreover, in contrast to FBXO31, the levels of FBXO4 and FBXW8 do not increase following Î³-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 16a</xref>), and knockdown of FBXO4 or FBXW8 does not affect cyclin D1 degradation in Î³-irradiated SK-MEL-28 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 16b</xref>). The results presented here reveal that FBXO31 is a dedicated checkpoint protein whose function is to arrest cells following genotoxic stress.</p>
