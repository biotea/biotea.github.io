      <abstract>
        <p>Age-related cataract is a major cause of blindness worldwide, and cortical cataract is the second most prevalent type of age-related cataract. Although a significant fraction of age-related cataract is heritable, the genetic basis remains to be elucidated. We report that homozygous deletion of <italic>Epha2</italic> in two independent strains of mice developed progressive cortical cataract. Retroillumination revealed development of cortical vacuoles at one month of age; visible cataract appeared around three months, which progressed to mature cataract by six months. EPHA2 protein expression in the lens is spatially and temporally regulated. It is low in anterior epithelial cells, upregulated as the cells enter differentiation at the equator, strongly expressed in the cortical fiber cells, but absent in the nuclei. Deletion of <italic>Epha2</italic> caused a significant increase in the expression of HSP25 (murine homologue of human HSP27) before the onset of cataract. The overexpressed HSP25 was in an underphosphorylated form, indicating excessive cellular stress and protein misfolding. The orthologous human <italic>EPHA2</italic> gene on chromosome 1p36 was tested in three independent worldwide Caucasian populations for allelic association with cortical cataract. Common variants in <italic>EPHA2</italic> were found that showed significant association with cortical cataract, and rs6678616 was the most significant in meta-analyses. In addition, we sequenced exons of <italic>EPHA2</italic> in linked families and identified a new missense mutation, <italic>Arg721Gln</italic>, in the protein kinase domain that significantly alters EPHA2 functions in cellular and biochemical assays. Thus, converging evidence from humans and mice suggests that <italic>EPHA2</italic> is important in maintaining lens clarity with age.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cataract is the leading cause of blindness. Cataract may form at any age, but the peak incidence is bimodalâin the perinatal period or later than 50 years of age. The early onset forms follow Mendelian inheritance patterns and are rare. Age-related cataract accounts for 18 million cases of blindness and 59 million cases of reduced vision worldwide. Among three types of age-related cataract, cortical cataract is known to be highly heritable, although few genes have been linked to its etiology. We report here that <italic>EPHA2</italic> is associated with cortical cataract. <italic>EPHA2</italic> is expressed in mouse and human cortical lens fiber cells, and homozygous deletion of <italic>Epha2</italic> in two independent strains of mice led to development of cataract that progressed with age. Common and rare variants including a missense mutation in the <italic>EPHA2</italic> gene were associated for cortical cataract in three different Caucasian populations. Our study identified <italic>EPHA2</italic> as a gene for human age-related cataract and established <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice as a model for progressive cortical cataract.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, with approximately 37 million people affected, accounting for 48% of global blindness <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Cataract is defined as any opacity of the crystalline lens resulting from either alteration in lens cell structure or changes in lens proteins or both. Morphologic classification of age-related cataract can be divided into four categories: nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular cataract and mixed type. Among Caucasian Americans aged 65 years or older, the reported prevalence of cortical cataract was 24% <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Abraham1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Incidence of cataract surgery in the United States is highest amongst those over 70 years, with an annual increase of about 14% <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Erie1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Age-related cataract has consistently been attributed to risk factors such as old age, female gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, UV light exposure, and heavy alcohol intake <xref rid="pgen.1000584-McCarty1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recent studies showed excess clustering of disease in families <xref rid="pgen.1000584-McCarty1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Heritability for cortical cataract in female twins was estimated as high as 58%, and at least 11% of total variance was accounted for by age <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Hammond1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

      <p>A genome-wide scan for cortical cataract after adjusting for covariates in a subset of the BDES showed evidence of linkage in 1p36 <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Iyengar1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

The Eph receptor A2 gene (<italic>EPHA2</italic>) that resides under the linkage peak on 1p36 was selected as a candidate gene because knockout mice for <italic>Epha2</italic> developed age-related cortical cataract.

<italic>Epha2</italic> Knockout Mice Developed Progressive Cortical Cataract</title>
        <p>During the course of characterizing mice with deletion of <italic>Epha2</italic> gene, we observed development of progressive cortical cataract in a significant fraction of homozygous knockout mice. This line of knockout mice (<italic>Epha2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>) with deletion of exons 6â17 was generated using a secretory gene trapping strategy <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000584-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Initially noticed on FVB/NJ genetic background, visible bilateral lens opacity in <italic>Epha2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice appeared by five months, which was confirmed as cataract by slit lamp examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The incidence and severity increased with age, affecting over 80% of mice by 12 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t001">Table 1</xref>). Inspection of dissected lens revealed significant lens opacity between three to four months, and mature cataracts with lens rupture occurred between six to eight months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Dense opacity initiated around the equator and progressed to involve the entire lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As early as one month after birth, prior to the onset of lens opacity, retroillumination examination revealed clusters of subcapsular vacuoles in the anterior cortex of the <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout but not in heterozygous or wild-type lenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), which are indicative of structural and osmotic alterations in the lens <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Xia1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>

(A) Cataracts were visible by gross inspection in homozygous <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Epha2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>) between 5 to 8 months of age, but not in heterozygous or wild type mice. Shown are slit lamp images confirming development of cataract in <italic>Epha2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> but not <italic>Epha2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice. (B) Dark field imaging of the dissected lens. Although not readily detectable by visual inspection, cataracts were found on dissected lens by 3 months of age. This lens was tilted to show denser opacity near the equator (arrow). Enucleation frequently occurred during dissection of mature cataract after 8 months (far right). (C) Retroillumination examination revealed clusters of small vacuoles by one month of age. Scale bars: 1 mm for middle panel; 150 Âµm for right panel.

<xref rid="pgen.1000584-NaruseNakajima1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The homozygous mutant mice developed cataracts with similar morphological changes as the secretory gene trapping mice on FVB/NJ background described above. Thus, neither the strain genetic backgrounds nor the secretory trapping of partial EPHA2 ectodomain fused to Î²-gal is likely to be a major contributing factor in the lens phenotypes of the <italic>Epha2</italic> mutant mice. Interestingly, in cohorts of mice subject to two-stage chemical skin carcinogenesis studies <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the penetrance of cataract increased to 100% by six months, suggesting that similar to humans, environmental factors could significantly influence cataractogenesis in <italic>Epha2</italic>-null mice.</p>

        <title>EPHA2 Protein Is Expressed in Mice and Human Lens</title>
        <p>We found that EPHA2 was expressed in lens homogenates of wild type mice, and the level of expression progressively decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The relative level of expression is compatible with other tissues known to have high levels of EPHA2 such as the skin <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that EPHA2 was most abundantly expressed in cortical lens fiber cells but not nuclear fiber cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). In lens epithelial cells, EPHA2 expression was low in the anterior region and became upregulated when epithelial cells underwent differentiation at the lens equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1Eâ1K</xref>). Much weaker staining was seen in the nuclei of the lens. To verify these findings, we separated lens cortex and nuclei from two week and five month old mice and subjected the homogenates to immunoblot. EPHA2 was highly expressed in cortical fiber cells at two weeks, which fell significantly by five months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). Histochemical staining for LacZ reporter gene cassette confirmed the elevated EPHA2 expression near the equator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s001">Figure S1</xref>XPATH ERROR: unknown variable "checknextn".). Consistent with our observations in the mouse, EPHA2 was readily detectable in human lens fiber cells by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

The expression of EPHA2 and ephrin-A1 in the overlapping regions suggests EPHA2-ephrin-A1 interaction at these sites, which could have signaling and/or structural roles in the lens. Homozygous deletion of <italic>Epha2</italic> gene led to significant alteration in ephrin-A1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) concomitant with changes in lens structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Staining for expression of N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1L and 1M</xref>), a known component of cell adhesion junctions in lens fiber cells, further confirmed structural defects in the mutant lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>).</p>

        <p>Disruption of lens structure could be caused by cellular stresses. We found that HSP25, a small heat shock protein and the murine homologue of human HSP27, was significantly overexpressed in the <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout lens from day two after birth, long before the onset of cataract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g002">Figure 2Gâ2I</xref>).

Prior to the onset of lens degeneration at old age (6 months and beyond), expression of major crystallins did not show significant change either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). HSP25 is closely related to and directly interacts with Î±B-crystallin, being expressed during oxidative stress in human cataractous lenses <xref rid="pgen.1000584-OyaIto1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The overexpressed HSP25 in mutant lenses is in an underphosphorylated form that is known to form large aggregates with misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g002">Figure 2J</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Arrigo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000584-Jakob1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. By trapping misfolded proteins in large aggregates, HSP25 could contribute to cataractogenesis. While the exact mechanisms of cataractogenesis remain to be fully elucidated, these results together suggest that <italic>Epha2</italic> deletion probably causes elevated stress responses in the lens, which may lead to increased protein misfolding, cellular structural damages and eventual lens opacity.</p>

        <p>Among variants identified via re-sequencing, two non-synonymous variants (<italic>Arg721Gln</italic> and rs35484156) and two synonymous variants (<italic>Ile779Ile</italic> and rs6678616) were pursued by genotyping all available individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t004">Table 4</xref>) in the discovery BDES set (494 families, Nâ=â1401). The <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> variant demonstrated the strongest association (P values: corticalâ=â2Ã10<sup>â8</sup>, severe corticalâ=â8Ã10<sup>â5</sup>) in the BDES. We performed extensive quality control metrics for the final model containing <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> in the discovery dataset to confirm both the consistency and the validity of the association result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We did not discover any bias in the SNP association caused by other factors.</p>

We estimated that after adjusting for covariates the risk allele for <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> can cause a net increase in the cortical score of 9.2% under the dominant model (i.e. if an individual carries one â<italic>A</italic>â allele for the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> variant, the cortical cataract score increases by 9.2% compared to carrying â<italic>GG</italic>â alleles). Since we did not have <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> â<italic>AA</italic>â homozygotes in our data, we did not assess the effect size for a recessive model. Using the severe cortical cataract trait the association signal at <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> was less significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>), showing that smaller sample sizes led to reduced power.</p>

        <p>The sequencing data for <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> confirmed that the risk allele â<italic>A</italic>â segregates with disease in a BDES family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We were unable to investigate segregation for heterozygous individuals in the other families, because missing data caused these individuals to be singletons or unconnected. We also genotyped the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> variant in two replication datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t002">Table 2</xref>), the United Kingdom Twin Eye Study (UKTS; 185 individuals from 172 families) and the Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study comprising unrelated persons (BMES; Nâ=â1470). The three datasets were comparable with respect to measurement of the trait and the way the data were defined for analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The frequency of the rare â<italic>A</italic>â allele is 0.6%, 0% and 0.2% in the BDES, UKTS, and BMES, respectively. These frequencies are not significantly different in the BMES and UKTS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s008">Table S2</xref>); increased frequency of the â<italic>A</italic>â allele in the BDES was probably due to enrichment of the same risk allele in these families (i.e. a founder effect), and we believe that 0.1%â0.2% represents a true population estimate for this rare variant. The risk allele has 78% penetrance in heterozygous individuals whose age is 70 years or more. We were unable to test association for the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> in the replication sets because either the rare allele was not present (UKTS) or its frequency was too small (BMES) to be used in the statistical models.</p>

            <p>(A) An example electropherogram of the coding strand is displayed for an affected and an unaffected individual, with the arrow marking the variant. Individuals with disease were heterozygotes (CAG) for Gln/Arg while unaffected individuals were homozygotes for Arg/Arg (CGG). (B) A large family with cortical cataract was examined and the co-segregation of <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> with cortical cataract determined. Two members (3-1 and 3-2) and one marry-in (3-3) were GG (Arg/Arg) but have cortical cataract, suggesting phenocopies. Symbols filled with black or gray represent those affected with severe (â¥25% of the lens affected) or moderate (5%â¤score&lt;25%) cortical cataract, respectively. In the parent generation, all heterozygotes for the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> variant developed severe cortical cataract or have had cataract surgery. However, this variant has age dependent penetrance, as individuals who developed severe disease are older (e.g. individual 3-4 who is 80 years old). Individuals in the offspring generation who are at risk may not have developed full-fledged cortical cataract (e.g. 4-1 who is less than age 65 with moderate cataract, or 4-2 who is a carrier but remains free of disease at age 63).</p>

</title>
        <p>Functionally, the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> mutation changes arginine, a positively charged amino acid, to glutamine. Examination of the EPHA2 kinase domain crystal structure <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Nowakowski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> revealed that Arg721 in the Î±E helix forms a salt bridge with Asp872 in the Î±I helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, both Arg721 and Asp872 are concordantly conserved among different members of human Eph kinases and among EPHA2 proteins across different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). The <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> mutation may disrupt the salt bridge and affect its conformation and function. To test this possibility, wild type (WT) and <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> mutant EPHA2 were expressed in HEK 293 cells that have low endogenous EPHA2 <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Miao1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Although the mutant receptor still remained responsive to ligand stimulation in both kinetic and dose-response studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), it displayed significantly higher basal activation than WT-EPHA2 in the absence of ligand stimulation. Consistent with our previous report that activated EPHA2 inhibited the Ras/ERK1/2 signaling cascade <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Miao1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the higher basal activation of EPHA2 was correlated with dramatically reduce basal ERK1/2 activities compared to WT-EPHA2 or vector control, suggesting altered signaling by the mutant EPHA2. In a clonal growth assay, HEK 293 cells expressing <italic>Arg721Gln-</italic>EPHA2 were significantly growth-inhibited cells by ephrin-A1, whereas WT-EPHA2 expressing cells were refractory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, we observed stochastic intracellular retention of the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> mutant EPHA2, but not WT-EPHA2 when expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from <italic>Epha2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos, affecting about 40% of total cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The effects were cell type-specific, as they were not observed in HEK 293 cells. While the molecular mechanism for the cytosolic retention is unclear at present, the data in aggregate demonstrate that the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> mutation significantly alters EPHA2 signaling and cellular regulation in vitro. Because EPHA2 is essential in maintaining lens clarity in the mouse knockout model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g001">Figure 1</xref>), it is possible that such perturbation of EPHA2 functions by the <italic>Arg721Gln</italic> mutation can predispose the carrier to cataractogenesis. Further studies, including knock-in of the mutant allele in mice, will be necessary to determine if the mutation is sufficient to predispose to lens opacity in vivo.</p>

        <title>Identification of Common Variants Associated with Age-Related Cortical Cataract</title>
        <p>In order to find common variants associated with disease, we selected 15 SNPs based on tagging parameters and phylogenetic conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g006">Figure 6Aâ6C</xref>) in addition to 4 coding variants identified via re-sequencing, resulting in 19 additional SNPs that covered at least 90% of the gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t004">Table 4</xref>). We genotyped these SNPs in three worldwide Caucasian populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s008">Table S2</xref>).

            <p>Markers were selected based on phylogenetic footprinting in mouse-human (A), or phylogenetic shadowing in human-primates (B), or a tag-based approach using LD from the CEU HapMap sample (C). Markers in blue are in phylogenetically conserved areas, in black are tag-based, and in pink are identified via re-sequencing (D). Single marker results are reported using the full range of quantitative cortical cataract scores (CCQT) and the extreme phenotypic contrast for cortical cataract (severe CC), from the BDES, BMES, and UKTS. Meta-analysis results are shown using the two family studies (BDES and UKTS) and using all three studies (BDES, BMES, and UKTS). We plotted âlog<sub>10</sub>(P value) from the likelihood ratio test for CCQT and severe CC at each marker (D). The dashed line represents the 0.05 P value after adjusting for multiple testing for the genotyped SNPs and multiple models (0.05/[19 markersÃ3 genetic modelsÃ2 traits]â=â4Ã10<sup>â4</sup>).

        <p>We performed association analyses using percent of lens affected with cortical cataract as a dependent variable. We also tested association using affection status only, classifying individuals as clearly affected (percent of cortical score â¥25) or unaffected (percent of cortical score &lt;1), and eliminating all those with intermediate scores. If the whole range of scores was considered, the average cortical score in the BDES, UKTS, and BMES was 7.6%, 16.3%, and 3.2%, respectively, while the proportions with severe cortical cataract in the BDES, UKTS, and BMES were 10%, 29%, and 3%, respectively. Prior to association analysis, the quantitative trait of percent of lens affected and the binary trait, affected with cataract (yes/no), were adjusted for significant covariates using regression. The values obtained after regression (residuals) were inverse rank transformed to normalize their distribution. Association testing was performed on values of the trait before and after inverse rank transformation. Multiple genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) were tested for each SNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s009">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s010">Table S4</xref>), but for brevity only the dominant models are presented in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>); the remainder of the models are presented in the supplementary materials. In the discovery family data, six SNPs, rs924201, rs7548209, rs11260721, rs3768293, rs6603867 and rs6678616 showed significant association (nominal P&lt;4.4Ã10<sup>â4</sup>, calculated as 0.05 divided by 3 modelsÃ2 traitsÃ19 genotyped SNPs), either with the full range of cortical cataract scores or with severe cortical cataract. Except for rs6678616, P values at the other five SNPs (rs924201, rs7548209, rs11260721, rs3768293 and rs6603867) were smaller when using the categorical yes/no definition of cortical cataract, despite the decrease in sample size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). Differences in the ability to detect association as a result of changed in phenotypic definition are not unexpected, as association is dependent on allele frequency, as well as on sample size.</p>
        <p>Because the average cortical cataract score of the cases in the UKTS was 10% greater than the other two studies, the proportion of severe cases in the UKTS is 3 times and 10 times higher than that in the BDES and BMES, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, in the replication dataset from the UKTS, P values for the severe cortical cataract trait were in general smaller than the full range of cortical cataract scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000584-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Four of the same common SNPs observed in the BDES, rs7548209, rs3754334, rs3768293, and rs6678616, showed replication (smallest P value with rs3754334â=â1Ã10<sup>â4</sup>). In the UKTS we also identified significant association for severe cortical cataract with another rare variant Ile779Ile (Pâ=â3Ã10<sup>â5</sup>). Rigorous diagnostic testing of the final models in the two family datasets (BDES and UKTS) confirmed that the results were valid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Association Analysis of Common Variants in Unrelated Data</title>
        <p>We conducted single SNP and haplotype association analyses in the BMES (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s011">Table S5</xref>). As the BMES cohort is slightly younger, if we selected an age-matched case-control set, restricting controls to 70 years or greater, and defining cases as those with a cortical scoreâ¥25% and controls with cortical score&lt;1% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>) we observed replication using the trend test (best P value at rs7548209â=â0.003). Without these restrictions, the association was less significant because the chance of misclassifying disease is higher at younger ages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). Using the five most significant SNPs, rs7548209, rs3754334, rs3768293, rs6603867 and rs6678616, we performed a haplotype association test for cortical cataract using a moving window approach with different window sizes from 2 to 5. Haplotype analyses showed stronger evidence than single marker tests in the BMES (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). Three haplotypes showed significant association at a nominal P&lt;0.05 with window size 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>).

        <title>Heterogeneity Tests and Meta-Analysis</title>
        <p>Joint (meta-)analysis was conducted to combine the results of the two family studies and then to combine all three studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s012">Table S6</xref>). The most significant association for the full range of cortical cataract trait values using the two family sets and all three datasets was found with rs6603867 (Pâ=â4Ã10<sup>â5</sup>) and rs6678616 (Pâ=â1Ã10<sup>â4</sup>), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). There was no significant heterogeneity for cortical cataract scores under the dominant model (P&gt;0.05) with these two significant SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s012">Table S6A</xref>). For severe cortical cataract, rs7548209 (Pâ=â8Ã10<sup>â9</sup>) and rs3768293 (Pâ=â0.0037) were the most significant markers when combining the two family datasets and when combining all three datasets, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). We noted that the SNPs for the severe cortical cataract trait showed heterogeneous effect sizes across studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). Nevertheless, the direction of the association for the full spectrum of cortical cataract was the same among all three studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s009">Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s010">Table S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s011">Table S5</xref>). Diversity in effect sizes among the three datasets for severe cortical cataract is not surprising, because the proportion of severe cases in each study is different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t002">Table 2</xref>). As a result, meta-analysis of all three datasets did not improve the overall significance of the results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>). However, single SNP association, haplotype association, and meta-analysis consistently identified that two independent association signals are present in the 3â² (rs7548209 and rs3754334) and the 5â² (rs3768293, rs6603867, and rs6678616) regions of the gene. The maximum pairwise correlations between SNPs in the 3â² and the 5â² regions is less than 0.4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000584-t005">Table 5</xref>), arguing for more than one susceptibility variant being present in these samples.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report here that <italic>EPHA2</italic> is essential in maintaining the clarity of crystalline lens in aging mice and is associated with age-related cortical cataract in humans. EPHA2 protein is expressed in the cortical lens fiber cells, and homozygous deletion of <italic>Epha2</italic> in mice caused progressive cortical cataract. At the molecular level, cataractogenesis was preceded by accumulation of underphosphorylated HSP25, indicating elevated stresses and protein misfolding in <italic>Epha2</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> lens. In human studies involving three independent Caucasian populations, we discovered common polymorphisms, as well as a rare variant that significantly altered the function of EPHA2 kinase activities and cellular functions. Therefore, converging evidence from genetically engineered mice and human population studies, coupled with in vitro cell-based assays, strongly suggest that <italic>EPHA2</italic> is the first major genes associated with the common form of cataract. The involvement of a receptor tyrosine kinase in cortical cataract etiology points to future directions in designing new preventive and therapeutic approaches for cortical cataract by targeting <italic>EPHA2</italic>.</p>
      <p>Prior to this study, the only noticeable phenotype reported in <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice is the kinked tails, which develops during early embryogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1000584-NaruseNakajima1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For yet unknown reasons, the penetrance of this phenotype has been quite low in the large cohorts of the same strain of knockout mice maintained in our facility on either FVB/NJ or C57Bl/6 genetic background. In another stain of <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice generated by the secretory trapping strategy <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000584-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the incidence of kinked tails was also very low. This is in contrast with cataract phenotype reported here that is observed in significant fraction of both strains of homozygous knockout mice.</p>
      <p>There are several unique approaches in our study compared with other studies to identify genes involved in complex disease. First, we utilized two independent lines of <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice that were extensively investigated for potential molecular implications in cataractogenesis. This effort provided confidence in subsequent studies pursuing causal variants in human populations. Second, we investigated association with polymorphisms of <italic>EPHA2</italic> in worldwide Caucasian populations from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Phenotypic measurements were comparable among the three datasets, but there was variability in the extent of severity of cataracts in these populations. The most severe forms of cataract were associated with rare variants that were unique to each population and there was little replication between populations. Common variants could be replicated across populations with a greater degree of certainty. To ensure validity of the results, we extensively examined diagnostics of the final models in the family data. A candidate gene study using family data, unlike a genome-wide association study using unrelated data, requires special techniques to ensure the validity, i.e. normality of the model residuals expected asymptotically and required for the P values that presume normality to be valid. We applied the George-Elston transformation to both sides of the regression equation in the association tests <xref rid="pgen.1000584-George1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We confirmed the normality of the residuals in the final models for all SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our studies led to the successful identification of a non-synonymous variant, <italic>Arg721Gln</italic>, residing in the protein kinase domain of EPHA2. Moreover, the variant showed increased spontaneous activation in the absence of ligand stimulation, suggesting that the coding variant alters the spontaneous and ligand-triggered cellular signaling. The altered signaling is associated with enhanced growth inhibition by ligand, and stochastic intracellular retention in primary fibroblasts. The reason for the cytoplasmic retention in only some, but not all cells expressing the mutant is not clear at present. Regardless of the mechanisms, cytoplasmic trapping is likely to interrupt both signaling and structural functions of EPHA2/ephrinA system in the lens fiber cells. Because EphA2 is essential for maintaining lens clarity as evidenced by cataractogenesis in homozygous knockout mice, functional alterations in EphA2 is likely to impair its physiological roles in the lens, predisposing the carriers to increased risk of cataract development.</p>
      <p>In addition to this rare variant, common polymorphisms were also discovered and replicated in worldwide Caucasian populations, suggesting that <italic>EPHA2</italic> could be involved in predisposition to cataractogenesis in the general population. The most significant common variant for the quantitative cortical cataract trait was rs6678616 in the region coding for the ligand binding domain of the <italic>EPHA2</italic> gene. Bioinformatic investigation revealed that rs6678616 is located in an exonic splicing enhancer element, and nucleotide changes of the SNP may potentially affect the affinity of splicing enhancer factors up to 14-fold (data not shown). The most significant SNP, rs7548209, for severe cortical cataract is present in a downstream conserved non-coding region of the <italic>EPHA2</italic> gene. Characteristics of this variant are not known. It is possible that such a variant may affect <italic>EPHA2</italic> expression during aging.</p>
      <p>While this manuscript was under preparation, it was reported that mice with homozygous deletion of <italic>Efna5</italic> encoding a ligand (ephrinA5) for EPHA2 also developed cataract <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. These data nicely complement the data described in this paper, and demonstrate that both the receptor (EPHA2) and the ligand (ephrinA5) are required for maintaining lens clarity. In addition, recent genetic studies involving a relatively small number of affected individuals have found a link between congenital cataract and variants of <italic>EPHA2</italic>, although none of rare variants were functionally characterized <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Shiels1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These recent results on rare congenital cataract support our conclusion on the link between <italic>EPHA2</italic> and the much more common age-related cataract, based on large human population studies and genetically engineered mice.</p>
      <p>Since aging was the most important risk factor for age-related cataract, age-dependent reduction of EPHA2 protein expression in normal lens and age-dependent deterioration of lens clarity in <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice suggests an important role of EPHA2 kinase in cataractogenesis during aging. Previous studies have shown that EPHA2 regulates epithelial cell morphogenesis and homeostasis in part by interacting with components of adherens and tight junctions, such as claudins and cadherins <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Miao2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Notably, the lens is primarily composed of lens fiber cells where intricate cell-cell interactions are essential for structural and functional integrity. Changes of EPHA2 expression or function due to aging or genetic predisposition can impair junctional structure, leading to excessive cellular stress and eventual opacity.</p>
      <p>Recent studies show that there are common genes and pathways among late onset neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and age-related eye disease. Genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases, kinesin light chain 1 <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and apolipoprotein E <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Utheim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, showed association with age-related cataract. Also, there is evidence of a link between longevity and age-related cataract <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Zubenko1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Successful aging, defined as preserved cognition, is associated with reduced age-related cataract among the elderly <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Zubenko1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Microarray expression analysis proved that lens expresses brain specific molecules, including Î²-amyloid secretases and degrading enzyme <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, synapsin and synaptic vesicle protein <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Frederikse1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and brain-specific miRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Frederikse2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This suggests that common genes and pathways may be involved in both age-related cataract and neurodegenerative diseases affecting the elderly population. Since the EPH/ephrin system is known to be critical for neural development <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and vision processes in the midbrain <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Feldheim1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, the <italic>EPH</italic> and <italic>EFN</italic> genes may be potentially involved in a broad spectrum of age-related eye and neurodegenerative diseases. Further functional investigation of these genes will elucidate pathogenic mechanisms leading to age-related cataract and other late onset diseases.</p>
      <p>In summary, converging evidence from mouse and humans demonstrates that <italic>EPHA2</italic> has an important role in maintaining lens transparency. While genetic predisposition is known to be a major contributing factor to age-related cortical cataract, our study has identified and characterized genetic variants of the <italic>EPHA2</italic> gene in human, and both common and rare variants confer risks for cortical cataract.</p>

        <p>The KST085 line of <italic>Epha2</italic> knockout mice was generated through secretory gene trapping as described previously <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The secretory trapping vector was inserted at the boundary between exon 5 and intron 6, leading to the truncation of exons 6 to 17 encoding the second fibronectin type III repeat in the extracellular domain all the way to the carboxyl terminal end. The remaining ectodomain encoded by exons 1 to 5 is fused to neomycin resistance and Î²-galactosidase reporter cassette (Î²-geo) and is trapped inside the cells in secretory vesicles, presumably in inactive form. These mice, which were generated on a C57Bl/6/129 genetic background, were then backcrossed with FVB/N mice.

The lens photographs were graded based on the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. For grading cortical cataract, a grid was used with a central circle that occupies 2% of the entire lens surface, and subfields covered the remaining area, where each subfield was 12.25% of the total area. The percentage of each subfield with opacity was recorded and combined into a percentage of total opacity involvement for the eye. We used worst scores of cortical cataract during the 15-year observation period as quantitative traits. We also defined a binary trait of severe cortical cataract status: if the score indicated that â¥25% of the entire lens in either eye was affected we classified them as affected, whereas unaffected individuals were those with cortical scores&lt;1% for the worse eye. The history of affection status during the 20 -year observation period from baseline (prevalent) and three follow-up (incident) phases of the study was reviewed to classify individuals into a binary classification, affected/unaffected, of cortical cataract, eliminating those with intermediate scores.</p>

IRB approval was obtained from the St Thomas' Hospital Local Research Ethics Committee, and all subjects signed informed consents. The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Both individuals from 13 dizygotic twin pairs were included in analyses. As 23 pairs were monozygotic twins, the twin with the more severe cataract score or with DNA available was retained for analysis. Thus, the number of individuals in the final analysis was 185 individuals from 172 families.</p>

        <p>We selected 34 individuals for re-sequencing, 19 of whom had severe cortical cataract (worst cortical score â¥25% of lens involved), 15 were unaffected family members with no evidence of cataract formation (worst cortical score &lt;1%) at â¥70 years of age, representing 18 families. Our rationale for choosing this set of individuals for re-sequencing was that they were previously shown to be linked to markers at 1p36 <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Iyengar1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and we hoped to find coding variants associated with disease, in addition to finding neutral variants.</p>
        <p>To identify linked families, sib pairs from the SIBPAL program (version 5.3.1) in the candidate region (1p36) were ranked for linkage informativity <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. For each sibling pair, a score based on the squared sib-pair difference and the estimated sib-pair marker allele sharing was computed:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> are the trait values for sibs 1 and 2, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the average of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e005.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> over the whole sample, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e006.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is the estimated mean allele sharing for the two sibs. This score is large (positive) either when the squared sib pair difference of the trait value is small and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e007.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is large or when the squared sib-pair difference is large and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e008.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is small, which means the sibs are similarly alike, in terms of deviation from the mean, for both their traits and allele-sharing; otherwise the score will tend to be small (negative). Therefore, all the sibpairs with positive values were considered to be contributing to linkage.</p>
        <p>All 17 <italic>EPHA2</italic> exons along with 50â100 base pairs of the surrounding intronic junctions were sequenced with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers designed using the PrimerSelect program (version 4.05) in the DNASTAR software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s007">Table S1</xref>). For each amplicon, the PCR conditions for amplification are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s007">Table S1</xref>. After PCR, the product was purified using ExoSAP-IT enzyme (1Ã; 2 Âµl of the ExoSAP-IT enzyme with 10 Âµl PCR product for a final concentration of 5 ng/Âµl) and the product sizes were confirmed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The amplified PCR products along with primers were sent to McLab (San Francisco, CA) for sequencing. Electropherograms were examined using the ChromasPro program (version 1.4) and new variants not previously reported in the literature were confirmed by sequencing in the reverse direction.</p>

        <title>Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Selection</title>
        <p>We selected SNPs for full-scale genotyping via three strategies: re-sequencing, tag-based selection using the linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>), and phylogenetic mining. Based on the results of re-sequencing, three rare coding variants and a common SNP were selected for follow up in the remaining individuals of the discovery data. For the tag-based approach, linkage disequilibrium (LD) in <italic>EPHA2</italic> was investigated by examining SNPs from 10 Kb upstream (+10 Kb) to 10 Kb downstream (â10 Kb) of the gene (16,323,419â16,355,151 bp) in HapMap data (CEU; Centre d'Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain; Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe, HapMap Data, Data Rel 21 a/phaseII Jan07, on NCBI B36.3 assembly, dbSNP b130) using the HAPLOVIEW program (version 3.1). We selected at least one SNP in each block based on HapMap data to get four tagging SNPs.</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic footprinting <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Ovcharenko1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and phylogenetic shadowing <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Ovcharenko2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> were used for additional SNP selection. Under the assumption that non-coding regulatory regions are conserved through evolution, direct genotyping of non-coding conserved SNPs may increase power in chromosomal regions with low LD. We examined mouse-human sequences to maximize the number of inter-species conserved regions. The <italic>EPHA2</italic> sequences from human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) and mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) were aligned using zPicture. We used window size width of â¥100 bp with â¥70% identity between human and mouse <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Loots1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In the phylogenetic shadowing approach, using multiple sequence comparisons among primates, sequence elements (blocks) that did not change among primates are identified as regulatory elements <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Ovcharenko2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We identified the non-coding conserved regions in <italic>EPHA2</italic> by comparing the human <italic>EPHA2</italic> gene as a reference with the orthologous sequences in two primates, the chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) and the rhesus monkey (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) using eShadow <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Ovcharenko2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Within each conserved block one SNP with the highest minor allele frequency (MAF) was selected for genotyping.</p>
        <p>Based on the hybrid selection strategy for SNPs, we first selected four non-redundant tag based SNPs that had MAF&gt;5%. These SNPs were supplemented with 11 conserved non-coding SNPs identified through phylogenetic approaches. Finally, a set of intriguing coding and regulatory SNPs (Nâ=â4) identified through re-sequencing were also genotyped. In total, 19 SNPs were genotyped in all three datasets, the BDES, UKTS, and BMES.</p>

        <title>SNP Genotyping and Quality Control Metrics</title>
        <p>We used two different techniques, TaqMan and SNPlex assays, to interrogate SNPs. The genotyping procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Clustering algorithms for genotype assignment used three quality control steps: (1) removing wells (individuals) with a significant number of outlier SNPs, (2) setting a SNP pass value by assigning a pass or fail status for each SNP, and (3) for each passing SNP, a confidence value was calculated (call rate). A confidence value of at least 95% was required to retain a genotype call. We further cleaned the data by removing individuals with low quality DNA across the SNPs (at least 90% of SNPs met the threshold quality value). We calculated the error rate and no-call rate using 5% replicate plating of DNA prior to these filtering steps. The average error rate and no-call rate for SNPlex genotyping was 0.7% and 3.9%, respectively. The average error rate and no-call rate for TaqMan genotyping was 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively. Cleaned data were used in association analyses.</p>
        <p>All genotyped SNPs met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a nominal P&gt;0.05. We estimated allele frequencies using the FREQ program in S.A.G.E. (version 5.4.2), and 95% confidence intervals were reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s008">Table S2</xref>). The program estimates allele frequencies using a maximum likelihood formulation that assumes a random mating population. Standard errors are computed by numerical double differentiation of the log likelihood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000584.s008">Table S2</xref>). We also examined linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks in each dataset using the HAPLOVIEW program (version 3.32).</p>

          <title>Association analysis for family data</title>
          <p>All genotyped SNPs were tested for association using the ASSOC program in S.A.G.E. (version 5.3.1). The method in ASSOC is a maximum likelihood regression-based approach that allows appropriate handling of familial correlations, estimating as necessary variance components for <italic>polygenic</italic>, <italic>marital</italic>, <italic>family</italic>, and <italic>sibling effects</italic> as well as for <italic>individual random effect</italic>s, and that transforms both sides of the regression equation <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> (simultaneously estimating two transformation parameters) to remove skewness and kurtosis <xref rid="pgen.1000584-George1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The model for the <italic>i<sup>th</sup></italic> pedigree member is <italic>h(y<sub>i</sub>)â=âh(f<sub>i</sub>)+Îµ<sub>i</sub></italic>, where <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> is the trait value, <italic>f<sub>i</sub>â=âÎ±+Î²g<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic> is the genetic marker value, <italic>Îµ<sub>i</sub></italic> is the sum of the random effects, and <italic>h</italic> is the George-Elston generalized modulus power transformation <xref rid="pgen.1000584-George1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The George-Elston transformation is defined as<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e009.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>This transformation involves both power (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e010.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) and shift (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e011.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) parameters that are simultaneously estimated, together with the other parameters of the model, by maximum likelihood under the assumption of multivariate normality across family members. Because the transformation is applied to both the trait value (y) and its expectation <italic>f</italic>, for quantitative traits the regression coefficients (Î²) are median unbiased estimates <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> to the extent that the model fits. In the case of binary traits, because the quantitative residuals (y) were obtained from logistic regression, the estimated regression coefficients (Î²) are not meaningful with respect to the magnitude of the effect, though they are so with respect to their statistical significance. Three genetic models (<italic>g</italic>), additive, dominant, and recessive with respect to a reference allele, were assessed at each SNP. The minor allele was selected as the reference allele. For example, a SNP in an additive model was coded as 0, 1, or 2 according to the number of reference alleles, whereas it was coded as 0 or 1 in a dominant model according to the absence or presence of the reference allele.</p>
          <p>To find the best model for the familial correlation structure, each familial variance component was tested in the model by itself and in combination with others. The most significant, but parsimonious, model was retained as the ânullâ model against which was contrasted models containing the SNPs as covariates. For the two family datasets BDES and UKTS, the variance components for <italic>sibling</italic> and <italic>random effects</italic>, along with a genetic model for a SNP, were included in the final analysis. For each SNP, the baseline model without the SNP covariate and an alternate model with the SNP covariate were contrasted. The likelihood was maximized with respect to the null model containing the variance components and the baseline parameter Î±, and the alternate model containing the same variance components and both Î± and Î². We performed likelihood ratio tests by comparing twice the difference between two log likelihoods with a chi-square distribution, and Wald tests by dividing each estimate of Î² by its standard error, estimated by numerical double differentiation of the log likelihood, and comparing the quotient to a standard normal distribution. Thus we obtained two P values that would be asymptotically identical.</p>
          <p>We examined the residuals ([<italic>h(y<sub>i</sub>)âh(Î±+Î²g<sub>i</sub>)</italic>]) in a final model that included the most significant SNP by plotting a normal quantile-quantile (normal Q-Q) plot. Regardless of the distribution of <italic>y</italic>, normality of the residuals is required for the association result to be valid. We also conducted association analyses on the normalized traits, forcing the marginal distribution of the analyzed trait to be about normally distributed under the null hypothesis, by taking the inverse standard normal transformation of the empirical quantile that was obtained from the formula [<italic>r(y)â1/3</italic>] divided by <italic>(n+1/3)</italic>, where <italic>r(y)</italic> is the rank of <italic>y</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000584-Hyndman1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. To evaluate the ability of the George-Elston transformation to achieve normality, we compared residuals without transformation to those with the George-Elston transformation, and to those with the George-Elston transformation when the initial trait was inverse normal transformed. We examined the distributions of residuals from the final models using the quantitative cortical cataract trait in the BDES and in UKTS. Since the estimates (Î²-coefficients) for the quantitative trait, after the George-Elston transformation is applied to both sides of the regression equation, are median unbiased estimates, we report these estimates as our effects that measure net change, after adjusting for other covariates, due to a dominant or recessive genotype, or per copy of a reference allele (additive model). The estimate measures the net percentage change in cataract score ranging from 0 to 100%.</p>
          <p>For the severe binary cortical cataract trait, as the George-Elston transformation was not sufficient to obtain normality in both family datasets, we report only P values from inverse normal transformed traits. For comparability, P values from both the quantitative and binary traits in the main text were from inverse normal transformed traits, and estimates for the quantitative cortical cataract were only reported for quantitative traits without inverse normal transformation. We also report P values from the likelihood ratio tests and Wald tests of the inverse normal transformed quantitative and binary traits.</p>

          <title>Association analysis for unrelated data</title>
          <p>For the unrelated BMES data, we performed ordinary least squares regression of quantitative traits on allele dosage as implemented in the PLINK program (version 1.0.1) <xref rid="pgen.1000584-Purcell1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We used Wald tests based on t-distributions, and regression coefficients (Î²-coefficients) and asymptotic P values are reported. We performed the Cochran-Armitage (additive) trend test using an age-matched (age at least 70 years) case-control set, comprising cases with cortical score â¥25% and controls with cortical score &lt;1%. The PLINK program performs a chi-square test for association on the fourfold allele table, and reports asymptotic P values and the estimated odds ratios for the minor allele. We also report the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios.</p>
          <p>After single SNP association tests, for which the P values were moderate, we conducted haplotype-based association tests in the unrelated data in order to explore the improvement in significance.

In this model, we assume population effect sizes (<italic>Î²<sub>i</sub></italic>) are heterogeneous among studies and follow a normal distribution with mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e012.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e013.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.

This assumption is valid, especially when residuals from the final model are normally distributed. The Q statistic was constructed using the formula, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e015.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000584.e016.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and <italic>k</italic> is the number of studies.
