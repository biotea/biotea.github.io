      <abstract>
        <p>Hyperostosis Cranialis Interna (HCI) is a rare bone disorder characterized by progressive intracranial bone overgrowth at the skull. Here we identified by whole-exome sequencing a dominant mutation (L441R) in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> (<italic>ZIP14</italic>). We show that L441R ZIP14 is no longer trafficked towards the plasma membrane and excessively accumulates intracellular zinc, resulting in hyper-activation of cAMP-CREB and NFAT signaling. Conditional knock-in mice overexpressing L438R <italic>Zip14</italic> in osteoblasts have a severe skeletal phenotype marked by a drastic increase in cortical thickness due to an enhanced endosteal bone formation, resembling the underlying pathology in HCI patients. Remarkably, L438R <italic>Zip14</italic> also generates an osteoporotic trabecular bone phenotype. The effects of osteoblastic overexpression of L438R <italic>Zip14</italic> therefore mimic the disparate actions of estrogen on cortical and trabecular bone through osteoblasts. Collectively, we reveal ZIP14 as a novel regulator of bone homeostasis, and that manipulating ZIP14 might be a therapeutic strategy for bone diseases.</p>

        <p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder affecting hundreds of millions of people, and is characterized by a low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased susceptibility to fracture. Genetic factors are the greatest determinants of BMD, but only a small fraction of these have been identified through genome-wide association studies. Studying rare, monogenic skeletal disorders is therefore an interesting strategy to identify genes with a putative large effect on BMD. Hyperostosis Cranialis Interna (HCI) is a rare monogenic disorder resulting in bone overgrowth exclusively at the skull, for which the underlying genetic cause was previously mapped to a region on chromosome 8. Our study demonstrates that HCI results from a mutation in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> (<italic>ZIP14</italic>), resulting in trafficking defects of ZIP14 and an aberrant cellular zinc homeostasis. Conditional mouse models demonstrate primary actions of Zip14 through osteoblasts, resulting in a HCI-like phenotype in the long bones and reveal estrogen-mimicking and PTH-opposing effects of Zip14 on bone homeostasis. This study designates ZIP14 as a novel regulator of BMD, and that manipulating ZIP14 might be a therapeutic strategy for complex bone diseases, like osteoporosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hyperostosis Cranialis Interna (HCI, OMIM 144755) is a rare bone disorder characterized by endosteal hyperostosis and osteosclerosis of the calvaria and the skull base. This results in the entrapment and dysfunction of cranial nerves I, II, V, VII and VIII, causing disturbances in smell, vision, sensation in the face, facial expression, hearing and balance, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, increased ocular and intracranial pressure can occur, leading to frequent headaches. Remarkably, there is no indication that the remainder of the skeleton is affected in HCI patients. The first radiological abnormalities are often seen in the first decade, whereas the first symptoms occur late in the first decade or in adulthood and slow progression of the disease can be seen until the age of 40 [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Untimely death may occur in severely affected cases, due to decreased intracranial volume [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>HCI was originally described by Manni <italic>et al</italic>. in three related families with common progenitors from the Netherlands with currently 13 affected family members over four generations [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This family is still the only family known with HCI. As a monogenic skeletal disorder, HCI has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The genetic cause of HCI has been investigated previously by performing a whole-genome scan and linkage analysis in this family, where we assigned the locus for HCI to chromosome 8p21 [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>The aim of this study was to further look for the disease-causing gene and get insights in the mechanism underlying HCI. Therefore, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which resulted in the identification of a missense mutation (p.L441R) in the <italic>SLC39A14</italic> (<italic>ZIP14</italic>) gene, encoding a zinc transporter. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies were performed to investigate the subcellular localization and p.L441R ZIP14. Furthermore, two conditional knock-in mouse models were generated, overexpressing p.L438R Zip14 in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Thorough skeletal phenotyping of these mice was performed to unravel cell-specific effects of p.L438R Zip14 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, to learn more about the pathogenesis of this disorder, histology of a HCI skull biopsy specimen was performed and luciferase reporter assays were done to look for aberrations in signaling pathways caused by p.L441R ZIP14.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>SLC39A14</italic> (<italic>ZIP14</italic>) as disease causing gene for HCI</title>
        <p>Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on one affected individual from the family with HCI. The average coverage throughout the whole exome was 66x. After filtering variants for their absence in dbSNP and excluding non-coding and synonymous variants, we focused on the variants present in the linkage region on chromosome 8 (chr8: 21,593,210â28,256,787) after which only two variants remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Both variants, one in <italic>SCARA3</italic> with a 5x coverage and one in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> with a 66x coverage, were checked with Sanger sequencing. The variant in the <italic>SCARA3</italic> gene appeared to be a false positive, since we could not confirm it in the patient. The other variant is a heterozygous c.1322T&gt;G substitution in the <italic>solute carrier family 39 member 14</italic> (<italic>SLC39A14</italic> or <italic>ZIP14</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This variant co-segregates with the disease in the complete family and was not found in 100 control individuals with the same ethnic background and is not present in sequence databases, including dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project and ExAc databases. Eighteen exons from the linkage region remained partially or completely uncovered by WES and were all checked with Sanger sequencing, but no additional pathogenic variants were identified. Our results therefore indicate that the c.1322T&gt;G variant found in <italic>ZIP14</italic> is the only coding variant in the 8p21 region previously linked to HCI, confirming its disease causality.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the p.L441R variant in <italic>ZIP14</italic></title>
        <p>The human <italic>SLC39A14</italic> gene has four protein coding isoforms according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), all consisting of nine exons. The heterozygous c.1322T&gt;G substitution in exon 8 of <italic>ZIP14</italic> affects all isoforms of the gene and results in a p.L441R substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), altering a highly conserved amino acid. Accordingly, this missense mutation has a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score of 29.4, indicating it belongs to the top 0.11% most deleterious substitutions that can occur in the human genome [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a zinc (Zn) transporter, ZIP14 has six or eight transmembrane domains, depending on the literature or prediction program used (TMHMM, MEMSAT, PRED-TMR, HMMTOP) [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the p.L441R mutation is always located at the end of the second-to-last transmembrane domain of ZIP14. All transmembrane prediction programs predict the variant to cause one or more shifts in a preceding, the affected or the following transmembrane domain, due to the replacement of a hydrophobic leucine by a hydrophilic arginine.</p>

        <title>The p.L441R mutation affects localization and function of <italic>ZIP14 in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>To evaluate the subcellular localization of mutant (L441R) ZIP14, HEK293T cells were transfected with wildtype (WT), L441R or truncated (W22X) ZIP14-GFP constructs and visualized with confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g002">Fig 2</xref>). WT ZIP14 is located on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, as previously reported [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast herewith, L441R ZIP14 is not present on the plasma membrane, but appears to be trapped in the cytoplasm. Further investigation of the cytoplasmic localization of L441R ZIP14 with markers for the Golgi apparatus and for early and late endosomes demonstrated no difference in the intracellular localization of WT and L441R ZIP14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007321.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A heterozygous model (WT/L441R ZIP14) clearly shows increased expression in the cytoplasm (compared to WT) and some co-localization on the plasma membrane. W22X ZIP14 shows expression in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. Moreover, there is a difference in cytoplasmic distribution of the different ZIP14 forms, i.e. both WT and L441R ZIP14 appear to be clustered in similar vesicular-shaped structures, whereas W22X ZIP14 is uniformly spread across the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

        <p><sup>65</sup>Zn uptake and Zn accumulation studies were performed to assess the basic functionality of p.L441R ZIP14 as a transporter of Zn (and other metals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). <sup>65</sup>Zn uptake experiments revealed that overexpressing WT ZIP14 significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) increases <sup>65</sup>Zn uptake by 4-fold when compared to cells transfected with empty vector. On the contrary, L441R and W22X ZIP14 showed no sign of <sup>65</sup>Zn uptake from the extracellular space into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This was no surprise, as L441R and W22X ZIP14 were no longer detected on the plasma membrane of the cells. FluoZin3-AM measures the accumulation of labile Zn in the cell. Results show that there is a significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) increase in Zn accumulation in cells overexpressing WT ZIP14. Overexpression of L441R ZIP14 also results in a significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) increase in intracellular Zn accumulation, which is greater than for WT ZIP14, indicating that labile Zn is trapped in cells with L441R ZIP14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Altogether, L441R ZIP14 no longer reaches the plasma membrane, but still resides on the same cytoplasmic structures as WT ZIP14 from where it causes an entrapment of labile Zn.</p>

        <title><italic>ZIP14</italic> is expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts</title>
        <p><italic>ZIP14</italic> was reported to be expressed in many tissues with increased expression in the liver, pancreas, thyroid gland, heart and intestine, and a low expression in the brain [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Information on the expression of <italic>ZIP14</italic> in skeletal cell types (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes) has not been reported in the literature. We therefore performed immunohistochemistry on sections of giant cell tumor and osteoblastoma tissue, bone tumors known to be enriched with osteoclast-like giant cells and osteoblasts, respectively. Here, expression of <italic>ZIP14</italic> was detected in osteoblasts of osteoblastoma tissue and giant cells from giant cell tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). <italic>ZIP14</italic> was not expressed in osteocytes of osteoblastoma or giant cell tumor tissue. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed on KS483 cells, murine mesenchymal stem cells, to assess expression level of murine <italic>Zip14</italic> (<italic>mZip14</italic>) during the different phases of osteoblast differentiation to a mature mineralizing osteoblast. Our results, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, indicate that expression of <italic>mZip14</italic> is stable during proliferation (first week) and maturation (second week) of osteoblast differentiation and rises during the mineralization phase (day 18â21). Lastly, Zip14 expression was checked with qPCR in murine osteoclasts derived from calvaria and long bones. Here we also detected expression of <italic>mZip14</italic> in both osteoclastic cell populations, but in osteoclasts derived from the calvaria we found an average 2-fold greater expression of <italic>mZip14</italic> in osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

First, in the control sample we did not find significant microscopic differences between the interna and externa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), but in the patient samples the interna is severely affected. The number of Haversian channels and osteocytes is significantly lower in the patient interna, compared to the externa and the cortex of the cervical vertebra of the patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). When we compare the externa of the patient with that of the control, the number of osteocytes was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0054) in the patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), although osteocyte distribution is comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Comparing the patient and controle internae, however, demonstrates that the patient interna is wider and characterized by a great and dense amount of well-organized bone, suggesting an increased bone formation or decreased bone resorption. Moreover, the number of Haversian channels (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0075) and the number of osteocytes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0042) are significantly lower in the patient interna, compared to interna of the control. Remarkably, the osteocytes in the patient interna appear grouped around the Haversian channels. Some osteocyte lacunae, especially further away from the Haversian channels, appear empty, suggesting osteocyte apoptosis. This was not seen in the patient externa or vertebral tissue or in the skull of the control.</p>

        <p>An <italic>in vivo</italic> model to study the effect of ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup> was generated by creating a floxed mutant Zip14 (Zip14<sup>flox</sup>) mouse model to express Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> ubiquitously (Sox2-Cre) or in specific cell types, i.e. osteoblasts (Runx2-Cre) and osteoclasts (CtsK-Cre). Breeding Zip14<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with Sox2-Cre mice demonstrated that ubiquitous expression of mutant Zip14 results in perinatal lethality.

The RANKL/OPG ratio of osteoclast knock-in mice was somewhat lower, due to a slight decrease in RANKL and increase in OPG.

        <title>ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup> increases cAMP-CREB and NFAT signaling</title>
        <p>Zip14 was previously linked to cAMP-CREB signaling [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To evaluate the effect of WT and L441R ZIP14 on the cAMP-CREB signaling activity, a luciferase reporter assay with a cAMP-responsive luciferase construct was applied. Here, overexpression of WT ZIP14 in HEK293T caused a decrease in cAMP-CREB signaling, whereas overexpression of L441R ZIP14 resulted in a significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) 5-fold increase in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). Next to cAMP-CREB signaling, ZIP14 has been associated with immune response and inflammation in the literature. We therefore checked both NF-ÎºB and NFAT signaling activity, due to their importance in bone cells and their association with inflammatory processes. No significant difference in NF-ÎºB signaling was observed between WT and L441R ZIP14, but NFAT signaling by L441R ZIP14 was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic> = 0.031) compared to WT ZIP14 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007321.g010">Fig 10</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Hyperostosis Cranialis Interna (HCI, OMIM 144755) was described in a Dutch family as a bone disorder that solely affects the calvaria and skull base through intracranial hyperostosis and osteosclerosis [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We performed a whole genome linkage analysis in the past and mapped the disorder to a region on chromosome 8 (8p21) [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study we additionally performed WES on one HCI patient which led to the identification of a heterozygous c.1322T&gt;G (p.L441R) substitution in the <italic>SLC39A14</italic> gene that co-segregates with the disorder. <italic>SLC39A14</italic> encodes a Zn transporter that belongs to the SLC39A or Zrt-, Irt-related protein (ZIP) family and is therefore often referred to as ZIP14. ZIP transporters invariably function by replenishing cytosolic Zn from the extracellular space and the lumen of intracellular compartments (influx) [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>ZIP14 has previously been localized to the plasma membrane and in the cytosol, in early and late endosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From here, ZIP14 mainly mobilizes Zn, but transport of other divalent cations (iron, manganese, cadmium) into the cytosol is also described [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We demonstrate that ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup> is still localized in the early and late endosomes, but loses its presence on the plasma membrane, implying trafficking defects of ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup>
<italic>in vitro</italic>. It is subsequently possible that ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup> is retained in the endosomes. Of note, patients with HCI have a heterozygous p.L441R substitution, indicating that fifty percent of ZIP14 is wildtype and reaches the plasma membrane (and early/late endosomes), whereas the other fifty percent will reasonably be trapped onto the endosomes. Consistent with the changes in localization, ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup> was not able to transport Zn from the extracellular space into the cell. Accumulation of labile Zn in the cell, however, was increased by ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup>, indicating an aberrant cellular Zn homeostasis. It is essential to note that the cellular localization of labile Zn excess is currently unknown and depends on transport capacity of ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup>. This is highly relevant as Zn generally plays a vital role in cells as it is estimated that about 10% of the human genome encodes proteins with Zn-binding sites. More than half of those are thought to be transcription factors and enzymes, distributed across the different cellular compartments. Local alterations in Zn homeostasis can therefore have significant effects on the functionality of corresponding Zn-dependent proteins and of cells, which could thus be the basis of the pathogenesis of HCI [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, mutations in <italic>SLC39A4</italic> (<italic>ZIP4</italic>) and <italic>SLC39A13</italic> (<italic>ZIP13</italic>) have been linked to Zn deficiency and/or accumulation in specific cellular compartments resulting in acrodermatitis enteropathica and spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>Next to aberrations in Zn homeostasis, it is important to note that mutations in <italic>ZIP14</italic> can affect manganese (Mn), cadmium and iron homeostasis as well. Recently, homozygous missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations in <italic>ZIP14</italic> were identified in patients with childhood-onset parkinsonism-dystonia, due to defects in Mn homeostasis [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These mutations were all part of transmembrane domains that are not predicted to form a pore (according to MemSatSVM), where our mutation is part of. The subcellular localization of all ZIP14 mutants in the study by Tuschl <italic>et al</italic>. were similar to that of wildtype ZIP14, Mn uptake was reduced and specifically accumulated in the brain of a mutant zebrafish model [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For our study, we focused on Zn as it is more relevant in skeletal homeostasis [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Zn is described to have a stimulatory role on osteoblastic bone formation and mineralization and an inhibitory effect on osteoclastic bone resorption [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and we demonstrated expression of <italic>ZIP14</italic> in osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Effects of ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup> on skeletal homeostasis were therefore investigated in conditional knock-in mice with expression of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> in osteoblasts or osteoclasts. First, femoral length (growth) was similar for all mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007321.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). This is relevant since Zn deficiency is generally associated with growth retardation (and other symptoms) [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice exhibit such phenotype marked by growth retardation and dwarfism [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As the role of Zip14 in growth was however attributed to its effects on the hypertrophy of chondrocytes, this could explain the normal growth in our osteoblast or osteoclast knock-in mice. Nevertheless, skeletal growth or height is not affected in patients with HCI as well. Since patients with HCI carry a heterozygous p.L441R mutation and <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice are phenotypically normal [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it could be that the wildtype allele fulfills a compensatory role and that growth defects in <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice are due to a general state of Zn deficiency. Moreover, it was documented that ZIP14 has roles in adipose tissue and glucose utilization that can influence growth of <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice as well [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>Knowing the long bones were affected by Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> in our conditional knock-in mice, we were surprised to see no calvarial phenotype as this is truly opposite of what we see in HCI patients. One aspect to be discussed here is the difference in expression of human <italic>ZIP14</italic><sup><italic>L441R</italic></sup> and murine <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup>. In HCI patients, endogenous <italic>ZIP14</italic> is expressed in its own spatiotemporal manner, whereas <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup> expression is driven by the Runx2 and Cathepsin K promoter in our conditional knock-in mice. Nevertheless, <italic>Cre</italic> expression was reported in long bones and calvariae of both Cre-models used in this study [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and overexpression of <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup> was confirmed in calvarial and long bone osteoblasts derived from Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007321.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Still, we analyzed the calvarial phenotype of <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice and found that loss of endogenous Zip14 did not affect the calvariae, even though the appendicular skeleton and vertebral column were osteoporotic. This suggests that aberrations in Zn homeostasis by Zip14 do not seem to affect calvariae of mice, even though the rest of the skeleton is affected. Whether this is due to a specific protective mechanism present in murine calvariae but not in humans, remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the calvariae, the appendicular skeleton and vertebral column were affected by knock-in of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Generally, knock-in of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> in osteoblasts resulted in a severe skeletal phenotype, whereas the skeletal phenotype in osteoclast knock-in mice was milder. Based on these findings, we conclude that osteoblasts are the primary cells through which mutant ZIP14 exerts its effects on bone homeostasis. Nevertheless, a remarkable finding was that both conditional knock-in models had an increased (endo)cortical bone formation rate. Additionally, osteoblast knock-in mice had an increased cortical thickness, where excessive endosteal bone formation even led to narrowing of the bone marrow cavity. Similarly, a study investigating the metabolic activity in the calvariae of HCI patients with <sup>18</sup>F-fluoride PET/CT depicted the highest rates of <sup>18</sup>F-fluoride uptake in the hyperostotic regions and more specifically at the endosteal side of the diploe (towards the bone marrow)[<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Bone overgrowth of the inner calvarial cortex of HCI patients is thus also the result of an increased endosteal bone formation. Therefore, even though the location of the skeletal defect is different, i.e. in the appendicular skeleton and vertebral column <italic>versus</italic> the calvaria, the (endo)cortical phenotype and the underlying cause of this are strikingly similar in Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> osteoblast knock-in mice and HCI patients.</p>
      <p>To further elucidate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> through osteoblasts, we focused on the fact that Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> has disparate effects on cortical and trabecular bone in Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice. These mice had an increased cortical thickness and narrowed bone marrow cavity along with a decreased trabecular bone volume. According to the literature, only few hormones and pathways have similar effects on the skeleton and these are parathyroid hormone (PTH)/parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP) and estrogen. Of note, Zip14 was previously associated with PTH1R-cAMP-CREB signaling in <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Pth</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and mice with osteoblast/osteocyte-specific G<sub>s</sub>Î± deficiency (BGsKO), bearing in mind that PTH mediates its effects through G<sub>s</sub>Î± signaling, have an increased cortical bone mass, decreased bone marrow cavity and a decreased trabecular bone mass in both models [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Albeit more severe, this phenotype has the same differential effects on bone as seen in our Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice. A contrasting skeletal phenotype is also seen in mice with PTH/PTHrP receptor overexpression in the osteoblastic lineage [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This suggests that the skeletal phenotype of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice resembles that of deficient or restrained PTH-signaling in osteoblasts.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that estrogen was not previously associated with Zip14, it exerts opposing actions on bone compared to PTH in osteoblasts and studies show that Zn has actions similar to estrogen on osteoblasts and osteoclasts [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Estrogen is generally known to restrain periosteal and stimulate endosteal bone formation during bone modeling and remodeling through osteoblast progenitors [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consequently, postmenopausal sex-steroid deficiency has been associated with an enlargement of the marrow cavity, thinning of the cortex and slight increase in midshaft diameter [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice, on the contrary, have a smaller midshaft diameter, due to a restricted periosteal bone formation, along with a thicker cortex and narrowed bone marrow cavity, resulting from a stimulated endosteal bone formation. Moreover, estrogen has protective effects on the resorption of both trabecular and cortical bone, but these are exerted by disparate cell types, i.e. by direct effects on osteoclasts and indirect effects on osteoblasts, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A possible explanation for the trabecular phenotype of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice is that by sole osteoblastic expression of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup>, there is no protective (estrogen-mimicking) effect on the resorption of trabecular bone. Another important hint for a role of estrogen-like signaling by mutant ZIP14 was found in clinical reports on the disease progression of HCI patients. Female patients exhibit sudden aggravation of HCI symptoms during pregnancy, like abrupt loss of smell or hearing, of which they sometimes recovered after pregnancy. Furthermore, female patients are often more severely, albeit not significant, affected by HCI [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As mentioned in the introduction, radiological abnormalities associated with HCI are often seen in the first decade of life and a slow progression of the disease can be seen until the age of 40 [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Altogether, these stages in life share critical changes in estrogen levels, i.e. estrogen gain associated with puberty and pregnancy and estrogen loss associated with aging-related sex-steroid deficiency. We therefore hypothesize that an increased estrogen production is comparable to the estrogen-mimicking effects of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup>, resulting in aggravation of symptoms in (female) HCI patients.</p>
      <p>Finally, we aimed at identifying possible downstream mechanisms or second messengers through which ZIP14 mediates its effects by osteoblasts. Zip14 was previously shown to play an important role in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling by importing Zn into the cytosol and maintaining basal cAMP levels [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We detected a 5-fold increase in cAMP levels in Saos-2 cells transfected with ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup>. Cyclic AMP is a well-known second messenger for several hormones, like PTH/PTHrP [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> expression in osteoblasts did not result in a PTH-mimicking skeletal phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, not to say that it led to a PTH-contrasting phenotype. In the literature, the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is documented to act predominantly intracellularly and stimulate cAMP production, calcium mobilization and c-Src. GPER is described to play a role in the reproductive system, nervous system and neuroendocrinology, immune system, cardiovascular system, pancreatic function and glucose metabolism and bone growth and chondrocyte metabolism [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Remarkably, <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice are characterized by impaired gluconeogenesis, hyperinsulinemic/diabetic pancreatic islets, chronic inflammation state, osteopenia and growth retardation [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Next, since <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice have a proinflammatory phenotype with increased systemic interleukin-6 (Il-6) levels that are coincident with a decrease in BMD [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we also investigated NFAT signaling activity by ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup>. We demonstrated a doubled NFAT signaling activity in Saos-2 cells by ZIP14<sup>L441R</sup>. NFAT signaling in osteoblasts has been linked to the production of chemoattractants (TNF-Î±, IL-6) to attract osteoclast progenitors and hence increase osteoclast numbers, as seen in Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice (with normal RANKL/OPG ratio). qRT-PCR analysis indeed confirmed a significant higher expression of <italic>Il-6</italic> and <italic>Tnf</italic> in osteoblasts derived from the long bones of Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> Ob-KI mice, compared to long bone control osteoblasts. This difference in expression was not detected in calvarial osteoblasts, where no skeletal phenotype is present. We therefore believe that NFAT signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines by Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> in osteoblasts is also essential in the development of the skeletal pathology. Finally, GPER activation is also linked to increased intracellular calcium mobilization, which is known to bind activators of NFAT [<xref rid="pgen.1007321.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our overall hypothesis therefore is that mutant Zip14 increases intracellular Zn levels, GPER signaling and cAMP-CREB and NFAT activity from the intracellular organelle where it resides, with estrogen-mimicking effects on osteoblasts.</p>
      <p>Although we are convinced that we identified <italic>ZIP14</italic> as disease causing gene for HCI and a putative underlying pathological mechanism, a major unresolved question is the exclusive skull phenotype of these patients. Here, ZIP14, along with numerous other Zn transporters and Zn-dependent proteins, define a local and spatiotemporal micro-environment and, for some reason, only that of the internal cortex of HCI patients calvariae results in severe bone overgrowth. Whether this is due to a specific deficit in the skeletal cells of the calvariae or fortunate differences in the expression pattern of compensatory mechanisms in the rest of the skeleton, remains to be determined in the future by performing RNA sequencing and a proteomic analysis, for example.</p>

Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in 35mm glass bottom dishes coated with poly-D-lysine (MatTek Corporation). HEK293T cells were transfected with WT, L441R or W22X ZIP14-GFP constructs using Fugene 6 (Promega) in a 3:1 ratio (Fugene 6:DNA). As the mutation in HCI patients is dominant, a heterozygous model was created by co-transfecting WT and L441R ZIP14-GFP. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with methanol, washed with PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), incubated with UltraCruz Blocking Reagent (sc-516214, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes and washed PBS. Specific staining of the Golgi apparatus and early and late endosomes was obtained by first using monoclonal IgG<sub>1</sub> antibodies targeting golgin-97 (sc-59820, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:300 dilution), EEA1 (sc-137130, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100 dilution) and Rab7 (sc-376362, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200 dilution), respectively. Then, after washing with PBS, a mouse IgG kappa binding protein (m-IgGÎº BP) conjugated to CruzFluor 555 (sc-516177, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100 dilution) was used to provide a specific fluorescent signal. Fluorescent staining of the plasma membrane was performed by incubating the fixed HEK293T cells with 1Î¼g/mL tetramethylrhodamine conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 minutes and washed with PBS. Vectashield antifade mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories) was used to preserve fluorescence and to stain the nucleus. High resolution images were obtained using an Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon) attached to a dual spinning disk confocal system (UltraVIEW VoX; PerkinElmer) equipped with 405, 488 and 561nm diode lasers for excitation of blue, green and red fluorophores, respectively. Images were acquired and processed using Volocity 6.0.1 software (PerkinElmer).</p>

        <title>Generation of a mouse model for HCI</title>
        <p>The mutated leucine at amino acid position 441 in ZIP14 of HCI patients is highly conserved in mice and corresponds to mL438 in both isoforms of mZip14 (NP_001128624.1; NP_659057.2). As no difference in function between both isoforms was reported, wildtype full length mZip14 cDNA corresponding to NP_001128624.1 cloned in a pCMV6-Entry vector was obtained from OriGene Technologies (MC216777). The mutation resulting in the p.L438R substitution was inserted using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). This construct was sent to genOway (France) to create a mouse model with <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup> through targeted insertion within the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. A <italic>lox</italic>P-flanked transcriptional STOP cassette is incorporated between <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup> and a CAG promoter to allow the expression of <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup> to be dependent upon the Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007321.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).

          <title>Generation and genotyping of a floxed Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> mouse model.</title>
          <p><bold>(A)</bold> A mouse model with floxed Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> was generated through targeted insertion within the ROSA26 locus. A loxP-flanked transcriptional STOP cassette is incorporated between Zip14<sup>L438R</sup> and its CAG promoter to allow the expression of the resulting transgene to be dependent upon the Cre recombinase. <bold>(B)</bold> A first PCR for genotyping (left) is to detect the Zip14<sup>flox</sup> and Cre-mediated excised (Zip14<sup>L438R</sup>) locus, with amplicons of 3428bp and 410bp in size, respectively, whereas the wildtype allele gives no amplification. A second PCR (right) is performed to distinguish homozygous Zip14<sup>flox/flox</sup> (998bp), heterozygous Zip14<sup>flox/-</sup> or Zip14<sup>L438R/-</sup> (998bp + 304bp) and homozygous wildtype (304bp) mice. <bold>(C)</bold> Sanger sequencing was performed to verify <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>L438R</italic></sup> (c.1535 T&gt;G) overexpression in cDNA of primary osteoblasts derived from calvariae and long bones of <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup><italic>; Runx2-Cre</italic> mice. As these mice also express endogenous <italic>Zip14</italic>, a low wildtype (T-base) signal can be noted in both osteoblast types as well. <bold>(D)</bold> Femoral length and body weight of 6-month old <italic>Zip14</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup>
