      <abstract>
        <p>The transport activity of human mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers is central to the malateâaspartate shuttle, urea cycle, gluconeogenesis and myelin synthesis. They have a unique three-domain structure, comprising a calcium-regulated N-terminal domain with eight EF-hands, a mitochondrial carrier domain, and a C-terminal domain. Here we present the calcium-bound and calcium-free structures of the N- and C-terminal domains, elucidating the mechanism of calcium regulation. Unexpectedly, EF-hands 4â8 are involved in dimerization of the carrier and form a static unit, whereas EF-hands 1â3 form a calcium-responsive mobile unit. On calcium binding, an amphipathic helix of the C-terminal domain binds to the N-terminal domain, opening a vestibule. In the absence of calcium, the mobile unit closes the vestibule. Opening and closing of the vestibule might regulate access of substrates to the carrier domain, which is involved in their transport. These structures provide a framework for understanding cases of the mitochondrial disease citrin deficiency.</p>

    <p>The mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers import glutamate together with a proton into the mitochondrial matrix and export aspartate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The transport step was discovered more than 45 years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, but it was another 30 years before the molecular identity was established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The transport protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family and plays a central role in several important ubiquitous and tissue-specific processes. In humans there are two isoforms, which are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern; aralar (SLC25A12 or AGC1) is predominately expressed in excitable tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and citrin (SLC25A13 or AGC2) in non-excitable tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The aspartate/glutamate carriers play a key role in the operation of the malateâaspartate shuttle, which is required for the import of reducing equivalents into the mitochondrion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In addition, they are crucial for the supply of mitochondrial aspartate to the cytosol. In liver, cytosolic aspartate is required for the urea cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, which is crucial for the production of urea from the deamination of amino acids. Cytosolic aspartate is also required for the conversion of oxoglutarate to oxaloacetate, a crucial step in gluconeogenesis from lactate and alanine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In neurons, aralar catalyses the efflux of aspartate required for the production of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-aspartate for the synthesis of myelin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Mutations in the <italic>SLC25A12</italic> and <italic>SLC25A13</italic> genes cause global cerebral hypomyelination (OMIM: 603667)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and citrin deficiency (OMIM: 603859)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, affecting myelin synthesis and the urea cycle, respectively.</p>
    <p>Following the identification of the genes, analysis of the molecular features showed that the transporters are calcium-regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Unlike other members of the mitochondrial carrier family, the aspartate/glutamate carriers have a three-domain structure, consisting of a hydrophilic N-terminal domain with EF-hand motifs, a mitochondrial carrier domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and a C-terminal domain of unknown function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The N-terminal domain has been proposed to contain eight EF-hand motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> that have sequence identities of 25â30% to other calcium-binding proteins, and it has been demonstrated to bind calcium by <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-overlay experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Proteolysis experiments with proteinase K in the brain and liver mitoplasts have shown that the N-terminal domain protrudes into the intermembrane space, providing binding sites for extra-mitochondrial calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Binding of calcium leads to the stimulation of the transport activity and consequently the malate-aspartate shuttle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. It has been suggested that the N-terminal domains of aralar and citrin are dissimilar, as reflected in differences in the calcium sensitivity of upregulation and in the putative numbers of functional EF-hands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The carrier domain, which accounts solely for the transport activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, shares 20â30% sequence identity with other members of the mitochondrial carrier family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and is anticipated to adopt a similar structure to the bovine and yeast ADP/ATP carriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The yeast ADP/ATP carrier is structurally monomeric in the membrane and in detergent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and functions as a monomer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The bovine orthologue has also been shown to be structurally monomeric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. On the basis of related protein properties, other mitochondrial carriers are likely to be monomeric in structure and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The C-terminal domain has been suggested to be an extra transmembrane helix of the carrier domain on the basis of its hydrophobic nature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here we present X-ray structures of the regulatory domains of the aspartate/glutamate carriers in calcium-bound and calcium-free conformations. The regulatory domains consist of eight EF-hands in a unique arrangement resembling an arch. Surprisingly, the aspartate/glutamate carriers dimerize via EF-hands 4â8 of the N-terminal domain, which have evolved from their canonical function of calcium binding to form a large and static dimerization interface. Out of the eight EF-hands, only EF-hand 2 is involved in calcium binding in both citrin and aralar. In the calcium-bound state, an amphipathic helix of the C-terminal domain binds to a hydrophobic groove in the N-terminal domain, opening a vestibule for the substrates to enter the carrier domain. In the calcium-free state EF-hands 1â2 close the hydrophobic groove with the loop between EF-hands 2 and 3 being the bending region, sealing the vestibule. On the basis of these observations we propose a mechanism by which calcium binding regulates the transport activity of the aspartate/glutamate carriers.</p>

        <title>Human mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers are dimeric</title>
        <p>The two human isoforms citrin (74âkDa) and aralar (75âkDa) are 77% identical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), and have the same three-domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). They consist of an N-terminal domain with eight predicted EF-hand motifs (citrin residues 1â319, 36âkDa), a carrier domain (citrin residues 320â612, 32âkDa) and a C-terminal domain (citrin residues 613â675, 6âkDa). Citrin was purified in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), and its mass was determined by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Surprisingly, the protein was found to have a mass of 147.7Â±1.7âkDa, twice the theoretical mass of 74âkDa, demonstrating that the full-length carrier was dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This result was unexpected, as other mitochondrial carriers are monomeric, based on their sequence properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and functional features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. To determine which domain was involved in dimerization, each was purified in isolation and assessed by SEC-MALLS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2bâf</xref>). It was not possible to determine accurately the mass of the carrier domain in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, as the protein was partially aggregated, but the majority was monomeric (39.9Â±1.4âkDa). The carrier domain was monodisperse in dodecyl-maltoside and had a mass of 36.3Â±0.5âkDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), similar to the calculated mass of 32âkDa and to carboxyatractyloside-inhibited Aac2p, which is known to be monomeric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). The results show that the carrier domain in isolation is monomeric. Thus, the dimerization of the full-length carrier is mediated via the N- and/or C-terminal domain. It was not possible to express and purify the N-terminal domain of citrin on its own. The carrier domain has a similar topology to other mitochondrial carriers, consisting of six transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Thus, the N- and C-terminal domains are both in the intermembrane space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, as shown experimentally for the N-terminal domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The N-terminal domain ends at the first helix of the carrier domain, whereas the C-terminal domain starts on the sixth helix of the carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which are adjacent structurally, as shown for the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. A fusion protein was engineered, which mimics this arrangement by linking the two domains via a TEV protease cleavage sequence. The N- and C-terminal domain fusion of citrin and aralar were expressed, purified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>), and assessed by SEC-MALLS. The masses of the domain fusions of citrin and aralar were 80.9Â±0.8âkDa and 82.0Â±0.9âkDa, respectively, twice the theoretical mass, demonstrating that the fusion proteins were dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). The N-terminal domain of aralar on its own could be expressed and purified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), and was shown to be 65.3Â±0.3âkDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), also a dimer. Taken together these results show that the N-terminal domains mediate the dimerization of the full-length aspartate/glutamate carriers.</p>

        <title>Architecture of the N- and C-terminal domain fusion of citrin</title>
        <p>To determine the molecular basis for dimerization and calcium regulation, we crystallized the N- and C-terminal domain fusion of citrin and solved the structure to 2.4âÃ resolution, with phases determined by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS). The statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and a representative stereo view of the experimental density map is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>. The structure demonstrates that the N-terminal domains of two protomers form a twofold symmetrical homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Each protomer consists of eight EF-hand motifs, which form an arch in a novel EF-hand arrangement. EF-hands 4â8 have evolved to form the extensive dimerization interface, whereas EF-hands 1â3 are located on the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Only EF-hand 2 binds calcium, as shown by anomalous difference Fourier maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>An additional helical feature was present in the electron density map, which was unambiguously assigned to residues 632â658 from the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). This helix is only found in the aspartate/glutamate carriers and was previously predicted to be part of the carrier domain, based on hydropathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, the structure shows that the C-terminal helix is amphipathic and is wedged into a hydrophobic groove in the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Gly638 to Lys641 form a turn of 3<sub>10</sub> helix, whereas Leu642 to Phe654 form a regular Î±-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The C-terminal domain adopts a loop conformation on either side of the helix. A large number of hydrophobic contacts involving highly conserved residues are responsible for the interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), and networks of aromatic residues at both ends of the C-terminal helix stabilize the interaction; Tyr640 forms an aromatic stacking arrangement with Phe78 and lies within 4âÃ of Phe40, Tyr44 and Phe81, whereas Phe654 forms an edge-on stacking arrangement with Phe92. Hydrogen bonds and one salt-bridge are also involved in the interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Most of these are found at the N-terminal end of the C-terminal domain, where Pro634, Asp635, His636, Tyr640 and Gly639 form hydrogen bonds with Glu16 (water-mediated), Tyr24, Tyr44, Phe78 and Glu82, respectively. Asp635 also forms a salt bridge to Lys23. The C-terminal end has one water-mediated hydrogen bond between Asn652 and His193. Thus, the C-terminal helix is bound tightly to EF-hands 1 and 2, principally via its N-terminal region.</p>
        <p>The linker of the purified fusion protein was cleaved in solution with TEV protease, and in the presence of calcium the resulting products ran as one species on a size exclusion column, indicating that the N- and C-terminal domains were bound together in a stable conformation in agreement with the structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). The interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains are likely to be conserved in aralar, as most of the interacting residues are present except for the equivalent residue to Lys23 (Gln22), which may form a hydrogen bond with Asp634, replacing the salt bridge interaction between Lys23-Asp635 in citrin.</p>

        <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free structures of the aralar N-terminal domain</title>
        <p>To obtain insight into the molecular mechanism of calcium regulation, we tried to solve a structure of the N- and C-terminal domain fusion of citrin in the calcium-free state. Crystals were soaked in the chelating agent or the fusion protein was purified in the presence of chelating agents before crystallisation trials, but calcium-free structures were not obtained. When the TEV cleavage site linker was cleaved in the presence of calcium-chelating agents EGTA and EDTA, the two domains did not separate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), likely because of the large number of interactions at the N-terminal region of the C-terminal domain that bind the C-terminal domain tightly to EF-hands 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We reasoned that removal of the C-terminal helix might be required to allow transition from the calcium-bound to the calcium-free state. As the N-terminal domain of citrin alone could not be expressed, we purified the N-terminal domain of aralar. Crystals were obtained in the presence of calcium as well as in the presence of chelating agents. Data sets were collected from single crystals to 2.3 and 2.4âÃ, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The structure of citrin was used to determine the structure of the calcium-bound state of the N-terminal domain of aralar by molecular replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In turn, the calcium-bound structure of aralar was used to determine that of the calcium-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The N-terminal domain of aralar shares the same overall architecture with citrin, consisting of eight EF-hands per protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). EF-hands 4â8 of aralar are in a very similar position to those of citrin, whereas EF-hands 1â3 are in a similar position in the calcium-bound state, but not in the calcium-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the calcium-free state of aralar, the hydrophobic groove that binds the C-terminal helix in the calcium-bound state of citrin is absent. In this region extra density was found, which was assigned to a loop of residues 296â308 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The loop links the N-terminal domain to the carrier domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and we have named it the âlinker loopâ. A simulated annealing omit map was calculated, confirming the position of the linker loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). There is density for parts of the linker loop in both protomers of the regulatory domain dimer, but in only one was the density sufficient for modeling. It has been postulated that this region could be part of a non-functional EF-hand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, but this is not the case. In the calcium-bound state of aralar, in which there is no C-terminal helix in the construct, there is no density for the linker loop, indicating that it is not bound to this region in this state. In the citrin structure, the C-terminal helix is bound, and thus binding of the linker loop to the same site would be excluded. The density map shows that the linker loop takes a different direction, but the density was insufficient for modelling.</p>
        <p>Interactions between the linker loop and the rest of the N-terminal domain involve hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds mediated predominantly by backbone amideâbackbone carbonyl interactions between residues Ala296, Leu300, Asn303, Ala305 and Glu306, and residues Pro294, His192, Tyr47, Gly45 and Leu44, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Molecular basis of calcium binding</title>
        <p>As calcium-bound and calcium-free structures were available, we could analyse the molecular nature of state-dependent calcium binding. On the basis of the relative angles of the EF-hand Î±-helices, EF-hands 4, 5 and 6 are in a closed conformation, whereas EF-hands 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 are in an open conformation in all structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, in the calcium-bound state only EF-hand 2 binds calcium, as shown by anomalous difference Fourier maps of citrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
        <p>In all structures, EF-hand 1 differs from canonical EF-hands and resembles those found in the S100 protein family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The calcium-binding loop of EF-hand 1 has an insertion of three extra amino acids and contains a short two-stranded antiparallel Î²-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,d</xref>). EF-hand 1 does not bind calcium in either of the calcium-bound states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>) in contrast to earlier predictions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and thus it is not directly involved in the regulation of the aspartate/glutamate carrier.</p>
        <p>In the calcium-bound state of citrin, EF-hand 2 binds calcium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), which is coordinated in a pentagonal monopyramidal arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The distances of calcium to the six ligands are between 2.3â2.4âÃ, similar to the canonical coordination geometry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In the calcium-bound state of aralar, EF-hand 2 binds calcium in a pentagonal bipyramidal manner with the seventh contact point provided by water. In the calcium-free state of aralar no calcium ion is present in EF-hand 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Interestingly, release of calcium from EF-hand 2 did not change the relative orientations of helices Î±3 and Î±4, as frequently observed in EF-hand-containing proteins. Hence, the calcium-free state has a âpreformedâ EF-hand, ready for calcium binding, potentially reducing the entropic cost. This arrangement has been observed for other EF-hands and might explain the high affinity for calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
        <p>In citrin, EF-hand 3 was predicted to be non-functional<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and indeed no calcium was present in the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Instead EF-hand 3 binds an ordered water molecule and is stabilized by multiple hydrogen bonds. A similar arrangement is found in the calcium-bound and calcium-free states of aralar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). It has been suggested previously that EF-hand 3 of aralar binds calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, but the molecular arrangement shows that this is not the case. The 12th residue of the calcium chelation loop has an asparagine residue rather than a negatively charged aspartate or glutamate residue, which is required for the bidentate side-chain ligation of calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
        <p>EF-hands 4â8 do not bind calcium either, but they have evolved to form an extensive dimerization interface. The helical arrangement of EF-hands 4, 5 and 6 is in a closed conformation, whereas 7 and 8 are in an open configuration. Similar to calmodulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, the exiting helix of EF-hand 4 is fused to the entering helix of 5, and likewise EF-hand 6 is fused to EF-hand 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a,b</xref>). It has been suggested that EF-hand 5 of aralar chelates calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, but it is in a closed conformation in all three structures and is involved in dimerization. Thus, EF-hands 4â8 are not involved in calcium binding.</p>

        <title>EF-hands 4â8 form the static unit of the N-terminal domain</title>
        <p>All three structures are homodimeric (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), consistent with the SEC-MALLS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1bâe</xref>). The structure of the dimerization interface, formed by EF-hands 4â8 of the N-terminal domain, is very similar in all three crystal forms (RMSD of the calcium-bound state of aralar and citrin: 0.93âÃ, RMSD of the calcium-free state of aralar and citrin: 0.83âÃ). The extensive dimerization interface in citrin covers a buried surface area of 2,200âÃ<sup>2</sup> per monomer (14% of the solvent-accessible surface), and is stabilized by 17 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). In the calcium-bound and calcium-free states of aralar, the dimerization interface covers a buried surface area of ~1,800âÃ<sup>2</sup> (12%) and 2,000âÃ<sup>2</sup> (15%) per protomer, respectively. In the calcium-bound state of aralar the interaction is stabilized by 14 hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), whereas in the calcium-free state there are 17 hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). The hydrogen bonds formed by side-chains are conserved between the calcium-bound states of citrin and aralar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>).</p>
        <p>A comparison of the dimerization interfaces of the calcium-bound and calcium-free states of aralar reveal only two changes in the hydrogen bonds formed by side-chain interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b,c</xref>). In the calcium-bound state residue Gln152 (Gln153 in citrin) forms hydrogen bonds to residues Thr264 (Thr265) and Glu267 (Glu268). In the calcium-free state Gln152 forms a hydrogen bond to Thr264, but the interaction to Glu267 is absent as a result of subtle movements. The other difference is that in the calcium-free state a hydrogen bond is formed between Asn228 of EF-hand 6 and Gln262 of EF-hand 7 of two protomers. In the calcium-bound state there is no density for the side-chain of Gln262, indicating that it is not interacting. Instead, the Asn228 side chain forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen of Gln262 within a protomer. Overall, the analysis indicates that the dimer formed by EF-hands 4â8 is largely static except for small movements in EF-hands 6â8 in response to calcium binding.</p>

        <title>EF-hands 1â2 form the mobile unit of the N-terminal domain</title>
        <p>Superimposition of EF-hands 4â8 of the calcium-bound state of citrin and the calcium-free state of aralar reveals a striking conformational change in which EF-hands 1â2 are involved in a rigid-body rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). The transition from the calcium-bound state to the calcium-free state involves a rotation of the unit of EF-hands 1â2 by ~47 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), with the rotation axis oriented between EF-hands 2 and 3. The bending region, corresponding to residues 82 (aralar) or 83 (citrin), is located on the C-terminal side of helix Î±4, close to the loop linking EF-hands 2 and 3. Once closed, the loop between EF-hands 1 and 2 (Tyr47, Ser52, Asn51, Asn53 and Lys55) interacts with residues in the loop between EF-hands 3 and 4 (Thr118, Ile119, His121) and the loop between EF-hands 4 and 5 (Thr188 and Ser191, which lie at a turn of 3<sub>10</sub> helix). As a consequence, a cavity in the regulatory domain closes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Comparison of calcium-free and calcium-bound aralar structures confirms the nature of the conformational change with EF-hands 1â2 rotating by 42 degrees, and with the rotation axis and bending region lying in a similar position.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have presented structures of the regulatory domains of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers citrin and aralar. In both cases the regulatory domain is the site of calcium regulation, which leads to the stimulation of the malate-aspartate shuttle in the presence of calcium and a return to basal activity of the shuttle in the absence of calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The SEC-MALLS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) and structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) show that the carriers form homodimers mediated only by the N-terminal domains. The striking aspect is that many EF-hand folds of this domain have evolved away from their canonical calcium-binding functions to provide a platform for dimerization. The carrier domains alone do not dimerize and thus they are likely to function independently, held together by the N-terminal domains. The twofold symmetry axis of the N-terminal domain dimer is likely to be perpendicular to the membrane, meaning that only two possible orientations relative to the carrier domains need to be considered. There are several arguments that favour the orientation in which the ridge formed by EF-hands 1â3 is facing the water phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). First, the ridge is highly negatively charged making it unlikely to face the membrane. Second, the binding site in EF-hand 2 would be accessible to calcium ions in the water phase. Third, in the calcium-bound state a cavity opens in the regulatory domain, which in the proposed orientation would lie proximal to the carrier domain, acting as a vestibule to allow access of the substrates. Fourth, in the absence of calcium the mobile unit of EF-hands 1â2 moves downwards as well as inwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). It is most likely that this motion is directed towards the carrier domain.</p>
      <p>There are no large movements of EF-hands 4â8 when the calcium-bound and calcium-free structures are compared, indicating that this unit is largely static. Dimerization might be required to form a rigid framework against which the conformational changes involving the mobile unit can take place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Our structures demonstrate that EF-hands 1 and 2 form the calcium-responsive mobile unit, which is consistent with several other observations. Deletion of EF-hand 1 in citrin was shown to result in a complete loss of calcium-binding capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, whereas specific mutations introduced in EF-hands 1 and 2 of aralar abolished the stimulation of the malateâaspartate shuttle by calcium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Both aralar and citrin bind calcium only via EF-hand 2, which has the correct molecular arrangement for calcium coordination. Thus, structurally there is no difference between aralar and citrin with respect to calcium regulation.</p>
      <p>The structure of citrin shows that in the calcium-bound state the C-terminal helix is bound to the N-terminal domain. Since it was a fusion protein, one could argue that the observed binding of the C-terminal helix to the N-terminal domain is an artefact. There are several compelling arguments against this notion. First, the unstructured flexible loop (not resolved in the crystal structures) that links the carrier domain to the C-terminal helix is 28-amino-acids long (a distance of about 100âÃ). Thus, the C-terminal helix is not restrained by the fusion and would be free to bind anywhere on the surface of the N-terminal domain. However, the helix was clearly resolved in the electron density map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), showing that it was binding consistently to the same site with high occupancy. Second, many conserved interactions are involved in the binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), and the C-terminal domain remains bound to the N-terminal domain after cleavage at the TEV protease site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Third, the groove is composed of conserved hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>), which would be highly unusual for a water accessible surface, but entirely compatible with binding the amphipathic C-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). The properties of the hydrophobic groove and amphipathic helix point therefore to an important functional feature. The calcium-dependent binding of an amphipathic helix to a hydrophobic groove is used for the binding of extrinsic target proteins by calmodulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and the S100 proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and it appears that a similar mechanism operates here. In the case of the aspartate/glutamate carriers, the functional elements of this conserved mechanism have been separated by insertion of the carrier domain, providing a new application of calcium regulation by EF-hand-containing proteins.</p>
      <p>In the calcium-free state of aralar the linker loop is bound in the same area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). In the calcium-bound state of citrin weak density for the linker loop is found in a different position, indicating that the loop is mobile and follows a different path.</p>
      <p>Combining all of these elements we propose a mechanism of calcium regulation of mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers. At increased calcium levels, the regulatory domain undergoes calcium-dependent conformational changes in which EF-hands 1â2 move to expose a hydrophobic binding site for the binding of the amphipathic Î±-helix of the C-terminal domain, excluding the binding of the linker loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). As a consequence, a vestibule opens through which a glutamate and proton can enter the carrier domain to trigger the conformational changes required for the translocation of the substrates. The calcium-induced interaction of the N-terminal domain with the C-terminal helix could therefore result in the upregulation of transport. In the absence of calcium, the mobile unit of EF-hands 1â2 closes the hydrophobic groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The role of the linker loop is tentative, especially since its sequence is not strictly conserved, but it could function to seal the remaining gap. In the calcium-free state the C-terminal helix stays bound to the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), poised to bind again to the hydrophobic site in the calcium-bound state. As a consequence of the motion, the vestibule closes, which may prevent substrates from entering the carrier domain. The structures were generated in the presence of high concentrations of calcium or chelating agents, and the protomers are in the same state. However, it is possible that under physiological conditions the two protomers of the dimer could act independently. The model we propose is an onâoff mechanism for the protomer, which is compatible with observations of physiological activity describing a basal transport activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, as they deal with regulation of carriers on the population level.</p>
      <p>The urea cycle is dependent on the export of aspartate from the mitochondrion by the aspartate/glutamate carrier. Mutations in the <italic>SLC25A13</italic> gene lead to metabolic diseases caused by an impaired urea cycle, collectively called citrin deficiency. There are three age-dependent disease phenotypesâneonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) in newborns, failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD) in young children and citrullinemia type 2 (CTNL2) with childhood to adult onset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Citrin deficiency is considered a panethnic disorder with the highest estimated frequencies of 1 in 17,000 for NICCD to 1 in 230,000 for CTNL2 in the East Asian population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Symptoms range from cholestasis and multiple aminoacidemia in NICCD to recurrent encephalopathy and hyperammonemia in CTNL2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). The NICCD symptoms often diminish by the first year, but in some cases patients develop CTNL2 later in life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. CTNL2 is effectively treated by liver transplantation, but, if left untreated, brain edema a few years later results in death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutations causing CTNL2 in <italic>SLC25A13</italic> were first identified 15 years ago and individuals are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for citrin deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Since then, 83 mutations causing citrin deficiency have been identified, of which six missense mutations are found in the regulatory domain of citrin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We have mapped all six onto the structure of the regulatory domain of citrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), providing a structural framework for the interpretation of the effect of these mutations.</p>
      <p>Residue Ala25 in EF-hand 1, which is mutated to glutamate in NICCD, is conserved among aspartate/glutamate carriers and is part of an extensive network of polar interactions involving EF-hand 1 as well as contacts between the N- and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). An introduction of a large and negatively charged residue may affect this network. Western blot analysis of fibroblast cultures of patients carrying the A25E mutation on both alleles showed that there was no difference in protein levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, indicating that this mutation affects function rather than biogenesis of the protein.</p>
      <p>Leu85 is part of the exiting helix of EF-hand 2 and in one case has been mutated to proline (NICCD). Sequence alignments show a preference for leucine at that position, but isoleucine and methionine are also tolerated. A western blot analysis of a liver biopsy of the patients carrying a compound heterozygous mutation (E601K and L85P) demonstrated that citrin was absent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The introduction of a proline residue in helix 4 of EF-hand 2 could truncate the helix, which is likely to be detrimental to the protein structure.</p>
      <p>Residues Gly139 and Gly176 are conserved and present in the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Mutations G139R (NICCD) and G176V (NICCD) introduce a large positively charged or hydrophobic residue into a tightly packed dimerization interface, which might lead to disruption of the dimer, which according to our model will significantly affect activity.</p>
      <p>Tyr148, which is mutated to cysteine in CTNL2, forms a hydrogen bond with conserved Asp89 in the loop region between EF-hands 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). In the calcium-free state of aralar Tyr147 (the equivalent residue to Tyr148) forms an additional hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group of Asp88. The Y148C mutation would eliminate the hydrogen bond and might affect both states. Glu252, which in NICCD is mutated to lysine, forms a hydrogen bond to its own backbone nitrogen and to the hydroxyl group of conserved Thr250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). E252K would disrupt the hydrogen bond and may lead to the loss of structural integrity in this region. With these structures we begin to understand the molecular basis of these mitochondrial pathologies.</p>

        <title>Purification of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound N-terminal domain of aralar</title>
        <p>Initially, a fusion of the N- and C-terminal domains of aralar was designed by using residues 2â317 of the N-terminal domain and residues 611â678 of the C-terminal domain of aralar (Uniprot: O75746) linked via a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQG).

Intensities were integrated using XDS, and merged and scaled using Aimless. Data collection statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>Phases were initially determined by molecular replacement using the calcium-bound aralar structure, truncated at residue 92 (removing EF-hands 1 and 2) and with non-protein atoms removed, as a search model. Phaser found a single solution with two copies in the asymmetric unit and a final log-likelihood gain of 1226. Refinement of the MR solution in Refmac with jelly-body restraints led to a significant drop in R-factors (<italic>R</italic> dropped from 44.7 to 36.6%, and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> from 44.1 to 39.6%). The conformation of the N-terminal region of the search model, including EF-hand 3, was clearly different compared with the calcium-bound state, and difference density was observed for EF-hands 1 and 2, particularly for chain B. Phenix.autobuild was used to rebuild and extend the preliminary model, using Resolve for density modification and Buccaneer for model building. The resulting model included EF-hands 1 and 2 for chain B, with <italic>R</italic>=27.1% and <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub>=33.4%. Iterative cycles of model building in Coot and refinement in Phenix.refine resulted in a final model with <italic>R</italic>=24.52%, <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub>=29.66%. The electron density maps of the calcium-free state contain a minor residual density in EF-hand 2, which is insufficient for a calcium ion. Refinement with calcium modelled in this density leads to an unacceptably high B-factor (520âÃ<sup>2</sup> compared to 80â100âÃ<sup>2</sup> for the surrounding atoms), instead a water molecule or a small ion, such as sodium, is likely to bind. Chains A and B of the calcium-free structure have different crystal contacts, yet adopt the same conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>), indicating that the proposed conformational changes are not the consequence of crystal packing. The linker loop is modelled only in chain B. The model was validated using Molprobity. The Ramachandran plot has 97.7% of protein residues in the favoured region and 0.4% outliers, and the model has a Molprobity clashscore of 3.26 and an overall Molprobity score of 1.19.</p>

On calcium binding the mobile sub-domain of EF-hands 1â2 moves to open up a hydrophobic groove in which the Î±-helix of the C-terminal domain (wheat) binds.

The conformational changes may limit access of the substrates to the carrier domain. The substrate-binding site is shown as a hexagon.</p>
