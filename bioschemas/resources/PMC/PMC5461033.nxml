      <abstract>
        <p>Mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites export a variety of cargo molecules including oversized cargoes such as collagens. However, the mechanisms of their assembly and organization are not fully understood. TANGO1L is characterized as a collagen receptor, but the function of TANGO1S remains to be investigated. Here, we show that direct interaction between both isoforms of TANGO1 and Sec16 is not only important for their correct localization but also critical for the organization of ER exit sites. The depletion of TANGO1 disassembles COPII components as well as membrane-bound ER-resident complexes, resulting in fewer functional ER exit sites and delayed secretion. The ectopically expressed TANGO1 C-terminal domain responsible for Sec16 binding in mitochondria is capable of recruiting Sec16 and other COPII components. Moreover, TANGO1 recruits membrane-bound macromolecular complexes consisting of cTAGE5 and Sec12 to the ER exit sites. These data suggest that mammalian ER exit sites are organized by TANGO1 acting as a scaffold, in cooperation with Sec16 for efficient secretion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Newly synthesized secretory proteins are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus in coatomer protein II (COPII)-coated vesicles (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Schekman, 2013</xref>). COPII vesicles are generated at ER exit sites, the specialized ribosome-free domain of the ER (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Palade, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Orci et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bannykh et al., 1996</xref>), where the small GTPase Sar1 is activated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sec12 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">NakaÅo and Muramatsu, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barlowe and Schekman, 1993</xref>). Activated Sar1 then recruits the inner coat protein complex Sec23/24 with cargo molecules to form a prebudding complex (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aridor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kuehn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tabata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Pagant et al., 2015</xref>), which then binds to the outer coat protein complex Sec13/31 to finish the budding reaction (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yoshihisa et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Matsuoka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Antonny et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2007</xref>). Although in vitro vesicle budding can be sufficiently reconstituted with these factors (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Supek et al., 2002</xref>), another protein called Sec16 is essential for the function of the early secretory pathway in yeast, flies, and humans (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Espenshade et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sprangers and Rabouille, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>Sec16 is a peripheral membrane protein that interacts with multiple COPII components (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gimeno et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shaywitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya and Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Whittle and Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Montegna et al., 2012</xref>). Depletion or mutation of Sec16 results in the disruption of ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Connerly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya and Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Iinuma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>), leading to the proposition that Sec16 acts as a scaffold protein (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sprangers and Rabouille, 2015</xref>). Additionally, studies on <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> indicate that Sec16 regulates COPII assembly (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bharucha et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been reported that Sec16 negatively regulates Sar1 GTP hydrolysis by either inhibiting the recruitment of Sec31 to the prebudding complex or interacting with Sec24 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yorimitsu and Sato, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>It was recently reported that Sec16 integrates nutrient signaling such as extracellular stimuli and starvation (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Farhan et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zacharogianni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tillmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aguilera-Gomez et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, Sec16 seems to be involved in a variety of cellular functions, including T cell activation, oncogenesis, and glucose homeostasis, and to have a role in Parkinsonâs disease (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Witte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bruno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has not yet been fully revealed how Sec16 is targeted to the ER exit sites to exert its function.</p>
      <p>Transport and Golgi organization 1 (TANGO1) was initially identified by genome-wide screening in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cells for factors involved in secretion (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bard et al., 2006</xref>). Two isoforms of TANGO1, TANGO1L and TANGO1S, have been reported as mammalian orthologues. Both are localized at ER exit sites, where they form macromolecular membrane complexes with cTAGE5 and Sec12 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>). TANGO1L interacts with collagen VII at its luminal SH3 domain, and the cytoplasmic proline-rich domains (PRDs) of both TANGO1L and cTAGE5 interact with Sec23/24, serving as a cargo receptor for collagen VII (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Saito and Katada, 2015</xref>). TANGO1L-knockout mice show chondrodysplasia caused by abnormal collagen secretion, confirming TANGO1Lâs function in vivo (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, TANGO1L has been reported to interact with Sedlin and sly1 (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Venditti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nogueira et al., 2014</xref>) and to recruit ERâGolgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membranes to the ER exit sites for collagen-containing megacarrier formation (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, TANGO1 was observed by superresolution microscopy to form ring-like structures around COPII coats (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Raote et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, we found that both TANGO1L and TANGO1S directly interact with Sec16 via the C-terminal PRD. The interaction is required not only for the correct localization of Sec16 and TANGO1 to the ER exit sites, but also for coordinating the localization and functioning of COPII components. Moreover, TANGO1 also organizes membrane-bound ER-resident protein complexes to the ER exit sites. The depletion of TANGO1 disassembles COPII components as well as ER-resident complexes, resulting in fewer functional ER exit sites and delayed secretion. These results suggest that TANGO1 acts as a scaffold in cooperation with Sec16 and organizes the ER exit site for efficient protein secretion.</p>

        <title>COPII components dissociate with TANGO1 depletion</title>
        <p>Although Sec16 has been proposed to be an organizer or regulator of ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Glick, 2014</xref>), much remains to be addressed regarding its function in mammalian cells. First, we confirmed that Sec16 extensively colocalizes with other COPII components at ER exit sites: immunofluorescence shows it as punctuated dots scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya and Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Iinuma et al., 2007</xref>). However, knockdown of both isoforms of TANGO1âeither by siRNAs against sequences common to both TANGO1L and TANGO1S (panTANGO1 siRNA) or by mixture of siRNAs against specific sequences to each TANGO1L and TANGO1S (TANGO1L+S siRNAs)âredistributed Sec16 to the perinuclear regions, and the signals of scattered dots were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Sec31, an outer coatomer of COPII vesicles, remained as dispersed spots through cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that the colocalization efficiency between Sec16 and Sec31 was markedly decreased in TANGO1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Interestingly, Sec23 continued to colocalize with both Sec16 and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), implying that part of Sec23 changes its localization to perinuclear regions without affecting punctate localization.</p>

        <p>Although the cTAGE5 expression level was reduced by TANGO1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), the dissociation between Sec16 and Sec31 was not observed (or was very limited) in cTAGE5-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), indicating that TANGO1, but not cTAGE5, is responsible for the dissociation of Sec16 and Sec31. TANGO1S-FLAG expression in TANGO1-depleted cells recovered the association between Sec16 and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>), suggesting that TANGO1 is required for correct assembly of COPII components at ER exit sites.</p>
        <p>Next, we tested how this disassembly affects secretion. Previous pulse-chase experiments indicated that TANGO1 is involved only in collagen secretion, without affecting general protein secretion (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). However, that study did not fully evaluate the function of TANGO1S. In the present study, we depleted TANGO1L and TANGO1S by transfecting with siRNAs twice and examining the transport of VSVG-ts045-GFP. VSVG-ts045-GFP that accumulates to the ER by incubation at 39.5Â°C (Fig. S1, left) is released after further incubation at 37Â°C. In control cells at 8 min, VSVG-ts045-GFP showed punctuated localization merged with Sec16 and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>, left). However, in cells treated with TANGO1 siRNAs, VSVG-ts045-GFP remained dispersed throughout the ER at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>, left). Further incubation at 37Â°C was required to observe spots in TANGO1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>, right). Interestingly, the VSVG-ts045-GFP spots observed in TANGO1-depleted cells were mostly colocalized with both Sec16 and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>, right). After 30 min, the VSVG-ts045-GFP reached the Golgi in both control and TANGO1-depleted cells (Fig. S1, right), indicating that TANGO1 depletion does not block but delays VSVG trafficking. These data suggest that only sites that contain all COPII components are functional, and TANGO1 depletion reduced functional ER exit sites by dissociating Sec16 from Sec31 and delaying secretion.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, when examined after methanol fixation, Sec16 depletion severely reduced the signal of TANGO1 at ER exit sites. Interestingly, Western blotting of corresponding cell lysates revealed that protein expression levels of both TANGO1L and TANGO1S were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This phenomenon is reminiscent of what we found for Sec12 after cTAGE5 depletion (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). Sec12 is dispersed throughout the ER with cTAGE5 knockdown, so the signal seemed to be diminished in methanol-fixed cells. Interestingly, the signals of cTAGE5 and Sec12 were also diminished with Sec16 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Next, we examined the localization of TANGO1 in PFA-fixed cells. TANGO1 signals were still observed and partially colocalized with Sec12 in Sec16 siRNAâtreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The signals seemed to be partially overlapped with reticular ER patterning of KDEL, implying that TANGO1 is dispersed through the ER with Sec16 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Because TANGO1 and Sec16 are mutually required for each otherâs correct localization, we next tested the possibility that the two proteins interact. We coexpressed FLAG-tagged Sec16 with HA-tagged TANGO1L or TANGO1S in 293T cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by elution with the FLAG peptide. We found that Sec16 interacts with both TANGO1S and TANGO1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To determine the interaction domain in Sec16, we made FLAG-tagged Sec16 deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 B</xref> and S2 A) and assessed their binding with TANGO1S. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, the 1,101- to 1,600-aa region of Sec16, corresponding to the ERES localization domain (ELD) and half of the central conserved domain, is capable of interacting with TANGO1S.

        <p>Next, we investigated which region of TANGO1 was responsible for the interaction with Sec16. We created recombinant proteins of TANGO1 deletions fused with GST and assessed their interaction with the FLAG-tagged 1,101- to 1,600-aa region of Sec16 purified from 293T cells (Fig. S3). We found that the PRD of TANGO1 directly interacts with the 1,101- to 1,600-aa region of Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). We made further deletions of the PRD and examined the interaction with Sec16 (Fig. S3). When the TANGO1 PRD was truncated by 60 aa at its C-terminal end, it was able to bind to Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, lane 4). However, when 120 aa was deleted from its C terminus, it failed to interact with Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, lane 5), indicating that the interaction domain of TANGO1âs PRD for Sec16 lies 60â120 aa from the C terminus. We named this region (1,788â1,847 aa) of TANGO1 the Sec16-interacting region (SIR). Because TANGO1âs PRD has also been reported to interact with Sec23 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>), we next tested the interaction with Sec23 (Fig. S3). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>, Sec23A is also capable of interacting with 60-aa truncated PRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>, lane 4), but the binding was severely reduced with a 120-aa deletion of PRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>, lane 5), suggesting that the major interacting domain of Sec23 corresponds to TANGO1âs SIR.</p>

        <title>Interaction between Sec16 and TANGO1 is required for their correct localization</title>
        <p>To clarify the functional significance of the interaction between TANGO1 and Sec16, we next examined the cells with TANGO1 deletion constructs. The cells depleted of both TANGO1L and TANGO1S were transfected with various constructs of TANGO1, and their localization and effects on other COPII components were investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, expressed TANGO1SÎ45 and TANGO1SÎ60 were localized at punctate dots characteristic of ER exit sites and extensively merged with Sec16 and Sec31 as TANGO1S full-length constructs. Quantitative analysis showed that the colocalization efficiency between Sec16 and Sec31 was recovered on the cells with these constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Conversely, the cells with TANGO1SÎ120, which cannot interact with Sec16 and Sec23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>), showed ER reticular patterning, and this construct failed to correct the dissociation of Sec16 and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the domain of TANGO1 responsible for the interaction with Sec16 and Sec23 (SIR) is required for correct localization of TANGO1, Sec16, and Sec31 at the ER exit sites.</p>

        <p>Although in vitro binding assays revealed that TANGO1 interacts directly with Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>), the possibility that TANGO1 has a common binding region for Sec16 and Sec23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>) prompted us to investigate whether Sec23 is required for the correct localization of TANGO1 and Sec16 at ER exit sites. Unfortunately, it is difficult to costain endogenous TANGO1 and Sec16, because antibodies against both proteins were made in rabbits. Thus, we made use of doxycycline-inducible TANGO1S-GFP stable HeLa cell lines. We depleted Sec23A and Sec23B by siRNAs and verified knockdown efficiency by anti-Sec23 (5H2) antibody, which can recognize both Sec23A and Sec23B, as shown in Fig. S4. When both Sec23A and Sec23B are efficiently depleted, induced TANGO1S-GFP extensively colocalizes with Sec16, indicating that Sec23 is not necessary for correct localization of TANGO1 and Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). We also confirmed by immunofluorescence that endogenous TANGO1S and TANGO1L did not change their localization when Sec23 was depleted (Fig. S5). Collectively, these results suggest that interaction between TANGO1 and Sec16 is not only required for their correct localization, but is also important for functional ER exit sites.</p>

        <title>TANGO1 scaffolds ER-resident protein complexes to the ER exit sites</title>
        <p>We have previously reported that TANGO1 forms macromolecular ER-resident protein complexes with cTAGE5 and Sec12 at ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>). Because TANGO1 seems to coordinate the localization of cytosolic COPII components to the ER exit sites, we next investigated whether TANGO1 is also important for recruiting ER-resident complexes to the ER exit sites. Our previous study suggested that Sec12 localizes at ER exit sites via direct interaction with cTAGE5 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we examined whether TANGO1 recruits cTAGE5 to the ER exit sites or vice versa.</p>
        <p>We depleted all of TANGO1L, TANGO1S, and cTAGE5 from the cells and checked the localization of expressed constructs. Because siRNA for TANGO1S is targeted to the 5â² UTR, the TANGO1S original construct can be used as a rescue construct, in contrast to cTAGE5, which requires an siRNA-resistant mutant. When TANGO1S-FLAG is expressed in the cells depleted of TANGO1 and cTAGE5, Sec16 recovers its association with Sec31, and TANGO1S-FLAG colocalizes with these COPII components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), suggesting that TANGO1 is capable of recruiting itself to the ER exit sites independently of cTAGE5, as long as Sec16 is present. Although expressed cTAGE5-FLAG colocalizes with Sec16 and Sec31 in cTAGE5-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), when expressed in cells depleted of both cTAGE5 and TANGO1, it no longer colocalizes with Sec16 and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Moreover, the dissociation of Sec16 and Sec31 is not recovered with cTAGE5 expression. These results strongly suggest that TANGO1 recruits cTAGE5 to the ER exit sites.</p>

        <p>Next, we examined Sec12 localization under the same conditions. We used a cTAGE5-FLAG siRNA-resistant construct lacking the epitope for the cTAGE5-CT antibody, so that expressed cTAGE5 was not recognizable by the antibody. Although Sec12 is dispersed throughout the ER in cTAGE5-depleted cells, cTAGE5-FLAG expression rescues the Sec12 signals at ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). We showed previously that when TANGO1 is depleted, cTAGE5 expression was reduced and Sec12 no longer localized at ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>). TANGO1S expression in these cells rescues the cTAGE5 expression, leading to Sec12 relocation to the ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). When TANGO1S is expressed in cTAGE5- and TANGO1-depleted cells, Sec12 remains dispersed throughout the ER because cTAGE5 expression is not recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, when cTAGE5 is expressed in a cTAGE5- and TANGO1-depleted environment, Sec12 signals fail to accumulate where cTAGE5 locates, confirming that cTAGE5 fails to recover functional ER exit sites, with dissociated localization of Sec16, Sec31, cTAGE5, and Sec12. These results strongly suggest that TANGO1 functions as an organizer for membrane-bound protein complexes and recruits them to ER exit sites.</p>

        <title>TANGO1 is capable of recruiting Sec16 and other COPII components</title>
        <p>Although Sec16 is considered to be an organizer of the ER exit sites, the fact that Sec16 is a peripheral membrane protein suggests that it must be first recruited to the ER exit site to exert its function of scaffolding other COPII components. This is in contrast to both TANGO1L and TANGO1S, which are membrane-spanning proteins localized at ER exit sites. Because our results showed that TANGO1 organizes membrane-bound proteins at ER exit sites, we decided to investigate whether TANGO1 was also capable of recruiting Sec16. To this end, we conducted a rapamycin-dependent distribution assay. This assay depends on the properties of two proteins, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and FKBP-rapamycinâassociated protein (FRAP), also known as mTOR, which interact only in the presence of rapamycin. We expressed a Tomm20-GFP-FRAP construct for mitochondria targeting. In addition, we coexpressed TANGO1 deletion constructs fused with an HA tag and FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Without rapamycin, even though Tomm20-GFP-FRAP was efficiently targeted to mitochondria, both TANGO1 PRD-HA-FKBP and TANGO1 PRDÎ120-HA-FKBP were localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). After 2-h treatment with rapamycin, both proteins were extensively colocalized with Tomm20-GFP-FRAP constructs on the mitochondria. We then checked the localization of Sec16. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, Sec16 was extensively recruited to mitochondria when TANGO1 PRD-HA-FKBP was expressed in cells in the presence of rapamycin. Conversely, in the cells with TANGO1 PRDÎ120-HA-FKBP, which lacks the Sec16 interaction domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), Sec16 remained localized to the punctuated dots characteristic of ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Moreover, another COPII component, Sec31, seemed to be recruited to the mitochondrial membrane, though with less efficiency than Sec16, when TANGO1 PRD-HA-FKBP was expressed in the presence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). These results suggest that TANGO1 is capable of recruiting Sec16 and other cytoplasmic COPII components to the ER exit sites. Collectively, this is evidence that TANGO1 recruits both membrane-bound and peripheral proteins and scaffolds them for correct functioning at ER exit sites.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>TANGO1L has been extensively characterized as a collagen cargo receptor at ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Saito and Katada, 2015</xref>). The luminal SH3 domain of TANGO1L interacts with collagen VII or HSP47 associated with collagens and facilitates collagen export from the ER (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we found that TANGO1, consisting of TANGO1L and TANGO1S, is partly involved in general protein secretion. We showed that VSVG trafficking is delayed by the depletion of both TANGO1L and TANGO1S. Moreover, we found that TANGO1 depletion compromises COPII protein integrity, observed as reduced colocalization efficiency between Sec16 and Sec31. Cargoes seem to be exported by functional ER exit sites characterized by the presence of each COPII component, including Sec16 and Sec31. TANGO1 depletion decreased the number of functional ER exit sites, leading to delayed secretion. These results indicate that TANGO1 is involved in the coordination of COPII components at ER exit sites for efficient secretion.</p>
      <p>In this study, we showed that TANGO1 directly interacts with Sec16 and mapped the interaction domains of both proteins to regions (1,788â1,847 aa) in PRD of TANGO1 (SIR) and ELD of Sec16. In addition, SIR in TANGO1 seems to be also important for Sec23 binding. TANGO1âs PRD has been shown by yeast two-hybrid system to interact with Sec23 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2009</xref>), and recent structural analysis suggested that multiple Sec23 molecules can bind to TANGO1âs repeated PPP motifs in PRD (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ma and Goldberg, 2016</xref>). Consistent with that article, our in vitro binding assay showed that TANGO1 PRDÎ60 (1,651â1,847 aa), which contains five of seven PPP motifs, efficiently interacts with Sec23, although PRDÎ120 (1,651â1,787 aa), which has only two PPP motifs, barely binds to Sec23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>).</p>
      <p>SIR in TANGO1 is important for TANGO1âs localization to the ER exit sites. However, it is not likely that Sec23 is involved in the regulation of TANGO1âs localization, because Sec23 depletion has no effect on the localization of either Sec16 or TANGO1. These results strongly suggest that Sec16 binding is required for correct localization of TANGO1 to the ER exit sites.</p>
      <p>Sec16 has been proposed to be an organizer or regulator, as it binds and accumulates multiple COPII components to the ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Connerly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bharucha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sprangers and Rabouille, 2015</xref>); however, the fact that Sec16 is a peripheral membrane protein indicates that there must be some mechanism to recruit the protein to the membranes. ELD was previously shown to be required for ER exit site localization of Sec16 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ivan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>), but the mechanism was not revealed. The current study reveals that TANGO1 interacts with Sec16 via ELD. The fact that TANGO1, regardless of isoform, is an integral membrane protein strongly suggests that membrane association of Sec16 is mediated at least in part by TANGO1. Surprisingly, TANGO1 depletion did not cause Sec16 dispersion to the cytosol: it still localized to the perinuclear regions, implying that Sec16 still associates with membranes. One explanation for this is that Sec16âs ELD might recognize factors other than TANGO1, such as certain lipids at the ER exit site membrane. If so, TANGO1 depletion might lead to Sec16 relocation to the domains enriched in those factors. In any case, we showed that ectopically expressed TANGO1 alone efficiently recruits Sec16. Thus, we conclude that interaction with TANGO1 recruits Sec16 to the ER exit sites.</p>
      <p>As discussed, TANGO1 and Sec16 are mutually required for their correct localization to the ER exit sites. Sec16 has been shown to form homo-oligomers (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhattacharyya and Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yorimitsu and Sato, 2012</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that the oligomerization property of Sec16 might be involved in the concentration of TANGO1 to the ER exit sites. Further work is needed to explore this possibility. In this context, it is noteworthy that TFG-1, an interactor of Sec16, forms homo-octamers and is involved in the association of small functional ER exit sites into large structures required for collagen export (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Witte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">McCaughey et al., 2016</xref>). In any case, our current analysis suggests that TANGO1, in cooperation with Sec16, is required for maintaining functional ER exit sites characterized by the presence of each COPII component.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that TANGO1 forms two different membrane-bound macromolecular complexes at ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>). Either TANGO1L or TANGO1S interacts with cTAGE5 oligomers, the cTAGE5 oligomers then bind to the corresponding amount of Sec12, forming 900- and 700-kD complexes. We have also reported that Sec12 localization to the ER exit sites is dependent on its direct interaction with cTAGE5 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that cTAGE5 is recruited to the ER exit sites by direct interaction with TANGO1. Thus, TANGO1 is required for cTAGE5 and Sec12 to localize at the ER exit sites.</p>
      <p>Based on these results, we propose a model that TANGO1, in cooperation with Sec16, acts as scaffold and organizes the ER exit site for efficient secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Supporting results for this model are as follows: (a) TANGO1 and Sec16 are mutually required for their correct localization to the ER exit sites; (b) TANGO1 is important for recruiting components of the membrane-bound ER-resident complex (i.e., cTAGE5 and Sec12) to the ER exit sites; (c) TANGO1 and Sec16 are independently necessary for the coordination of the COPII components at the ER exit sites; and (d) disruption of the coordination by either TANGO1 or Sec16 depletion causes at least delayed secretion from the ER.</p>

      <p>Cytoplasmic coiled-coil domains of both TANGO1L and TANGO1S shares sequence called TEER, which is important for recruiting ERGIC membranes to the ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Further investigation is required to uncover the relationship between two distinct functions of cytoplasmic domains of TANGO1, to recruit Sec16 via SIR and to recruit ERGIC membranes via TEER.</p>
      <p>It is also interesting to evaluate current findings from an evolutionary perspective. The core components of COPII-vesicle formation including Sar1, Sec12, Sec23/24, Sec13/31, and Sec16 are all conserved from budding yeast. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> Sec12 is dispersed through the ER, in contrast to the concentrated localization of Sec16, Sec23/24, and Sec13/31 at the ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, modest concentrations of Sar1 around ER exit sites that are devoid of COPII proteins have been observed by superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kurokawa et al., 2016</xref>). These results imply that in spite of the dispersed localization of activator Sec12, Sar1 has to be concentrated around ER exit sites to function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>).</p>
      <p>In <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, a budding yeast, Sec12 is concentrated at the ER exit sites by its direct interaction with Sec16 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Montegna et al., 2012</xref>). Sar1 is also concentrated at the ER exit sites in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Soderholm et al., 2004</xref>). These two types of yeast share the upstream conserved region (UCR) required for ER exit site localization of Sec16, and it has been reported for <italic>P. pastoris</italic> that UCR interacts with COPII components and that this interaction is required for Sec16 localization to the ER exit sites (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bharucha et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in spite of functional resemblance between UCR in yeast and ELD in humans, sequence similarity is not observed, implying that the mechanisms of Sec16 association to the membrane are different among these species. Further, TANGO1 is only conserved in metazoans (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). TANGO1 might have evolved to recruit Sec16 to ER exit sites by the direct interaction between SIR and ELD. Moreover, human TANGO1 interacts with cTAGE5 and recruits multiple Sec12 molecules in association with cTAGE5, compared with the Sec12 recruitment by direct interaction with Sec16 observed in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Thus, it would be interesting to speculate that higher eukaryotes introduced ER-resident complexes consisting of TANGO1 and cTAGE5 for recruiting multiple Sec12 molecules for the efficient production of Sar1 in the vicinity of ER exit sites organized by Sec16. It is noteworthy that <italic>Drosophila</italic> only has the long isoform of TANGO1 and it seems not have cTAGE5 counterparts. It might be worth testing whether fly TANGO1 interacts with Sec12 and Sec16, and if it is able to oligomerize.</p>
      <p>During the preparation of this manuscript, it was reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> TANGO1 also functions as an organizer; however, the mechanism by which TANGO1 organizes ER exit sites remained unclear (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Our present study provides the evidence that TANGO1 directly interacts with Sec16 and, in cooperation with Sec16, acts as a scaffold for efficient protein secretion.</p>
