      <abstract>
        <p>Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) harbour self-renewal and differentiation properties, accounting for chemotherapy resistance and recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms to sustain liver CSCs remain largely unknown. In this study, based on analysis of several hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) transcriptome datasets and our experimental data, we find that C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC tumours and liver CSCs. C8orf4 attenuates the self-renewal capacity of liver CSCs and tumour propagation. We show that NOTCH2 is activated in liver CSCs. C8orf4 is located in the cytoplasm of HCC tumour cells and associates with the NOTCH2 intracellular domain, which impedes the nuclear translocation of N2ICD. C8orf4 deletion causes the nuclear translocation of N2ICD that triggers the NOTCH2 signalling, which sustains the stemness of liver CSCs. Finally, NOTCH2 activation levels are consistent with clinical severity and prognosis of HCC patients. Altogether, C8orf4 negatively regulates the self-renewal of liver CSCs via suppression of NOTCH2 signalling.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common liver cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer related death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The 5-year survival rate of HCC patients remains poor, and &gt;750,000 HCC patients die each year. The high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity are the two major features of HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Many studies have suggested that heterogeneity is a result of the hierarchical organization of tumour cells by a subset of cells with stem/progenitor cell features known as cancer stem cells (CSCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, which are cancer cells with stem cell features. These CSCs within tumour bulk display the capacity to self-renew, differentiate and give rise to a new tumour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, accounting for a hierarchical organization of heterogeneous cancer cells and a high rate of cancerous recurrence. Liver CSCs can be enriched by several defined surface markers, including epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CD13, CD133, CD90, CD24,CD44, calcium channel Î±2Î´1 subunit and so on<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>Like stem cells, CSCs are characterized by self-renewal and differentiation simultaneously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Not surprisingly, CSCs share core regulatory genes and developmental pathways with normal tissue stem cells. Accumulating evidence shows that NOTCH, Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways are implicated in the regulation of CSC self-renewal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. NOTCH signalling modulates many aspects of metazoan development and tissue stemness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. NOTCH receptors contain four members (NOTCH1â4) in mammals, which are activated by engagement with various ligands. The aberrant NOTCH signalling was first reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis of human T-cell leukaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Recently, a number of studies have reported that the NOTCH signalling pathway is implicated in regulating self-renewal of breast stem cells and mammary CSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, how the NOTCH signalling regulates the liver CSC self-renewal remains largely unknown.</p>
    <p>C8orf4, also called thyroid cancer 1 (TC1), was originally cloned from a papillary thyroid carcinoma and its surrounding normal thyroid tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. C8orf4 is ubiquitously expressed across a wide range of vertebrates with the sequence conservation across species. A number of studies have reported that C8orf4 is highly expressed in several tumours and implicated in tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In addition, C8orf4 augments Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling in some cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, suggesting it may be involved in the regulation of self-renewal of CSCs. However, the biological function of C8orf4 in the modulation of liver CSC self-renewal is still unknown. Here we show that C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC and liver CSCs. NOTCH2 signalling is highly activated in HCC tumours and liver CSCs. C8orf4 negatively regulates the self-renewal of liver CSCs via suppression of NOTCH2 signalling.</p>

        <title>C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC tissues and liver CSCs</title>
        <p>To search for driver genes in the oncogenesis of HCC, we performed genome-wide analyses using several online-available HCC transcriptome datasets by R language and Bioconductor approaches. After analysing gene expression profiles of HCC tumour and peri-tumour tissues, we identified &gt;360 differentially expressed genes from both Park's cohort (GSE36376; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and Wang's cohort (GSE14520; refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Of these changed genes, we focused on <italic>C8orf4</italic>, which was weakly expressed in HCC tumours derived from both Park's cohort (GSE36376) and Wang's cohort (GSE14520) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Lower expression of C8orf4 was further confirmed in HCC samples by quantitative reverse transcriptionâPCR (qRTâPCR) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). In this study, HCC patient samples we used included all subtypes of HCC. In addition, these observations were further validated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These data indicate that C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC tumour tissues.</p>
        <p>Notably, <italic>C8orf4</italic> was also weakly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by analysis of its expression profiles derived from online datasets (GSE14897; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and GSE25417; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). <italic>C8orf4</italic> was also lowly expressed in normal liver stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>), suggesting that C8orf4 may be involved in the regulation of self-renewal of liver stem cells. Thus, we propose that C8orf4 might play a role in the maintenance of liver CSCs. Since CD13 and CD133 were widely used as liver CSC surface markers, we sorted CD13<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> cells from Huh7 and Hep3B HCC cell lines as well as HCC samples, serving as liver CSCs. We observed that <italic>C8orf4</italic> was weakly expressed in liver CSCs enriched from both HCC cell lines and patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Six HCC samples were analysed for these experiments. Similar results were obtained in CD13<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> cells from Hep3B cells. Furthermore, we performed sphere formation experiments using Huh7 cells and HCC primary sample cells, and detected expression levels of C8orf4. We observed that C8orf4 was dramatically reduced in the oncospheres generated by both HCC cell lines and patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). In addition, we noticed that C8orf4 expression was negatively correlated with liver CSC markers such as CD13 and CD133 in HCC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), suggesting lower expression of C8orf4 in liver CSCs. Moreover, C8orf4 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of tumour cells. Altogether, C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC tumour tissues and liver CSCs.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>C8orf4 negatively regulates self-renewal of liver CSCs</title>
        <p>We then wanted to look at whether C8orf4 plays a critical role in the self-renewal maintenance of liver CSCs. <italic>C8orf4</italic> was knocked out in Huh7 cells through a CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Two <italic>C8orf4</italic>-knockout (KO) cell strains were established and <italic>C8orf4</italic> was completely deleted in these two strains. <italic>C8orf4</italic> deletion dramatically enhanced oncosphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We co-stained SOX9, a widely used progenitor marker, and Ki67, a well-known proliferation marker, in <italic>C8orf4</italic> KO sphere cells. We found that SOX9 was strongly stained in <italic>C8orf4</italic> KO sphere cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, Ki67 staining was not significantly altered in <italic>C8orf4</italic> KO sphere cells versus WT sphere cells. We also digested sphere cells and examined the SOX9 and Ki67 expression by flow cytometry. Similar results were achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Importantly, through serial passage of CSC sphere cells, similar observations were obtained in the fourth generation oncosphere assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). These data suggest that C8orf4 is involved in the regulation of liver CSC self-renewal.</p>
        <p>In addition, <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deficient Huh7 cells overtly increased xenograft tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We then performed sphere formation and digested oncospheres formed by <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deficient or WT cells into single-cell suspension, then subcutaneously implanted 1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup>, 1 Ã 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 Ã 10<sup>2</sup> and 10 cells into BALB/c nude mice. Tumour formation was examined for tumour-initiating capacity at the third month. <italic>C8orf4</italic> deficiency remarkably enhanced tumour-initiating capacity and liver CSC ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, <italic>C8orf4</italic> deletion significantly enhanced expression levels of the liver CSC markers such as <italic>CD13</italic> and <italic>CD133</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We also silenced C8orf4 in HCC primary cells using a lentivirus infection system and established C8orf4-silenced cells. Two pairs of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences obtained similar knockdown efficiency. C8orf4 knockdown remarkably promoted sphere formation and xenograft tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>C8orf4</italic> deletion potentiates the self-renewal of liver CSCs.</p>
        <p>We next overexpressed C8orf4 in Huh7 cells and HCC primary cells using lentivirus infection. We observed that C8orf4 overexpression in Huh7 cells remarkably reduced sphere formation and xenograft tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>). In addition, C8orf4 overexpression remarkably reduced tumour-initiating capacity and expression of liver CSC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i,j</xref>). Similar results were observed by C8orf4 overexpression in HCC primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k</xref>). We tested three HCC samples with similar results. Overall, C8orf4 negatively regulates the maintenance of liver CSC self-renewal and tumour propagation.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>C8orf4 suppresses NOTCH2 signalling in liver CSCs</title>
        <p>To further determine the underlying mechanism of C8orf4 in the regulation of liver CSCs, we analysed three major self-renewal signalling pathways, including Wnt/Î²-catenin, Hedgehog and NOTCH pathways, in <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deleted Huh7 cells and HCC primary cells. We found that only NOTCH target genes were remarkably upregulated in <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), whereas <italic>C8orf4</italic> deficiency did not significantly affect the Wnt/Î²-catenin or the Hedgehog pathway. Given that the NOTCH family receptors have four members, we wanted to determine which NOTCH member was involved in the C8orf4-mediated suppression of liver CSC stemness. We noticed that only <italic>NOTCH2</italic> was highly expressed in both Huh7 cells and HCC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, this result was also confirmed by analysis of <italic>NOTCH</italic> expression levels derived from Wang's cohort (GSE14520) and Petel's cohort (E-TABM-36; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Moreover, we analysed expression profiles of <italic>C8orf4</italic> and <italic>NOTCH</italic> target genes using Park's cohort (GSE36376) and Wurmbach's cohort (GSE6764; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). These cohort datasets provided several Notch signalling and its target genes. <italic>HEY1</italic>, <italic>NRARP</italic> and <italic>HES6</italic> genes were highly expressed in HCC tumour tissues (GSE6764; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), which were further confirmed in HCC samples by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>HEY1</italic>, <italic>NRARP</italic> and <italic>HES6</italic> genes have been reported to be relatively specific NOTCH target genes. We then examined these three genes as the NOTCH2 target genes throughout this study. We found that the <italic>C8orf4</italic> expression level was negatively correlated with the expression levels of <italic>HEY1</italic> and <italic>HES6</italic>, suggesting that C8orf4 inhibited NOTCH signaling in HCC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Finally these results were further confirmed in HCC samples by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). To further explore the activation status of NOTCH2 signalling in liver CSCs, we examined the expression levels of NOTCH downstream target genes in oncospheres and CD13<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> cells derived from both Huh7 cells and HCC cells. We observed that NOTCH target genes were highly expressed in liver CSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). These observations were verified by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). In addition, the expression levels of <italic>NRARP</italic>, <italic>HES6</italic> and <italic>HEY1</italic> were positively related to the expression levels of <italic>EpCAM</italic> and <italic>CD133</italic> derived from Zhang's cohort (GSE25097; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and Wang's cohort (GSE14520; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). These data suggest that the NOTCH2 signalling plays a critical role in the maintenance of self-renewal of liver CSCs.</p>

        <title>C8orf4 interacts with NOTCH2 that is critical for liver CSCs</title>
        <p>On ligandâreceptor binding, the NOTCH receptor experiences a proteolytic cleavage by metalloprotease and Î³-secretase, releasing a NOTCH extracellular domain (NECD) and a NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD), respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Then the active NICD undergoes nuclear translocation and activates the expression of NOTCH downstream target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.Then we constructed the NOTCH2 extracellular domain (N2ECD) and intracellular domain (N2ICD) and examined the interaction with C8orf4 via a yeast two-hybrid approach. Interestingly, we found that C8orf4 interacted with N2ICD, but not N2ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The interaction was validated by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Through domain mapping, the ankyrin repeat domain of NOTCH2 was essential and sufficient for its association with C8orf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Taken together, C8orf4 interacts with the N2ICD domain of NOTCH2.</p>
        <p>To further verify the role of NOTCH2 in the maintenance of liver CSC self-renewal, we knocked down NOTCH2 in Huh7 cells and established stably depleted cell lines by two pairs of NOTCH2 shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). NOTCH2 knockdown dramatically reduced sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>), as well as attenuated xenograft tumour growth and tumour-initiating capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Similar observations were achieved in NOTCH2-depleted HCC primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). In addition, we found that simultaneous knockdown of NOTCH2 and overexpression of C8orf4 failed to reduce sphere formation capacity compared with individual knockdown of NOTCH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>), suggesting that NOTCH2 and C8orf4 affected sphere formation through the same pathway. Meanwhile, C8orf4 knockdown failed to rescue the sphere formation ability of NOTCH2-depleted HCC primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>). Similar observations were obtained in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, NOTCH2 depletion in C8orf4-silenced Huh7 cells or HCC primary cells also abrogated the C8orf4 depletion-mediated enhancement of xenograft tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j</xref>), suggesting that C8orf4 acted as upstream of NOTCH2 signalling. These data suggest that C8orf4 suppresses the liver CSC stemness through inhibiting the NOTCH2 signalling pathway.</p>

        <title>C8orf4 blocks nuclear translocation of N2ICD</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>, C8orf4 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm in tumour cells of HCC samples. To confirm these observations, we stained C8orf4 in several HCC cell lines and noticed that C8orf4 also resided in the cytoplasm of Huh7 cells and Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). These results were further validated by cellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, <italic>C8orf4</italic> KO led to nuclear translocation of N2ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In addition, we also examined the intracellular location of N2ICD in Huh7 spheres. We found that <italic>C8orf4</italic> deletion caused complete nuclear translocation of N2ICD in oncosphere cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>), while N2ICD was mainly located in the cytoplasm of WT oncosphere cells. However, we found that <italic>C8orf4</italic> KO did not affect subcellular localization of Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Through luciferase assays, C8orf4 transfection did not significantly influence promoter transcription activity of Wnt target genes such as <italic>TCF1</italic>, <italic>LEF</italic> and <italic>SOX4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). These data indicate that C8orf4 resides in the cytoplasm of HCC cells and inhibits nuclear translocation of N2ICD.</p>
        <p>To further determine whether C8orf4 inhibits the NOTCH2 signalling in the propagation of xenograft tumours, we examined the distribution of N2ICD and NOTCH2 target gene activation in <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deficient xenograft tumour tissues. We found that <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deficient tumours displayed much more nuclear translocation of N2ICD compared with WT tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). Expectedly, <italic>C8orf4</italic>-deficient tumours showed elevated expression levels of NOTCH2 target genes such as <italic>HEY1</italic>, <italic>HES6</italic> and <italic>NRARP</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). Furthermore, C8orf4 overexpression blocked the nuclear translocation of N2ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>). Consequently, C8orf4-overexpressing tumours showed much less N2ICD nuclear translocation and reduced expression levels of NOTCH2 target genes compared with control tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5f,g</xref>). Of note, C8orf4 overexpression in N2ICD-overexpressing Huh7 cells still blocked nuclear translocation of N2ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i,j</xref>). Consequently, C8orf4 overexpression abolished the activation of Notch2 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>C8orf4</italic> deletion causes the nuclear translocation of N2ICD leading to activation of NOTCH2 signalling.</p>

        <p>To further verify the role of NRARP and HEY1 in the maintenance of liver CSC self-renewal, we knocked down these two genes in Huh7 cells and established stably depleted cell lines by two pairs of shRNAs.

        <title>NOTCH2 signalling is correlated with HCC severity</title>
        <p>As shown above, the NOTCH2 signalling was highly activated in liver CSCs and involved in the regulation of liver CSC stemness. We further examined the relationship of NOTCH2 signalling with the progression of HCC. First, we analysed NOTCH2 activation levels in HCC tumour tissues and peri-tumour tissues derived from Park's cohort (GSE36376). We observed that <italic>HEY1</italic>, <italic>HES6</italic> and <italic>NRARP</italic> were highly expressed in the tumour tissues of HCC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Consistently, high expression levels of <italic>HEY1</italic>, <italic>HES6</italic> and <italic>NRARP</italic> in HCC tumours were validated by Zhang's cohort (GSE25097) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Importantly, high expression of these three genes was confirmed in HCC samples through quantitative RTâPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>), as well as immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). To confirm a causative link between low C8orf4 expression level and nuclear N2ICD, we examined 93 HCC samples (31 peri-tumour, 37 early stage of HCC patients and 25 advanced stage of HCC patients) with immunohistochemistry staining. We observed that nuclear staining of N2ICD appeared in â¼10% tumour cells in the majority of early HCC patients we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>). In advanced HCC patients, nuclear staining of N2ICD in tumour cells increased to â¼30% in almost all the advanced HCC patients we examined. Consequently, HEY1 staining existed in â¼10% tumour cells with scattered distribution and increased to 30% tumour cells in the advanced HCC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). Consistently, low expression of C8orf4 was well correlated with activation of NOTCH2 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>).</p>
        <p>Serial passages of colonies or sphere formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as transplantation of tumour cells, are frequently used to assess the long-term self-renewal capacities of CSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We used HCC primary cells for serial passage growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and tested the expression levels of <italic>C8orf4</italic>, <italic>HEY1</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic>. We found that <italic>C8orf4</italic> expression was gradually reduced over serial passages in oncosphere cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Consequently, the expression of NOTCH2 targets such as <italic>HEY1</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> was gradually increased in oncosphere cells during serial passages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). In addition, N2ICD nuclear translocation appeared in oncosphere cells with high expression of HEY1 plus low expression of C8orf4 (termed as C8orf4<sup>â</sup>/N2ICDnuc/HEY1<sup>+</sup> cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). These data suggest that the C8orf4<sup>â</sup>/N2ICDnuc/HEY1<sup>+</sup> fraction cells represent a subset of liver CSCs.</p>
        <p>Through analysing Wang's cohort (GSE54238), we noticed that the NOTCH2 activation levels were positively correlated with the development and progression of HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>). By contrast, the NOTCH2 pathway was not activated in inflammation liver, cirrhosis liver and normal liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Consistently, similar observations were achieved by analysis of Zhang's cohort (GSE25097) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). In addition, the NOTCH2 activation levels were consistent with clinicopathological stages of HCC patients derived from Wang's cohort (GSE14520) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>). Finally, HCC patients with higher expression of <italic>HEY1</italic> displayed worse prognosis derived from Petel's cohort (E-TABM-36) and Wang's cohort (GSE14520) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7h</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>CSC have been identified in many solid tumours, including breast, lung, brain, liver, colon, prostate and bladder cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. CSCs have similar characteristics associated with normal tissue stem cells, including self-renewal, differentiation and the ability to form a new tumour. CSCs may be responsible for cancer relapse and metastasis due to their invasive and drug-resistant capacities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, targeting CSCs may become a promising therapeutic strategy to deadly malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. However, it remains largely unknown about hepatic CSC biology. In this study, we used CD13 and CD133 to enrich CD13<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> subpopulation cells as liver CSCs. Based on analysis of several online-available HCC transcriptome datasets, we found that C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC tumours as well as in CD13<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> liver CSCs. NOTCH2 signalling is required for the maintenance of liver CSC self-renewal. C8orf4 resides in the cytoplasm of tumour cells and interacts with N2ICD, blocking the nuclear translocation of N2ICD. Lower expression of C8orf4 causes nuclear translocation of N2ICD that activates NOTCH2 signalling in liver CSCs. NOTCH2 activation levels are consistent with clinical severity and prognosis of HCC patients. Therefore, C8orf4 negatively regulates self-renewal of liver CSCs via suppression of NOTCH2 signalling.</p>
      <p>Elucidating signalling pathways that maintains self-renewal of liver CSCs is pivotal for the understanding of hepatic CSC biology and the development of novel therapies against HCC. Several signalling pathways, such as Wnt/Î²-catenin, transforming growth factor-beta, AKT and STAT3 pathways, have been defined to be implicated in the regulation of liver CSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Not surprisingly, some liver CSC subsets and normal tissue stem cells may share core regulatory genes and common signalling pathways. The NOTCH signalling pathway plays an important role in development via cell-fate determination, proliferation and cell survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The NOTCH family receptors contain four members in mammals (NOTCH1â4), which are activated by binding to their corresponding ligands. A large body of evidence provides that NOTCH signalling is implicated in carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, the role of NOTCH signalling in liver cancer is controversial. A previous study reported that NOTCH1 signalling suppresses tumour growth of HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Recently, several reports showed that NOTCH signalling enhances liver tumour initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Importantly, a recent study showed that various NOTCH receptors have differential functions in the development of liver cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Here we demonstrate that NOTCH2 signalling is activated in HCC tumour tissues and liver CSCs, which is required for the maintenance of liver CSC self-renewal.</p>
      <p>C8orf4, also known as TC1, was originally cloned from a papillary thyroid cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The copy number variations of C8orf4 are associated with acute myeloid leukaemia and other haematological malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. C8orf4 has been reported to be implicated in various cancers. C8orf4 was highly expressed in thyroid cancer, gastric cancer and breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. C8orf4 has been reported to enhance Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling in cancer cells that is associated with poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, C8orf4 is downregulated in colon cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. In this study, we show that C8orf4 is weakly expressed in HCC tumour tissues and liver CSCs. Our observations were confirmed by two HCC cohort datasets. Importantly, C8orf4 negatively regulates the NOTCH2 signalling to suppress the self-renewal of liver CSCs. Therefore, C8orf4 may exert distinct functions in the regulation of various malignancies.</p>
      <p>NOTCH receptors consist of noncovalently bound extracellular and transmembrane domains. Once binding with membrane-bound Delta or Jagged ligands, the NOTCH receptors undergoes a proteolytic step by metalloprotease and Î³-secretase, generating NECD and NICD fragments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The NICD, a soluble fragment, is released in the cytoplasm on proteolysis. Then the NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the transcription initiation complex, leading to activation of NOTCH-associated target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. However, it is largely unclear how the NICD is regulated during NOTCH signalling activation. Here we show that N2ICD binds to C8orf4 in the cytoplasm of liver non-CSC tumour cells, which impedes the nuclear translocation of N2ICD. By contrast, in liver CSCs, lower expression of C8orf4 causes the nuclear translocation of N2ICD, leading to activation of NOTCH signalling.</p>
      <p>CSCs or tumour-initiating cells, behave like tissue stem cells in that they are capable of self-renewal and of giving rise to hierarchical organization of heterogeneous cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Thus, CSCs harbour the stem cell properties of self-renewal and differentiation. Actually, the CSC model cannot account for tumorigenesis in all tumours. CSCs could undergo genetic evolution, and the non-CSCs might switch to CSC-like cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These results highlight the dynamic nature of CSCs, suggesting that the clonal evolution and CSC models can act in concert for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, low C8orf4 expression in tumour cells results in overall Notch2 activation, which then may have more of a progenitor signature and be more aggressive. These cells would likely have a growth advantage in non-adherent conditions and express many of the stemness markers. The dynamic nature of CSCs or persistent NOTCH2 activation may contribute to the high number of C8orf4<sup>â</sup>/N2ICDnuc/HEY1<sup>+</sup> cells in advanced HCC tumours and correlation in the patient cohort.</p>
      <p>A recent study showed that NOTCH2 and its ligand Jag1 are highly expressed in human HCC tumours, suggesting activation of NOTCH2 signalling in HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In addition, inhibiting NOTCH2 or Jag1 dramatically reduces tumour burden and growth. However, suppression of NOTCH3 has no effect on tumour growth. Dill <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> reported that Notch2 is an oncogene in HCC. Notch2-driven HCC are poorly differentiated with a high expression level of the progenitor marker Sox9, indicating a critical role of Notch2 signalling in liver CSCs. Here we found that NOTCH2 and its target genes such as NRARP, HEY1 and HES6 are highly expressed in HCC samples. In addition, depletion of NRARP and HEY1 impairs the stemness maintenance of liver CSCs and tumour propagation. Moreover, the expression levels of NRARP, HEY1 and HES6 in tumours are positively correlated with clinical severity and prognosis of HCC patients. Finally, the NOTCH2 activation status is positively related to the clinicopathological stages of HCC patients. Altogether, C8orf4 and NOTCH2 signalling can be detected for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of HCC patients, as well as used as targets for eradicating liver CSCs for future therapy.</p>

For non-sphere cell separation, we collected sphere formation medium that contains non-sphere cells and sphere cells in an Eppendorf tube and let stand for 5âmin and pellets were spheres. Supernatants were then removed in a new Eppendorf tube carefully with transferpettor and collected by centrifugation at 1,500<italic>g</italic> for 5âmin. Pellets were non-sphere cells and used directly for subsequent experiments. We cultured these non-sphere cells under the same non-adherent conditions as sphere cells.</p>

For tumour-formation assay, spheres were digested in single cells by trypsin/EDTA, and 10, 10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> cells were injected into 6-week-old male BALB/c nude mice. Tumour formation was observed every month and analysed at the third months. BALB/c nude mice were obtained from the Animal Centre of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China), and all experiments involving mice were approved by the institutional committee of Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

(<bold>e</bold>) IHC staining for N2ICD, C8orf4 and HEY1. These images represent 93 HCC samples. Scale bars, 50âÎ¼m. (<bold>f</bold>) IHC images were calculated using Image-Pro Plus 6. (<bold>g</bold>) Expression levels of NOTCH target genes were elevated in HCC tumours and advanced HCC patients derived from Wang's cohort. (<bold>h</bold>) <italic>HEY1</italic> expression level was positively correlated with prognosis prediction of HCC patients analysed by Petel's cohort and Wang's cohort. HCC samples were divided into two groups according to <italic>HEY1</italic> expression levels followed by KaplanâMeier survival analysis. For <bold>a</bold>â<bold>c</bold>, data are shown as box and whisker plot, Box: interquartile range (IQR); horizontal line within box: median; whiskers: 5â95 percentile. For <bold>f</bold>,<bold>g</bold>, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for statistical analysis, *<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01; ***<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; data are shown as meanÂ±s.d. Experiments were repeated at least three times. aHCC, advanced HCC; CL, cirrhosis liver; eHCC, early HCC; IL, inflammatory liver; NL, normal liver; NS, not significant.</p>
