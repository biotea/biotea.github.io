      <abstract>
        <p>The messenger RNA of the intronless <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene is translated into distinct protein isoforms through the usage of consecutive translation initiation sites. These translational isoforms have distinct functions in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation due to the presence of different N-terminal sequences. Here, we describe the function of an N-terminally extended protein isoform of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein Î± (C/EBPÎ±) that is translated from an alternative non-AUG initiation codon. We show that a basic amino-acid motif within its N-terminus is required for nucleolar retention and for interaction with nucleophosmin (NPM). In the nucleoli, extended-C/EBPÎ± occupies the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter and associates with the Pol I-specific factors <underline>u</underline>pstream-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>f</underline>actor <underline>1</underline> (UBF-1) and SL1 to stimulate rRNA synthesis. Furthermore, during differentiation of HL-60 cells, endogenous expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± is lost concomitantly with nucleolar C/EBPÎ± immunostaining probably reflecting the reduced requirement for ribosome biogenesis in differentiated cells. Finally, overexpression of extended-C/EBPÎ± induces an increase in cell size. Altogether, our results suggest that control of rRNA synthesis is a novel function of C/EBPÎ± adding to its role as key regulator of cell growth and proliferation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Increased cell proliferation, for example in cancerous growth, requires an increase in protein synthesis to fulfill the need for extra cell mass. Stimulation of RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-dependent ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription is a crucial event in ribosome biogenesis, which is prerequisite for enhanced protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruggero and Pandolfi, 2003</xref>). In recent years, a growing number of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription factors have been found to regulate RNA Pol I-dependent rDNA transcription in addition. These transcription factors either stimulate rRNA synthesis during proliferation like c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arabi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) or inhibit rRNA synthesis as has been shown for CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Torrano <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and the lineage-specific transcription factors MyoD, myogenin and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein Î² (C/EBPÎ²) that selectively interact with rRNA genes during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ali <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>C/EBPÎ± controls cell proliferation as well as transcription of genes involved in differentiation and energy homeostasis in various cell types through redundant as well as specific functions compared with C/EBPÎ² and other C/EBP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Nerlov, 2007</xref>). In the haematopoietic system, C/EBPÎ± is required for the differentiation of myelomonocytic cells, and mutations in the <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene are considered to be critically involved in the etiology of about 10% of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Nerlov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kirstetter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). A pivotal mechanism that controls C/EBPÎ± expression in the cell is the regulated translation of its intronless messenger RNA into three functionally different protein isoforms from three successive translation initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ossipow <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The full-length-C/EBPÎ± isoform (p42) that is translated from the first AUG codon in the C/EBPÎ± reading frame is a complete transcription factor possessing all sequences for transactivation of genes and for inhibition of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ossipow <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). In contrast, the truncated-C/EBPÎ± isoform (p30), which is translated from an internal AUG codon, lacks the amino-terminal sequences for transactivation and is unable to restrict proliferation probably due to the absence of sequences required for the inhibition of E2F-dependent target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Porse <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). An evolutionary conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the mRNA leader sequence controls the ratio between the full-length (p42) and truncated (p30) C/EBPÎ± isoforms. Because of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory uORF, translation of the C/EBPÎ± isoforms is under the control of the mTOR kinase-mediated regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E as well as the stress-induced eIF2Î±-kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Differential expression of the translational isoforms of C/EBPÎ± provides a versatile mechanism to deliver functions on demand. However, it seems also to provide a critical target for deregulation and mutation during cancer development as is illustrated by a mouse model for the frequent mutation in human AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Pabst <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) that results in the synthesis of only the truncated-C/EBPÎ± isoform and causes AML with complete penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kirstetter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The function of the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform, which is translated from an upstream non-AUG codon has never been experimentally addressed. In this study, we reveal a novel function of C/EBPÎ± that is specific for the extended isoform. We show that the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform can localize to nucleoli where it binds to the rDNA promoter. The extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform interacts with and facilitates the recruitment of the Pol I-specific transacting factor <underline>u</underline>pstream-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>f</underline>actor <underline>1</underline> (UBF-1) and components of the TATA-binding protein (TBP)âTBP-associated factor (TAF<sub>I</sub>) complex SL1, and it enhances acetylation of histone H3 and H4 at the rDNA promoter. Furthermore, its nucleolar localization results in an increase in cell size. We identified a motif within the additional amino-terminal domain of the extended isoform that serves as a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and is required for interaction with nucleophosmin (NPM). In addition to the NoLS, a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation of a specific serine residue (S299D) strongly stimulates nucleolar retention, indicating that nucleolar retention of extended-C/EBPÎ± may be further regulated through phosphorylation. We also show that downregulation of endogenous expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± on phorbolester-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells correlates with loss of C/EBPÎ±-specific nucleolar staining. Our data further strengthens the concept that regulated translation of the C/EBPÎ± mRNA into protein isoforms with distinct functions is a key-regulatory mechanism in the control of proliferation and differentiation in C/EBPÎ± expressing cells.</p>

        <title>Extended-C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> is translated from a non-AUG alternative initiation codon</title>
        <p>Amino-acid sequence comparison reveals a high degree of conservation among mammals of the region upstream of the first AUG-codon in the C/EBPÎ± coding frame as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref> for the murine and human C/EBPÎ± cDNAs. For murine C/EBPÎ±, these N-terminally extended sequences can be incorporated into the C/EBPÎ± proteins through initiation from one of the two successive CUG alternative initiation codons (A-sites in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) that lie â28 and â37 codons upstream of the first AUG (site B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) of the C/EBPÎ± coding frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) (and data not shown). In case of the human sequence, a GUG alternative initiation codon is found at position â35. Mutation of the most prominently used CUG codon (ÎA<sup>2</sup>) in the rat C/EBPÎ± cDNA or the GUG codon (ÎA<sup>1</sup>) in the human C/EBPÎ± cDNA as well as removal of the complete sequence upstream of the first AUG (Î5â²) result in complete loss of extended-C/EBPÎ± expression in COS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, converting the CUG or GUG codons into a proper AUG codon (A<sup>opt</sup>) results in predominant expression of the extended isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hence, alternative CUG or GUG codons in the 5â²-leader sequence of C/EBPÎ± mRNAs can be used for initiation of translation.</p>

        <title>The extended-C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> isoform is retained in the nucleolus</title>
        <p>C/EBPÎ± is a transcription factor that predominantly localizes to the nucleus. It contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within its carboxy-terminal basic region that is present in all three translational isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Williams <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). To compare the subcellular distribution between the three translational isoforms of C/EBPÎ±, we examined their cellular localization by fluorescence microscopic analysis using the Zeiss ApoTome system. For this purpose, we transfected C33A cells with expression constructs containing sequences for the separate C/EBPÎ± isoforms or constructs with the C/EBPÎ± isoforms fused at their carboxy-termini to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We found that in a consistent percentage (10%) of transfected cells, the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform localized to the nucleoli as was detected by either direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) or indirect fluorescence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Nucleolar localization was verified by co-immunostaining of the nucleolar marker protein Fibrillarin, which is a component of the rRNA processing machinery. In contrast, nucleolar localization was never observed with transient expression of the full-length- or truncated-C/EBPÎ± isoforms, indicating that nucleolar localization is a specific feature of the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform. Interestingly, during the establishment of C33A cell lines that stably express extended-C/EBPÎ±, the percentage of cells with nucleolar retention continuously raises up to 100%, in long-term cultures, suggesting that these cells have a selective proliferation or survival advantage (data not shown).</p>
        <p>NoLSs are often characterized by stretches of basic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Carmo-Fonseca <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Emmott and Hiscox, 2009</xref>). The extended-C/EBPÎ± domain contains a conserved RRXR motif that is also found in proven NoLSs of other proteins like Parp2, p14/19Arf, ING1b, Rpp29 or HIV Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jarrous <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Weber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meder <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). To examine whether the extended domain is required and sufficient for nucleolar retention, we fused the 28 amino acids of the extended domain to EGFP and determined cellular localization by microscopic analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that the sequences of the extended C/EBPÎ± domain alone are very efficient in retaining the attached EGFP in the nucleolus in almost 100% of transfected cells. In contrast, the mutation of the RRQR motif into AAAA abolished nucleolar localization of the extended domain EGFP fusion construct and resulted in even distribution over the cell similar to the EGFP control. Hence, nucleolar localization is a unique feature of the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform and the RRXR NoLS-motif within the extended domain of C/EBPÎ± is required for its nucleolar retention.</p>

        <title>Pseudo-phosphorylation of serine 299 of extended- C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> stimulates nucleolar retention</title>
        <p>The observation that transiently expressed extended-C/EBPÎ± is retained in the nucleoli in a portion of cells, yet unrestrained nucleolar retention can be achieved with the sole EGFP-fused extended domain indicates that nucleolar retention of the whole protein may be subject of further regulation. It has been shown for other proteins with partial nucleolar localization like Parp2 or ING1b that in addition to the RRXR motif also their NLSs contributed to the efficiency of nucleolar retention independent from their function for nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meder <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). We, therefore, examined the effect of different mutations within the bipartite NLS of C/EBPÎ± and identified a serine residue within the NLS (S299 in full-length-C/EBPÎ±) whose mutation into a phosphorylation-mimicking aspartate causes efficient nucleolar retention. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> presents data from triplicate transfection experiments in four cell lines (C33A, HEK293, COS-1, HeLa) showing that in all cell lines, the S299D mutation rendered nucleolar retention to virtually 100% of transfected cells, compared with around 10% nucleolar versus 90% nucleoplasmic staining for the wt extended-C/EBPÎ±-EGFP. Mutation of the RRQR NoLS-motif in the extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup>-EGFP construct completely abolished nucleolar retention in all cases. Notably, we did not score a single cell with nucleolar localization of full-length- or truncated-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup>-EGFP fusion proteins either with or without the S299D mutation during the examination of all the cell lines. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a typical example for all C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup>-EGFP isoforms in C33A cells and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref> shows nucleolar retention for extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup>-EGFP in five additional cell lines. Mutation of the serine 299 into alanine did not stimulate nucleolar retention of the extended-C/EBPÎ±-EGFP fusion protein or the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by immunostaining of cells transfected with expression constructs for native C/EBPÎ± isoforms without EGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Although, a similar extended isoform of the related C/EBPÎ² exists that is translated from an upstream AUG-codon, it does not have a NoLS, and we did not observe localization of extended-C/EBPÎ² in the nucleolus whether it harbours an S239D mutation that corresponds to the S299D mutation in C/EBPÎ± or not (data not shown). Hence, our data suggest that nucleolar retention of extended-C/EBPÎ± is cell-type independent, requires the RRQR NoLS-motif in the extended domain and is enhanced by phosphorylation of serine 299 within the NLS.</p>

        <title>Endogenous C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> localizes to the nucleolus in myelomonocytic cells</title>
        <p>The promyelocytic human leukemia cell line HL-60 has retained the capacity to differentiate in cell culture and is one of the few cell lines that express endogenous C/EBPÎ±. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that proliferating and undifferentiated HL-60 cells express all three C/EBPÎ± translational isoforms, depicted extended-, full-length- and truncated-C/EBPÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). Intriguingly, indirect fluorescent immunostaining of C/EBPÎ± in HL-60 cells using four different anti-C/EBPÎ± antibodies revealed a prominent staining of the nucleoli in addition to the expected nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Induction of macrophage differentiation by phorbolester (TPA) treatment resulted in complete disappearance of the C/EBPÎ±-specific staining of the nucleoli although staining of the remaining part of the nucleus remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that the expression of the extended- and truncated-C/EBPÎ± isoforms were specifically downregulated in the differentiated HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). Hence, loss of expression of the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform correlates with loss of nucleolar staining. C/EBPÎ±-specific nucleolar staining was also found in another human leukemia cell line, the promonocytic U937 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3B and C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Extended-C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> interacts with Pol I-specific factors and its nucleolar retention depends on ongoing rDNA transcription</title>
        <p>The nucleolus is the place where rDNA transcription is performed through the activity of RNA Pol I. The nucleolar transcription factor UBF-1 is a crucial component of the RNA Pol I preinitiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Grummt, 2003</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that ectopically expressed extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> but not the corresponding ÎNoLS mutant localizes with endogenous UBF-1 in the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). To examine whether C/EBPÎ± interacts with UBF-1, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for extended-, full-length or truncated-C/EBPÎ±, respectively, followed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. We found that both wt and the S299D mutant of extended-C/EBPÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>) as well as full-length-C/EBPÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>) can be co-precipitated together with endogenous UBF-1 using anti-UBF-1 antibodies. In contrast, we could not detect a clear co-precipitation of truncated-C/EBPÎ±.</p>
        <p>RNA Pol I transcription requires the SL1 complex, which is composed of the TBP and three Pol I-specific TAFs, TAF<sub>I</sub>110, TAF<sub>I</sub>63 and TAF<sub>I</sub>48. SL1 was shown to be essential for UBF-1 recruitment and pre-initiation complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Friedrich <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). As full-length C/EBPÎ± is known to bind to and recruit TBP to Pol II promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Nerlov and Ziff, 1995</xref>), we examined whether extended-C/EBPÎ± interacts with TBP and TAF<sub>I</sub>48. Co-IP using anti-C/EBPÎ± antibodies resulted in precipitation of TBP by extended-C/EBPÎ±, as well as the S299D and the S299D-ÎNoLS mutant thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, interaction with TBP is a genuine property of both full-length and extended-C/EBPÎ±. In addition, we could co-precipitate extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> with anti-TAF<sub>I</sub>48 antibodies; however, co-precipitation was not seen with the ÎNoLS mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>, upper panel). Furthermore, TAF<sub>I</sub>48 can be precipitated with anti-TBP antibodies more efficiently in cells that express extended-C/EBPÎ±, in particular the S299D mutant, compared with ÎNoLS or empty vector controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>, lower panel). Overall these results indicate that extended-C/EBPÎ±, UBF-1, and TBP and TAF<sub>I</sub>48 as part of the SL1 complex reside as a complex in the nucleolus.</p>
        <p>It has been shown that the RRQR motif in Parp2 is required for nucleolar retention and for interaction with NPM (also known as B23) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meder <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), a ubiquitously expressed phosphoprotein with multiple functions that constantly shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Grisendi <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). To examine whether a similar interaction between NPM and C/EBPÎ± exists, Co-IP experiments were set up and as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>, NPM could only be co-immunoprecipitated with wt and the S299D mutant of extended-C/EBPÎ± while co-imunoprecipitation failed with the ÎNoLS mutant or full-length isoform that both lack RRQR motif.</p>
        <p>Typically, nucleolar retention of regulatory factors depends on ongoing rDNA transcription. To examine whether nucleolar localization of the extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> mutant depends on ongoing rDNA transcription, we analysed its localization in the presence of a low concentration of actinomycin D (50 ng/ml), which specifically inhibits RNA Pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Perry and Kelley, 1970</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>, nucleolar localization of extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> was lost in the presence of actinomycin D, whereas inhibition of RNA Pol II driven transcription with Î±-amanitin had no effect on the localization of the extended isoform. Taken together, these results show that extended-C/EBPÎ± interacts with functional nucleolar proteins, UBF-1 and NPM, and the SL1 components TBP and TAF<sub>I</sub>48, and that its nucleolar retention depends on ongoing rDNA transcription.</p>

        <title>Extended-C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> stimulates RNA Pol I-dependent rRNA synthesis</title>
        <p>As C/EBPÎ± is a transcription factor, we examined whether extended-C/EBPÎ± was able to regulate RNA Pol I-mediated rRNA synthesis as has been shown also for other RNA Pol II-dependent transcription factors, including c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arabi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). To address this question, we co-transfected a human rRNA minigene reporter construct (pMr1930-BH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) together with expression vectors for extended-C/EBPÎ± in HEK293T cells. We observed that overexpression of both extended-C/EBPÎ± and the S299D mutant thereof strongly induced RNA Pol I-mediated transcription of the reporter RNA to a similar extent as c-Myc, which was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). To examine whether extended-C/EBPÎ± is able to stimulate endogenous rDNA transcription, we analysed the expression levels of 45S pre-rRNA by Northern blotting in long-term C33A cell lines that stably express extended-, full-length- or truncated-C/EBPÎ± wt proteins, the S299D mutants thereof and ÎNoLS mutants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref> shows that expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± and extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> results in increased levels of endogenous 45S pre-rRNA compared with the empty vector control. In contrast, expression of the full-length- or truncated-C/EBPÎ± isoforms either with or without the S299D mutation was not able to enhance 45S pre-rRNA levels. The ÎNoLS mutation prevents induction of 45S pr-RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). To examine a possible indirect Pol II-dependent regulation of rDNA transcription by extended-C/EBPÎ±, 45S pre-rRNA levels were analysed under inhibition of Pol II by Î±-amanitin (50 Î¼g/ml). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref> show that inhibition of Pol II only slightly affected induction of 45S pre-rRNA, suggesting a direct regulation of Pol I by extended-C/EBPÎ±. To examine whether selective elimination of extended-C/EBPÎ± impedes rRNA synthesis, we knocked-down expression of endogenous C/EBPÎ± in HL-60 cells by introduction of lentiviral human C/EBPÎ±-specific shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A</xref>). Subsequently, in the C/EBPÎ± knock-down cells, expression was restored from retrovirally transduced constructs coding for all three C/EBPÎ±-FLAG isoforms, or from a construct with a ÎCUG mutation avoiding expression of the extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8B</xref>). As demonstrated by Northern analysis, 45S pre-rRNA levels were only significantly stimulated in the presence of extended-C/EBPÎ± and not when full-length- and truncated-C/EBPÎ± are expressed alone from the ÎCUGÎ± construct. Once more, the requirement of the N-terminal NoLS was demonstrated as stimulation of 45S pre-rRNA levels by overexpression of extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> alone is abrogated when NoLS is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8C</xref>). Taken together, extended-C/EBPÎ± directly and specifically enhances rDNA transcription, which depends on nucleolar retention mediated by the N-terminally located NoLS.</p>
        <p>Bioinformatic analysis revealed two C/EBP-binding motifs in the intergenic spacer of the human rDNA repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A</xref>). One of the C/EBP-binding motifs lies 25 bp upstream of the transcription start, in the same proximal promoter sequences that are crucial for Pol I regulation by c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A</xref>; region Cp, same as region 42.9 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using anti-C/EBPÎ± antibodies revealed that extended-C/EBPÎ± occupies this rDNA promoter segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B</xref>; upper chart, region Cp) in C33A cells. Notably, the more efficient nucleolar retention of extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> results in recovery of more Cp DNA fragments whereas the ÎNoLS mutation abolishes DNA recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B and C</xref>). In addition, extended-C/EBPÎ± binds to a more distal region containing the second C/EBP-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A and B</xref>; upper chart, region Cd). Extended-C/EBPÎ± does not interact with region M that does not contain a C/EBP-binding motif, which, however, was shown to be implicated in c-Myc-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9A and B</xref>; region M, same as region 42 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>Region Cp covers the Pol I promoter and is also heavily occupied by UBF-1, as was also observed by others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B</xref>, lower chart, region Cp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; here region 42.9). Interestingly, the enhanced interaction of extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> with the regions Cp and Cd improves recruitment of UBF-1 to these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9B and C</xref>). To investigate whether extended-C/EBPÎ± also facilitates the recruitment of components of the SL1 complex to the rDNA promoter, we performed a ChIP assay using an anti-TBP antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9D</xref> shows that indeed recruitment of TBP is enhanced on extended-C/EBPÎ± binding to region Cp. c-Myc like extended-C/EBPÎ± binds most strongly to region Cp and stimulates histone H3 and H4 acetylation especially at the neighbouring region M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). C/EBPÎ± is known to activate transcription from Pol II promoters through recruitment of histone acetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Erickson <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bararia <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). ChIP analysis using anti-histone H3 or H4 antibodies revealed that histone acetylation is enhanced particularly at site M and to a lesser extend to Cp when extended-C/EBPÎ± binds to the rDNA promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9E</xref>). Hence, our results suggest that the occupation of the rDNA promoter region by extended-C/EBPÎ± facilitates recruitment of UBF-1 and SL1, and induces histone acetylation.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of extended-C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> results in an increase in cell size</title>
        <p>Increase in cell size is a well-known consequence of enhanced ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Baserga, 2007</xref>), and the stimulation of rRNA synthesis by c-Myc has been associated with increased cell size in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Oskarsson and Trumpp, 2005</xref>). Cell volume analysis of the stably transfected cells revealed that expression of extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>wt</sup>- and in particular the extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> isoform results in a profound increase in the mean cell volume, whereas the other isoforms show no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>). C33A cells lack a functional Brahma protein as part of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, which is required for C/EBPÎ±-induced proliferation arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">MÃ¼ller <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). To study whether the absence of Brahma is instrumental in the pronounced increase in cell volume, we analysed C33A cells in which Brahma function was restored by expression from a retroviral construct compared with dominant negative mutant of Brahma and empty vector. In none of the situations, however, cell size was affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). Hence, Brahma function has no effect on cell size. In addition, over-expression of extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>wt</sup>- and the extended-C/EBPÎ±<sup>S299D</sup> isoform in HEK293 cells that have a functional SWI/SNF complex resulted in a clear although less pronounced increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we reveal a novel function of the transcription factor C/EBPÎ± that is specific for the translational protein isoform called extended-C/EBPÎ±. Results presented in this manuscript provide evidence that extended-C/EBPÎ± localizes in the nucleoli and stimulates RNA Pol I-dependent rDNA transcription, and concomitantly increases cell size.</p>

        <title>Regulation of Pol I activity and rRNA synthesis by C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic></title>
        <p>We show an increase in rRNA levels from endogenous loci and increased Pol I transcription from an rRNA minigene reporter in response to extended-C/EBPÎ± expression. These findings are supported by ChIP assays that revealed interaction of extended-C/EBPÎ± with rDNA promoter sequences. Furthermore, expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± results in increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 within the rDNA promoter, reflecting enhanced promoter activation through recruitment of acetyltransferases. Finally, our results suggest that extended-C/EBPÎ± stimulates Pol I pre-initiation complex formation as extended-C/EBPÎ± interacts with UBF-1 and components of the SL1 complex, and facilitates their recruitment to rDNA promoter sites. Remarkably, similar functions have also been described for c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Arabi <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Indeed, both proteins can bind to the proximal promoter region (region Cp), recruit the same set of factors and induce histone acetylation in the same region M. Other RNA Pol II transcription factors like Runx2, MyoD, Myogenin and C/EBPÎ² interact with rRNA genes, yet repress rRNA synthesis during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Grandori <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Young <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ali <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). These inhibitory factors contact the rRNA promoter during mitosis when the nucleolar structures are dissolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Young <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ali <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), making nucleolar retention signals dispensable. This stands in contrast to the activating function of extended-C/EBPÎ± that requires the NoLS for rDNA promoter binding and stimulation of rRNA synthesis.</p>
        <p>We show that besides extended- also full-length-C/EBPÎ± interacts with UBF-1. In contrast to the extended isoform, full-length-C/EBPÎ± is not retained in the nucleoli and rather seems to inhibit rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7B</xref>; data not shown). Interestingly, the Pol I inhibitory factors Runx2, MyoD and Myogenin also interact with UBF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Young <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ali <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although the observed repression by full-length-C/EBPÎ± could be caused indirectly by its anti-proliferative activities, or through sequestration of UBF-1 within the nucleoplasm, it may inhibit rRNA synthesis involving direct rDNA promoter interaction similarly to Runx2, MyoD or Myogenin. Such a direct interaction of full-length C/EBPÎ± with the rDNA promoter is likely as we recovered promoter rDNA (region Cp) in ChIP analysis using both anti-UBF-1 as well as anti-C/EBPÎ± antibodies from proliferating HL-60 cells expressing all translational C/EBPÎ± isoforms as well as from differentiating HL-60 cells, which express only the full-length C/EBPÎ± isoform (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Overexpression of extended-C/EBPÎ±, in particular of the S299D mutant that shows augmented nucleolar retention and Pol I activation, results in a pronounced increase in cell volume. Obviously, cell growth (increase in cell size) requires an enhanced protein biosynthesis rate, which directly depends on ribosome biogenesis with rRNA synthesis as the rate-limiting process. Accordingly, other positive regulators of Pol1-dependent rRNA transcription like c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Oskarsson and Trumpp, 2005</xref>) and IRS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Valentinis <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sun <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) are able to increase cell size in specific systems.</p>

        <title>Specific nucleolar retention of the extended-C/EBP<italic>Î±</italic> isoform</title>
        <p>Extended-C/EBPÎ± is the only translational C/EBPÎ± isoform that can be retained in the nucleoli. This can be explained by the presence of a conserved RRXR nucleolar localization (NoLS) motif in the N-terminal part of the protein that is also found in other nucleolar-retained factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jarrous <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Weber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Zhang and Xiong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meder <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). For both Parp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Li, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meder <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and extended-C/EBPÎ± (this study), the RRXR motif is required for interaction with NPM (also known as B23), which could mean that either these factors need to be nucleolar to interact with NPM or that they are recruited to the nucleolus through binding to NPM. NPM is implicated in cancer pathogenesis as it is over-expressed in a diversity of solid tumours, and in several haematologic malignancies the <italic>NPM1</italic> gene is found mutated or rearranged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Falini <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it would be interesting to examine whether cancerous mutations of NPM have an effect on functions of C/EBPÎ± in the control of cell proliferation and growth.</p>
        <p>Apart from the RRXR motif, we observed that a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation of a Serine residue within the NLS (S299 as numbered for the full-length isoform) strongly enhances nucleolar retention of extended-C/EBPÎ±. This observation is reminiscent to the contribution of NLSs of Parp2 or ING1b that contribute to the efficiency of nucleolar retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Meder <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Serine 299 lies in a region that is conserved between all C/EBPs and its phosphorylation has been associated with opposite effects on DNA binding and/or subcellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mahoney <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Yin <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Buck <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). As we observed that in long-term cultures of cells that stably express the wild-type extended-C/EBPÎ± isoform, the percentage of cells with nucleolar localization of extended-C/EBPÎ± continuously increases, a physiological mechanism must exist that stimulates nucleolar retention and thereby provides a proliferation or survival advantage for the cells. To adequately address which signalling pathways could be involved, a more comprehensive experimental setup is required.</p>

        <p>The lack of antibodies that specifically recognize extended-C/EBPÎ± and the impossibility to specifically target the endogenous protein by knockdown strategies (all protein isoforms can be translated from a single mRNA molecule) makes it technically difficult to address its physiological functions and sites of action in depth. Nevertheless, we could detect C/EBPÎ±-specific nucleolar localization and expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± in the leukemia cell line HL-60. The concomitant loss of both, C/EBPÎ±-specific nucleolar localization and extended isoform expression during HL-60 differentiation provides a good indication that extended-C/EBPÎ± is responsible for the nucleolar staining in the undifferentiated cells. We presume that expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± is likely to be timely and spatially restricted only to those few cells that proliferate in a tissue. Preliminary analysis of primary bone marrow cells revealed weak but consistent staining of C/EBPÎ± in the nucleoli as well as detection of an extended isoform by immunoblotting (data not shown). To uncover extended-C/EBPÎ± physiology <italic>in vivo</italic> in more detail, antibodies have to be generated that specifically recognize this isoform. In addition, a mouse model in which either expression of extended-C/EBPÎ± is abrogated by mutation of its initiation codon by a knock-in approach, or in which extended-C/EBPÎ± can be induced from a transgene would be instrumental.</p>

The truncated-C/EBPÎ± isoform that is co-regulated with the extended isoform in HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), however, drives proliferation in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Calkhoven <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). We would like to propose a hypothetical translational switch model explaining how controlled translation into extended- and truncated-C/EBPÎ± contributes to coordination of cell growth and proliferation: the truncated isoform blocks the anti-proliferative activity of the full-length isoform in the nucleus; the extended isoform escapes from this inhibition by relocating to the nucleolus where it stimulates rRNA synthesis as prerequisite for cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>

Treatments with actinomycin D (50 ng/ml; Sigma) or Î±-amanitin (50 Î¼g/ml; Sigma) were done for 2 h before fixation. For immunostaining, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37Â°C, washed three times with PBS for 5 min at RT, permeabilized with 0.3% triton X-100 for 5 min at RT, blocked in 3% BSA in PBS and incubated with primary antibody (anti-C/EBPÎ± 14AA, C18, N19 or anti-UBF-1 F-9: 1 Î¼g/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-C/EBPÎ± MA1-825 (1 Î¼g/ml, ABR Affinity BioReagents); anti-Fibrillarin AFB01 (2.5 Î¼g/ml, Cytoskeleton Inc.) for 45 min at RT. After triple washing for 10 min with PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 45 min at RT, then triple washed again and incubated with DAPI (1 mg/ml MeOH) for 15 min at RT. After triple washing for 10 min with PBS and single rinsing with H<sub>2</sub>O at RT, coverslips were mounted with Moviol (Sigma) onto glass slides. Microscopic analysis was performed with the ApoTome deconvolution system (Zeiss). Cell volume in femtoliter was determined using the CASY Model TTC (Innovatis).</p>
