      <abstract>
        <p>Growth factor stimulation induces the formation of dynamic actin structures known as dorsal ruffles. Mammalian actin-binding protein-1 (mAbp1) is an actin-binding protein that has been implicated in regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis; however, a role for mAbp1 in regulating the dynamics of growth factorâinduced actin-based structures has not been defined. Here we show that mAbp1 localizes to dorsal ruffles and is necessary for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated dorsal ruffle formation. Despite their structural similarity, we find that mAbp1 and cortactin have nonredundant functions in the regulation of dorsal ruffle formation. mAbp1, like cortactin, is a calpain 2 substrate and the preferred cleavage site occurs between the actin-binding domain and the proline-rich region, generating a C-terminal mAbp1 fragment that inhibits dorsal ruffle formation. Furthermore, mAbp1 directly interacts with the actin regulatory protein WASp-interacting protein (WIP) through its SH3 domain. Finally, we demonstrate that the interaction between mAbp1 and WIP is important in regulating dorsal ruffle formation and that WIP-mediated effects on dorsal ruffle formation require mAbp1. Taken together, these findings identify a novel role for mAbp1 in growth factorâinduced dorsal ruffle formation through its interaction with WIP.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is important for many cellular processes including endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and cell motility. The actin cytoskeleton is regulated temporally and spatially to form specialized structures such as growth factorâinduced dorsal ruffles and lamellipodia. Dorsal ruffles are highly dynamic structures that form on the dorsal surface of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in response to treatment with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Orth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Orth and McNiven, 2006</xref>). Dorsal ruffles are important for diverse cellular processes including cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Suetsugu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and internalization of growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Orth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Several actin regulatory and binding proteins including N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Legg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), WASp-interacting protein (WIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Krueger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) localize to these structures and have been implicated in their function.</p><p>Mammalian actin-binding protein 1 (mAbp1) is an F-actinâbinding protein that regulates both endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kessels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Connert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). mAbp1 was originally identified as a protein tyrosine kinase substrate. The N-terminal region of mAbp1 consists of an actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domain, followed by a charged Î±-helical domain, both of which bind to F-actin. After the F-actinâbinding domains, there is a proline-rich region, which contains putative SH3-domain binding sites and two YXXP consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Larbolette <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kessels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The C-terminus also contains an SH3 domain, which binds to proteins involved in endocytosis, such as dynamin 1, and signaling proteins including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK) and the Cdc42 exchange factor Fgd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kessels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Schafer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Fenster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have revealed regulatory roles for mAbp1 in receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kessels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Mise-Omata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), T-cell receptor signaling and internalization, B-cell receptor antigen processing and presentation, and neutrophil adhesion and integrin-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Le Bras <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Han <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Onabajo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Schymeinsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, mAbp1 knockout mice display severe behavioral abnormalities attributed at least in part to a defect in vesicle fusion and trafficking in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Connert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, despite its importance in regulating endocytosis, previous studies have not investigated a role for mAbp1 in regulating actin-based structures such as dorsal ruffles.</p><p>Cortactin is another F-actinâbinding protein that is structurally similar to mAbp1. It has been reported that cortactin localizes to dorsal ruffles and is necessary for dorsal ruffle formation through its interaction with dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Krueger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Cortactin contains similar domains to mAbp1 including an actin-binding domain, a proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain that mediates proteinâprotein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Wu and Parsons, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kessels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Cortactin activity is regulated in part by limited proteolysis mediated by the calcium-dependent protease calpain 2, and this proteolytic event has been shown to modulate both cell protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Perrin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and invadopodia dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cortesio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study we examined the role of mAbp1 in PDGF-induced dorsal ruffle formation. We show that both mAbp1 and cortactin are necessary for dorsal ruffle formation; however, despite their structural similarity, mAbp1 and cortactin have nonredundant functions in the regulation of dorsal ruffles. We identify mAbp1 as a novel calpain 2 substrate and show that a cleavage fragment of mAbp1 negatively regulates dorsal ruffle formation. We also identify WIP as a novel mAbp1-binding partner and show that mutations that abrogate the mAbp1-WIP interaction impair dorsal ruffle formation. Finally we demonstrate that WIP-mediated effects on dorsal ruffle formation require mAbp1 but not cortactin. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for mAbp1 in dorsal ruffle formation through its interaction with WIP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and Antibodies</title><p>Fibronectin was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Ruoslahti <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>).

EGFP-actin was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). EGFP-cortactin has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Perrin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Myc-mAbp1 was generated by PCR amplification of mAbp1 with an EcoRI-containing forward primer and an XhoI-containing reverse primer followed by ligation to pcDNA3.1, which contained a myc tag sequence. Mutations were introduced into the calpain cleavage site by site-directed mutagenesis of myc-mAbp1 DNA: D6 primer: 5â²CACCACCTCTGGCCTGCAGAAGCAACTC, L289G primer: 5â²CAGCCGGGCAAGGGGAGGAGCCCCTTC; the WIP binding site (W415K) of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mAbp1 primer: 5â²GTGATTGACGAAGGCTGGAAGCGAGGCTATGGGCCTG; the mAbp1 binding site (Î110-170) of GFP-WIP primer: 5â²AGGATTGTTCCAGGCTGGAATGCCGCCCCCAAGGCCCGACGTGGGCTCAA or into GFP-mAbp1 to create silent mutations using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP-mAbp1 constructs were made by PCR amplification of wild-type or mutant mAbp1 with an EcoRI-containing forward primer and a BamHI-containing reverse primer, followed by ligation to pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). C-terminally Flag-mAbp1 was produced by PCR amplifying mAbp1 with a BamHI-containing forward primer and an XhoI-containing reverse primer that omitted the stop codon and was ligated into pCDNA 3.1-Flag. pCDNA 3.1 Flag was made by annealing a Flag tag oligo containing PstI and XhoI sites into linearized pCDNA 3.1 vector. C-terminally GST-tagged mAbp1 was produced by separately PCR amplifying mAbp1 and GST. mAbp1 was amplified with a BamHI-containing forward primer and an EcoRI-containing reverse primer that omitted the stop codon. GST was amplified from pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using an EcoRI-containing forward primer and a HindIII-containing reverse primer. Both PCR products were simultaneously ligated into pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) that had been digested with BamHI and HindIII, to generate a His-mAbp1-GST fusion. The GFP-mAbp1-N terminal fragment was amplified from full- length pEGFP-mAbp1 with a KpnI-containing forward primer and a BamHI reverse primer that introduced a stop codon. The GFP-mAbp1-C terminal fragment was amplified from full-length pEGFP-mAbp1 with a KpnI-containing forward primer, which introduced a start codon, and a BamHI reverse primer. Both the N- and C-terminal fragments were subsequently ligated into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Flag-hWIP was provided by Scott Weed (University of West Virginia). WIP was amplified from pCDNA 3.1 Flag-WIP with a HindIII-containing forward primer and an EcoRI-containing reverse primer and ligated into the pmCherry-C1 vector to make pmCherry-WIP. Cloning of the pmCherry-C1 vector has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Lokuta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). GFP-WIP was constructed by excision of WIP from pmCherry-WIP with HindIII and EcoRI and ligation into pEGFP-C1. N-WASP was amplified with an EcoRI-containing forward primer and an XhoI-containing reverse primer and ligated into pCDNA 3.1-Flag. The pSUPER.retro (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) RNAi system was utilized to achieve stable expression of short interfering RNAs. Oligonucleotides targeted to mAbp1 mRNA as well as a nonsilencing control were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), annealed, and cloned into the pSUPER.retro.puro vector according to manufacturer's instructions. Retroviral transfection was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Franco <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Wild type NIH-3T3 cells were infected twice at 32Â°C for 6 h and allowed to recover in growth medium for 24 h before selection with 1 Î¼g/ml puromycin for 4â5 d. Target sequences for nonsilencing were as follows: for NIH-3T3 cells: control: 5â²TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT3â²; for mAbp1 siRNA: 5â²AGAAGAACCTACATATGAA; and for cortactin siRNA: 5â²GGAACACATCAACATTCAC. Target sequences for calpain 2 in NIH-3T3 cells have been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Franco <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

To determine if calpain-mediated proteolysis of mAbp1 is important in dorsal ruffle formation, cells stably expressing control or mAbp1 siRNA were transiently transfected with GFP, wild-type GFP-mAbp1, or GFP-mAbp1-D6-L289G. In accordance with our previous data, mAbp1-deficient cells expressing GFP alone showed impaired dorsal ruffle formation compared with control cells.

Expression of either the GFP-tagged N- or C-terminal fragments in mAbp1-deficient cells was not sufficient to rescue dorsal ruffle formation, demonstrating that the mAbp1 actin-binding domains or the proline rich/SH3 domains alone are not able to rescue dorsal ruffle formation (data not shown). To determine if the calpain-generated fragments have an inhibitory effect on dorsal ruffle formation, parental NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected with GFP, wild-type GFP-mAbp1, GFP-N-terminal or C-terminal mAbp1 fragments and treated with PDGF to induce dorsal ruffle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Expression of wild-type or the N-terminal fragment of mAbp1 had minimal effects on dorsal ruffle formation compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). In contrast, expression of the C-terminal mAbp1 fragment decreased dorsal ruffle formation by approximately threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). These findings suggest that the C-terminal calpain proteolytic fragment plays an inhibitory role in dorsal ruffle formation. Interestingly, calpain-mediated proteolysis of mAbp1 was enhanced in PDGF-treated NIH-3T3 cells at time points greater than 30 min when dorsal ruffles no longer form in response to growth factor (Supplemental Figure 2), suggesting that PDGF-induced proteolysis of mAbp1 may contribute to the cessation of dorsal ruffle formation after PDGF stimulation.

Dorsal ruffle formation was impaired more than twofold in mAbp1-deficient cells, similar to the phenotype observed in both cortactin and WIP-deficient cells. This is the first study to identify mAbp1 as a calpain substrate and as a novel WIP binding partner. Despite having similar binding partners and modes of regulation, we show that mAbp1 and cortactin have nonredundant functions in dorsal ruffle formation. Interestingly, calpain-mediated proteolysis of mAbp1 is not necessary for the formation of dorsal ruffles but instead may negatively regulate dorsal ruffle formation through the generation of an inhibitory C-terminal mAbp1 fragment. Our findings demonstrate that a critical determinant of mAbp1 function in dorsal ruffle formation is mediated through its SH3 domain, likely through its interaction with WIP. Finally, WIP-mediated effects on dorsal ruffles in NIH-3T3 cells require mAbp1, but not cortactin. Taken together, our findings identify a novel role for mAbp1 in growth factorâinduced dorsal ruffle formation through its interaction with WIP.</p><p>Growth factor-induced dorsal ruffles have been implicated in diverse cellular processes including the endocytosis of growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Krueger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Orth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), dissolution of actin-containing stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Orth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Warn <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). The signaling pathways that mediate the dynamics of dorsal ruffles have been the focus of recent investigation. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the formation of dorsal ruffles including Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Veracini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), RhoGTPases and PI3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Suetsugu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the GTPase dynamin has been shown to be critical for growth factor stimulated dorsal ruffles through its interaction with cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Krueger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Here we demonstrate that mAbp1 is necessary for efficient dorsal ruffle formation. It is particularly interesting that despite their structural similarities, mAbp1 and cortactin have nonredundant roles in the regulation of dorsal ruffles.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that several proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton are calpain substrates. Calpain 2âmediated proteolysis of cortactin regulates both membrane protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Perrin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and invadopodia dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cortesio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Furthermore the downstream Rac effectors that stimulate Arp 2/3-dependent actin polymerization, WAVE1, WAVE2 and WAVE 3, are also subject to calpain-mediated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Oda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that actin regulatory proteins are an important class of calpain substrates. Calpain-mediated proteolysis of mAbp1 separates the F-actinâbinding domain and the SH3 domain. Interestingly, expression of the SH3 domainâcontaining fragment of mAbp1 inhibited dorsal ruffle formation, likely through its association with WIP because WIP overexpression rescued the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). It is possible that calpain proteolysis of mAbp1 may also be important for regulating other processes mediated by mAbp1, such as vesicle trafficking. This merits further study since calpains have been implicated in synaptic vesicle assembly and budding as well as endosomal recycling and vesicle fusion during exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Evans and Turner, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, cortactin is also cleaved between the F-actinâbinding domain and the SH3 domain, suggesting that mAbp1 and cortactin are similarly regulated by calpain proteases. Furthermore, the proline-rich domains of mAbp1 and cortactin are also both phosphorylated by Src-family kinases and in vitro evidence suggests phosphorylation of cortactin results in increased susceptibility to calpain proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). In the future it will be interesting to determine if Src signaling affects the calpain-mediated proteolysis of mAbp1.</p><p>Although yeast Abp1 binds directly to Arp 2/3 to activate its actin nucleation activity, mAbp1 lacks the canonical sequences required for Arp 2/3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Schafer, 2002</xref>). However, it has been postulated that mAbp1 may promote Arp 2/3 activity through an alternative mechanism. Our data support the interesting possibility that mAbp1 may regulate Arp 2/3 activity and thereby dorsal ruffle formation through binding WIP. Accordingly, a role for WIP in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton has been previously established. WIP interacts directly with both actin and N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Martinez-Quiles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, WIP-deficient fibroblasts have decreased PDGF-induced dorsal ruffle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and N-WASPâmediated activation of Arp 2/3 is necessary for dorsal ruffle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Legg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, WIP-mediated dorsal ruffle formation is not likely to occur through its interaction with N-WASP because WIP binding to N-WASP has been shown to inhibit Arp 2/3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Martinez-Quiles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Alternatively, WIP may promote actin polymerization by its ability to stabilize F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Martinez-Quiles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, the ability of WIP to regulate dorsal ruffles was shown to be dependent in part on its ability to bind actin; however, WIP regulation may also require interactions with SH3-domainâcontaining proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We have identified a novel, direct interaction between mAbp1 and WIP that is abrogated by a mutation in the SH3 domain of mAbp1, W415K. The SH3 domain mutant mAbp1, W415K, was unable to rescue dorsal ruffle formation in mAbp1-deficient cells, indicating that WIP binding to the SH3 domain of mAbp1 is likely critical for dorsal ruffle formation. mAbp1 binds to several proteins through its SH3 domain, and we cannot rule out that other mAbp1-binding proteins, such as dynamin, may also contribute to the regulation of dorsal ruffles by mAbp1. A mutant form of WIP, Î110-170, which is deficient in mAbp1 binding, further supports a role for a mAbp1-WIP interaction in the formation of dorsal ruffles. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), overexpression of wild-type WIP enhanced dorsal ruffle formation; however, the Î110-170 WIP mutant was unable to enhance dorsal ruffle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). In further support of an important role for the WIP-mAbp1 interaction, WIP effects on dorsal ruffle formation required the expression of mAbp1 but not cortactin. The data support an essential role for mAbp1 in WIP-mediated dorsal ruffle formation. It is interesting that although PDGF treatment enhanced the interaction of mAbp1 and WIP by approximately twofold, it had no effect on the association between N-WASP and WIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Taken together, our data suggest that mAbp1 mediates dorsal ruffle formation through its interaction with WIP.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a novel role for mAbp1 in growth factorâmediated dorsal ruffle formation. Our data support a model where the mAbp1-WIP complex, independent of cortactin, is necessary for efficient dorsal ruffle formation. It is possible that mAbp1 associates with and recruits WIP to sites of growth factorâmediated actin remodeling to affect dorsal ruffle formation. However, live imaging did not provide the resolution to determine if mAbp1 is in fact recruited to dorsal ruffles before WIP. A challenge for future investigation will be to define the temporal and spatial recruitment and activity of these key actin regulatory components during the formation of dorsal ruffles. In any case, on the basis of our findings, we propose that mAbp1 recruits WIP to dorsal ruffles providing a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the Arp2/3 complex to regulate actin dynamics during dorsal ruffle formation.</p></sec>
