      <abstract>
        <p>Chromosome segregation errors during meiosis result in the formation of aneuploid gametes and are the leading cause of pregnancy loss and birth defects in humans. Proper chromosome segregation requires pairwise associations of maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes. Chiasmata, which are the cytological manifestations of crossovers (COs), provide a physical link that holds the homologs together as a pair, facilitating their orientation on the spindle at meiosis I. Although CO-promoting activities ensure a balanced number and position of COs, their identity and mechanism of action in mammals remain understudied. Previous work in yeast and Arabidopsis has shown that Zip2 and Shoc1 are ortholog proteins with an important role in promoting the formation of COs. Our work is the first study in mammals showing the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> function of mouse and human SHOC1. We show that purified recombinant human SHOC1, an XPF/MUS81 family member, preferentially binds branched DNA molecules but apparently lacks <italic>in vitro</italic> endonuclease activity, despite its conserved ERCC4-(HhH)<sub>2</sub> core structure. Cytological observations suggest that initial steps of recombination are normal in a majority of spermatocytes from SHOC1 hypomorphic mice. However, late stages of recombination appear abnormal, as chromosomal localization of MLH1 is reduced. In agreement, chiasma formation is reduced, and cells arrest at metaphase I with a few lagging chromosomes and subsequent apoptosis. This analysis of SHOC1-deficient mice and the selective localization of SHOC1 to a subset of recombination sites show that SHOC1 acts at key mid-stage steps of the CO formation process. The formation of chromosome axial elements and homologous pairing are apparently normal, but synapsis is altered with SYCP1 frequently failing to extend the full length of the chromosome axes. Finally, we describe that SHOC1 interacts with TEX11, another protein important for the formation of COs, connecting SHOC1 to chromosome axis and structure.</p>

        <p>Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division in which haploid gametes are generated to counterbalance the doubling of the chromosome number occurring at fertilization. Proper chromosome segregation requires pairwise associations of the maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes. This is provided by chiasmata, which are generated as a result of homologous recombination-mediated repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The association of meiotic chromosomes in pairs through chiasmata guarantees that each gamete receives only one copy of each chromosome. For this reason, errors in recombination are commonly linked to spontaneous abortions, aneuploid-based birth defects, and in some cases, infertility. We observed that the absence of SHOC1 results in deficient recombination and incomplete meiosis-specific modification of chromosome structure. Our findings thus indicate that the mouse SHOC1 protein is required for normal progression of important aspects of meiosis that act to ensure that the correct numbers of chromosomes are transferred to the next generation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cells in meiosis undergo two rounds of chromosome segregation after only one round of DNA replication. This highly regulated, specialized cell division generates haploid gametes containing a single copy of each chromosome. For maternal and paternal copies of each chromosome to segregate properly, the homologs must first pair with their correct partner and then become physically connected by chiasmata, the cytological representation of crossover (CO) products from homologous recombination (HR). The tether provided by COs allows the chromosome pair to orient correctly on the meiotic spindle [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, mutations that alter recombination increase meiotic chromosome segregation errors and can result in aneuploid gametes.</p>
      <p>In most organisms, meiotic recombination is initiated by chromosomal DNA cleavage by the SPO11 protein [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The DNA ends at DSBs are resected to produce single-stranded DNA that binds two recombinases, RAD51 and DMC1. During strand invasion, these nucleoprotein filaments invade an intact homologous sequence [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] to form single end heteroduplex invasion intermediates, which can be extended by DNA synthesis. Strand invasion intermediate processing may occur by one of two distinct pathways. The intermediates may dissociate with subsequent re-joining of the broken ends by synthesis-dependent strand annealing to generate non-crossovers (NCO). Alternatively, the initial strand invasion intermediate may become stabilized by 3â² to 5â² unwinding of duplex DNA that promotes synthesis-mediated extension, which induces more stable single-end invasions [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and double Holliday junctions (dHJs) [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These last two intermediates have been shown to occur in yeast only. Intermediates in the second pathway complete repair to generate COs [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Two distinct classes of COs are formed [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The majority of COs (90â95% in the mouse) are formed through multiple steps occurring throughout meiotic progression that require the ZMM group of proteins, which includes the SYCP1 protein from the transverse filaments of the synaptonemal complex [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the ATP-dependent helicase Mer3/HFM1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the MSH4-MSH5 complex [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This class of COs (Class I) exhibits unique properties such as interference [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is defined as the non-random placement of crossovers, such that the formation of one crossover affects the likelihood of formation of a second crossover in an adjacent region. The second class of COs (Class II) involves structure specific endonucleases like MUS81 [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the regulation of crossing-over is critical in meiosis of all organisms, we still do not know the identity of several key activities and control mechanisms in mammals.</p>
      <p>Zip2 is a yeast protein with an important role in meiosis. In the absence of Zip2, homologous chromosomes are properly paired (aligned) but not synapsed (juxtaposed and intimately bound by the synaptonemal complex). It has been proposed that Zip2 promotes initiation of chromosome synapsis by localizing at sites of interhomolog recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Later work showed that in the absence of Zip2, single-end invasion intermediates form at wild type levels, but are maintained at peak levels for much longer than in wild type cells. Furthermore, double-Holliday junction patterns are also defective and yield a 40â50% reduction in the number of COs, which appear with substantial delay with respect to wild type. Defects in CO formation are even higher when specific hotspots are analyzed [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic>zip2</italic> mutations also prevent the formation of normal synaptonemal complex [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Later work on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> revealed that the Shoc1 protein, a novel member of the ZMM group of proteins and an ortholog of Zip2, is required for class I CO formation [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Plants lacking Shoc1 protein show impaired meiosis but show no other developmental defects. Shoc1 mutant meiocytes resemble those from wild type plants at the leptotene and pachytene stages, with apparent normal homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis. However, cells at diakinesis show a mixture of univalents and bivalents, revealing reduced numbers of chiasmata, which causes an uneven distribution of chromosomes after anaphase I and unbalanced chromosome numbers in spores after the second meiotic division. Dmc1 focus numbers are not affected, but chiasmata frequencies in Shoc1 mutants are significantly lower than in wild type. Further, Arabidopsis <italic>Shoc1</italic> belongs to the same epistatic group as <italic>Msh5</italic>, which acts with Msh4 and Zip4 in the same pathway for CO formation.</p>
      <p>A distinctive feature of plant Shoc1 proteins is a highly conserved region with an Ercc4-helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)<sub>2</sub> core typically found in Xpf/Mus81 family members and suggestive of endonuclease and DNA binding activity. The (HhH)<sub>2</sub> structure typically consists of two consecutive HhH motifs that are linked by a connector helix, and is often involved in non-sequence specific DNA binding. This core can be used to identify homologs in Fungi, Metazoa, Mycetozoa, and mammals via a reciprocal PSI-BLAST procedure [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, Arabidopsis Shoc1 has a high structural similarity to human (C9ORF84), mouse (AI481877) (SHOC1/ZIP2H), and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (Zip2) proteins, which indicates these are probably orthologs. Xpf/Mus81 protein family members are conserved in eukaryotes and archaea, where they exist as either heterodimers or homodimers, respectively. Humans and mice have three endonucleases with the catalytic activity first known as XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, and MUS81-EME2. Vertebrates including humans have two additional XPF/MUS81 family members, FANCM and FAAP24, which form heterodimers with no detected endonuclease activity [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Within a heterodimer, the catalytic subunits share a characteristic core containing an ERCC4-like nuclease domain (GDX<sub>n</sub>ERKX<sub>3</sub>D) and a tandem (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domain. This ERCC4-(HhH)<sub>2</sub> arrangement also occurs in non-catalytic subunits, but they have highly diverged sequences. For example, the ERCC4 domain in human FANCM lacks the lysine side chain, which is consistent with observations that FANCM-FAAP24 has no endonuclease activity [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This may reflect non-catalytic roles for these domains, such as binding ssDNA or targeting to defined DNA structures or sites of DNA damage [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>A minimum number of COs must be formed in a cell to connect pairs of homologous chromosomes and promote their proper segregation on the first meiotic spindle. Although pro-crossover activities play a central role in this process by ensuring that a subset of DSBs is repaired into COs, several of these proteins in mammals are unidentified, and for those we have recognized, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. While recent studies of plant Shoc1 suggest that the functionality of Shoc1 depends on the formation of a Shoc1-Ptd1 complex [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] similar to that described for Xpf-Ercc1, we still do not understand the function of SHOC1 orthologs in mammalian meiosis. Our studies integrate <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical mechanisms of recombination mediated by SHOC1 and the meiotic phenotype of <italic>Shoc1</italic> deficient mice to provide a comprehensive functional and mechanistic understanding of the SHOC1 protein in mammalian meiosis.</p>

        <title>Kinetics of SHOC1 association to meiotic chromosomes</title>
        <p>We first used immunocytochemistry to assess the kinetics of SHOC1 association and dissociation at recombination sites in mouse meiotic chromosomes. We used rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for mouse SHOC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). SHOC1 antibodies recognize only one band at approximately the expected molecular weight in Western blots of wild type testis extract. Preincubation of SHOC1 antibodies with a SHOC1 protein fragment used to produce these antibodies abolishes reactivity against SHOC1 in Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescent localization of SHOC1 in wild type spermatocyte chromosome spreads showed that a maximum number of foci can be detected at mid zygotene stage (199 Â± 19 foci/cell, mean Â± SD, n = 37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). No signal was detected when we used this antibody to immunostain <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocyte spreads (see description of this mutant below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This may reflect the lack of sensitivity of SHOC1 antibodies to reduced amount of SHOC1 in the mutant mice (see below) or inability of the remaining SHOC1 to accumulate at recombination sites. Our results suggest a role of SHOC1 in the intermediate stages of recombination.</p>

        <title>SHOC1 associates with mid-stage meiotic recombination intermediates</title>
        <p>We propose a model in which SHOC1 loading at meiotic chromosomes coincides with the time recombination intermediates stabilize pairwise associations of homologous chromosomes. To test this model, we evaluated the percent co-localization of SHOC1 foci with DMC1 (which catalyzes strand invasion), MSH4 (which acts at intermediate stages of recombination), TEX11 (essential for meiotic recombination intermediate metabolism) [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and MLH1 (presumably involved in resolution of DNA branched structures and a marker of CO sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We observed strong co-localization between SHOC1 and DMC1 (maximum at mid zygotene spermatocytes, 85Â±10% SHOC1 overlapping with DMC1, n = 28; 99Â±2% DMC1 overlapping with SHOC1, n = 30). At this stage we observed 177Â±16 DMC1 foci per cell (n = 55). We note that the relatively high percentage of co-localizing SHOC1 and DMC1 foci at late pachytene spermatocytes (28Â±2%, n = 43), where DMC1 is nearly absent at the chromosome axis, mostly correspond to foci located on X-Y chromosomes.</p>
        <p>We also observed substantial co-localization between SHOC1 and MSH4 (maximum at late zygotene cells, 62Â±15%, n = 60) and SHOC1 and TEX11 at later meiotic stages (maximum at early pachytene cells, 45Â±14%, n = 32) but detected no significant co-localization between residual SHOC1 foci present at late pachytene spermatocytes and MLH1 foci (0%, n = 45). In contrast, MSH4-MLH1 showed a maximum of 49% of foci co-localizing at late pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These data suggest that SHOC1 may be necessary at intermediate stages of prophase I, where it could stabilize intermediates of the recombination pathway (see below) and promote stable homologous chromosome interactions, but may be absent from later recombination structures marked by MLH1.</p>

Our results show that the number of SHOC1 foci was substantially reduced in both <italic>Spo11</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (8Â±4 foci/cell, n = 66) and <italic>Dmc1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> (8Â±3 foci/cell, n = 88) spermatocytes compared to wild type spermatocytes (132Â±20 foci/cell, n = 24, P&lt;0.0001). In contrast, the number of SHOC1 foci was significantly increased in <italic>Hop2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> spermatocytes (254Â±37 foci/cell, n = 54) and no change in the number of SHOC1 foci was observed in <italic>Hfm1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Mlh1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> spermatocytes compared to mid-zygotene wild type cells. The increase of SHOC1 foci in <italic>Hop2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> spermatocytes <italic>was</italic> unexpected because HOP2 has been proposed to work in cooperation with DMC1 catalyzing formation of strand invasion intermediates of recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is possible that in <italic>Hop2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> spermatocytes, SHOC1 is able to interact with recombination intermediates (i.e. strand invasion) or their associated proteins, but progression of these intermediates to later stages is impaired.</p>
        <p>In summary, a number of results suggest that mid-stage DNA recombination intermediate structures, and possibly their associated proteins, are required for optimal SHOC1 loading on recombination sites. These are: 1) kinetics of SHOC1 association with meiotic chromosomes; 2) the requirement of DMC1 for normal SHOC1 foci numbers; 3) the high number of co-localizing SHOC1/DMC1 foci, and 4) the increased number of SHOC1 foci in <italic>Hop2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> spermatocytes, which accumulate DMC1/RAD51-single-stranded DNA nucleoprotein filaments [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The observations that DMC1 is apparently required for normal levels of SHOC1 foci, and that RAD51 foci numbers in spermatocytes are not affected by changes in the wild type level of SHOC1 (see below), support for a model in which SHOC1 acts downstream of DMC1.</p>

        <title>Normal progression of meiosis requires <italic>Shoc1</italic></title>
        <p>Although deletion of <italic>Shoc1</italic> in Arabidopsis results in meiotic defects, the requirement for SHOC1 in mammalian meiosis is still not understood. Thus, we undertook a study of the role of SHOC1 in mammalian meiosis. To generate SHOC1 deficient mice we designed a gene trap vector that replaced coding exons 2â20 of <italic>Shoc1</italic> with a Neo-PGK-gb2 cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3A Fig</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>). We confirmed the correct insertion of Neo-PGK-gb2 by PCR followed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). <italic>Shoc1</italic> heterozygous mice were fertile, did not display any apparent tissue anomalies and showed a normal life span. However, when heterozygous mice were mated, the genotyping of 76 offspring from 15 different litters yielded no pups homozygous for the mutant <italic>Shoc1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). We confirmed these results by analyzing the genotypes of the yolk sacs and embryos from 9.5 dpc embryos. Again, no homozygous mutant mice were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Thus, we were not able to obtain male or female mice carrying the above-mentioned mutation for meiotic analysis. This was unexpected, as <italic>Shoc1</italic> is mostly expressed in testis of adult mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). It is possible that the absence of homozygous mutant mice may be caused by embryonic lethality caused by the absence of SHOC1, consistent with results showing that <italic>Shoc1</italic> is expressed during murine embryonic development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). However, other scenarios are possible such as a linked mutation.</p>
        <p>In a separate attempt to generate <italic>Shoc1</italic> knockout mice, we created heterozygous mice in which only coding exons 2â4 were replaced with a neomycin-resistance cassette, which should introduce a frame shift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). We obtained wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant mice at the expected mendelian ratios (1:2:1). RT-PCR analysis of transcript levels for exons across the gene from testes of homozygous targeted mice showed that expression of <italic>Shoc1</italic> is altered but not abolished by the gene trap insertion. While expression corresponding to exons 1â4 was undetectable (transcription start site is predicted at exon 2), we observed significant expression of downstream exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which suggests that an alternate transcription start site present in exon 5 is activated after deletion of exons 2â4. Although we observed some expression of RNA transcript, comparative analysis of testis from wild type and genetically modified mice by Western blot revealed that the amount of SHOC1 (calculated wild type SHOC1 MW: 168.06 KDa) is reduced in SHOC1 defective mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Elimination of exons 2â4 (coding 84 amino acids) may result in a truncated version of SHOC1 with a calculated MW of 158 KDa. This short version of SHOC1 cannot be distinguished from wild type in Western blots, likely due to the lack of resolution of the SDS-PAGE gels we used. Thus, we generated hypomorph mice (<italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp</italic></sup>) expressing reduced levels of a truncated version of SHOC1. This partial loss of SHOC1 allows embryonic viability and development throughout adulthood.</p>
        <p>To test whether <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mice exhibit meiotic defects, we first carried out testis tissue and germ cell analysis. Testes of <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mice (n = 10) are significantly smaller (0.055gÂ±0.0067 vs. 0.12gÂ±0.014; mean Â± SD, P = 0.0006, t test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) compared to wild type testes (n = 8), a phenotype commonly seen in mice with meiotic defects [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Tissue analysis indicated that <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> males undergo incomplete testis development with enlargement of interstitial cells and lack of spermatozoa. The number of seminiferous tubules was not reduced, but their size (calculated as the average diameter per tubule) was decreased by an average of 23Â±13% (307Â±27 Î¼m for wild type and 238Â±41 Î¼m for <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> (n = 20 wild type and n = 26 <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> seminiferous tubules analyzed from three different mice of each genotype) compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Primary spermatocytes represented the most advanced spermatogenic cells detected in the <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mice, indicating that spermatogenesis was blocked at metaphase of meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2Daâ2Dh</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mutant testes showed signs of extensive apoptosis in seminiferous tubules (average number of apoptotic cells per positive tubule Â± standard deviation, 13.7Â±4.6, n = 50 seminiferous tubules obtained from tissue sections of four different mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2Dcâ2De</xref>) compared to wild type (1.98Â±0.58, n = 50 seminiferous tubules scored from two mice, P = 0.0001). Approximately 98% of TUNEL positive cells (90 seminiferous tubules scored) were at the metaphase I stage.</p>
        <p>We analyzed spermatocyte progress through meiotic prophase I in detail by scoring individual stages of asynchronous populations of wild type and <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes from adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). We observed increases in the percentages of diplotene (43Â±9% vs. 38Â±7%; mean Â± SD; Pâ¤0.0001, two tailed t test) and metaphase I spermatocytes (6Â±3% vs. 2Â±1%; Pâ¤0.0005) and a decrease in pachytene spermatocytes (40Â±6% vs. 50Â±11%; Pâ¤0.0001) in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mice (n = 1,198 cells from 3 mice) relative to wild type mice (n = 1,360 cells from 3 mice).</p>
        <p>We also analyzed hematoxylin-eosin histological sections of 35-day-old wild type and <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> ovaries. Compared with wild type mice, no significantly changes in ovary size or number of follicles and corpora lutea were observed in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This is similar to the phenotype observed for <italic>Mlh1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mutants ([<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Matings of homozygous <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> female mice with wild type males produced normal number and sizes of litters compared with matings of wild type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s011">S2 Table</xref>). Together, the results suggest no effect of the <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp</italic></sup> mutation in mouse female gonad development. Although the results suggest sexual dimorphism with respect to the deletion of <italic>Shoc1</italic>, it is also possible that the lack of a phenotype in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> ovaries is caused by the incomplete ablation of SHOC1.</p>
        <p>In summary, tissue analysis suggests that spermatogenesis progresses normally in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> male mice until the end of prophase I when spermatocytes arrest at metaphase I, which may indicate that prophase I checkpoints are not triggered. Chromosomes in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes appear normally condensed at metaphase, but a few chromosomes are off the metaphase plate in contrast to chromosomes in wild-type spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2Dfâ2Dh</xref>). A high number of metaphase I spermatocytes with lagging chromosomes in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> mice suggests defects in chiasma formation (see text below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3D</xref> for a detailed quantification).</p>

        <title>Cytological markers suggest defective late stages of recombination in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes</title>
        <p>We then evaluated the progression of recombination in mouse <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes that appeared to be in a pachytene-like stage based on the association of the X and Y chromosomes. We assessed DSB repair by immunostaining chromosomes for Î³H2AX[<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which appears on chromatin near DSBs and disappears after repair. Although immunostaining with Î³H2AX marks only the sex body for most wild-type pachytene cells (3.2% Î³H2AX staining outside the sex body, n = 95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), a fraction (25%) of <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes showed persistent Î³H2AX staining not only in the sex body, but also in one or several patches along autosomes (n = 120, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The persistence of Î³H2AX into the pachytene stage is a hallmark of a failure or delay in the repair of meiotic DSBs [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>After the resection of DNA ends, RAD51 binds to single-stranded DNA and catalyzes invasion of an intact homologous sequence [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] to form cytologically detectable intermediates that likely mark single-end invasion sites [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To test whether these recombination stages are affected in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes, we determined the number of RAD51 foci on meiotic chromosomes from wild type and <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> zygotene spermatocytes. There were no significant differences in the number of RAD51 foci/cell in wild type compared to <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes (205.6Â±9.3 vs. 205.2Â±10 foci/cell, n = 20, p = 0.9, unpaired t test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We concluded that recombination stages involving RAD51 are not altered in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> cells compared to wild type.</p>
        <p>As CO formation in mice requires the MLH1 mismatch repair protein, the subset of recombination intermediates that mature into COs begins to be marked by MLH1 accumulation in early to mid pachytene spermatocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To test whether recombination intermediates are processed to this stage in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes, we immunostained for MLH1. <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes showed a significant reduction in the number of MLH1 foci/cell compared to wild type spermatocytes (19.8Â±0.5 MLH1 foci/cell, n = 38 versus 24.1Â±0.5 MLH1 foci/cell, n = 25, unpaired t test p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This reduced number of MLH1 foci suggests a role for SHOC1 in the class I crossover pathway.

        <p>To confirm that <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> deficient mice have reduced CO formation, we analyzed the frequency of <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes with lagging chromosomes at metaphase I. Achiasmate chromosomes fail to associate in the metaphase I plate and are often seen as lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We observed an elevated number of <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes at metaphase I with at least one lagging chromosome compared to wild type spermatocytes (5%, n = 60 wild type cells versus 34%, n = 100 <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). We note few lagging chromosomes (1.5Â±0.7/cell, mean Â± SD, n = 100) in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes, indicating that only some homologous chromosome pairs fail to form chiasmata.</p>
        <p>Chiasmata join homologs to make stable bivalent chromosomes; when chiasma numbers are reduced, the numbers of bivalents are reduced and univalents are observed. So, we scored the number of bivalent chromosomes per cell in air-dried chromosome spreads and found significantly fewer bivalents/cell in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes compared to wild type spermatocytes (18.7Â±0.15, n = 49 versus 19.9Â±0.05, n = 25, unpaired t test, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Together with the reduction in MLH1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), and an increased number of lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), the reduction in the number of bivalents that we observed in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes suggests that normal CO formation requires wild type levels of SHOC1.</p>
        <p>In early pachytene spermatocytes, X and Y chromosome pairs normally form a short stretch of synaptonemal complex encompassing the small region of homology in the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR). Synapsis at PAR is sensitive to reduced rates of recombination and perturbations in synapsis, and thus can be used to detect defects in these processes. Although the sex body appeared to form normally in all pachytene and diplotene <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes, the X and Y chromosome PAR regions were unsynapsed and separated in 65% of <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> cells with obvious synaptic defects (n = 52) and in 9% of <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> cells with no apparent synaptic defects (n = 32) versus only 4% of wild-type cells (n = 50, Pâ¤0.001, t test comparing wild type versus <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> cells with obvious synaptic defects, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).

        <p>To determine SHOC1 <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical activities, we expressed and purified a truncated form of the protein, SHOC1<sup>570-1111</sup>, from insect cells. We adopted this strategy because we were unable to generate soluble full-length SHOC1 using multiple expression systems (E. coli, yeast, and insect cells), possibly due to a disordered C-terminal tail region. In the human SHOC1 protein sequence, the (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domain is linked to a C-terminal tail region that appears naturally disordered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). We purified this fragment of human SHOC1 using a multistep protocol, including dextrin and mono Q/S affinity chromatography and gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This SHOC1 fragment contains all predicted XPF functional domains, is active in biochemical assays (below), and is apparently monomeric (evaluated by chemical crosslink followed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and Superdex 200 gel filtration, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>As the presence of a ERCC4-(HhH)<sub>2</sub> core structure is indicative of protein DNA binding, we used a DNA gel shift assay to identify preferred DNA substrates of SHOC1<sup>570-1111</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). We generated and purified different DNA branched structures (splayed arms, D-loop, and Holliday junction) and both linear single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, produced by annealing partially complementary oligonucleotides. All contained a common 5â²-<sup>32</sup>P end-labeled DNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and oligonucleotide #1 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s013">S4 Table</xref>). We found that SHOC1<sup>570-1111</sup> binds to single-stranded DNA, Holliday junction and D-loop substrates most efficiently, followed by the splayed arm and linear duplex, as indicated by the appearance of slow-migrating products during neutral PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>The (HhH)<sub>2</sub> motif participates in DNA binding of other DNA repair enzymes. For example, XPF/MUS81 endonucleases recognize the junction of single-stranded/double-stranded in a resected double-strand DNA molecule with a precise polarity [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the major determinant of binding branched DNA junctions localizes to the (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domain [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This globular domain contains two copies of a sequence-independent HhH DNA-binding motif, which are bridged by a fifth connecting helix [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, top panel). (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domains use their hairpins to bridge across the minor groove face of duplex DNA by engaging a backbone phosphate from each strand separated by three base pairs [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We tested the effect of deleting the (HhH)<sub>2</sub> motifs (purified SHOC1<sup>570-1041</sup> mutant in a SDS-PAGE gel is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) on SHOC1 DNA binding. Deletion of both HhH domains substantially reduced the ability of SHOC1 to bind single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). We do not think this is caused by alterations in SHOC1 conformation because we observed similar profiles when thermal scanning with an environment-sensitive dye probe was performed on SHOC1<sup>570-1111</sup> and SHOC1<sup>570-1041</sup>, suggesting no gross changes in protein stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). In sum, we observed that recombinant mouse SHOC1 has a strong preference for branched structures and single-stranded DNA and the SHOC1 (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domain plays a role in efficient DNA binding.</p>

        <p>Although our work strongly implicates SHOC1 in the recombination process, how SHOC1 integrates with described recombination factors is poorly understood. Prompted by similarities between the meiotic phenotype of mice deficient in SHOC1 or TEX11 [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and prominent SHOC1-TEX11 co-localization during early pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), we analyzed their interaction by a direct yeast-two hybrid assay.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We show that purified recombinant SHOC1 can bind DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> with a strong preference for DNA branched structures. In agreement, immunolocalization experiments reveal that SHOC1 concentrates to a subset of recombination sites that are shown to be a key intermediates in the mid-stage of the CO formation process. Further, SHOC1 deficient spermatocytes are deficient in CO formation. Although most <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes exhibit a comparable number of initial recombination events to wild-type mice, they show a reduced number of MLH1 foci, reduced chiasma formation, and arrest at metaphase I with lagging chromosomes and subsequent apoptosis. In sum, the evidence suggests that also in mammals SHOC1 acts through a major pathway for CO formation. However, this CO deficient phenotype seems to be less severe than that observed in yeast and Arabidopsis. <italic>Zip2</italic> mutants showed 40â50% reduction in the number of COs with respect to wild type; and defects in CO formation were even higher at specific hotspots [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, Shoc1 mutant chiasmata frequency per cell (0.8â1.27) are significantly lower (80â90%) compared to wild type (7.8â9.2) [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The observed disparity between mouse and the yeast and plant counterparts may be explained by interspecies differences in the role of SHOC1. However, it is also possible that the moderate phenotype observed in mice is caused by the incomplete ablation of SHOC1.</p>
      <p>Chromosome associations are also affected in mouse <italic>Shoc1</italic> mutant spermatocytes. Pairing and initial synapsis is apparently normal but synapsis is incomplete for most chromosomes in <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/hyp</italic></sup> spermatocytes. This effect of <italic>Shoc1</italic> mutation is similar to that described in the yeast <italic>Zip2</italic> mutant but not in Arabidopsis. In yeast, chromosomes are homologously paired but not synapsed [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and synaptonemal complex formation is abnormal in a <italic>Zip2</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, Shoc1 mutant meiocytes at pachytene stages resemble those from wild type mice, with apparent normal homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis.</p>
      <p>Our findings in mice has several points in common with a recent work in yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showing that Zip2 and Spo16 form an Xpf-Ercc1-like complex that drives intermediate recombination products toward crossover. Remarkably, both Shoc1 and Zip2-Spo16 recognizes DNA branches structures, are important for formation of normal numbers of meiotic crossovers, and interact with Tex11/Zip4, another protein of the ZMM group important for crossover formation.</p>
      <sec id="sec014">
        <title>What is the role of SHOC1?</title>
        <p>How could SHOC1 promote CO formation? Using protein sequence and structural analyses, we and others found that human and mouse SHOC1 have putative ERCC4-like nuclease motifs with a GEX<sub>22</sub>ERKX<sub>3</sub>E (DRK for mouse) sequence significantly similar to members of the XPFG/MUS81 family of nucleases [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Two well-defined HhH domain segments follow this motif. Although conservation of the ERCC4-(HhH)<sub>2</sub> core suggests potential nuclease activity for SHOC1, the ERCC4-like domains in mouse and human SHOC1 diverge from the canonical sequence. Since in our hands recombinant human SHOC1<sup>570-1111</sup> apparently lacks <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclease activity, our results argue against a possible role for Shoc1 in cleaving recombination intermediates to produce COs. This conclusion is further supported by divergent catalytic sites also found in Arabidopsis and yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Instead, we argue that SHOC1 binds DNA branched structures to stabilize them. We propose that SHOC1 binding protects against dissociation by anti-crossover activities, such as BLM (Bloom syndrome protein) functions that promote disassembly of D-loops catalyzed by RAD51 [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007381.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

        <p>Intriguingly, in our <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding assay, SHOC1 binds single-stranded DNA with high affinity and exhibits ATPase activity. These biochemical characteristics have also been found in human recombinant FANCM-FAAP24, in which these are important features to target the protein to DNA structures containing single-stranded DNA [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Most ERCC4-(HhH)<sub>2</sub> members of the XPF/MUS81 protein family exist in their functional state as heterodimers in eukaryotes or as homodimers in archaea. In agreement, Arabidopsis Shoc1 interacts with Ptd1, a protein with sequence similarity to Ercc1 and that contributes to meiotic CO formation [<xref rid="pgen.1007381.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our current efforts to identify a SHOC1 interaction partner (screening of a testis specific yeast-two-hybrid library with SHOC1 as a bait, and SHOC1 immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectroscopy) with structural characteristics or an equivalent role as Ptd1 have been fruitless. In this case, we speculate that SHOC1 in mammals could function alone. Indeed, in our assays SHOC1<sup>570-1111</sup> acts in its monomeric form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>) and seems proficient in binding branched structures. Alternatively, SHOC1 may interact with known ERCC1-like proteins (i.e. EME1, FAAP24) or with an unidentified protein, but their interaction may be transient making detection difficult. Future work will investigate these possibilities.</p>

Knockout mouse production was performed by the Texas A&amp;M Institute for Genomic Medicine according to the following scheme: (i) vector DNA purification and linearization, (iii) electroporation of ES cells followed by cell isolation and selection, (iv) generation of chimeras by ES cell injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts, (v) breeding chimeras with wild-type C57BL6N females to obtain germline F1 heterozygotes that were genotyped by PCR (see below).

        <p>The procedure for the generation of SHOC1 deficient mice, in which the gene-trapping cassette (LacZ-Neo) was designed to replace exons 2â4 and prevent translation of downstream fusion transcripts, is detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007381.s003">S3F Fig</xref>. <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/wt</italic></sup> ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to create chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6 mice to generate <italic>Shoc1</italic><sup><italic>hyp/wt</italic></sup> heterozygous mice.
