      <abstract>
        <p>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a syndrome characterized by recurrent and intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors or mental acts that a person feels compelled to perform. Twin studies, family studies, and segregation analyses provide compelling evidence that OCD has a strong genetic component. The <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene encodes a developmentally regulated stimulator of neurite outgrowth and previous studies have implicated rare variants in this gene in disorders in the OC spectrum, specifically Tourette syndrome (TS) and trichotillomania (TTM). The objective of the current study was to evaluate rare genetic variation in <italic>SLITRK1</italic> in risk for OCD and to functionally characterize associated coding variants. We sequenced <italic>SLITRK1</italic> coding exons in 381 individuals with OCD as well as in 356 control samples and identified three novel variants in seven individuals. We found that the combined mutation load in OCD relative to controls was significant (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.036). We identified a missense N400I change in an individual with OCD, which was not found in more than 1000 control samples (P&lt;0.05). In addition, we showed the the N400I variant failed to enhance neurite outgrowth in primary neuronal cultures, in contrast to wildtype <italic>SLITRK1</italic>, which enhanced neurite outgrowth in this assay. These important functional differences in the N400I variant, as compared to the wildtype <italic>SLITRK1</italic> sequence, may contribute to OCD and OC spectrum symptoms. A synonymous L63L change identified in an individual with OCD and an additional missense change, T418S, was found in four individuals with OCD and in one individual without an OCD spectrum disorder. Examination of additional samples will help assess the role of rare <italic>SLITRK1</italic> variation in OCD and in related psychiatric illness.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and ritualistic behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that are frequently performed in response to the obsessional thoughts <xref rid="pone.0070376-Leckman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Twin and family studies, the latter including segregation analyses, have provided compelling evidence that OCD has a strong genetic component with a complex genetic architecture <xref rid="pone.0070376-Pauls1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is likely that OCD is etiologically quite heterogeneous and that rare variants may account for an appreciable proportion of the genetic liability to OCD. Family and treatment studies indicate that Tourette syndrome (TS) and trichotillomania (TTM) are related to OCD and all three conditions might be considered part of a larger spectrum of conditions, the so-called OC spectrum <xref rid="pone.0070376-Leckman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070376-Ferro1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p> Rare variants in the gene <italic>SLITRK1</italic> have been associated with disorders in the OC spectrum <xref rid="pone.0070376-Abelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0070376-Miranda1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the first description, genetic analysis of a subject with TS revealed a <italic>de novo</italic> translocation in 13q implicating <italic>SLITRK1</italic> as the etiologic mutation <xref rid="pone.0070376-Abelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>By sequencing coding exons of SLITRK1 in 381 individuals with OCD and 356 controls, we identified two novel missense variants and one novel synonymous variant in <italic>SLITRK1</italic> in seven individuals. Six of the individuals had OCD (1.57% of OCD) and one individual was in the comparison group and did not have an OC spectrum disorder (0.30% of controls). The N400I and L63L variants were identified, each in a separate OCD individual. The T418S variant was identified in four OCD samples and in one screened control. The <italic>SLITRK1</italic> mutation burden in OCD cases relative to controls was significant at <italic>p</italic>â=â0.036. This finding highlights the potentially complex nature of <italic>SLITRK1</italic>'s influence on the heritability and expression for disorders in the OC spectrum. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant association between <italic>SLITRK1</italic> and TS and TTM, but a number of independent studies report difficulty in replicating the findings <xref rid="pone.0070376-Abelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0070376-ORoak1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070376-Verkerk1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0070376-Zimprich1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Here we add to the literature three additional variants, one of which (the N400I variant), occurs more frequently in cases than in controls (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.0497) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070376-g001">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given the high detection frequency of the T418S variant and its discovery in an individual without an OCD, we reasoned that the variant might be common and functionally tolerated in the general population. Similarly, the L63L variant identified in an individual with OCD is unlikely to demonstrate easily identifiable functional consequences, as it does not cause a coding change in the protein. It remains possible that the L63L variant could have subtle functional effects such as altering mRNA folding, decreasing mRNA translation or impacting posttranslational modifications of the protein, consistent with literature that demonstrates functional effects of synonymous mutations in the schizophrenia candidate gene, human dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) <xref rid="pone.0070376-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, while the T418S and L63L variants may have a role in increasing susceptibility to an OC spectrum disorder, it may be hard to demonstrate functional impact of these variants with in vitro functional assays.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the <italic>SLITRK1</italic>-N400I variant is a missense change that in theory carries a greater risk for secondary functional consequences and phenotypic differences. Our functional analysis of the N400I variant in rat hippocampal neurons and in mouse cortical neurons supports this conclusion. Wildtype <italic>SLITRK1</italic> stimulates neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pone.0070376-Abelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070376-Kajiwara1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and we investigated the impact of the N400I variant on this function. Unlike the overexpressed wildtype <italic>SLITRK1</italic>, which significantly extended the summed total neurite length in our neurite outgrowth assays (relative to an empty vector control, data not shown), the N400I variant showed no activity in either E18 rat hippocampal neurons nor in E17 mouse cortical neurons. Similarly, the <italic>SLTRK1</italic> frameshift mutation previously observed in TS and TTM cases also failed to stimulate neurite outgrowth <xref rid="pone.0070376-Abelson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The consistent functional alteration seen in both the <italic>SLITRK1</italic> frameshift variant and in the N400I variant provides support for a role for the N400I variant in the pathophysiology in the OC spectrum. More specifically, the amino acid change in N400I is located in one of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domains (a type of domain predicted to be involved in protein-binding) and as such may disrupt the interaction of <italic>SLITRK1</italic> with its extracellular targets, leading to inhibited or compromised function.</p>
      <p>We identified the <italic>SLITRK1</italic>-T418S missense variation in four individuals with an OCD and in one individual without an OC spectrum disorder. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis revealed that the individual without an OC spectrum disorder is afflicted with MDD, is mildly mentally retarded and exhibits various subclinical psychiatric phenotypes, despite the absence of an OC spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070376-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, she exhibits a pathological grooming behavior, compulsive-nail biting, that is reminiscent of similar grooming behaviors seen in the OC spectrum, such as compulsive hair-pulling in TTM. Additionally, we note a potential relationship between the <italic>SLITRK1</italic>-T418S variant in depression as four of the five individuals with the T418S missense mutation (including the non-OC spectrum individual) have a diagnosis of MDD and the remaining individual has a history of attempted suicide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070376-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, given the high prevalence rates of depression in the general population (9.1% current depression in the United States <xref rid="pone.0070376-Centers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>), the depressive symptoms and T418S connection seen in this sample may be coincidental. Additional sequencing of <italic>SLITRK1</italic> in large numbers of individuals will be needed to determine whether the T418S or other rare variants, are increased in a broader range of psychiatric phenotypes than is represented by the OC spectrum.</p>
      <p>In this study we combine a comprehensive genetic screen of <italic>SLITRK1</italic> in OCD and closely related disorders, with the functional analysis of a newly identified <italic>SLITRK1</italic> missense variant found in the screen. Using this dual approach, we documented significantly more genetic variation in <italic>SLITRK1</italic> in OCD than in a non-OC spectrum comparison group; furthermore, we identified one variant, <italic>SLITRK1</italic>-N400I, which eliminates a known function of the protein. This represents an important advance in the characterization of the role <italic>SLITRK1</italic> may play in the pathophysiology of the OC spectrum and emphasizes the benefits of combining genetic and functional assays to enhance our understanding of psychiatric illness.</p>
