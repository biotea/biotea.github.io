      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Common acquired melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms that are composed of small uniform melanocytes and typically present as flat or slightly elevated, pigmented lesions on the skin. We describe two families with a new autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by multiple skin-colored, elevated melanocytic tumors. In contrast to common acquired nevi, the melanocytic neoplasms in affected family members ranged histopathologically from epithelioid nevi to atypical melanocytic proliferations that showed overlapping features with melanoma. Some affected patients developed uveal or cutaneous melanomas. Segregating with this phenotype, we found inactivating germline mutations of the <italic>BAP1</italic> gene. The majority of melanocytic neoplasms lost the remaining wild-type allele of <italic>BAP1</italic> by various somatic alterations. In addition, we found <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations in a subset of sporadic melanocytic neoplasms showing histologic similarities to the familial tumors. These findings suggest that loss of <italic>BAP1</italic> is associated with a clinically and morphologically distinct type of melanocytic neoplasm.</p>

    <p id="P2">We report a type of melanocytic neoplasm that was inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in two unrelated families and was clinically, histopathologically, and genetically distinct from common acquired nevi (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Beginning in the second decade of life, affected family members progressively developed skin-colored to reddish-brown, dome-shaped to pedunculated, well-circumscribed papules with an average size of 5mm (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1â4</xref>). The number of tumors per patient varied markedly, ranging from 5 to over 50. No intellectual disabilities or dysmorphic features were identified in affected individuals.</p>
    <p id="P3">Histopathological examination revealed primarily dermal tumors composed entirely or predominantly of epithelioid melanocytes with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. The melanocytes often contained large, vesicular nuclei that varied significantly in size and shape (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5â7</xref>). The cytological features of some of the cells were reminiscent of Spitz nevi; however, characteristic features (such as epidermal hyperplasia, hypergranulosis, Kamino bodies, clefting around junctional melanocytic nests, and spindle-shaped melanocytes) frequently seen in Spitz nevi were consistently absent. In addition, 37 of 42 (88%) tumors in the families showed <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, which are typically absent in Spitz nevi.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
    <p id="P4">Some of the neoplasms exhibited one or more atypical features, such as high cellularity, considerable nuclear pleomorphism, and several chromosomal aberrations. These tumors were classified as âneoplasms of uncertain malignant potentialâ and the patients were managed as if they had melanoma (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Both families were identified because of the occurrence of multiple epithelioid melanocytic tumors, but in each family, one affected individual had uveal melanoma, and three members of family 2 had been diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Twenty-two melanocytic neoplasms from three affected individuals (II-1, II-4, II-7) in family 1 were analyzed with array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Losses affecting the entire chromosome 3 or portions of the short arm of chromosome 3 were found in 50% of tumors. The smallest overlap of the deleted regions encompassed 5.8 megabases, extending from base-pair position 47,976,758 to 53,848,761 (hg 18 assembly) and encoded at least 150 known genes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">The frequent loss of the 3p21 region suggested a second hit<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, resulting in the elimination of the remaining wild-type allele of a mutated tumor suppressor gene in this region. To support this hypothesis, the haplotypes of 6 members of family 1 were reconstructed with SNP-arrays. Affected siblings in the second generation (II-1, II-4, II-7) inherited the same maternal copy of the 3p21 region, whereas the non-affected brother (II-5) received the other maternal 3p21 copy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). SNP-arrays showed that in all tumors with chromosome 3 loss, the paternal copy of chromosome 3 was lost, while the maternal copy was retained (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). In conclusion, these data strongly suggested that a mutated gene in the 3p21 region was inherited from the maternal side of the family.</p>
    <p id="P7">To identify the mutated gene, we sequenced the minimally deleted region of chromosome 3 in 2 affected (I-2, II-4) and 2 unaffected (I-1, II-5) subjects from family 1 using an in-solution hybrid capture technique followed by massively parallel sequencing.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in the <italic>BAP1</italic> gene (c.1305delG, p.Gln436Asnfs*135) that was subsequently found to segregate with the phenotype (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). To rule out <italic>BAP1</italic> germline mutations in the general population, we reviewed sequence data from 629 individuals in the 1000genomes database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1000genomes.org/home">http://www.1000genomes.org/home</ext-link>). No truncating mutations were found indicating that <italic>BAP1</italic> germline mutations are infrequent in the general population.</p>
    <p id="P8">The status of the second <italic>BAP1</italic> allele was assessed in 29 skin tumors and in the uveal melanoma (I-2) from family 1. All tumors in which a loss of 3p21 was detected previously by aCGH, also showed a loss of the wild-type <italic>BAP1</italic> allele in the sequencing electropherogram. In five additional cases without loss of the 3p21 region, the electropherogram showed markedly suppressed residual wild-type sequences, indicating that the neoplastic cells had lost the wild-type <italic>BAP1</italic> allele through copy number neutral mechanisms, resulting in maternal uniparental disomy. In four other neoplasms without 3p21 deletions, we found additional acquired somatic nonsense (2 cases), frameshift (1 case) and missense (1 case) mutations in <italic>BAP1</italic>. Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 showed loss of nuclear expression in all melanocytic neoplasms, including the tumors without detectable alteration of the wild-type <italic>BAP1</italic> allele. In summary, these data suggest that the remaining wild-type allele of <italic>BAP1</italic> is lost by various somatic alterations in the melanocytic tumors (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">In family 2, we found a different germline mutation in <italic>BAP1</italic> that segregated with the phenotype and removed the acceptor splice site at the last exon (c.2057-2A&gt;G, p.Met687Glufs*28, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Analysis of cDNA from 2 affected family members confirmed that the last intron was not removed by splicing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). In family 2, inactivation of the remaining wild-type <italic>BAP1</italic> allele was found in 9 of 13 skin tumors, in the uveal melanoma (II-1), and in the cutaneous melanoma from patient II-3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3aâd</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The metastatic melanoma of individual II-6 did not show loss of heterozygosity of <italic>BAP1</italic>, but no additional tissue was available to investigate alternative mechanisms of <italic>BAP1</italic> inactivation. Besides the elevated, skin-colored melanocytic neoplasms, common acquired nevi (flat, brown maculae) were also excised from 4 patients (II-3, III-3, III-4, III-5). Histopathologically these nevi were composed of small uniform melanocytes and showed strong nuclear expression of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">To address the role of <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations in sporadic melanocytic neoplasms, we sequenced <italic>BAP1</italic> in 156 randomly selected tumors without family history: common nevi with uniform small melanocytes (n=28); Spitz nevi (n=17); neoplasms with overlapping features between Spitz nevus and melanoma (so-called âatypical Spitz tumorsâ, n=18); primary melanomas originating from acral skin (n=15), mucosa (n=15), or skin with (n=15) or without (n=15) chronic sun-induced damage, and uvea (n=33). Thirteen (40%) uveal melanomas, two (11%) atypical Spitz tumors and three (5%) of the melanomas (2 melanoma on skin without chronic sun-induced damage and 1 acral melanoma) had somatic <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations. No mutations were found in the other categories (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4â8</xref>). The mutation frequency seen in uveal melanoma is similar to a recent report.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Two of five sporadic cutaneous melanomas that arose in nevi harbored <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations. In both cases the <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations were absent in the nevus portion, suggesting that loss of function of <italic>BAP1</italic> may play a role in progression from nevus to melanoma in some cases (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4aâg</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">The two atypical Spitz tumors with somatic <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations had similar morphologic features to the melanocytic neoplasms seen in both families, lacked immunohistochemical expression of BAP1, and harbored <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). This finding suggests that bi-allelic inactivation of <italic>BAP1</italic> is associated with a clinically and morphologically distinct type of melanocytic neoplasm. Histopathologically, the tumors range from intradermal nevi composed of bland epithelioid melanocytes to atypical proliferations of epithelioid melanocytes with morphological and cytogenetic features overlapping with melanoma. These tumors have been previously subsumed under the category of âspitzoidâ melanocytic neoplasms because they share cytologic features with Spitz nevi.</p>
    <p id="P12">As illustrated by the families, inheriting one mutant copy of <italic>BAP1</italic> results in a markedly increased number of these neoplasms. In aggregate, several hundred papular melanocytic tumors were present in affected family members, while the number of melanomas was substantially lower. This indicates that the risk of malignant progression in individual tumors is low, and that bi-allelic loss of <italic>BAP1</italic> in conjunction with mutations in <italic>BRAF</italic> is not sufficient for melanoma formation in the skin. Harbour et al.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> proposed that bi-allelic loss of <italic>BAP1</italic> in uveal melanoma, which carry mutations in <italic>GNAQ</italic><sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> or <italic>GNA11</italic><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but not in <italic>BRAF</italic>, marks the transition to metastatic disease. Our findings may indicate that the role of <italic>BAP1</italic> in melanocytic neoplasia depends on the associated oncogene and/or the cell of origin.</p>
    <p id="P13"><italic>BAP1</italic> was originally discovered as a binding partner of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and has been functionally implicated in DNA damage response<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, as well as in regulation of apoptosis, senescence, and the cell cycle.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart Calypso is involved in chromatin remodeling, which was shown to oppose the mono-ubiquitination activity of the polycomb repressive complex 1, a critical component of transcriptional silencing.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In cancer, mutations and deletions in <italic>BAP1</italic> have been reported in breast and lung cancers<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, but none of the individuals in our study developed breast or lung cancers.</p>
    <p id="P14">In summary, we describe a novel autosomal dominant syndrome that is caused by germline mutations of <italic>BAP1</italic>, characterized by a high penetrance of melanocytic neoplasms with distinctive clinical and histopathological features, and possibly associated with an increased risk for uveal and cutaneous melanoma.</p>
