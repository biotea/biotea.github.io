        <p>Mitochondrial fission requires recruitment of the GTPase Drp1 to mitochondria, but the molecules that mediate this recruitment have been disputed.

      <abstract>
        <p>Several mitochondrial outer membrane proteinsâmitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51, respectively)âhave been proposed to promote mitochondrial fission by recruiting the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), but fundamental issues remain concerning their function. A recent study supported such a role for Mff but not for Fis1. In addition, it is unclear whether MiD49 and MiD51 activate or inhibit fission, because their overexpression causes extensive mitochondrial elongation. It is also unknown whether these proteins can act in the absence of one another to mediate fission. Using <italic>Fis1</italic>-null, <italic>Mff</italic>-null, and <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cells, we show that both Fis1 and Mff have roles in mitochondrial fission. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of Drp1 suggests that Fis1 and Mff are important for the number and size of Drp1 puncta on mitochondria. Finally, we find that either MiD49 or MiD51 can mediate Drp1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission in the absence of Fis1 and Mff. These results demonstrate that multiple receptors can recruit Drp1 to mediate mitochondrial fission.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The opposing processes of fusion and fission (division) regulate mitochondrial morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Westermann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Chan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). During mitochondrial fission, the dynamin-related GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is recruited from the cytosol onto the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it assembles into puncta. These puncta consist of oligomeric Drp1 complexes that wrap around and constrict the mitochondrial tubule to mediate fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Mears <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). This proposed mechanism is analogous to how dynamin pinches off endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Schmid and Frolov, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). Because much of Drp1 resides in the cytosol, key mechanistic issues are how Drp1 is recruited to the mitochondrial surface and what factors influence its assembly.</p><p>In mammals, four integral membrane proteins of the mitochondrial outer membraneâmitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MiD49 and MiD51, respectively)âhave been proposed to act as receptors that recruit Drp1 to the mitochondrial surface. However, there is much uncertainty concerning the precise role of these candidates and their relationship to each other. Fis1 was the first proposed receptor, based on definitive genetic and biochemical data from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cereÂ­visiae</italic>. The yeast Drp1 orthologue, Dnm1, requires Fis1 to localize to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Fekkes <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Mozdy <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Tieu and Nunnari, 2000</xref>). Fis1 physically interacts with Dnm1 via one of two molecular adaptors, Mdv1 or Caf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Tieu <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Cerveny and Jensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Griffin <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, however, there are no apparent orthologues of Mdv1 or Caf4, and the evidence supporting a role for Fis1 in mitochondrial fission is mixed. Supporting a role in fission, overexpression of Fis1 in mammalian cells promotes fragmentation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Yoon <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Stojanovski <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Yu <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and inhibition of Fis1 results in elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Yoon <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Lee <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Stojanovski <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Koch <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>). However, a recent study showed that deletion of the <italic>Fis1</italic> gene from human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells does not disrupt mitochondrial morphology or Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria and suggested that mitochondrial defects from <italic>Fis1-</italic>knockdown studies may be due to off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Mff is the strongest candidate for a Drp1 receptor. Knockdown of <italic>Mff</italic> results in mitochondrial elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>) and reduces the amount of Drp1 recruited to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>MiD49 and MiD51 (also called mitochondrial elongation factor 1) have been proposed to be components of the mitochondrial fission machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Palmer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), but there is conflicting evidence concerning their mechanism of action. One study showed that a double knockdown results in mitochondrial elongation and reduces recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria, supporting a role in fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Palmer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Paradoxically, overexpression of either MiD49 or MiD51 also causes mitochondrial elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Palmer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Zhao <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), and another study showed that knockdown of MiD51 causes mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Zhao <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These latter observations led to the alternative proposal that MiD51 inhibits mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Zhao <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the role of these candidate Drp1 receptors, we studied their function in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Our results support their role in mitochondrial fission and indicate that each protein is capable of recruiting Drp1 and promoting mitochondrial fission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Fis1 and Mff can function independently of one another to regulate mitochondrial fission in MEFs</title><p>Given the disputed role of Fis1 in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), we sought to directly compare the roles of Fis1 and Mff by generating MEF cell lines with null alleles of Fis1, Mff, or both. These cells are completely deficient for the relevant proteins (Supplemental Figure S1A). Mitochondrial morphology was assessed by immunofluorescence against the mitochondrial marker Tom20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies using <italic>Mff</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), mitochondria in <italic>Mff</italic>-null cell lines are severely elongated and interconnected. In contrast, mitochondria in <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cell lines have more moderate elongation and interconnection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used a morphology scoring assay in which each cell was categorized as having short tubules, long tubules, net-like mitochondria, or collapsed mitochondria. For both mutants, more cells were found to have long or net-like mitochondria relative to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), but the phenotype of <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells is much more pronounced than that of <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells. Two other independent pairs of wild-type and <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cell lines gave similar results (Supplemental Figure S1B). Of interest, mitochondrial elongation is most severe in the <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic> double mutant and approaches that of <italic>Drp1</italic>-null cells, indicating that the phenotype of Mff loss is substantially enhanced by additional removal of Fis1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Mitochondrial elongation in <italic>Fis1</italic>-null, <italic>Mff</italic>-null, and <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null MEFs.

Histograms show the percentage of cells with fragmented or mostly short tubular mitochondria. For B, F, G, and H, data are the averages Â± SEM from three independent experiments, with 100 cells scored per experiment. All statistical testing was performed with the Student's <italic>t</italic> test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="659fig1"/></fig><p>These observations were confirmed with several independent methods. First, we used morphometric image analysis to evaluate mitochondrial length/interconnectivity. We quantified the number of discrete mitochondria and the total mitochondrial area in the cell periphery, where individual mitochondria can be readily resolved. The ratio of these two values provided a quantitative measure of mitochondrial length/interconnectivity. Significant differences were found among the wild-type cells and each of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The phenotypic trend found with this approach agreed well with the manual morphological scoring.</p><p>We also used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to further quantify these differences in mitochondrial morphology. A region of interest (ROI) containing multiple mitochondria with matrix-targeted Cox8-Dendra2 was photobleached, and the recovery of fluorescence over 10 s was monitored. Because of the short recovery time, the fluorescence recovery is dependent on the length and interconnectivity of the photobleached mitochondria, not on mitochondrial fusion. Each of the mutant cell lines demonstrates higher levels of recovery than wild-type cells, with <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cells having the highest level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, D and E</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S1C). The recovery properties of <italic>Fis1</italic>-null and <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells were intermediate, with <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells showing higher levels of recovery than <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells. To corroborate the FRAP results, we used an independent approach to measure the diffusion of Cox8-Dendra2. After photoconverting Cox8-Dendra2 with a 405-nm laser in a region of interest, we quantified the area to which the photoconverted signal immediately spread. We found that <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cells have the largest diffusion value, followed by <italic>Mff</italic>-null, then <italic>Fis1</italic>-null, and lastly wild-type cells (Supplemental Figure S1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that both Fis1 and Mff regulate mitochondrial length and interconnectivity, with Mff playing the predominant role in MEFs.</p><p>Given that both Fis1 and Mff function to regulate mitochondrial morphology, we tested whether Fis1 and Mff could act independently of one another. When <italic>Fis1</italic>-null and <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells are transfected with Fis1 and Mff expression constructs, respectively, both show a robust rescue in mitochondrial morphology as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, F and G</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S2). Of interest, when Fis1 is expressed in <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells or Mff is expressed in <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells, there is also a substantial, albeit less complete, rescue in mitochondrial morphology. These results demonstrate that Fis1 and Mff can act independently and partially replace each other to regulate mitochondrial morphology.</p><p>Mitochondrial fission is induced by a number of physiological situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Westermann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Chan, 2012</xref>). To determine whether Fis1 or Mff might selectively mediate mitochondrial fission in one of these pathways, we challenged wild-type and mutant cells with carbonyl cyanide <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenylhydrozone (CCCP; for mitochondrial membrane depolarization), staurosporine (STS) or etoposide (for apoptosis), 1% O<sub>2</sub> (for hypoxia), or 0.1% serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1E). After each challenge, <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells show mitochondrial shortening, but less than in wild-type cells. In contrast, <italic>Mff</italic>-null and <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cell lines are highly resistant to mitochondrial shortening after each of these treatments. We conclude that both Fis1 and Mff are important for mitochondrial fission under basal and induced conditions, with Mff playing a larger role in both cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Fis1 and Mff are important for recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria</title><p>To determine whether the mutant cells are defective in recruiting Drp1, we used immunofluorescence to visualize Drp1 puncta on mitochondria in vivo. In wild-type cells, much of the Drp1 staining is diffuse in the cytosol, but a proportion can be found in punctate structures on mitochondria. This recruitment to mitochondria is reduced in cells with <italic>Mff</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our knockout cells have reduced numbers of mitochondrial Drp1 puncta, with <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cells having the greatest defect, followed by <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells and then <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used image analysis to quantify the density (number of puncta/mitochondrial area) of Drp1 puncta on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells have a small but significant decrease in the density of mitochondrial Drp1 puncta. <italic>Mff</italic>-null and <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cells have more substantial decreases. Of interest, the average total fluorescence per puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and C</xref>), as well as the average size of puncta (Supplemental Figure S1F), also show substantial declines in the mutant cells. As expected, exogenous expression of Mff in <italic>Mff</italic>-null cells rescued mitochondrial morphology and restored mitochondrial Drp1 puncta (Supplemental Figure S2, B and D). This rescue depended on the R1 region (containing an 11-residue repeat) and the transmembrane domain, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The levels of Drp1 in purified mitochondrial fractions from <italic>Mff</italic>-null and <italic>Fis1/Mff</italic>-null cells were substantially lower than those from wild-type and <italic>Fis1</italic>-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The levels from <italic>Fis1</italic>-null mitochondria were only slightly less than wild-type levels.

We also found similar elongation of mitochondria when MiD49 or MiD51 is overexpressed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> later in the paper). This effect is associated with enhanced Drp1 levels on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and Supplemental Figure S4C). We wondered whether these proteins might be recruiting an inactive form of Drp1.

Analysis of <italic>Fis1</italic>-null MEFs indicates a clear, although minor, role of Fis1 in Drp1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), its role appears to be substantially less important than that of Mff. It is possible that the relative importance of Fis1 versus Mff depends on the particular cell type. Cell-type specificity might explain why we found a clear mitochondrial morphology defect in <italic>Fis1</italic>-null MEFs versus a previous study of <italic>Fis1</italic>-null HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Otera <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). It is also possible that the relative importance of these proteins depends on which signaling pathway is activated, although we have not yet identified conditions that selectively promote Fis1-mediated fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that Fis1 and Mff, beyond merely recruiting Drp1, might have a role in promoting Drp1 assembly. In the absence of Fis1, Mff, or both, the remaining Drp1 puncta associated with mitochondria are notably smaller in size and lower in intensity. In this regard, these Drp1 receptors may play a role similar to yeast Mdv1, which promotes self-assembly of Dnm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Lackner <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Future biochemical studies are needed to test this model.</p><p>Previous studies yielded perplexing observations of MiD49 and MiD51 overexpression versus knockdown. In particular, it was unclear why MiD overexpression causes mitochondrial elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Palmer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Zhao <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). We find that when these proteins are overexpressed, recruitment of Drp1 is enhanced, but there is also increased inhibitory phosphorylation of Drp1 on S637. With CCCP treatment, this phosphorylation is reduced, and mitochondrial fission ensues. We cannot rule out that additional mechanisms might also inhibit Drp1 function upon MiD overexpression. Our results suggest the potential for regulation, in which the outcome of MiD activity depends on the physiological state of the cell. For example, we speculate that MiDs might recruit Drp1 but maintain it in an inactive state until a cellular signal triggers fission.</p><p>Finally, our results indicate that Fis1, Mff, MiD49, and MiD51 can each recruit Drp1 and promote mitochondrial fission. In particular, the MiDs are able to promote fission in the absence of both Fis1 and Mff. It remains possible that these proteins can also function together to mediate fission. Future studies will clarify whether these proteins preferentially operate in specific cell types or cellular circumstances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Antibody sources were as follows: Drp1 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), Drp1 S616-PO<sub>4</sub> and S637-PO<sub>4</sub> (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Î²-tubulin (TUBB; Imgenex, San Diego, CA), Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), MiD49 (also known as SMCR7; Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL), MiD51 (also known as SMCR7L; Proteintech Group), actin (Millipore, Billerica, MA), Fis1 (Alexis/Axxora, San Diego, CA), Mff (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; and gift from A. van der Bliek, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA), and Myc (mouse monoclonal 9E10 from Covance, Berkeley, CA; and rabbit polyclonal from Sigma-Aldrich).

Mitochondrial morphology and protein levels were assessed at 72 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Drp1 immunoprecipitation and cell fractionation</title><p>To assess levels of Drp1 S637-PO<sub>4</sub>, we immunoprecipitated Drp1 (anti-DLP1; BD Biosciences) from 5 million cells lysed in IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (HALT; Thermo-Pierce, Rockford, IL). The lysates were cleared with a 21,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> spin at 4Â°C for 10 min. Immune complexes were captured with protein A/G agarose (Thermo-Pierce), and the beads were washed with IP buffer.</p><p>For cell fractionation, cells were collected by trypsinization and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of mitochondria isolation buffer (10 mM HEPES, 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM Mg acetate, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail and lysed using a nitrogen bomb (Parr, Moline, IL) at 250 psi for 10 min, followed by mechanical homogenization with a glass Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 700 Ã <italic>g</italic> three times for 10 min to obtain a postnuclear supernatant. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 21,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 30 min to obtain the cytosol fraction. To obtain purified mitochondria, the crude mitochondrial pellet was placed in a discontinuous Percoll gradient consisting of 80, 52, and 26% Percoll diluted in mitochondria isolation buffer. Centrifugation was performed at 42,500 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 45 min. Purified mitochondria were recovered from the 52 and 26% Percoll interface.</p></sec><sec><title>Myc coimmunoprecipitation assay</title><p>MiD-Drp1 interactions were assessed by transfecting 293Ts with Myc-tagged MiD constructs and Drp1 mutant constructs. For mouse Drp1 variant 2, residues S579 and S600 correspond to human Drp1 residues S616 and S637, respectively. Human nomenclature is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> for consistency. Cells were harvested by trypsinization 24 h posttransfection, and cross-linked with 250 Î¼M dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Thermo-Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linker was quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 150 mM and incubating for an additional 10 min. Cells were pelleted, the quenched cross-linker solution was removed, and pellets were solubilized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 1% NP-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. Myc immunoprecipitation was performed with rabbit anti-Myc agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). Cross-link bonds were reversed by solubilizing samples in Laemmli buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 0.005% bromophenol blue) containing 10% Î²-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min.</p></sec></sec>
