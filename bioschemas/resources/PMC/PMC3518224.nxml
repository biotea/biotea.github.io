        <p>PI4KIIIÎ± is targeted to the plasma membrane via an evolutionarily conserved complex comprised of EFR3 and TTC7 to control PtdIns4P synthesis and the selective enrichment of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in this membrane.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) has critical functions via both direct interactions and metabolic conversion to PI 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and other downstream metabolites. However, mechanisms that control this PtdIns4P pool in cells of higher eukaryotes remain elusive. PI4KIIIÎ±, the enzyme thought to synthesize this PtdIns4P pool, is reported to localize in the ER, contrary to the plasma membrane localization of its yeast homologue, Stt4. In this paper, we show that PI4KIIIÎ± was targeted to the plasma membrane as part of an evolutionarily conserved complex containing Efr3/rolling blackout, which we found was a palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein. PI4KIIIÎ± knockout cells exhibited a profound reduction of plasma membrane PtdIns4P but surprisingly only a modest reduction of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> because of robust up-regulation of PtdIns4P 5-kinases. In these cells, however, much of the PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was localized intracellularly, rather than at the plasma membrane as in control cells, along with proteins typically restricted to this membrane, revealing a major contribution of PI4KIIIÎ± to the definition of plasma membrane identity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phosphoinositides are minor components of cellular membranes but play key regulatory roles in cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). Their phosphorylated head groups, which protrude from the cytosolic leaflet of membranes, bind with variable affinity and specificity to proteins located in or exposed to the cytosolic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemmon, 2008</xref>). Through these interactions, the heterogeneous distribution of the seven phosphoinositides in different membranes helps to generate a code of membrane identity that plays a fundamental role in orchestrating the processes occurring on such membranes. Some phosphoinositides (in particular phosphatidylinositol [PI] 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>]) also act as precursors of other intracellular messenger molecules.</p>
      <p>Among phosphoinositides, PI 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) plays numerous fundamental roles. It has critical functions in the Golgi complex, the endosomal system, and the plasma membrane, which are mediated by its direct interaction with PtdIns4P-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DâAngelo et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylation of PtdIns4P at the 5 position by type I PI monophosphate kinases (PIPKIs) represents the major pathway for the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doughman et al., 2003</xref>), which, in turn, is the precursor of other important signaling metabolites. PtdIns4P also has major regulatory actions on the localization and metabolism of other membrane lipids. For example, several oxysterol-binding proteinârelated proteins contain PtdIns4P binding sites that target them to PtdIns4P-containing membranes. One yeast oxysterol-binding proteinârelated protein (Osh4) was recently shown to bind either PtdIns4P or cholesterol via the same lipid-binding pocket and to exchange these two lipids on artificial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raychaudhuri and Prinz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Saint-Jean et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, genetic and biochemical interactions between enzymes that control PtdIns4P levels (both PI 4-kinases and PI 4-phosphatases), and enzymes of the sphingolipid metabolic pathways have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tabuchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breslow et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In view of these considerations, and of numerous findings that link PtdIns4P, its downstream metabolites, and the lipids indirectly controlled by PtdIns4P to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vicinanza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCrea and De Camilli, 2009</xref>), it is critically important to understand the mechanisms controlling PtdIns4P levels and metabolism on different membranes, in particular the plasma membrane, whose PtdIns4P pool serves as the precursor of the bulk of cellular PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. However, information on these mechanisms in metazoan cells is not as advanced as in yeast. The mammalian genome encodes four PI 4-kinase isoforms. PI4KIIIÎ± and PI4KIIIÎ² (encoded by <italic>PI4KA</italic> and <italic>PI4KB</italic>, respectively) are the homologues of the two major yeast PI 4-kinases, Stt4 and Pik1, which mediate PtdIns4P generation in the plasma membrane and Golgi complex, respectively, in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audhya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>). PI4KIIÎ± and PI4KIIÎ², two very similar proteins encoded by <italic>PI4K2A</italic> and <italic>PI4K2B</italic>, respectively, represent a duplication of yeast Lsb6 and function in the Golgi complex, the endosomal system, and also to some extent at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>In yeast, Stt4 has been shown to be localized at plasma membrane hotspots termed PI kinase (PIK) patches in a complex with the accessory proteins Efr3 and Ypp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, considering that the bulk of the cortical ER is tightly apposed to the plasma membrane in this organism, Stt4 contains a so-called FFAT (two phenylalanines [FF] in an acidic tract) motif that enables binding to the integral ER membrane proteins Scs2/22. In fact, contact sites between the ER and the plasma membrane serve as hubs controlling PtdIns4P metabolism in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although a pharmacological and knockdown study has suggested that, as in the case of yeast Stt4, PI4KIIIÎ± functions in the generation of PtdIns4P at plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>), surprisingly little is known about this enzyme. Based on immunofluorescence, a localization of PI4KIIIÎ± in the ER has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wong et al., 1997</xref>), but such a localization remains highly debated, in spite of the partial conservation of its FFAT motif that would be expected to bind VAP-A/B, the mammalian Scs2/22 homologues. The exogenous expression of tagged PI4KIIIÎ± also failed to provide consistent results, and no evidence existed for its targeting to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>). In mammalian cells, ERâplasma membrane contacts are much less extensive than in yeast, and the bulk of the ER is not localized in close proximity to the plasma membrane. How the mechanisms of PtdIns4P generation have adjusted to the different architecture of cells of higher eukaryotes is an important open question.</p>
      <p>An issue of special interest is the link between the functions of Stt4/PI4KIIIÎ± and of Efr3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2008</xref>). Efr3 is the yeast homologue of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> rolling blackout (RBO), a protein expressed at high levels in the nervous system of this organism whose mutation is responsible for a temperature-sensitive paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). RBO was proposed to be a transmembrane lipase, and its potential role in lipid metabolism was supported by changes in phosphoinositide and diacylglycerol levels in temperature-sensitive <italic>rbo</italic> mutants at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Additional interest in the localization and properties of PI4KIIIÎ± came from the recent identification by several groups of this enzyme as a critical host factor for the hepatitis C virus life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borawski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trotard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvisi et al., 2011</xref>), pointing to PI4KIIIÎ± as to a potential target for antiâhepatitis C virus therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altan-Bonnet and Balla, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of addressing the still unclear and controversial subcellular localization of PI4KIIIÎ± and the function of the PtdIns4P pools regulated by this enzyme. Here, we show recruitment of PI4KIIIÎ± to the plasma membrane and show that its targeting requires presence in this membrane of EFR3/RBO, which we demonstrate to be a palmitoylated peripheral scaffold protein, not a transmembrane lipase. We also show that loss of PI4KIIIÎ± leads to a striking compensatory increase of PIPKIs that minimizes a global decrease in cellular levels of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, in spite of the dramatic decrease of PtdIns4P. However, the bulk of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> produced by this compensatory response is localized not in the plasma membrane but, surprisingly, on intracellular vesicles. Proteins and lipids normally segregated in the plasma membrane are also found on these vesicles, emphasizing how targeting of PI4KIIIÎ± to the plasma membrane is a key upstream event in defining the proteomic and lipidomic identity of this membrane.</p>

        <p>In contrast to yeast Stt4, which is localized at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audhya and Emr, 2002</xref>), a GFP-tagged PI4KIIIÎ± construct based on the published ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 1996</xref>) displayed diffuse cytosolic localization with no discernable enrichment on any cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>). We noted, however, that the mobility by SDS-PAGE of a construct corresponding to untagged PI4KIIIÎ± was slightly faster than the mobility of the endogenous protein, as assessed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, compare first and third lanes). We thus considered the possibility of an incorrect annotation and reexamined the reported translational start site of <italic>PI4KA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 1996</xref>). An alignment of vertebrate <italic>PI4KA</italic> homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) revealed substantial conservation upstream of the reported translation start site (hence defined as M1*; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 1996</xref>), including an additional conserved Met residue (defined as M1). Western blot analysis demonstrated that exogenously expressed M1-PI4KIIIÎ± co-migrated with endogenous PI4KIIIÎ±, in contrast to the smaller M1*-PI4KIIIÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, determination of <italic>PI4KA</italic> translation initiation sites using ribosome footprinting after harringtonine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>) suggested that M1, but not M1*, was a strong translation start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This analysis also revealed a potential non-AUG start site (ACG, encoding Thr and indicated as T* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) between M1 and M1*.</p>

The majority of GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± fluorescence was still localized in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). However, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy revealed that GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ±, but not GFP-M1*-PI4KIIIÎ±, transiently visited the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp1">Video 1</ext-link>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Although this dynamic behavior of PI4KIIIÎ± appeared to differ from that of its yeast homologue, Stt4, which forms stable PIK patches at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2008</xref>), our finding is consistent with a role for PI4KIIIÎ± at the plasma membrane.

        <p>Immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous PI4KIIIÎ± from mouse brain extracts, followed by mass spectrometry analysis, identified two interactors, EFR3B and TTC7B, that, interestingly, are the yeast homologues of Efr3 and Ypp1, the other constituents of yeast PIK patches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2008</xref>).

        <p>Individually, TTC7B was localized in the cytosol, whereas EFR3B was found constitutively at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Coexpression of GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± with EFR3B and TTC7B resulted in significant colocalization of all three proteins at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Control experiments demonstrated that although EFR3B could recruit TTC7B to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), EFR3B alone was not sufficient to recruit GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± to this membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). We note that the stable association of a large fraction of the cellular GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± pool with the plasma membrane when it is cooverexpressed with TTC7B and EFR3B stands in contrast the puncta observed by TIRF microscopy in cells expressing only GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Thus, most likely, when M1-PI4KIIIÎ± is overexpressed alone, its predominant localization in the cytosol as well as its dynamic behavior at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>) are explained by limiting amounts of endogenous EFR3B and TTC7B at the plasma membrane. Consistent with this possibility, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EFR3B (and its close homologue EFR3A) and/or TTC7B (and its close homologue TTC7A) resulted in a striking reduction of the dynamic GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± puncta at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that PI4KIIIÎ±, like its yeast homologue, is at least partially targeted to the plasma membrane and requires both EFR3 and TTC7 for efficient recruitment to this membrane.</p>

        <title>EFR3 is a peripheral membrane protein whose N-terminal palmitoylation is essential for plasma membrane localization</title>
        <p>To gain further understanding of the mechanisms that localize PI4KIIIÎ± to the plasma membrane, we investigated the membrane targeting of EFR3, as this protein is a necessary factor for recruiting both TTC7 and PI4KIIIÎ± to this membrane. At the molecular level, EFR3/RBO was proposed to function as an integral membrane lipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). Our bioinformatic analysis, however, predicted that none of the EFR3/RBO homologues from yeast to humans contains transmembrane regions and that the protein, instead, comprises multiple HEAT (Huntington, elongation factor 3, regulatory subunit A of protein phosphatase 2A, and target of rapamycin) repeats. Further sequence analysis identified a Cys-rich motif at the N terminus of EFR3 that is conserved in all metazoans and could potentially act as a palmitoylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Accordingly, a bioorthogonal metabolic labeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hang et al., 2011</xref>) revealed that FLAG-tagged EFR3A and EFR3B were palmitoylated at the N-terminal Cys-rich motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Importantly, palmitoylation-deficient mutants (C6S/C7S/C8S/C9S for EFR3A and C5S/C7S/C8S for EFR3B) were localized in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), and the EFR3B palmitoylation-deficient mutant was unable to recruit tagged TTC7B and M1-PI4KIIIÎ± to the plasma membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p>

Interestingly, the N-terminal Cys-rich motif is absent from yeast Efr3, indicating that, in spite of the evolutionary conservation of the PI4KIIIÎ±âEFR3âTTC7 complex, the mechanism that targets it to the plasma membrane is not conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes.</p>

        <p>Expression of RFP-PH<sup>PLCÎ´</sup>, a biosensor for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, revealed a robust reduction of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels at the plasma membrane as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). Most surprisingly, however, global levels of cellular PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, as assessed biochemically, were only moderately reduced in KO MEFs (to 80% of control cell levels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). A potential explanation for this modest change, which contrasts with the much stronger reduction in global PtdIns4P levels (to 25% of control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5 B</xref> and S4), in spite of the loss of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane, came from a further analysis of the localization of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and of the expression levels and localization of PIPKIs (the enzymes that generate PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from PtdIns4P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doughman et al., 2003</xref>) in PI4KIIIÎ± KO cells.

Furthermore, PIPKIs (PIPKIÎ² and PIPKIÎ³) were found to be massively up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>), and numerous actin comets were observed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp10">Video 5</ext-link>), a known effect of the ectopic accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rozelle et al., 2000</xref>).

Thus, loss of PI4KIIIÎ± in MEFs leads to initiation of homeostatic mechanisms by which cells attempt to restore PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels through a more efficient conversion of PtdIns4P to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in KO MEFs, but much of the PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> generated under such conditions is ectopically localized.</p>

To chronically prevent PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulation at the plasma membrane, we expressed an inositol 5-phosphatase construct with a C-terminal CAAX motif that ensures constitutive plasma membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Milosevic et al., 2005</xref>). Even 16 h after transfection, no PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-positive intracellular vesicles similar to those found in PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 H</xref>), suggesting that more complex homeostatic mechanisms are involved in their formation.</p>

        <p>Further characterization of the PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-positive intracellular vesicles in PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs revealed that they were positive for many proteins typically restricted to the plasma membrane. For example, they were decorated by AP-2â, epsin-, and dynamin-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Dynamin was also localized on actin comet tails (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp11">Video 6</ext-link>), as previously shown in cells overexpressing PIPKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and De Camilli, 2002</xref>). In contrast, the PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-positive vesicles did not colocalize with early or late endosomal markers (EEA1, Rab5, Rab9, and the PtdIns3P biosensor FYVE<sup>Hrs</sup>) or a Golgi/PtdIns4P marker (PH<sup>OSBP</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Additionally, integral and peripheral membrane proteins normally selectively segregated at the plasma membrane, including fluorescently tagged M1 muscarinic receptor (M1R-YFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wess et al., 2007</xref>) and myristoylated/palmitoylated Lck membrane anchor (L<sub>10</sub>-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodgers, 2002</xref>), were found at these intracellular sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Likewise, wild-type EFR3B partially relocalized to the intracellular structures positive for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>), suggesting a reciprocal requirement of both EFR3 and PI4KIIIÎ± for correct targeting of the PI4KIIIÎ±âEFR3âTTC7 complex to the plasma membrane. Additionally, plasma membrane levels of cholesterol, a lipid normally concentrated in this membrane, were â¼20% lower in PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs relative to controls, whereas intracellular levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Thus, PI4KIIIÎ± appears to be a critical determinant of the lipidomic and proteomic identity of the plasma membrane.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study provides answers to long-standing questions concerning the generation of PtdIns4P at the plasma membrane. It has long been known that an important pool of PtdIns4P exists in this membrane, and studies in both yeast and higher eukaryotes had implicated Stt4/PI4KIIIÎ± in its generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audhya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balla et al., 2005</xref>). However, the localization in cells of higher eukaryotes of this enzyme, which is expected to be of fundamental importance in cell physiology because its product is an essential precursor of key regulatory messenger molecules, had remained highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>). The prevailing view was that it was predominantly localized in the ER (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altan-Bonnet and Balla, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2012</xref>), and no evidence has been reported for its targeting to the plasma membrane.</p>
      <p>Because of lack of suitable antibodies for the detection of the endogenous protein by immunocytochemistry (despite repeated attempts), the subcellular targeting of PI4KIIIÎ± can only be explored by the expression of tagged PI4KIIIÎ±. Here, we show that the failure of a previous study to reveal an association of PI4KIIIÎ± with the plasma membrane is explained by the incorrect identification of the N-terminal sequence of this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>). We demonstrate that EFR3/RBO and TTC7, the mammalian homologues of yeast Efr3 and Ypp1, play a key role in the recruitment of PI4KIIIÎ± to the plasma membrane. As in yeast, EFR3 is constitutively localized at the plasma membrane, but it is not capable of recruiting PI4KIIIÎ± in the absence of Ypp1/TTC7. TTC7 is a soluble protein that requires interaction with EFR3 for membrane recruitment and likely acts as a bridge between PI4KIIIÎ± and EFR3.</p>
      <p>In yeast, in which fluorescently tagged proteins were expressed under the regulation of the endogenous promoter (and thus at physiological levels), Stt4 was shown to be stably associated with the plasma membrane at âPIK patches.â In our experiments, the recruitment of transfected GFP-tagged PI4KIIIÎ± to the plasma membrane was highly dynamic unless its binding partners EFR3B and TTC7B were also overexpressed, possibly reflecting its stoichiometric excess relative to EFR3 and TTC7 when expressed alone. Whether endogenous PI4KIIIÎ±, EFR3, and TTC7 form stable patches in mammalian cells remains an open question.</p>
      <p>A large fraction of the ER is constitutively closely apposed to the plasma membrane in yeast, and these contact sites play an important role in PtdIns4P metabolism, as the ER-localized PtdIns4P phosphatase Sac1 is thought to act in trans to dephosphorylate PtdIns4P in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>). Although the relationship between yeast PIK patches and ERâplasma membrane contact sites remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2008</xref>), it is of interest that Stt4 contains an amino acid sequence matching the so-called FFAT motif, which enables binding of cytosolic proteins to the ER-resident proteins Scs2/Scs22. This motif is partially conserved in PI4KIIIÎ± and thus could mediate the association of a small PI4KIIIÎ± pool with the ER via the mammalian Scs2/Scs22 homologue VAP-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2005</xref>), although contacts between the cortical ER and the plasma membrane are less abundant and smaller in mammalian cells compared with in yeast. No evidence for a major association of PI4KIIIÎ± with the ER was obtained in our study.</p>
      <p>Importantly, our results shed new light on EFR3/RBO. They demonstrate that EFR3 is not a transmembrane lipase as originally proposed by a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). First, improved structural predictions do not support the presence of transmembrane regions or of a lipase-type fold. Instead, our bioinformatic analysis predicts that EFR3 is a cytosolic protein consisting entirely of Î±-helical HEAT repeats. Second, the protein is palmitoylated at a conserved Cys-rich motif at its N terminus, and mutation of the Cys residues in this motif abolishes the plasma membrane targeting of EFR3. Interestingly, the palmitoylation motif is conserved in all metazoan EFR3 homologues but is absent from yeast Efr3, demonstrating a conservation of function in spite of potentially divergent membrane-targeting mechanisms. In view of this revised function of EFR3/RBO, it will be of interest to reassess and further investigate the mechanisms of the temperature-sensitive paralytic phenotype in <italic>Drosophila rbo</italic> mutants.</p>
      <p>The association of PI4KIIIÎ± with the plasma membrane that we show here and the results of our gene KO experiments provide conclusive evidence for a role of PI4KIIIÎ± as a key contributor to plasma membrane PtdIns4P, as previously suggested by pharmacological and knockdown studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balla et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2008</xref>). Interestingly, in the absence of PI4KIIIÎ±, cells very strongly up-regulate the expression of PIPKIs, which convert PtdIns4P to PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, so that PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels are much less drastically decreased than PtdIns4P levels. The intracellular signaling pathways underlying this compensatory change remain to be determined and represent an important question to be addressed by future work. Additionally, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which is normally primarily concentrated at the plasma membrane, was surprisingly mislocalized on intracellular structures in PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs, leading to a partial relocation onto these vesicles of actin regulatory proteins and endocytic proteins normally restricted to the plasma membrane. Because binding to PtdIns4P contributes to the membrane targeting of PIPKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kunz et al., 2002</xref>), PtdIns4P generated on endosomes by type II PI 4-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>) may play a role in the ectopic localization of the PIPKIs and may function as a substrate for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> generation. Thus, it remains possible that the very robust reduction in total PtdIns4P levels observed in PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs may be caused not only by lack of PtdIns4P production at the plasma membrane but also by increased consumption of the PtdIns4P pool generated by type II PI 4-kinases.</p>
      <p>Importantly and strikingly, the selective localization of specific intrinsic membrane proteins of the plasma membrane is disrupted by lack of PI4KIIIÎ±. In PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs, proteins normally segregated primarily in this membrane, including the M1 muscarinic receptor, a prototypical transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wess et al., 2007</xref>), and the myristoylated/palmitoylated N-terminal anchor of Lck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodgers, 2002</xref>), were also found and enriched on PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-positive intracellular structures, which adopted a plasma membraneâlike identity. Even EFR3, whose plasma membrane targeting is mediated by palmitoylation and thus at least partially via interactions with plasma membrane lipids (potentially cholesterol-enriched membrane rafts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster et al., 2003</xref>), localizes to such intracellular sites in PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs, indicating that the unique protein composition of the plasma membrane relative to other membranes is perturbed. Effects produced by the deficiency of plasma membrane PtdIns4P on other lipids in this membrane, notably cholesterol, may contribute to these changes. Thus, impairing the production of PtdIns4P at the plasma membrane drastically affects the proteomic and lipidomic composition of the plasma membrane, pointing to PI4KIIIÎ± as a key upstream factor in determining the âidentityâ of this membrane. We note that an independent study published just after our manuscript was submitted also reported that generation of PtdIns4P at the plasma membrane is a critical determinant of the identity of this membrane and that loss of plasma membrane PtdIns4P is not matched by a corresponding reduction in PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (some discrepancies between the two studies may depend upon the different experimental models; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that, in contrast to previous studies, at least a pool of PI4KIIIÎ± is targeted to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we provide mechanistic insight concerning the recruitment of PI4KIIIÎ± to this membrane and show that the PtdIns4P pool produced by this enzyme plays essential roles not only as a precursor to a variety of key regulatory metabolites but also, either directly or via its downstream metabolites, as a critical determinant of plasma membrane homeostasis and identity.</p>

The targeting vector (Gene Dynamics) was electroporated into hybrid C57BL/6J-129S1/Sv mouse embryonic stem cells (Yale Cancer Center Animal Genomics Shared Resource), and positive clones were identified by Southern blotting (Gene Dynamics; Fig. S3). Targeted embryonic stem cells were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J mice and transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant recipient females. Chimeric male offspring were subsequently crossed to a enhanced flippase recombinase-expressing deleter strain (B6.Cg-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J; The Jackson Laboratory) to remove the neomycin resistance gene. Obtained conditional mutant mice were then crossed with either a Î²-actin-Cre mouse (FVB/N-Tg(ACTB-cre)2Mrt/J; The Jackson Laboratory) to delete the <italic>PI4KA</italic> gene ubiquitously or a strain expressing an Esr1-Cre fusion protein (B6;129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(cre/ERT)Nat</sup>/J; The Jackson Laboratory) to generate mutants in which <italic>PI4KA</italic> gene ablation could be induced pharmacologically by the addition of 4-OHT. Animal care and use was performed in accordance with our institutional guidelines. Genotyping of the mutant mice was performed by PCR using the following primers: wild-type allele, 5â²-CCGCCAGACTGACTTTGGCATGTATG-3â² and 5â²-CCAGCATGATGTTGCCATTGTGCCTG-3â²; KO allele, 5â²-GGATGCTGTGCAGCACCACTCCCTC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCTGTGTCCAACATGAGTGTAACCAG-3â²; and floxed allele, 5â²-GGCAGAGGCAGGTGAATCTCTGAGTTCAAG-3â² and 5â²-GCAAGGGAGCATCAGGCTCTGGC-3â².</p>

        <title>Generation of PI4KIIIÎ± conditional KO MEFs</title>
        <p>Primary MEFs were generated from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 1 from the appropriate strains. Some populations of MEFs were immortalized using the standard NIH 3T3 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>). To generate cells lacking PI4KIIIÎ±, recombination was induced by treatment of cells with 0.3â1.5 ÂµM 4-OHT for 24â36 h followed by replacement of the media and subsequent growth for a total period of 7â10 d. Cells were grown in DMEM containing glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin supplement. In this study, three different sets of control and KO cells were used interchangeably, as indicated in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp13">Table S2</ext-link>, and no differences were observed between sets of control/KO pairs in all assays in which multiple sets were tested.</p>

        <title>Quantification of phosphoinositide levels</title>
        <p>For the quantification of PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, control and PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs were metabolically labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]myo-inositol for days 7â10 after treatment with 4-OHT (in the case of PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs). Cells were lysed in 4.5% perchloric acid, and the pellet was rinsed three times with 0.1 M EDTA. The pellet was deacylated with a mixture of methylamine/water/<italic>n</italic>-butanol/methanol (36:8:9:47) for 1 h at 50Â°C and dried in a SpeedVac (SVC 100; Savant), and the residue was extracted using 500 Âµl of a mixture of <italic>n</italic>-butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate (20:40:1) and 500 Âµl of water. The aqueous phase was resolved using anion-exchange HPLC with an ammonium phosphate gradient (LC-20AT ultra-fast liquid chromatography [Shimadzu] equipped with a Partisil 5 SAX 4.6 Ã 125âmm column [Whatman]) and identified using a radiometric detector (Î²-RAM 4B; LabLogic). The identity of each peak was determined by comparison with known compounds, and the values reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> are shown as the amount of the desired lipid as a percentage of total detectable inositol phospholipids (PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>). For the time course of phosphoinositide measurements shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201206095/DC1" id="supp14">Fig. S4</ext-link>, total anionic lipids were isolated by lysis in 1:1 methanol/aqueous 1 M HCl and 2 mM AlCl<sub>3</sub> followed by addition of chloroform, extraction of the organic layer with 1:1 methanol/2 mM oxalic acid, and evaporation of the solvent. Deacylation was performed as described previously in this paragraph, and the resultant glycerol-inositol phosphate peaks were analyzed by an HPLC system (Dionex; Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a conductivity detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakatsu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

        <title>Acute depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> using an optogenetic approach</title>
        <p>PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was depleted from HeLa cells essentially as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, HeLa cells were transfected with CIBN-CAAX, mCherry-CRY2-5Ptase<sup>OCRL</sup>, and iRFP-PH<sup>PLCÎ´</sup> and kept in the dark before the experiment. PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion was initiated by illumination with 488-nm light after a baseline image of the mCherry and iRFP channels was acquired. Constant PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion was ensured by repeated 200-ms illuminations with 488-nm light at 1-min intervals for 1 h, whereas mCherry and iRFP images were acquired at 15-min intervals to minimize photobleaching.</p>

        <title>Cholesterol measurements</title>
        <p>Total free cholesterol was analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shui et al., 2011</xref>). Only HPLC-grade solvents were used, and the deuterated cholesterol standard (cholesterol-26,26,26,27,27,27-d<sub>6</sub>) was obtained from C/D/N Isotopes Inc. In brief, total cellular lipid extracts were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of chloroform/methanol, spiked with 2.5 Âµg/ml cholesterol-d<sub>6</sub>, and analyzed using an HPLC system (1100 Series; Agilent Technologies) coupled to a mass spectrometer (3200 QTRAP; Applied Biosystems). The multiple reaction monitoring transitions for endogenous cholesterol (369.4/161.0) and cholesterol-d<sub>6</sub> (375.4/161.0) were monitored in positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode. Measured cholesterol levels were first normalized to the cholesterol-d<sub>6</sub> standard and finally presented relative to the measured phospholipid concentration to account for sample-to-sample variation. The values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref> represent the mean free cholesterol shown as a percentage of control cell levels. Error bars represent the standard deviation (<italic>n</italic> = 12 each for control and KO). Plasma membrane cholesterol levels were quantified by brief exposure of cells to methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (MÎ²CD; Sigma-Aldrich) followed by measurement of the amount of extracted cholesterol using an enzyme-coupled assay, normalizing to total protein content determined after cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zidovetzki and Levitan, 2007</xref>). In brief, control and PI4KIIIÎ± KO MEFs were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with 10 mM MÎ²CD (in PBS) at room temperature for 1 min. The solution was then collected, and the concentration of free cholesterol was determined using the enzyme-coupled assay kit (Amplex Red; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, with fluorescence detection on a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite M1000; Tecan). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet [cOmplete]), and protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The relative cholesterol concentration for each sample was normalized to protein concentration (<italic>n</italic> = 6 each for control and KO).</p>

        <title>Image analysis</title>
        <p>Image analysis was performed using Volocity and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For the quantification of GFP-PH<sup>Osh2</sup> and GFP-PH<sup>PLCÎ´</sup>, a ratio of plasma membrane to cytosolic signal (derived from a line scan) was computed for each cell and averaged (<italic>n</italic> = 29 cells for control; <italic>n</italic> = 30 cells for KO for GFP-PH<sup>Osh2</sup> and <italic>n</italic> = 22 cells for control; <italic>n</italic> = 23 cells for KO for GFP-PH<sup>PLCÎ´</sup>). For quantification of GFP-M1-PI4KIIIÎ± plasma membrane puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), samples were blinded, a random 100 Ã 100âpixel area was cropped, and puncta were counted manually (<italic>n</italic> = 4â6 cells per condition).</p>
