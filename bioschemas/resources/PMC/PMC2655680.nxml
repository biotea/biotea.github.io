      <abstract>
        <p>Short-patch repair of DNA single-strand breaks and gaps (SSB) is coordinated by XRCC1, a scaffold protein that recruits the DNA polymerase and DNA ligase required for filling and sealing the damaged strand. XRCC1 can also recruit end-processing enzymes, such as PNK (polynucleotide kinase 3â²-phosphatase), Aprataxin and APLF (aprataxin/PNK-like factor), which ensure the availability of a free 3â²-hydroxyl on one side of the gap, and a 5â²-phosphate group on the other, for the polymerase and ligase reactions respectively. PNK binds to a phosphorylated segment of XRCC1 (between its two C-terminal BRCT domains) via its Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. We show here, contrary to previous studies, that the FHA domain of PNK binds specifically, and with high affinity to a multiply phosphorylated motif in XRCC1 containing a pSer-pThr dipeptide, and forms a 2:1 PNK:XRCC1 complex. The high-resolution crystal structure of a PNKâFHAâXRCC1 phosphopeptide complex reveals the basis for this unusual <italic>bis</italic>-phosphopeptide recognition, which is probably a common feature of the known XRCC1-associating end-processing enzymes.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Short-patch repair of DNA single-strand breaks and gaps (SSBs) is coordinated by the multi-domain XRCC1 protein, which acts as a âscaffoldâ, recruiting and organising the DNA polymerase (PolÎ²) and DNA ligase (Lig3Î±) that fill in the missing nucleotides and seal the phosphodiester backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Facile error-free repair of SSBs depends on the availability of a free 3â²-hydroxyl on one side of the gap, and a 5â²-phosphate group on the other, which respectively permit template-directed DNA synthesis and ATP-dependent ligation. However, in many circumstances the DNA damage event that caused the gap, leaves end-chemistries that cannot be extended or ligated, and end-processing is required before SSB repair can be completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Polynucleotide kinase 3â² phosphatase (PNK or PNKP) is a bifunctional DNA end-processing enzyme that facilitates SSB repair by phosphorylating 5â²-hydroxyls and/or dephosphorylating 3â²-phosphates at the margins of DNA single-strand gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). PNK interacts, via its N-terminal forkhead-associated domain (FHA), with a segment of XRCC1 (between the central and C-terminal BRCT domains) that is multiply phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). PNK is also involved in non-homologous end-joining repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) via its interaction with a similar phosphorylated segment C-terminal to the coiled-coil region of the structurally unrelated XRCC4 scaffold protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). FHA domains are implicated in proteinâprotein interactions in a wide and diverse range of cellular proteins, and have been found to bind preferentially to amino-acid sequences containing a single phospho-threonine (pThr) residue.</p><p>Although previous studies had indicated that the PNKâFHA domain has the conventional specificity for phospho-threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the tight clustering of the identified CK2 phosphorylation sites within XRCC1, suggests that the situation might be more complicated. To gain some insight into this we have analysed the binding of PNK to phosphorylated XRCC1 protein biochemically, and performed a quantitative calorimetric analysis of the interaction of the PNKâFHA domain with a series of phosphorylated XRCC1 peptides. We show here that, contrary to previous studies, the FHA domain of PNK binds specifically, and with high affinity to a <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated target sequence in XRCC1 containing vicinal pThr-pSer residues. The structural basis for this is revealed by a high-resolution crystal structure of the human PNKâFHA domain binary complex with a phosphorylated XRCC1-derived peptide. The distinctive characteristics of the PNKâFHA are also found on the FHA domains of two other DNA repair end-processing enzymes, APTX (aprataxin) and APLF (aprataxin/PNK-like factor), defining a distinct subset of FHA domains specifically adapted to <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylation-specific binding to the DNA repair scaffold proteins, XRCC1 and XRCC4.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The phospho-XRCC1 (pSer518/pSer519/pThr523) antibody used throughout this study was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA (Catalogue number: A300-059A).</p></sec><sec><title>Peptides</title><p>All peptides were synthesized and purified in-house by the Peptide Synthesis Facility, ICR.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression vectors</title><p>pTWO-E is a modified pET-17b (Novagen, Merck Chemicals, Nottingham, UK) vector engineered to encode an N-terminal, 3C-Protease cleavable, His<sub>6</sub> affinity tag.</p><p>pTWO-B is a modified pFASTBAC1 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) that encodes an N-terminal, 3C-Protease cleavable, His<sub>6</sub> affinity tag.</p><p>pTHREE-E is a modified pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare, UK Ltd, Little Chalfont, UK) vector engineered to contain the multiple cloning site of pET-17b and encodes an N-terminal 3C-Protease cleavable, GST affinity tag.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene synthesis</title><p>A synthetic gene encoding the N-terminal region of human PNK (amino acids 1â139, including the FHA domain) was constructed using recursive PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

However adding the fourth putative CK2 phosphorylated residue, pSer525, offered no significant further increase in affinity.</p><p>The consistent observation of a 2:1 stoichiometry for PNKâFHA-binding to all the peptides tested, other than that phosphorylated on Thr523 only, was surprising. To determine if this was related to the use of the isolated FHA domain, we repeated the titrations with full-length human PNK, against the pSer518/pThr519, and pSer518/pThr519/pThr523/pSer525 peptides. The measured affinities for these peptides (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.57 ÂµM and 0.10 ÂµM, respectively) were comparable to those obtained with the isolated FHA domains, and the stoichiometries obtained for the full-length proteins (<italic>N</italic> = 0.61 and 0.49) were similarly consistent with formation of 2:1 complexes with the peptide in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Finally we inverted the ITC experiment from the normal arrangement with the protein in the cell and the peptide injected. When PNKâFHA was injected into the cell containing the pSer518/pThr519 peptide, the measured affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 2.23 ÂµM) was comparable to that obtained in the inverted experiment, with the measured stoichiometry (<italic>N</italic> = 1.76) inverted, but fully consistent with formation of a 2:1 proteinâpeptide complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).</p><p>The binding data are suggestive of two possible PNKâFHA-binding sites within the 12 residues of the XRCC1 CK2 clusterâa primary site centred on pThr519 and a secondary site centred on pThr523. The 1:1 stoichiometry for binding to the pThr523-only peptide as compared to the 2:1 stoichiometry for all the peptides containing pThr519, is further suggestive of hierarchical co-operative binding, whereby an FHA bound to Thr519 can facilitate binding of a second FHA to Thr523 (most tightly when phosphorylated), but not the other way round. To test this, we made a further pSer518/pThr519 peptide in which the kernal of the putative secondary site, Thr523, was mutated to valineâa residue isosteric with threonine, but unable to make the polar interactions that are likely to contribute to peptide binding. PNKâFHA bound this with a comparable affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.70 ÂµM) to the equivalent wild-type peptide (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.23 ÂµM), but with a stoichiometry (<italic>N</italic> = 0.91) indicative of a single site of binding, consistent with abrogation of the secondary binding site by the Thr523Val mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E).</p></sec><sec><title>Structural basis for <italic>bis</italic>-phospho-peptide binding by PNKâFHA</title><p>The strong additive interaction we observe for the PNKâFHA binding to the <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated pS518/pT519 motif is clearly different from the specificity previously described for FHA domains in general, but most importantly also differs from that ascribed to the PNKâFHA domain itself in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To investigate this further we sought to obtain co-crystals of human PNKâFHA/bound to XRCC1 phospho-peptides whose binding we had characterized. However initial attempts only yielded crystals of the unliganded FHA domain (PDB: 2BRF), which had an unusually low solvent content (â¼38% v/v) and diffracted strongly to high resolution. Careful analysis of the crystal packing in this structure revealed a crowded environment around the expected peptide-binding site, incompatible with retention of the peptide ligand on formation of this very stable lattice. We therefore introduced a mutation into the protein (Leu99Glu) in a residue involved in a substantial hydrophobic crystal packing interface, but distant from the peptide-binding site, with the aim of preventing formation of this crystal form. Using the mutant FHA domain we obtained a new crystal form containing a complex of the FHA domain and the <italic>tris</italic>-phosphorylated XRCC1 peptide (pSer518/pThr519/pThr523).</p><p>As in the previously described murine PNKâFHAâXRCC4 peptide complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the XRCC1-peptide binds across the tips of the loops connecting the Î²-strands that form either face of the FHA domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Clear electron density is visible for the bound peptide from XRCC1 residue Tyr515 to Asn522, including the phosphorylated residues pSer518 and pThr519. However the third phosphorylated residue pThr523 and the three residues following that, are not resolved despite our âcrystal engineeringâ attempts; the packing of the FHA domains within the new crystal lattice seemingly incompatible with a 2:1 protein; peptide-binding mode.

At the N-terminus XRCC1-Tyr515 packs between the side chains of PNK Pro37 and Thr42âthe conformation of Tyr515 suggests that the chain N-terminal to this would not contact the FHA domain. C-terminal to this, the main chain carbonyls of Tyr515 and the two consecutive residues Ala516 and Gly517, are all directed down towards the FHA domain, and make hydrogen bonding interactions with the guanidinium head group of Arg35. This residue also hydrogen-bonds to the OÎ³ of the phosphorylated pThr519. The interaction with Arg35 fixes the conformation of the XRCC1 peptide from residue 515 to residue 519, and locks it between the side chains of Arg44 and Arg48, which form a narrow hydrophobic but intensely charged clamp, around the main chain at Gly517 and the phosphorylated serine, pSer518 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). The NÎµ and NH moieties of Arg48 also provide additional hydrogen bonds to the phosphate group of pThr519.</p><p>The pendant phosphate group of pSer518 has two alternate conformations in the crystals, related by a â¼120Â° rotation around the CÎ±-CÎ² bond. In either conformation, the phosphate group is in close proximity to the guanidinium head-groups of one or other of the side chains of Arg44 or Arg48, making direct or water bridged hydrogen-bonding interactions. In any case, the proximity of the negatively charged phosphate group to both these positively charge side-chains would provide a very favourable electrostatic interaction.</p><p>Whether both these favourable alternative conformations would persist in free solution is unclear, as the tip of the phosphate group is involved in interactions with a calcium ion required for crystal formation, and this likely perturbs the conformational energetics of the pSer518 side-chain conformation. In contrast, the pendant phosphate of pThr519 is locked down in a cage of hydrogen bonds provided by the side chain hydroxyl of PNK Ser47, and peptide and side-chain nitrogens of PNK Arg48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D).</p><p>Beyond pThr519, the conformation of the XRCC1 peptide is determined by main-chain to side-chain hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chain of PNK Asn70 and Lys45.

Recognition centres on the core pThr residue, which interacts with a Ser-Arg sequence (47 Ser-Arg 48 in hPNK) that is very highly conserved amongst FHA domains. However, the determinants of specificity outside of the core pThr vary considerably, with residues preceding and/or following the pThr making substantially different contributions in the different classes of FHA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Previous studies of the PNKâFHA domain and its interaction with XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) have highlighted the importance of residues â2, â3 and +1 relative to the pThr, and in particular the apparent absence of significant +3 interactions, unlike many other FHA domains, where this is an important feature.</p><sec><title>Specificity of PNKâFHA</title><p>In the XRCC1 peptide complex described here however, PNKâFHA shows a clear and highly specific +3 interaction involving the side chains of XRCC1 Asn522 and PNK Asn97, indicating that, at least in this respect, PNKâFHA may not be as distinctive as originally suggested. The equivalent to XRCC1 Asn522 in XRCC4 is a glutamic acid (Glu236), which is disordered in the XRCC4 peptide complex. Interestingly, Asn (as in XRCC1) is indicated as the preferred +3 substituent in a peptide array analysis of PNKâFHA-binding preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C therein), whereas Glu (as in XRCC4) appears somewhat disfavoured.

That Ser518 was not phosphorylated in the XRCC4 complex is probably responsible for the different conformation observed for Arg44 in the two complexes. In both cases, the residues at â2 and â3 relative to the pThr, make no side-chain contacts with the protein that could mediate selectivity for these positions, and the specificity of FHA for the XRCC1 and XRCC4 sequences resides in the polar and electrostatic interactions with phosphorylated and acidic residues at 0, â1, +1 and +2, the hydrophobic interaction with Tyr at â4, and (for XRCC1) with the amide-side chain of the Asn at +3. In the schematics on the right, residues with a red (strictly) or orange (highly) background are conserved across FHA domains.

In both crystal structures the â2 and â3 residues of the peptide (XRCC1: G,A â XRCC4: E,D) are actually distinguished by having no side chain interactions with the FHA domain that could mediate specificity. Furthermore, the consensus derived from the peptide array data, would apparently preclude the â2 and â3 residues, Gly and Ala, that actually occur in XRCC1, so its biological relevance is open to question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B).</p></sec><sec><title>PNKâFHA binds <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated motifs</title><p>Where PNKâFHA does genuinely appear distinctive, is in its preferential binding to a <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated motif. Thus while PNKâFHA binds the pThr519-XRCC1 peptide with an affinity â¼10 Î¼M, its affinity for the pSer518/pThr519 peptide is nearly 10 times greater. The contribution of the phosphorylated â1 residue is purely additive to a necessary core pThr-dependent interaction, so that a pSer518 monophosphorylated peptide shows no significant binding. The pSer in the â1 position relative to the core pThr, is able to make direct hydrogen bonding interactions with residues in the FHA domain, but will also provide a strong favourable electrostatic interaction with the intense positive charge generated by the side chains of Arg 35, Arg 44 and Arg 48. Indeed, this, rather than any specific recognition process, may be the explanation for the apparent preference for acidic residues at the â2 and â3 positions in the XRCC4 peptide array study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests of XRCC1 extracted from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) indicated that an isolated fragment (corresponding to amino acids 503â546) was a mixture of tri- and tetra-phosphorylated species. Additionally, it was noted that residues Ser518 and Thr523 are consensus CK2 phosphorylation sites, whilst those of Thr519 and Ser525 were considered to be atypical or hierarchical sites. Together, these data strongly suggest that pThr519 most likely only exists in cells in a <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated context (i.e. along with pSer518).</p><p>Previous studies of the interaction of PNKâFHA with XRCC4 did not discover the preferential binding to the adjacent <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated motif we describe here for XRCC1. However, both XRCC1 and XRCC4 scaffold proteins share the core Ser-Thr-Asp-Glu motif, in which the downstream acidic side chains directs CK2-phosphorylation of the serine and threonine residues. Thus, it is highly likely that this motif is <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated in both cases, and bound by PNKâFHA in the same way.</p><p>PNK is one of three mammalian DNA repair enzymes with distinctive and related N-terminal FHA domains that have so far been shown to bind to XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Although only the structure of the PNKâFHA is currently available, the FHA sequences of PNK, APTX and APLF show strong conservation of the distinct sequence motifs that in PNK mediate interaction with the main specificity determinants in XRCC1. While yet to be formally demonstrated, the likelihood is therefore, that the FHA domains of APTX and APLF will also show preferential binding to the adjacent <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated pSer518-pThr519 motif. Indeed, Aprataxin has been shown to bind with a higher affinity to a <italic>tris</italic>-phosphorylated XRCC1 peptide (pSer518/pThr519/pThr523) than a mono-phosphorylated peptide (pT523) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>While this work was in progress, the FHA domain of the yeast checkpoint kinase Dun1p, was shown to bind preferentially to a di-phospho-threonine motif generated by ATM/ATR in the SQ/TQ cluster domain of the upstream kinase Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, unlike the adjacent phosphorylated residues in the XRCC1 and XRCC4 motifs, the two pThr residues in Rad53 are separated by two residues. Furthermore, the mode of interaction, as indicated by an NMR structure of the Dun1-FHA bound to a <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated Rad53 decapeptide, is markedly different, with no equivalent to the Ser-Arg âcageâ interaction seen in PNK and other FHA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and with the N-terminal of the two pThr binding in a similar region on the FHA domain as the tyrosine in the XRCC1/XRCC4 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B).

XRCC1 possesses an additional threonine residue, again in the context of downstream acidic residues (523 Thr-Asp-Ser-Glu-Glu 527) that can also be phosphorylated by CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody specific to a <italic>tris</italic>-phosphorylated XRCC1 peptide (see Methods section) we found that Thr523, like the upstream pSer518 and pThr519 appears protected from dephosphorylation by PNKâFHA, and that PNKâFHA bound to a pThr523 mono-phosphorylated peptide with similar affinity as to a mono-phosphorylated pThr519 peptide. Taken together, these data indicate that both the threonine residues in this region of XRCC1 are capable of being phosphorylated by CK2, and when phosphorylated, of providing binding sites for PNK. Significantly, the ITC data shows that the two sites co-operate, and an XRCC1 peptide phosphorylated on both threonines binds two PNKâFHA molecules, with &gt;15-fold higher affinity than for either site in isolation, and with &gt;50-fold higher affinity when Ser518 is also phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).
<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Hierarchical co-operative binding of PNKâFHA domains. PNKâFHA binds with modest affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> â¼10 Î¼M) to the XRCC1 FHA-binding region when phosphorylated on either Thr518 <bold>(a)</bold> or Thr523 <bold>(b)</bold>. An FHA bound to the pThr518 site can stabilize the very weak interaction of a second FHA domain bound to the Thr523 site, even when not phosphorylated, probably by direct proteinâprotein contacts. However an FHA domain bound to pThr523 cannot stabilize the binding of a second FHA to the unphosphorylated Thr518 site. When both sites are fully phosphorylated <bold>(c)</bold>, which is the likely result of the hierarchical phosphorylation of this region by CK2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, two FHA domains can bind with &gt;50-fold higher affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> â¼0.1 Î¼M), suggesting the presence of a far more stable complex than had been suggested by previous studies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1086f6"/></fig></p><p>The co-operation between the two sites is however hierarchical, with binding to the pThr519 (more so with simultaneous pSer518) being able to facilitate binding to the Thr523 site, most tightly when phosphophorylated, but to some degree even when not. That the second binding site is indeed focussed on Thr523 is demonstrated unequivocally by the effect of the Thr523Val mutation, which shifts the binding stoichiometry to â¼1:1. The nature of the interactions between the FHA domains, that mediate co-operative binding to the pThr-sites remain to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Recognition of a <italic>bis</italic>-phosphorylated motif provides PNK, and probably the other FHA-domain DNA end-processing enzymes, APTX and APLF, with a unique mechanism for highly specific recognition of their binding sites in the XRCC1 and XRCC4 DNA repair scaffolds. XRCC4 is known to be dimeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and might in principle therefore recruit two copies of PNK, APTX or APLF, potentially in homo- and hetero-combinations, although this is yet to be tested. XRCC1, although showing a degree of dimerization at higher concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic>, is primarily monomeric and interacts with nicked and gapped DNA substrates as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We show here that XRCC1 is also able to recruit two copies of PNK, and possibly two copies of APLF or APTX. However our preliminary data (not shown) suggests that it is not possible to obtain a PNKâXRCC1âAPTX hetero-complex, and this is certainly consistent with the observation that these enzymes reside in distinct XRCC1 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As PNK is a dual function enzyme, removing 3â²-phosphates from one end of a ssDNA gap and adding 5â²-phosphates at the other end, the presence of two binding sites on the XRCC1 scaffold may facilitate specific access of one or other of the two PNK active sites to their particular substrate âendâ of the gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Further work will be required to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1086/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by a Cancer Research UK Programme Grant (C302/A8265) (to L.H.P).
