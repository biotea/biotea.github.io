      <abstract>
        <p>In both humans and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, UDP-galactose 4â²-epimerase (GALE) catalyzes two distinct reactions, interconverting UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) and UDP-glucose (UDP-glc) in the final step of the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism, and also interconverting UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-galNAc) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-glcNAc). All four of these UDP-sugars serve as vital substrates for glycosylation in metazoans. Partial loss of GALE in humans results in the spectrum disorder epimerase deficiency galactosemia; partial loss of GALE in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> also results in galactose-sensitivity, and complete loss in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is embryonic lethal. However, whether these outcomes in both humans and flies result from loss of one GALE activity, the other, or both has remained unknown. To address this question, we uncoupled the two activities in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, effectively replacing the endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic> with prokaryotic transgenes, one of which (<italic>Escherichia coli GALE)</italic> efficiently interconverts only UDP-gal/UDP-glc, and the other of which (<italic>Plesiomonas shigelloides wbgU)</italic> efficiently interconverts only UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc. Our results demonstrate that both UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc activities of <italic>dGALE</italic> are required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> survival, although distinct roles for each activity can be seen in specific windows of developmental time or in response to a galactose challenge. By extension, these data also suggest that both activities might play distinct and essential roles in humans.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In this manuscript we apply a fruit fly model to explore the relative contributions of each of two different activities attributed to a single enzymeâUDP-galactose 4â²-epimerase (GALE); partial impairment of human GALE results in the potentially severe metabolic disorder epimerase deficiency galactosemia. One GALE activity involves interconverting UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism; the other activity involves interconverting UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We have previously demonstrated that complete loss of GALE is embryonic lethal in fruit flies, but it was unclear which GALE activity loss was responsible for the outcome. Using genetically modified fruit flies, we were able to remove or give back each GALE activity individually at different times in development and observe the consequences. Our results demonstrate that both GALE activities are essential, although they play different roles at different times in development. These results provide insight into the normal functions of GALE and also have implications for diagnosis and intervention in epimerase deficiency galactosemia.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Galactose is an essential component of glycoproteins and glycolipids in metazoans, and as a constituent monosaccharide of the milk sugar, lactose, also serves as a key nutrient for mammalian infants. Galactose is also found in notable quantities in some fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Galactose is both synthesized and catabolized in all species via the Leloir pathway, which is highly conserved across branches of the evolutionary tree <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Holden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The reactions of the Leloir pathway are catalyzed by the sequential activities of three enzymes: (1) galactokinase (GALK) which phosphorylates alpha-D-galactose to form galactose-1-phosphate (gal-1P), (2) galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), which transfers uridine monophosphate (UMP) from uridine diphosphoglucose (UDP-glc) to gal-1P, forming UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) and releasing glucose-1-phosphate (glc-1P), which can proceed to phosphoglucomutase and the glycolytic pathway, and (3) UDP-galactose 4â²-epimerase (GALE) which interconverts UDP-gal and UDP-glc <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Holden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In addition to a role in the Leloir pathway, metazoan GALE enzymes also interconvert UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-galNAc) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-glcNAc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Because it catalyzes reversible reactions, GALE therefore not only contributes to the catabolism of dietary galactose, but also enables the endogenous biosynthesis of both UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Kingsley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> when exogenous sources are limited.</p>

      <p>Deficiency in any of the three Leloir enzymes in humans results in a form of the metabolic disorder galactosemia, although the symptoms and clinical severity differ according to which enzyme is impaired and the extent of the impairment. Profound loss of hGALE results in generalized epimerase-deficiency galactosemia, an autosomal recessive and potentially severe disorder. To date, however, no patient has been reported with complete loss of GALE, and even the most severely affected demonstrate at least 5% residual enzyme activity <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Holton1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Previous studies have indicated that different patient mutations impair hGALE to different extents <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Maceratesi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002721-Wohlers2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Further, while some mutations impair both GALE activities similarly, others do not. For example, the <italic>hGALE</italic> allele V94M, which leads to severe epimerase-deficiency galactosemia in the homozygous state, encodes an enzyme that retains â¼5% residual activity toward UDP-gal but â¼25% residual activity toward UDP-galNAc <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Wohlers1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Wohlers2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Disparities such as this have raised the question of whether the pathophysiology of epimerase deficiency galactosemia results from the loss of GALE activity toward UDP-gal/UDP-glc, or toward UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc, or both.</p>
      <p>To address this question, we applied a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model of <italic>GALE</italic> deficiency <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Using this model, we have previously established that <italic>GALE</italic> is essential in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; animals completely lacking endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic> succumb as embryos, and conditional loss of <italic>dGALE</italic> in larvae results in death within two to four days of knockdown. Finally, partial loss of <italic>dGALE</italic> leads to galactose sensitivity in larvae, and transgenic expression of human <italic>GALE</italic> (<italic>hGALE</italic>) rescues each of these negative outcomes <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Quimby1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we have applied our transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to uncouple and examine the individual roles of GALE separately. Toward that end, we generated flies that lacked endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic> and expressed either of two prokaryotic transgenes, one encoding <italic>E. coli</italic> GALE (<italic>eGALE)</italic> which exhibits an approximately 8,000-fold substrate preference for UDP-gal/UDP-glc over UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Thoden1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and the other encoding <italic>P. shigelloides wbgU</italic>, which exhibits an approximately 2,000-fold substrate preference for UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc over UDP-gal/UDP-glc <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Kowal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. By expressing these prokaryotic transgenes individually or in combination in <italic>dGALE</italic>-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> we determined that both GALE activities are required for survival of embryos and larvae. We also found that restoration of one activity or the other in later development rescued some phenotypes. Combined, these results provide insight into the varied roles of <italic>dGALE</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and homeostasis, and by extension, suggest that <italic>hGALE</italic> may play similarly complex and essential roles in humans.</p>

<italic>The Drosophila</italic> GALE enzyme efficiently interconverts both UDP-gal/UDP-glc and UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc</title>
        <p>Human and other mammalian GALE enzymes efficiently interconvert both UDP-gal/UDP-glc and UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc (e.g. <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Maley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002721-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). Previously, we reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> GALE interconverts the first of these substrate pairs (UDP-gal/UDP-glc) <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but did not address whether dGALE could also interconvert the second. Here we demonstrate that dGALE from wild-type adult flies efficiently interconverts both substrate sets (left most bar, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Of note, while purified human GALE <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and dGALE each interconvert both UDP-gal/UDP-glc and UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc, the apparent specific activity of both human and fly enzymes toward UDP-gal is significantly higher than toward UDP-galNAc.</p>

        <p>To generate flies with epimerase activity toward only UDP-gal/UDP-glc or only UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc, we created transgenic lines expressing <italic>eGALE</italic> (<italic>UAS-eGALE</italic>) or <italic>wbgU</italic> (<italic>UAS-wbgU</italic>), respectively, each in a conditionally <italic>dGALE</italic>-impaired background.

To minimize background, activities of the encoded eGALE and WbgU enzymes toward UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc were assayed in flies knocked down for endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic>; results for the transgenes that demonstrated activities closest to those seen in wild-type <italic>Drosophila, eGALE<sup>62A</sup> and wbgU<sup>19A</sup>,</italic> are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

As a control we also tested lysates from <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown flies expressing a human <italic>GALE</italic> transgene; as expected, those samples demonstrated very strong activity toward both substrates.</p>

        <p>Previously, we created and characterized two <italic>dGALE</italic>-deficient alleles, <italic>dGALE<sup>f00624.4</sup></italic> and <italic>dGALE<sup>Îy</sup></italic>, which allowed us to demonstrate that <italic>GALE</italic> is essential for survival in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1002721-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To examine the requirement for the two different epimerase activities separately, we set up crosses which allowed for the expression of <italic>eGALE</italic> or <italic>wbgU</italic>, individually or in combination, driven by <italic>Act5C-GAL4</italic> in an otherwise <italic>dGALE</italic>-deficient background (<italic>dGALE<sup>f00624.4</sup>/dGALE<sup>Îy</sup></italic>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002721-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the observed to expected ratios of surviving transgenic offspring that eclosed from these crosses.

To rule out the possibility that rescue with <italic>eGALE</italic> plus <italic>wbgU</italic> in combination occurred not because both GALE activities are essential but rather because neither individual transgene expressed sufficient enzyme, we also tested additional <italic>eGALE</italic> and <italic>wbgU</italic> transgenes that individually demonstrated higher levels of expression; none was sufficient to rescue (data not shown). Of note, there also was no apparent over-expression phenotype; for example, animals expressing either <italic>eGALE</italic> or <italic>wbgU</italic> in <italic>addition</italic> to endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic>, and animals dramatically over-expressing human GALE, remained viable, fertile, and appeared morphologically normal (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Here we have expanded the <italic>GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic>conditional <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown system to include different <italic>GAL4</italic>-dependent <italic>GALE</italic> transgenes and have applied this expanded system to test the ability of each transgene, or pair of transgenes, to compensate for the loss of endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic>. By using age-synchronized cohorts of animals and shifting from the permissive (18Â°C) to the restrictive temperature (28â29Â°C) at different times we also were able to test the ability of each <italic>GALE</italic> transgene, or pair of transgenes, to sustain survival and fecundity at different stages of development. At 18Â°C these animals expressed endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic>, but not their transgenes, and at 28â29Â°C these animals expressed their transgenes but not <italic>dGALE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Specifically, we tested <italic>Drosophila</italic> that carried no <italic>GALE</italic> transgene, an <italic>eGALE</italic> transgene, a <italic>wbgU</italic> transgene, both <italic>eGALE</italic> and <italic>wbgU</italic> transgenes, or an <italic>hGALE</italic> transgene.</p>
        <p>As expected from prior results (<xref rid="pgen.1002721-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002721-t001">Table 1</xref>), animals expressing no <italic>GALE</italic> transgene succumbed when shifted to the restrictive temperature as larvae, while animals expressing either human <italic>GALE</italic> or both <italic>eGALE</italic> plus <italic>wbgU</italic> remained viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Surprisingly, expression of either <italic>eGALE</italic> or <italic>wbgU</italic> alone was also sufficient to rescue survival, albeit to a lesser extent. The fact that the individual prokaryotic transgenes were sufficient to rescue <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown animals, but not animals genetically null for <italic>dGALE</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002721-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggests that trace residual <italic>dGALE</italic> expression in the knockdown animals lowered the threshold of transgene function required for rescue.</p>
        <p>Of note, while <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown animals encoding either <italic>eGALE</italic> or <italic>wbgU</italic> remained viable following a shift to the restrictive temperature in early to mid-development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), these survivors were not entirely healthy. Specifically, these animals demonstrated either partial or complete loss of fecundity as adults. To test whether the degree of <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown was comparable between males and females, and therefore not a confounding factor in differential outcome, we performed GALE and GALT enzyme assays on newly eclosed and three day old male and female knockdown adults that carried no GALE transgene and that had been switched to the restrictive temperature as early to mid-stage pupa. The degree of GALE knockdown in both males and females was profound and comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). As expected, the level of GALE activity was even lower in the older animals, presumably because any GALE synthesized prior to the temperature switch had three additional days to decay. Also as expected, GALT activity was normal and apparently unaffected by the <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown in all samples tested (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To examine fecundity, we collected and sequestered newly eclosed virgin female and male flies from each surviving cohort, crossed them to an equal number of wild-type flies of the opposite sex, and counted the numbers of viable offspring resulting from each cross. Crosses resulting in large numbers of viable offspring (&gt;50) were scored as ânormal fecundityâ. Crosses resulting in fewer than 10 viable offspring were scored as âreduced fecundity,â and crosses resulting in no viable offspring were scored as âloss of fecundityâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). For example, when <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown was initiated during early to mid-stage pupal development, animals of both sexes displayed diminished fecundity. Expression of <italic>eGALE</italic> alone, but not <italic>wbgU</italic> alone, rescued the male defect, whereas expression of both prokaryotic transgenes in combination, or <italic>hGALE</italic> alone, was required to rescue the female defect. These results indicate that GALE activity toward UDP-gal is both necessary and sufficient for male fecundity, but that GALE activities toward both UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc are required for female fecundity.</p>

        <title>Galactose exposure of transgenic flies with late-onset <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown reveals differential roles of GALE activities toward UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc</title>

To assess the roles of the two <italic>GALE</italic> activities in coping with environmental galactose, we collected adult flies in which <italic>dGALE</italic> knockdown coupled with <italic>hGALE</italic>, <italic>eGALE</italic>, <italic>wbgU</italic>, or <italic>eGALE</italic> plus <italic>wbgU</italic> transgene expression was initiated using the <italic>GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic> system during late larval or early-to-mid-pupal development. These animals were allowed to develop on a standard molasses-based food, and were then transferred as newly eclosed adults to food containing either 555 mM glucose as the sole sugar, or 555 mM glucose plus 175 mM galactose.</p>
        <p>We assessed the lifespan of each cohort of animals on both foods; as a control, knockdown animals expressing no <italic>GALE</italic> transgene were also monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the absence of galactose, all cohorts showed similar longevity profiles, although females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) showed greater variability than males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In the presence of galactose, however, both males and females expressing either no <italic>GALE</italic> transgene, or only the <italic>wbgU</italic> transgene, demonstrated a dramatic reduction in life span (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g004">Figure 4B and 4D</xref>). Females expressing <italic>eGALE</italic> alone exhibited a slight decrease in life span that was independent of diet. Animals expressing <italic>hGALE</italic> or <italic>eGALE</italic>+<italic>wbgU</italic> had lifespans comparable to control animals expressing endogenous <italic>dGALE</italic>, regardless of diet.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>UDP-galactose 4â²-epimerase (GALE) is an essential enzyme in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1002721-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in humans <xref rid="pgen.1002721-FridovichKeil1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but until now the relative contributions of the two distinct GALE activities to development and galactose-tolerance has remained unclear. Understanding these roles has important implications regarding mechanism of galactose sensitivity, and may be applicable to diagnosis and prognosis in humans with epimerase-deficiency galactosemia. Our experiments described here exploit the genetic and biochemical facility of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to test the consequences of losing each of the two GALE activities individually at different stages of development, or under different conditions of galactose exposure.</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that developing animals require at least some GALE activity toward both epimer pairs, even in the absence of dietary galactose. Complete loss of either activity in embryos is lethal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002721-t001">Table 1</xref>). In animals with trace dGALE activity left by knockdown rather than genetic deletion or disruption, however, transgenic expression of either GALE activity alone is sufficient for rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002721-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Further, in animals that expressed both GALE activities as larvae, knockdown of both activities during pupation is not lethal.</p>
      <p>However, knockdown of either GALE activity in early development, or knockdown of both activities in later development has consequences. For example, loss of activity toward UDP-gal in larvae results in impaired fecundity of both males and females, while loss of activity toward UDP-galNAc in larvae results in impaired fecundity of females but not males. Individual loss of one activity or the other later in development also results in differential sensitivity to galactose. Specifically, both male and female flies deficient in GALE activity toward UDP-gal exhibit a markedly reduced lifespan when exposed to galactose; this effect is not seen in wild-type flies or in flies uniquely deficient in GALE activity toward UDP-galNAc.</p>
      <p>These results support two important conclusions. First, the essential role of GALE in development and homeostasis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> extends beyond the Leloir pathway. Whether GALE activity toward UDP-galNAc is essential because of its presumed role in establishing and maintaining substrate pools for glycosylation, or for some other reason, remains unknown. Prior studies in GALE-deficient mammalian cells <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Schulz2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> showed that uridine supplementation could rescue growth and some metabolic abnormalities caused by galactose exposure, raising the possibility that depleted pools of uridine or uridine-derivatives might also be contributing factors. In the current study it is also unclear whether animals subjected to knockdown of one or both GALE activities later in development demonstrate a less severe outcome than those knocked down earlier in development because the products of GALE function, namely UDP-gal, UDP-glc, UDP-galNAc, and UDP-glcNAc, are less essential later in development, or rather because these UDP sugars have already accumulated to sufficient levels and can be recycled for use. Similarly, the differential sensitivities of male and female fecundity to loss of GALE activity later in development may reflect fundamental differences in male and female development, or alternatively may reflect differential sensitivity to loss; for example, eggs may require a more substantial pool of specific UDP-sugar substrates than sperm to give rise to a viable embryo.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Implications for mechanism</title>
        <p>The disparate metabolic profiles observed in GALE-impaired flies exposed to galactose provide a window of insight into potential mechanisms behind the outcomes observed. For example, gal-1P accumulates to abnormal levels in animals missing GALE activity toward UDP-gal but not UDP-galNAc, and only those animals demonstrate substantially reduced lifespan when exposed to galactose as adults. This metabolic result is expected, since only GALE activity toward UDP-gal should impact the Leloir pathway, and this outcome result implies that gal-1P might contribute to the early demise of these animals. However, the gal-1P result also implies that the negative outcomes observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> deficient in GALE activity toward UDP-galNAc, e.g. compromised survival in embryos and compromised fecundity in adult females, do not result from gal-1P accumulation. This is an important point because it challenges the common supposition that gal-1P underlies pathophysiology in both classic and epimerase deficiency galactosemias. Clearly there must be another basis for the negative outcomes observed in these animals. It is also interesting to note that while loss of GALE activity toward UDP-galNAc in developing animals has phenotypic consequences, at least for female fecundity, it does not appear to negatively impact the âglobalâ level of UDP-galNAc in animals exposed to galactose. The explanation for this apparent disparity might involve subtle or tissue-specific differences below the threshold of detection of our experimental approach.</p>

        <title>Implications for patients</title>
        <p>The implications of this work for patients with epimerase deficiency galactosemia are two-fold. First, these results demonstrate that both GALE activities are essential for health of flies, and possibly also people. To our knowledge clinical laboratories that test patient samples for GALE activity only test activity toward UDP-gal. While this practice is certainly understandable, given that mutations may impact the two GALE activities differently <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Openo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002721-Wohlers4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the results presented here raise the possibility that rare patients with GALE deficiency limited to UDP-galNAc activity could be missed. Second, given the impact of GALE-loss on both male and female fecundity in flies, these results suggest that long-term studies of both male and female reproductive issues in epimerase-deficiency galactosemia patients might be warranted.</p>

The <italic>wbgU</italic> sequence was amplified from a plasmid generously provided by Peng George Wang (Ohio State University). Resulting plasmids were confirmed by sequence analysis. <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>eGALE</italic> stocks were generated using standard transgenic techniques following injection of the transgene into embryos by the fly core of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA. <italic>UAS-wbgU</italic> stocks were generated using standard transgenic techniques following injection of the transgene into embryos by Genetic Services, Inc., Cambridge, MA. Transformants were selected by the presence of the white gene within <italic>pUAST</italic>. Expression of functional <italic>eGALE</italic> or <italic>wbgU</italic> was confirmed by enzymatic assay of lysates from transformants.</p>

        <title>Measuring metabolite accumulation in GALEâdeficient larvae</title>
        <p>Cohorts of newly hatched larvae raised at 18Â°C were transferred to vials of food containing either 555 mM glucose only or 555 mM glucose plus 175 mM galactose. The larvae were maintained at 18Â°C for one additional day, then transferred to 28Â°â29Â°C and allowed to develop for another four days prior to harvest. Metabolites were extracted and quantified as described previously <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and were separated and quantified using a Dionex HPLC, as described previously <xref rid="pgen.1002721-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> with the following changes: UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc were separated using a high salt isocratic procedure with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and buffer concentrations of 45% A and 55% B (0â61 min), followed by washing with a linear increase of B to 95% (61â80 min). For all samples, 20 Âµl were injected into a 25 Âµl injection loop. Ratios of the level of each metabolite on food containing galactose over the level on food containing glucose only were calculated, and 95% confidence intervals were determined using Fieller's theorem.</p>
