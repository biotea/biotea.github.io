        <p>Although manganese is an essential trace metal, little is known about its transport and homeostatic regulation. Here we have identified a cohort of patients with a novel autosomal recessive manganese transporter defect caused by mutations in <italic>SLC39A14.</italic> Excessive accumulation of manganese in these patients results in rapidly progressive childhood-onset parkinsonismâdystonia with distinctive brain magnetic resonance imaging appearances and neurodegenerative features on post-mortem examination. We show that mutations in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> impair manganese transport <italic>in vitro</italic> and lead to manganese dyshomeostasis and altered locomotor activity in zebrafish with CRISPR-induced <italic>slc39a14</italic> null mutations. Chelation with disodium calcium edetate lowers blood manganese levels in patients and can lead to striking clinical improvement. Our results demonstrate that SLC39A14 functions as a pivotal manganese transporter in vertebrates.</p>

    <p>Precise physiological homeostasis of the essential trace metal manganese (Mn) is crucial for normal cell function. Mn acts as a cofactor for multiple enzymes and is involved in numerous physiological processes, including some that are critical for neuronal and glial cell function, such as neurotransmitter synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p>
    <p>Due to the ubiquity of Mn, nutritional deficiency of this trace metal has rarely been observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, mutations in <italic>SLC39A8</italic>, encoding a Mn uptake transporter, have recently been recognized to cause a severe Mn depletion syndrome associated with developmental delay, cerebellar atrophy, epilepsy and short stature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Biochemically, this disorder is accompanied by dysglycosylation resembling a type II congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) due to dysfunction of Mn-dependent enzymes such as the beta 1, 4 glycosyltransferase involved in galactosylation of glycoproteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
    <p>Excessive Mn concentrations on the other hand are neurotoxic and lead to manganismâa parkinsonian movement disorder caused by accumulation of Mn in the basal ganglia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. When the homeostatic mechanisms of the gut, which regulates gastrointestinal Mn absorption, and/or the liver, which modulates the biliary excretion of Mn, fail, get bypassed or are overwhelmed, rising Mn blood levels subsequently result in Mn deposition in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Mn overexposure can occur in welding and mining industries, in individuals using Mn contaminated Ephedrone preparations, and in patients receiving high Mn concentrations in total parenteral nutrition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Impaired hepatic Mn excretion in chronic liver disease may cause âacquired hepatocerebral degeneration'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Mn toxicity also plays a role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Several early-onset parkinsonism genes including <italic>PARK2</italic> (<italic>Parkin</italic>) and <italic>PARK9</italic> (<italic>ATP13A2</italic>) are associated with Mn dyshomeostasis. Affected patients share common neuropathological features of Mn neurotoxicity, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy and altered alpha-synuclein aggregation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Indeed, <italic>Parkin</italic> and <italic>ATP13A2</italic> are postulated to protect dopaminergic cells from Mn toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Furthermore, polymorphisms in <italic>ATP13A2</italic> are associated with increased susceptibility to Mn toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Alpha-synuclein is also suggested to act as an intracellular Mn store<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and Mn exposure promotes alpha-synuclein oligomerization and enhances cellular toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
    <p>Recently, mutations in <italic>SLC30A10</italic> have been found to cause an inherited disorder of Mn metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. <italic>SLC30A10</italic> encodes a divalent cation transporter expressed on the cell membrane in liver and brain where it mediates efflux of Mn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In affected individuals, Mn accumulates in the basal ganglia and the liver causing parkinsonismâdystonia, chronic liver disease, hypermanganesemia, polycythaemia and abnormal iron indices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Polymorphisms in <italic>SLC30A10</italic> are associated with increased blood Mn levels and impaired neurological function affecting sway velocity and finger-tapping speed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
    <p>Although the importance of Mn in multiple disease processes is increasingly recognized, transport and homeostatic regulation of Mn <italic>in vivo</italic> are poorly understood. Several transporters have been postulated to play a role in Mn homeostasis and regulation, however, it remains unknown which of these are crucial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have identified a cohort of children with hypermanganesemia and progressive parkinsonismâdystonia who carry homozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SLC39A14</italic>. We show that disodium calcium edetate (Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA) effectively chelates Mn and increases urinary Mn excretion in affected individuals. Commenced early in the disease course, chelation therapy can lead to significant improvement of clinical symptoms and, potentially, prevention of disease progression. Our results also demonstrate that SLC39A14 functions as a primary Mn transporter and that mutations in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> impair Mn uptake, without affecting zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and cadmium (Cd) blood levels. This is further corroborated in zebrafish carrying CRISPR-induced mutations in the <italic>slc39a14</italic> orthologue which also show Mn dyshomeostasis while other metals remain unaffected. Our findings bring new insights into Mn transport and provide a novel zebrafish disease model in which to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Mn-related disease.</p>

        <title><italic>SLC39A14</italic> mutations cause Mn-associated neurodegeneration</title>
        <p>SLC39A14 is a divalent metal transporter, also known as Zrt, Irt-like protein 14 (ZIP14), that belongs to the LIV-1 subfamily whose members contain eight transmembrane domains (TMDs), a histidine-rich motif (HXHXHX), and a metalloprotease motif (H/EEXPHEXGD) required for metal transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). While most SLC39 transporters are specific for Zn there is evidence that SLC39A14 also transports Mn, Fe and Cd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), in conjunction with autozygosity mapping and Sanger sequencing, we identified homozygous changes in the coding region of <italic>SLC39A14</italic> in eight patients from five unrelated consanguineous families presenting with hypermanganesemia and progressive movement disorder (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The identified mutations include three missense changes (F98V, G383R, N469K) that affect highly conserved amino-acid residues, as well as a nonsense (E105X) and frame-shift mutations (S160Cfs*5) that are expected to generate significantly truncated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The G383R mutation is located within the EEXPHEX<underline>G</underline>D motif required for metal binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Although it affects the last nucleotide of exon 7 (c.1147G&gt;A), splicing is unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Human <italic>SLC39A14</italic> encodes three isoforms due to alternative splicing of exon 4 and 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The S160Cfs*5 mutation is caused by a 2-bp deletion within exon 4A, solely affecting isoform 2. The clinical phenotype of this individual was not significantly different to that of the remaining patient cohort. Mendelian segregation of the mutations within the family was verified for cases where parent DNA was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). None of the identified sequence changes have been reported previously including the dbSNP, 1,000 Genomes Project and ExAC databases (see URLs). Recessive variants in 15 genes causing early-onset PD or Mn dyshomeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were excluded by analysing the WES data for subject B-II-4, D-II-1 and E-II-4.</p>
        <p>Patients with <italic>SLC39A14</italic> mutations showed common clinical features and disease course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1, 3â5</xref>). Affected children presented with loss of developmental milestones, progressive dystonia and bulbar dysfunction in infancy or early childhood. Towards the end of the first decade, they developed severe generalized pharmacoresistant dystonia, spasticity, limb contractures and scoliosis, and lost independent ambulation. Some showed parkinsonian features of hypomimia, tremor and bradykinesia. There appeared to be a degree of cognitive sparing relative to the motor disability. Three children died between 13 months and 7 years, two due to respiratory infections and for the third the cause of death is unknown.</p>
        <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain features were characteristic of Mn deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Within the deep grey matter, T1-weighted hyperintensity was present in the globus pallidus and, to a lesser extent, the striatum, with thalamic sparing. Generalized T1-hyperintensity indicated extensive white matter involvement including the cerebellum, spinal cord and dorsal pons, with sparing of the ventral pons. Sagittal T1-weighted sequences demonstrated hyperintense signal of the anterior pituitary gland. Axial T2-weighted imaging (T2, T2* and FLAIR sequences) showed hypointensity of the globus pallidus which was progressive in one patient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Some patients had evidence of cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Computed tomography imaging undertaken in one patient was normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>).</p>
        <p>In all tested patients, whole-blood Mn levels were markedly elevated relative to the reference range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Blood levels of Fe, Zn and Cd, divalent metals that can be transported by SLC39A14 in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, were assessed in two patients using inductively coupled plasmaâmass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and found to be normal when compared with control subjects and literature reference ranges (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Mn levels were normal in heterozygous parents.</p>
        <p>In contrast to SLC30A10 deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, children with <italic>SLC39A14</italic> mutations did not develop polycythaemia or liver disease. Liver MRI of individual E-II-4 showed no obvious increase in T1-weighted signal intensity, suggesting that Mn does not accumulate in the liver in this disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Iron indices including total iron-binding capacity and ferritin were normal. Unlike patients with Mn deficiency due to mutations in <italic>slc39a8</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), glycosylation of transferrin, assessed in patient E-II-2, was unaffected despite the Mn overload.</p>
        <p>Post-mortem examination performed on individual D-II-1 who died of septic shock following a bronchopneumonia at 4 years of age revealed marked neuronal loss in the globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) while neurons in the caudate, putamen, thalamus and cerebral cortex were relatively well-preserved. Similar severe neuronal loss and gliosis were observed in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum with relative preservation of the cerebellar cortex. Patchy loss of myelin staining was evident in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter associated with coarse vacuoles (some over 50âÎ¼m) and patchy axonal loss on neurofilament staining. A few rounded eosinophilic spheroid structures were noted in the dentate nucleus, but neuropathological features of iron deposition (negative Perls' stain), axonal spheroids, tau and alpha-synuclein pathology were not observed.</p>

        <title>Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA lowers blood Mn and alleviates clinical symptoms</title>
        <p>In an attempt to reduce the systemic Mn load, individuals C-II-2 and E-II-2 were commenced on chelation therapy with i.v. Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA according to a protocol published for SLC30A10 deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Individual C-II-2, who was started early on in the disease course at 5 years of age, tolerated chelation therapy well without notable side effects and showed dramatic clinical improvement. After 6 months of monthly Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA courses (500âmg twice daily for 5 consecutive days) upper limb tremors and athetoid movements had ceased and lower limb dystonia improved to the extent that she regained the ability to walk independently with foot orthoses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1 and 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>For subject E-II-2, who was commenced on chelation at 17 years of age, Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA administration (20âmgâkg<sup>â1</sup> per day) led to marked increase in urinary Mn excretion accompanied by reduction of blood Mn levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Despite mobilization of Mn stores she has continued to deteriorate with worsening tremor and stiffness. Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA therefore appears to effectively chelate Mn in this disorder; however, clinical response can be variable, possibly due to patient age and disease severity at treatment onset.</p>

        <title>Tissue expression and Mn transport differ between isoforms</title>
        <p>Immunostaining of sections of human control liver showed that SLC39A14 localized to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in a punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the brain, SLC39A14 was detected in large neurons, especially in the globus pallidus, insular cortex and dentate nucleus, occasionally in the putamen and rarely in the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Comparable subcellular localization was seen when C-terminally eGFP-tagged human SLC39A14 was expressed in zebrafish embryos. Both isoforms 1 and 2 localize to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that individual C-II-2 carries mutations that only affect isoform 2, tissue expression and function of both SLC39A14 isoform 1 and 2 were examined. The isoforms differ by 20 amino acids encoded by exon 4A and 4B, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4 and 7</xref>). Reverse transcriptionâPCR (RTâPCR) showed that transcript 1 was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined while transcript 2 was not detected in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Transient expression of wild-type SLC39A14 isoform 1 and 2 in HEK-293 cells confirmed that both facilitate Mn uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). However, isoform 2 showed a greater ability to transport Mn than isoform 1. These results indicate that both isoforms localize to the cell membrane where they facilitate Mn uptake, albeit potentially with different efficacy.</p>

        <title>Mn affects transcriptional regulation of zebrafish <italic>slc39a14</italic></title>
        <p>In other contexts, expression of metal transporters is controlled by the concentration of their substrate thereby ensuring tight regulation of metal levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We assessed the effect of Mn on expression of zebrafish <italic>slc39a14</italic> by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Acute MnCl<sub>2</sub> exposure (500âÎ¼M for 24âh) of zebrafish larvae at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) led to a significant increase in <italic>slc39a14</italic> expression. This increase in expression was caused by upregulation of transcript 2 mRNA levels while levels of transcript 1 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Transcriptional regulation of <italic>slc39a14</italic> by its substrate is therefore likely to contribute to Mn homeostasis. Subchronic MnCl<sub>2</sub> exposure (50âÎ¼M, 72âh) on the other hand did not significantly affect <italic>slc39a14</italic> transcript levels (data not shown).</p>

        <p>The impact of F98V, G383R and N469K variants on SLC39A14 protein localization and function was investigated in stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant SLC39A14. Immunoblotting studies showed that overall expression of mutant SLC39A14 in total cell lysates was similar to wild-type SLC39A14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of non-permeabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and permeabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) HEK-293 cells with anti-FLAG antibody confirmed similar subcellular localization patterns for both wild-type and mutant SLC39A14 at the cell surface and within the cytosol. Investigation of mutant SLC39A14 transporter activity following MnCl<sub>2</sub> exposure (1âÎ¼M; 15âmin) showed reduced Mn levels for cells expressing mutant protein, particularly mutants F98V and G383R, when compared with those expressing wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further elucidate the role of <italic>SLC39A14</italic> in Mn homeostasis, we generated a zebrafish model of Slc39a14 deficiency by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. RTâPCR confirmed expression of zebrafish <italic>slc39a14</italic> at all stages of embryonic and early larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization demonstrated <italic>slc39a14</italic> expression in the proximal pronephric ducts at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). 5â² and 3â² RACE showed that zebrafish, as for human <italic>SLC39A14</italic>, have an alternative fourth and ninth exon and, in addition, an alternative eighth exon encoding a fourth splice isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Sequence alignment of human and zebrafish Slc39a14 demonstrated that both proteins share high sequence homology. About 62% of amino-acid residues are identical with a higher degree of conservation observed around the TMDs and the metalloprotease motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), suggesting that the human and fish Slc39a14 transporters are likely to have comparable functions.</p>
        <p>A zebrafish mutant line that carries a <italic>slc39a14</italic> null mutation (<italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup>) in exon 5, which is shared by all transcripts, was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). The mutant harbours a frame-shift mutation P210Hfs*48 (c.629_630del) predicted to truncate the protein by 246 amino acids with loss of the metal-binding domain and TMD III to VIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Because an antibody to zebrafish Slc39a14 is not available, we assessed s<italic>lc39a14</italic> mRNA expression in homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutants and found it markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), suggesting nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcripts.</p>
        <p>Homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutants showed a 35% increase in Mn levels at 5 dpf and 72% increase at 14 dpf, confirming a crucial role for Slc39a14 in Mn clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Other previously reported substrates of the transporter, including Fe, Zn and Cd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Larval length did not differ between mutant and wild-type larvae, excluding differences in size accounting for the observed difference in Mn levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Despite abnormal Mn levels, <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutants survived into adulthood without any obvious morphological or developmental defects.</p>
        <p>Exposure of homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutants to a sublethal MnCl<sub>2</sub> concentration (50 âÎ¼M) from 2 to 5 dpf led to a much greater accumulation of Mn relative to wild-types at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> larvae also showed increased sensitivity to Mn-induced toxicity; the median lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of MnCl<sub>2</sub> was significantly lower for mutant compared with wild-type larvae, and analysis of the relative median potency of MnCl<sub>2</sub> (1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.2â2.9) suggested MnCl<sub>2</sub> to be 1.75 times more lethal for mutant than for wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). A locomotor assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> confirmed that exposure of homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> but not wild-type larvae to MnCl<sub>2</sub> leads to a prominent reduction in their average locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). These analyses of the <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup>mutant demonstrate that loss of Slc39a14 function causes Mn dyshomeostasis similar to observations in humans.</p>

        <title>Cerebral Mn deposition induces transcriptional changes</title>
        <p>To determine the major site of Mn accumulation in <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutants, Mn levels were determined in brain and abdominal viscera (intestine, liver, pancreas and spleen) of adult zebrafish at 1 year of age. Mn levels were eight times higher in brains from homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> fish compared with wild-type, whereas no significant differences in the Mn content of abdominal viscera were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Fe, Zn and Cd levels were unchanged in mutant brain tissue while there was a small increase in Fe in abdominal viscera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). Thus, the brain represents the main organ of Mn deposition in <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> zebrafish. To assess whether loss of Slc39a14 function and cerebral Mn deposition leads to differential expression of other Mn uptake transporter genes, transcript levels of transferrin receptor 1 (<italic>tfr1a</italic>, <italic>tfr1b</italic>), divalent metal transporter 1 (<italic>DMT1</italic>) and <italic>slc39a8</italic> were compared between mutant and wild-type adult brains and whole larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). While most of these genes showed no statistically significant changes, transcript levels of <italic>tfr1b</italic> were significantly lower in <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutant brains. On the other hand, MnCl<sub>2</sub> overexposure of wild-type and mutant larvae led to upregulation of <italic>tfr1b</italic> but downregulation of <italic>slc39a8</italic> expression. These results suggest that <italic>tfr1b</italic> and <italic>slc39a8</italic> are indeed involved in the regulation of Mn homeostasis, probably with different roles within different tissues.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have identified a novel autosomal recessive disorder of Mn homeostasis caused by homozygous mutations in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> that lead to early-onset rapidly-progressive parkinsonismâdystonia and neurodegeneration. Identified mutations are predicted to affect transporter function either through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, protein truncation or impairment of transporter activity. Moreover, we have generated and characterized a zebrafish <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> mutant line that recapitulates aspects of the human disease, providing novel insights into Slc39a14 function and facilitating further elucidation of disease mechanisms and drug screening.</p>
      <p>SLC39A14 belongs to the SLC39 group of divalent metal transporters. Prior to this study, there was considerable uncertainty with respect to the <italic>in vivo</italic> specificity of this transporter. Unlike most SLC39 proteins that are specific for Zn <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggested that SLC39A14 could transport Mn, Fe and Cd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Our data indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic>, the major role for SLC39A14 is to transport Mn. Homozygous <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> zebrafish accumulate high levels of Mn and show increased sensitivity to Mn toxicity while levels of Fe, Zn and Cd remain unaffected. This is consistent with our finding that blood metal levels of Fe, Zn and Cd are unaffected in patients with <italic>SLC39A14</italic> mutations. Consequently, SLC39A14 joins SLC30A10 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and SLC39A8 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) as clinically important, conserved and critical regulators of Mn homeostasis in vertebrates.</p>
      <p>Cerebral Mn deposition in patients with <italic>SLC39A14</italic> mutations is associated with characteristic MRI brain appearances similar to those observed in SLC30A10 deficiency. Both disorders present with a progressive extrapyramidal phenotype and neurodegenerative features, including neuronal loss and spongiosis in the globus pallidus, as well as myelin and axonal loss throughout the white matter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. However, differences do exist between the two disorders. Individuals with SLC39A14 deficiency do not develop polycythaemia or abnormal iron indices, and liver function is preserved even in cases with advanced neurological disease.</p>
      <p>It is plausible that the primary function of SLC39A14 in humans is hepatic Mn uptake for subsequent biliary excretion through SLC30A10. Certainly, MR liver imaging is consistent with lack of hepatic Mn deposition in patients with SLC39A14 deficiency. The high level of SLC39A14 expression in liver tissues (observed in this study and previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) further substantiates this hypothesis. Mn exposure in mice also causes a marked increase in hepatic <italic>SLC39A14</italic> mRNA expression, further highlighting the role of SLC39A14 in hepatic Mn uptake under a high Mn load<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. This hypothesis is reinforced by the observation that subject C-II-2 carries mutations that solely affect isoform 2. The absence of brain expression of isoform 2 suggests that the primary defect of Mn clearance does not occur in the brain and that cerebral Mn deposition arises secondarily due to the increased systemic Mn load. As the main regulatory organ involved in Mn homeostasis in humans, the liver seems most likely to play the crucial role in the disease mechanism. <italic>Slc39a14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice furthermore show transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Slc30a10</italic> expression, suggesting that Slc30a10 and Slc39a14 transporters indeed act in partnership for efficient hepatic Mn detoxification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. We postulate that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SLC39A14</italic> in humans lead to impaired hepatic Mn uptake with resultant hypermanganesemia and downstream neurotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Whether SLC39A14 is essential for Mn uptake in other tissues remains to be clarified. The ubiquitous expression pattern that we have confirmed for isoform 1 suggests a role for SLC39A14 in a wide range of tissues. Although SLC39A14 is expressed in the intestine, the major site of Mn uptake, intestinal Mn uptake appears to be preserved in this disease as clinically we do not see deficiency of Mn. Similarly, Mn is deposited in the brain, suggesting that transporters other than SLC39A14 facilitate cerebral Mn uptake. Several alternative Mn uptake transporters may compensate for loss of SLC39A14 function. These include DMT1, TfR1, SLC39A8, Mn citrate shuttle, glutamate receptors and various calcium channels/ATPases that have been implicated in Mn transport at the cell membrane either in the brain or the intestine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Quantitative gene expression analysis suggests that <italic>tfr1b</italic>, one of two <italic>tfr1</italic> paralogues in zebrafish and the main cerebral <italic>tfr1</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, may be involved in facilitating brain Mn uptake in this disorder. Excess Mn in the brain is likely to lead to downregulation of transporter gene expression. On the other hand, increased transcript levels of <italic>tfr1b</italic> on Mn exposure in whole larvae suggests that the role of this gene may vary between tissues.</p>
      <p>Our analyses of the subcellular localization of human SLC39A14 in zebrafish embryos and HEK-293 cells demonstrate that SLC39A14 is not only present on the cell membrane but also intracellularly. This is consistent with previous studies in HepG2 cells where SLC39A14 was detected at the plasma membrane and in endosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Hence, SLC39A14 might be required for intracellular trafficking of Mn and its transport into specific organelles. This concurs with a recent study showing that SLC39A14 facilitates endosomal trafficking of zinc in enterocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Subcellular deficiency of Mn may therefore also contribute to the neuropathology in SLC39A14 deficiency.</p>
      <p>Similar to humans, the brain is the main organ of Mn deposition in zebrafish <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup>mutants. Moreover, <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> larvae demonstrate impaired locomotor behaviour on Mn exposure. Recently, environmental Mn exposure has been linked to impaired dopamine neuromodulation in zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. The mechanisms that lead to reduced locomotor activity in <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> larvae require further studies to elucidate whether, similarly, the observed changes are due to specific Mn neurotoxicity. Unlike humans, however, <italic>slc39a14</italic> is not expressed in the liver during early larval zebrafish development. The prominent expression of <italic>slc39a14</italic> in the pronephric ducts indicates that the kidney is likely to regulate Mn homeostasis in zebrafish larvae.</p>
      <p>I.v. Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA significantly increases urinary Mn excretion and lowers blood Mn levels in affected individuals. Similarly, in <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> zebrafish cardiac injection of Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA led to lower Mn levels compared with those of untreated mutants. Nevertheless, clinical response varied between the two individuals given chelation therapy. Subject C-II-2 who was commenced on Na<sub>2</sub>CaEDTA early in the disease course showed a remarkable response with restoration of ambulation, whereas subject E-II-2, severely affected by late stage disease, has continued to clinically deteriorate, even though blood and urine Mn levels suggested mobilization of Mn stores. We know from SLC30A10 deficiency that despite extensive neuronal damage Mn toxicity phenotypes are to a great extent reversible<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Although chelation therapy can be efficacious, it could potentially lead to a worsening of neurological symptoms due to mobilization of Mn with a shift into the brain similar to observations in Wilson's disease. Indeed, 10â50% of patients with neurologic Wilson's disease deteriorate during the initial phase of treatment with D-Penicillamine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Furthermore, the type of mutation may have an impact on treatment response. While individual C-II-2 has a homozygous mutation that only affects SLC39A14 isoform 2 all isoforms are affected in subject E-II-2.</p>
      <p>We have shown that the tissue localization of isoform 1 and 2 of <italic>SLC39A14</italic> differs and that there may be differences in functional activity. Whilst isoform 1 is ubiquitously expressed with high levels of expression evident in the brain, isoform 2 shows a restricted expression pattern including liver, kidney and intestine â organs involved in the regulation of metal ion homeostasis. As reported previously for murine Slc39a14<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, our Mn uptake studies in HEK-293 cells confirm that human isoform 2 has a greater ability to transport Mn than isoform 1. Furthermore, Mn-dependent transcriptional regulation of <italic>SLC39A14</italic> expression appears to only affect isoform 2. In zebrafish mRNA expression of transcript 2 is upregulated on Mn loading whereas that of transcript 1 remains unchanged. Similarly, transcription of <italic>SLC30A10</italic> is regulated by Mn and the induction of <italic>SLC30A10</italic> expression on Mn exposure is likely to reduce the body Mn load through promotion of hepatic excretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. These findings suggest that there may be specific roles for the individual SLC39A14 isoforms that might also contribute to differences in treatment response.</p>
      <p>Whilst Mn levels have not been assessed in <italic>Slc39a14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice, alterations in Zn and Fe absorption and trafficking have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. <italic>Slc39A14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice demonstrate enhanced hepatic iron uptake via transcriptional upregulation of DMT1 and TfR-1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). This is consistent with our finding of increased Fe content in abdominal viscera of <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> zebrafish. It is possible that increased DMT1 and TfR-1 expression occurs in response to the high Mn load and indeed <italic>tfr1b</italic> expression increases on Mn exposure in both wild-type and mutant zebrafish larvae. Both of these transporters transport Mn and Fe interdependently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. A recent study of <italic>Slc39a14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice suggests that Slc39a14 is also instrumental in the uptake of Cd into the liver with hepatic Cd levels being diminished while other organs including kidney, gut and lung showing Cd accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results show that SLC39A14, alongside SLC30A10, is a pivotal Mn transporter required for Mn clearance and maintenance of Mn homeostasis in vertebrates. Our findings expand our understanding of Mn transport and its regulatory mechanisms, and highlight its importance in neurodegenerative disease processes. SLC39A14 is part of a group of Mn transporters that regulates the intricate network of Mn homeostasis. Further studies of the function of this transporter might shed new light on our understanding of how Mn toxicity may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD, with Mn dyshomeostasis not only being observed in inherited disorders of Mn transport and environmental manganism, but also playing an important role in heritable forms of PD that show greater susceptibility to Mn toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, treatment of Mn neurotoxicity remains unsatisfactory. The <italic>slc39a14</italic><sup><italic>U801</italic></sup> zebrafish mutant has the potential to illuminate the mechanisms of Mn toxicity and provide new avenues for drug discovery for both rare and common neurodegenerative disorders associated with Mn toxicity.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Under normal conditions nutritional Mn (red) is absorbed in the duodenum and enters the enterohepatic circulation via the portal vein from which it is transported into the liver via SLC39A14, a Mn uptake transporter (orange). Any excess Mn is rapidly removed from the systemic circulation by uptake into the liver via SLC39A14 and excreted into the bile via SLC30A10 (brown), a Mn efflux protein. (<bold>b</bold>) Dysfunction of SLC39A14 (indicated by a black X) impairs hepatic uptake of Mn for subsequent biliary excretion. Consequently, Mn accumulates in the blood and brain leading to hypermanganesemia and neurotoxicity, respectively. IVC, inferior vena cava.</p>
