      <abstract>
        <p>Crosstalk between inflammatory signalling pathways and receptor tyrosine kinases has been revealed as an indicator of cancer malignant progression. In the present study, we focus on EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase, which is overexpressed in many human cancers. It has been reported that ligand-independent phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 is induced by Akt. We show that inflammatory cytokines promote RSK-, not Akt-, dependent phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897. In addition, the RSKâEphA2 signalling pathway controls cell migration and invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells. Moreover, Ser-897-phosphorylated EphA2 co-localizes with phosphorylated active form of RSK in various human tumour specimens, and this double positivity is related to poor survival in lung cancer patients, especially those with a smoking history. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 is controlled by RSK and the RSKâEphA2 axis might contribute to cell motility and promote tumour malignant progression.</p>

    <p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play central roles in human tumorigenesis and malignant progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. EphA2, which belongs to the largest Eph subfamily among RTKs, regulates tissue development and maintains epithelial tissue homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Overexpression of EphA2 is one of the prognostic factors in progressive tumours, including lung, breast, brain, ovarian, melanoma, prostate and urinary bladder cancers. EphA2 expression correlates with cancer metastasis, promotion of epithelialâmesenchymal transition (EMT) and maintenance of cancer stem cell properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. An EphA2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been shown to induce tumour regression in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenografts <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that EphA2 is a promising molecular target in cancer therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, comprehensive mechanisms for receptor function remain poorly understood.</p>
    <p>RTKs are normally activated through their own tyrosine kinase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In addition to this classical activation model, it has become evident that the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues plays key roles in ligand-controlled and ligand-independent functions of RTKs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We have reported that tumour necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) induces the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Thr-669 in the juxtamembrane domain and Ser-1046/7 in the carboxy (C)-terminal tail through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 pathways, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Ser-1046/7 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of EGFR and Thr-669 phosphorylation causes negative feedback regulation of its tyrosine kinase. Similarly, three serine residues in the C-tail of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 are phosphorylated by ERK, protein kinase CÉ (PKCÉ) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2), which are critical for negative feedback regulation and endocytosis of the receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Hence, study on serine/threonine phosphorylation is essential to understand fully the roles of RTKs in pathogenic alterations of cancers, but we are still far from clarifying the whole picture.</p>
    <p>Recently, increasing evidence has shown that upregulation of EphA2 along with downregulation of its ligands, including ephrin-A1, disrupts orderly epithelial adhesion of cancer cells, suggesting ligand-independent functions of EphA2 in tumour microenvironments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Indeed, Miao <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> demonstrated an alternative function of EphA2, in which ligand-independent Akt phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 promotes growth factor-induced cell polarization, lamellipodium protrusion and cell migration, and is correlated with the tumour grade of human astrocytoma. In contrast, ligand-dependent EphA2 tyrosine kinase activation inhibited cell migration and invasion. A large number of serine and threonine residues capable of being phosphorylated have been identified by mass spectral analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>; therefore, further characterization of EphA2 phosphorylation is essential for understanding the ligand-independent functions of EphA2 in cancer cells.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we try to determine whether an inflammatory cytokine promotes EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser-897. We show that TNF-Î± induces Ser-897 phosphorylation, but, unexpectedly, it is directly regulated by the ERKâRSK signalling pathway, but not by the PI3KâAkt pathway. Therefore, we further characterize activation of the RSKâEphA2 pathway by other factors activating ERK and their roles in regulating the cell motility of human cancer cells. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between this pathway and clinical outcomes using human lung cancer tissue specimens.</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 is induced by TNF-Î±</title>
        <p>In our previous studies, we detected TNF-Î±-induced Ser/Thr phosphorylation of EGFR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To determine whether TNF-Î± also induces the phosphorylation of EphA2, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-Phos-tag SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> that is an approach for the detection and separation of phosphorylated proteins, was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). First, we analysed the phosphorylation of EphA2 and EGFR in HeLa cells using Phos-tag SDSâPAGE. Several shifted bands of EGFR were clearly detected upon TNF-Î± stimulation, indicating different phosphorylation states. Similarly, but slightly delayed, two major shifted bands of EphA2 were observed. These results indicate that, in parallel with EGFR phosphorylation, EphA2 is targeted by an inflammatory signalling pathway. We next used phospho-Ser-897 EphA2 (pS-EphA2) antibody and phospho-Tyr-588 EphA2 (pY-EphA2) antibody in Phos-tag SDSâPAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Upon stimulation with TNF-Î±, pS-EphA2 antibody recognized two major bands that showed similar gel retardation in the total EphA2 blot, whereas no band with a similar shift appeared in the pY-EphA2 blot.</p>
        <p>In normal SDSâPAGE, TNF-Î± and ephrin-A1 selectively induced pS-EphA2 and pY-EphA2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Selectivity of pS-EphA2 antibody to the phosphorylation of Ser-897 was confirmed in HEK293 cells expressing Ser-897 to Ala substitution mutant EphA2 (SA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Moreover, pY-EphA2 was not induced until 60âmin after TNF-Î± stimulation, although pS-EphA2 was promoted from 10âmin and largely reduced at 60âmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This time course was similar to that of the phosphorylation of EGFR at Thr-669 and Ser-1046/7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In addition, TNF-Î± and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) induced pS-EphA2 in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We previously demonstrated that TNF-Î± promotes EGFR endocytosis in a p38-dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that EphA2 was not internalized and pS-EphA2 was localized on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Altogether, our results clearly demonstrated that TNF-Î± induces the phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 in a tyrosine kinase activity-independent manner.</p>

        <title>Akt does not control Ser-897 phosphorylation of EphA2</title>
        <p>Miao <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> previously reported that Akt directly induces EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser-897 in glioma cells. Consequently, we investigated whether Akt is also involved in pS-EphA2 in HeLa cells. Cells were pre-incubated with PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or an allosteric Akt inhibitor (MK-2206) for 30âmin and then stimulated with TNF-Î± for 20âmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Unexpectedly, pS-EphA2 was not inhibited by these inhibitors, while Akt phosphorylation was significantly inhibited. We also confirmed these results using immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). As used by Miao <italic>et al.</italic>, we next attempted to evaluate pS-EphA2 in T98G human glioblastoma cells stimulated with TNF-Î± or FCS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, MK-2206 and LY294002 abolished pS-EphA2 in neither TNF-Î± stimulation nor FCS stimulation. Moreover, constitutively present pS-EphA2 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells harbouring <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations and Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells carrying <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation was also resistant to PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 is not catalysed by Akt.</p>

        <title>TAK1 controls TNF-Î±-induced phosphorylation of EphA2</title>
        <p>The results for the PI3KâAkt pathway as shown above are reasonable because we detected only slight activation of Akt in TNF-Î±-treated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). By contrast, transforming growth factor-Î²-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key kinase in the TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² signalling pathway leading to MAPK and NF-ÎºB activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. RNAi knockdown experiments using shRNA or siRNA against TAK1 demonstrated that TAK1 is essential for TNF-Î±-induced pS-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). In addition, overexpression of EphA2 with activated TAK1 in HeLa cells caused an increase in EphA2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). These results indicate that EphA2 is phosphorylated by downstream kinases of TAK1.</p>

        <title>RSK inhibitor blocks phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897</title>
        <p>To identify the kinases responsible for pS-EphA2, we obtained the substrate sequence LOGO of Ser/Thr kinases from the PhosphoSitePlus database ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction.do">http://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction.do</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Among Ser/Thr kinases, the LOGOs of RSK1 and RSK2, downstream kinases of ERK, are similar to that of Akt. Akt and RSKs are members of the AGC family kinases that share substrate specificity characterized by Arg at position -3 relative to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>; therefore, we next qualified RSK as a putative candidate for the kinase responsible for Ser-897 phosphorylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, TNF-Î±-induced pS-EphA2 was induced from 8âmin, peaked at 14âmin and was then gradually downregulated, which closely correlated with the time course of pRSK. Pretreatment with MEK inhibitor (U0126) or RSK inhibitor (BI-D1870) abrogated the appearance of shifted bands in Phos-tag SDSâPAGE and pS-EphA2 in normal SDSâPAGE as well as pS-EphA2 staining in immunofluorescence, suggesting that the ERKâRSK pathway controls pS-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). We previously demonstrated that Thr-669 phosphorylation of EGFR is also induced by the ERK pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>; however, it was inhibited by U0126 but not by BI-D1870 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), indicating that different kinases in the ERK pathway control pS-EphA2 and pT-EGFR. Moreover, we tried to examine the effects of various other stimuli that activate RSK, including high osmotic stress (0.3âM NaCl), 12-<italic>o</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and EGF. As expected, pS-EphA2 was strongly induced by all of these agents and it was inhibited by BI-D1870, but not by LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). U0126 and BI-D1870 also blocked EphA2 phosphorylation in TNF-Î±-stimulated A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), in FCS- or TNF-Î±-stimulated T98G and U-87 MG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>) and in MDA-MB-231 and Panc-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>).

However, phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112, an RSK substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, was inhibited, indicating that BI-D1870 substantially inhibited RSK kinase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 is induced by RSK or its downstream kinases.</p>

        <title>EphA2 at Ser-897 is directly phosphorylated by RSK</title>
        <p>To identify RSK as the kinase responsible for pS-EphA2, HEK293 cells were transfected with EphA2 and RSK1. Coexpression of EphA2 with RSK1 induced Ser-897 phosphorylation of wild-type EphA2 but not its SA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Activation of TAK1 caused RSK phosphorylation as well as pS-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition, constitutively active RSK1 but not kinase-dead RSK1 induced pS-EphA2, indicating that the kinase activity of RSK1 is indispensable for pS-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, single knockdown of neither RSK1 nor RSK2 reduced pS-EphA2, but RSK1/2 double knockdown attenuated pS-EphA2 completely. Moreover, pS-EphA2 was partially recovered by RSK1 re-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that pS-EphA2 is regulated redundantly by RSK1 and RSK2. Consequently, to obtain direct evidence for the catalysis of EphA2 phosphorylation, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay using recombinant kinases and found that both GST-RSK1 and GST-RSK2 phosphorylated Ser-897 of GST-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).

        <title>RSKâEphA2 axis is involved in cell motility</title>
        <p>It has been reported that Ser-897 phosphorylation of EphA2 promotes cell migration and invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. RSK1 and RSK2 are also known as key kinases for metastatic properties in various types of cancer cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>; therefore, we tried to determine whether the novel RSKâEphA2 axis induces cell motility. MDA-MB-231 cells, in which the RSKâEphA2 axis is constitutively activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), were adopted for a scratch assay. Treatment of RSK inhibitor BI-D1870 continuously inhibited pS-EphA2 for 48âh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). We confirmed that there were no significant differences in cell proliferation and cell death between BI-D1870-treated cells and control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a and b</xref>). Although cells migrated to the scratched area in the control sample, significant attenuation of cell migration was observed in BI-D1870-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Similar results were obtained using siRNAs against RSK1 and RSK2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c and d</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining on the migration border demonstrated that pS-EphA2 and EphA2 were preferentially localized in the migrating front with F-actin in lamellipodia in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). On the other hand, BI-D1870 not only inhibited staining of pS-EphA2 but also collapsed the elongated and polarized morphology. In addition, the formation of lamellipodia was notably interfered with and EphA2 diffused all over the cells by the inhibition of RSK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Moreover, BI-D1870 and RSK1/2 knockdown reduced invasive ability in Matrigel-coated chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e and f</xref>). These results suggested that RSK1/2 control cell motility by maintaining pS-EphA2 localization at the edge in the direction of movement, such as in lamellipodia.</p>
        <p>To provide direct evidence for the role of the RSKâEphA2 axis in cell motility, the expression of EphA2 in EphA2-knockdown cells was restored by the transfection of siRNA-resistant complementary DNA encoding EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>). Cell migration reduced by EphA2 knockdown was recovered by re-expression of kinase-dead EphA2, but not that of its S897A mutant. In addition, TNF-Î±-induced migration of A549 cells was inhibited by BI-D1870 or EphA2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a and b</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that RSK-mediated Ser-897 phosphorylation of EphA2 is indispensable for cell motility in a tyrosine kinase activity-independent fashion.</p>

BI-D1870, U0126 and each targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, including gefitinib and crizotinib, abrogated pS-EphA2, indicating that the RSKâEphA2 axis was constitutively activated by driver oncogene products in all these lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Overall, these results highlight that the RSKâEphA2 axis is under the control of driver oncogenes, and suggest that molecular-targeted agents have the potential to block cancer migration and invasion via inhibition of the RSKâEphA2 pathway.</p>

        <p>We immunohistochemically investigated pRSK and pS-EphA2 using a multi-cancer tissue microarray, which included 1,010 cores from 13 organ cancer tissues. We found double-positive samples in various cancers except for one stomach sample exhibiting pS-EphA2 positivity and pRSK negativity, suggesting a strong signalling correlation between EphA2 and RSK in human cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8aâf</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7a</xref> showing typical specimens of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma indicates that pS-EphA2 and pRSK were potentially co-localized.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser-897 has been characterized as an important reaction regulating tumour progression of human glioma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Akt has been identified to be responsible for ligand-independent migration and invasion by inducing Ser-897 phosphorylation, in which phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody that recognizes [RXXpS/pT] has mainly been used to detect the phosphorylated protein. EphA2 amino acids 894â897 [RLPpS] completely match the consensus sequence; however, it is also a putative substrate of RSK, as shown in the PhosphoSitePlus database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Indeed, we report here that RSK1 and RSK2, but not Akt, catalyse Ser-897 phosphorylation directly in cytokine, growth factor and oncogenic signalling pathways in all of the human cancer cells that we tested, including glioma cells. In addition, the immunohistochemical co-localization of pS-EphA2 and activated RSK supports the existence of a novel RSKâEphA2 signalling pathway in tumour microenvironments. Nonetheless, it is still essential to consider carefully the contribution of Akt in EphA2 phosphorylation because Akt is reported to activate ERK in some conditions such as stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor.</p>
      <p>Two major pSer-897 bands were detected in immunoblot results using Phos-tag SDSâPAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref>). These results demonstrate that there is at least one additional phosphorylation site other than Ser-897 in EphA2. In the PhosphoSitePlus database, more than 10 serine and threonine residues are deposited as putative phosphorylation sites in the intracellular domain of human EphA2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In particular, the amino-acid sequence around Ser-897 (<underline>S</underline>IRLP<underline>S</underline><sup>897</sup><underline>TS</underline>G<underline>S</underline>) contains several serine and threonine residues. Therefore, we are now trying to identify new phosphorylation sites and their responsible kinases to understand fully the tyrosine kinase- and ligand-independent prometastatic function of EphA2. In addition, the amino acid corresponding to Ser-897 and surrounding amino acids are largely conserved in EphA1, another RTK of the Eph receptor family, which is also involved in invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis of cancer patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, although the level of EphA1 expression in human cancer cells used in this study is very low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), it is essential to characterize whether the serine residue of EphA1 is a substrate for RSK or Akt.</p>
      <p>RSK has been reported to induce cell proliferation through promoting cell cycle progression and cell survival through modulating activity of the BCL2 family in various malignancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The ERKâRSK pathway has also been extensively studied in terms of effects that promote cancer migration, invasion, metastasis and EMT both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. For example, Doehn <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> reported that treatment with several RSK inhibitors, including BI-D1870, reduced migration as well as blocked TGF-Î²/TNF-Î±-induced, ERK-dependent EMT through inhibition of the FRA1- and c-Jun-dependent transcriptional programme of prometastatic genes, including those encoding extracellular cell matrix (ECM) components and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In the present study, RSK1/2 were shown to have redundant roles in promoting both EphA2 phosphorylation and cell migration, supporting the metastasis-promoting ability of RSK1/2.</p>
      <p>In addition, RSK can regulate cell migration by suppressing integrin-mediated cell adhesion through phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein filamin A at Ser-2125 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Interestingly, EphA2 on the cell surface can also interact with integrins to regulate cell adhesion. Moreover, both RSK and EphA2 have been demonstrated to control RhoA and RhoG small GTPase activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. In particular, Kawai <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> reported that pS-EphA2 promotes the interaction of EphA2 with ephexin4 to induce the activation of RhoG. Consequently, our new finding on the functional connection between RSK and EphA2 encourages further study to characterize fully the cooperation of these two kinases with integrins and Rho GTPases in the motility of cancer cells, cellâcell adhesion and cellâECM interaction.</p>
      <p>Determination of the mechanism maintaining tumour stemness is one of the most important challenges in current oncology and might also involve collaboration of RSK and EphA2. Binda <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> showed that EphA2 drives self-renewal and tumorigenicity in cancer stem cells derived from human glioblastoma, in which a strong signal for pS-EphA2 was detected in stem-like tumour propagating cells, but not in differentiated astrocytoma and neuroblastoma, in an ephrin-A ligand-independent manner. In addition, infiltrative invasion of glioma stem cells expressing EphA2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is completely independent of ephrin-A1, A3 and A4 ligands, was disrupted by S897A mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Stratford <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> reported that targeting RSK2 with siRNA or small molecule inhibitors eliminates tumour-initiating cells in triple-negative breast cancers. Combining these reports with our results establishes the new idea that the RSKâEphA2 axis might have an important function in the maintenance of cancer stem properties; therefore, detailed study is needed to understand fully their roles in tumour progression.</p>
      <p>EphA2 expression has been considered to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Brannan <italic>et al.</italic>, for example, reported that EphA2 expression was positively correlated with activated EGFR, KRAS mutation, smoking history, poor prognosis, early recurrence and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that RSK-mediated EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser-897 is involved in poor patient survival, especially in smokers. It is well known that smoking is frequently associated with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In addition, KRAS activation of the ERK pathway induces EphA2 expression in cultured cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Considering these observations together with our results, KRAS-mediated activation of the ERKâRSK pathway regulates not only EphA2 protein expression but also the phosphorylation of EphA2, which consequently results in high level expression of pS-EphA2 leading to cancer metastasis. In addition to <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation, we demonstrated that <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation and <italic>ALK</italic> fusion, major causes of NSCLCs, are other potential mechanisms to activate RSK in human NSCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, the regulation of EphA2 overexpression is still largely unknown; therefore, further detailed study is needed to understand fully the molecular mechanisms behind the high expression of pS-EphA2 in cancer cells.</p>
      <p>The role of pS-EphA2 has also been demonstrated in glioblastoma multiforme, in which a high level of pS-EphA2 was only detected in grade IV human astrocytomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These results suggest that the RSKâEphA2 axis is a common pathophysiological signature for human cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated that BRAF-V600E evoked RSK-mediated EphA2 phosphorylation in melanoma cells. It has been demonstrated that both RSK and EphA2 play critical oncogenic and cancer progressive roles in melanoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Moreover, it has become evident that ligand-independent EphA2 signalling is a mediator of vemrafenib resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Recent clinical trials clarified that combined MEK (trametinib) and BRAF (dabrafenib) inhibition is effective molecular-targeted therapy for melanoma patients harbouring BRAF mutation, suggesting that the RSKâEphA2 pathway inhibition affects the therapeutic efficacy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, treatment of trametinib resulted in effective downregulation of the RSKâEphA2 pathway; therefore, it is one possible strategy for intervention of phosphorylation of EphA2 for the treatment of cancers in a clinical context.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have demonstrated the previously unknown connection of RSK to EphA2, and this pathway is involved in the malignant progression of cancer cells, such as migration and invasion. In addition to EphA2, many other RTKs are overexpressed in tumour tissues and involved in oncogenesis and acquired resistance to molecular-targeted agents. Therefore, study on ligand-controlled and ligand-independent serine and threonine phosphorylation is the next challenge to elucidate new unknown functions of RTKs, to illustrate cancer pathology and to identify new molecular targets for pharmacological interventions.</p>

        <p>Whole-cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (25âmM HEPES (pH 7.7), 0.3âM NaCl, 1.5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2âmM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20âmM Î²-glycerophosphate, 1âmM sodium orthovanadate, 1âmM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1âmM dithiothreitol, 10âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup> aprotinin and 10âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup> leupeptin). The lysates were mixed with the same volume of SDSâPAGE sample buffer (100âmM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.0% SDS, 70âmM DTT, 10% glycerol and 0.10% bromophenol blue) and heated at 95âÂ°C for 5âmin. Samples were resolved using 6.5, 7.5 or 10% SDSâPAGE gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was treated with BlockAce (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and probed with primary antibodies (diluted 1:1,000, except for phospho-ERK, RSK1, Î²-actin and Î±-tubulin, which were diluted 1:4,000). The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (P0448; diluted 1:2,000), anti-mouse (P0260; diluted 1:2,000) and anti-goat IgG (P0449; diluted 1:2,000; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized with the ECL system (GE Healthcare Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Some antibody reactions were carried out in Can Get Signal solution (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan) or PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Uncropped scans of the blots were supplied in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>.

        <title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
        <p>A multi-cancer tissue microarray and a lung cancer tissue microarray, which consist of 1,010 cores from 13 organ cancer tissues (lung, breast, thyroid, liver, colon, stomach, prostate, ovary, uterine corpus, kidney, pancreas, biliary tract and urothelial cancers) and 353 cores, respectively, were obtained from Toyama University Hospital (Toyama, Japan). Detailed clinical and pathologic information, including patient demographics, smoking history and overall survival, was available for most patients in the lung cancer tissue microarray. The tumour specimens with <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations were obtained from NSCLC patients, all of whom provided written informed consent, at Kanazawa University Hospital (Kanazawa, Japan). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each institute.</p>
        <p>Immunohistochemistry was performed at Pathology Institute Corporation (Toyama, Japan). The sections were deparaffinized and subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval using a water bath or a pressure chamber, blocking of the endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10âmin and equilibration. Then, the sections were incubated with anti-phospho-Ser-897-EphA2 antibody (1:100) and anti-phospho-RSK1 antibody (1:50) at room temperature overnight. After extensive washing, the sections were incubated with EnVision+Dual Link System-HRP (DAKO) for 30âmin, visualized with DAB and counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared and mounted with resinous mounting medium. Cytoplasmic and/or cell membrane staining for phospho-Ser-897-EphA2 and nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining for phospho-RSK1 were considered to indicate positivity. Image capture and evaluation was performed in a masked manner.</p>
