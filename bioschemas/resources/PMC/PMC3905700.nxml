      <abstract>
        <p>Exosomes are released by most cells to the extracellular environment and are involved in cell-to-cell communication. Exosomes contain specific repertoires of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs that can be functionally transferred to recipient cells. However, the mechanisms that control the specific loading of RNA species into exosomes remain unknown. Here we describe sequence motifs present in miRNAs that control their localization into exosomes. The protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) specifically binds exosomal miRNAs through the recognition of these motifs and controls their loading into exosomes. Moreover, hnRNPA2B1 in exosomes is sumoylated, and sumoylation controls the binding of hnRNPA2B1 to miRNAs. The loading of miRNAs into exosomes can be modulated by mutagenesis of the identified motifs or changes in hnRNPA2B1 expression levels. These findings identify hnRNPA2B1 as a key player in miRNA sorting into exosomes and provide potential tools for the packaging of selected regulatory RNAs into exosomes and their use in biomedical applications.</p>

    <p>Exosomes are 50- to 300-nm-diameter vesicles secreted by most cells to the extracellular environment through fusion with the plasma membrane of endosomic compartments called multivesicular bodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Exosomes have been shown to contain RNAs, including mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

We report that hnRNPA2B1 binds a specific subset of miRNAs through their EXOmotifs and controls their loading into exosomes.

        <title>Specific repertoires of miRNAs are sorted into exosomes</title>
        <p>To assess whether some RNAs are specifically sorted into exosomes, we conducted a microarray analysis of activation-induced changes in the miRNA and mRNA profiles of primary T lymphoblasts and their exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, data publicly available at Gene Expression Omnibus through GEO Series accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE50972">GSE50972</ext-link>). Exosome sample quality was assessed using western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>) and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Microarray analysis showed that in most cases the miRNAs modulated upon activation are not the same in cells and exosomes, either for upregulated or for downregulated miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, top panels). Thus, miRNAs whose expression levels increase in T cells upon activation are not significantly increased in exosomes and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). A similar trend was observed for mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>). This lack of concordance between the activation-regulated miRNA and mRNA profiles of cells and exosomes indicates that miRNA and mRNA loading into exosomes is not a passive process. Several miRNAs were more highly represented in exosomes than in cells (such as miR-575, miR-451, miR-125a-3p, miR-198, miR-601 and miR-887; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), and in most cases this difference is maintained under resting and activated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, lower left panel). Similarly, most miRNAs that are more highly represented in cells than in exosomes (such as miR-17, mir-29a, let-7a, miR-142-3p, miR-181a and miR-18a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) maintain this tendency independently of the activation state of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, lower right panel). Some miRNAs are thus specifically sorted into exosomes (EXOmiRNAs), whereas others are specifically retained in cells (CLmiRNAs). Similar results were obtained for mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1c</xref>). Together, these data suggest the existence of mechanisms that control the active sorting of RNAs into exosomes.</p>

        <title>miRNAs contain motifs that control their sorting in exosomes</title>
        <p>To investigate sequence differences, we performed a multiple alignment analysis (ClustalW) of the mature sequences of 30 EXOmiRNAs and 42 CLmiRNAs. For this analysis, we used EXOmiRNAs and CLmiRNAs that show differential expression in cells with respect to exosomes in both primary T cells (data from the current study) and the leukemic Jurkat T-cell line (data previously published in Mittelbrunn <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and publicly available at the Gene Expression Omnibus through GEO Series accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE27997">GSE27997</ext-link>), and maintain this tendency under resting and activated conditions. The alignment cladogram grouped mature miRNAs according to their tendency to be localized in cells (CLmiRNAs, blue) or exosomes (EXOmiRNAs, red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Moreover, paralogous miRNAs, which have similar sequences but differ in their chromosomal localization (and therefore in their transcription levels), always showed the same tendency to be localized in exosomes or cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In contrast, mature miRNA complementary chains derived from the same pre-miRNA, which are therefore expressed at similar levels but have different sequences, can differ in their tendency for cell versus exosome localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). These data together suggest that the sequence of mature miRNAs is important for determining their sorting into exosomes.</p>
        <p>An unbiased search for specific motifs detected two motifs significantly over-represented in EXOmiRNAs (EXOmotifs), and three motifs significantly over-represented in CLmiRNA sequences (CLmotifs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The EXOmotif GGAG and the CLmotif UGCA occur in the 3â² half of the miRNA sequence in 75% and 66.6% of cases, respectively. The other CLmotifs appear in the 5â² half, and the remaining EXOmotif does not occur at a characteristic position. To ascertain whether these motifs are important for miRNA sorting, we cloned the CLmiRNA miR-17 and the EXOmiRNA miR-601 into retroviral vectors and then performed directed mutagenesis to convert the CLmotif of miR-17 into an EXOmotif and, conversely, the EXOmotif of miR-601 into a CLmotif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Differential overexpression of wild-type versus mutated miRNAs was assessed using RTâPCR with locked nucleic acid (LNA)-specific primers, allowing us to discriminate between the wild-type and mutated miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). miRNA levels in Jurkat T cells and their exosomes were analysed by absolute quantitative PCR, normalizing against synthetic RNAs added exogenously to all samples. In accordance with microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), the EXOmiRNAs miR-198 and miR-601 had a higher EXO/CL ratio than the CLmiRNAs miR-17 and miR-18a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, conversion of the miR-17 CLmotif into an EXOmotif (miR-17mut) resulted in a higher EXO/CL ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, left panel), and in the complementary experiment conversion of the EXOmotif in miR-601 into a CLmotif (miR-601mut) decreased the EXO/CL ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, right panel). These data thus indicate that specific short motifs present in miRNAs determine the sorting of miRNAs into exosomes.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>hnRNPA2B1 controls the loading of EXOmiRNAs into exosomes</title>
        <p>To investigate the molecular machinery that controls the sorting of specific miRNAs into exosomes, we screened for proteins present in exosomes that specifically bind EXOmiRNAs. Extracts from human primary T-cell exosomes were incubated with streptavidin beads coated with either a biotinylated EXOmiRNA (miR-198) or a biotinylated CLmiRNA (miR-17), and pulled down proteins were subjected to high-throughput identification using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). As negative controls, we used non-coated and poly-A RNA-coated streptavidin beads. A group of RNA-related proteins was precipitated with one or both miRNAs, but not with the negative controls. Functional analysis of the precipitated proteins revealed a predominant association with biological functions related to RNA-post-transcriptional modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The set of precipitated proteins included several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Among them, hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 seemed to bind only the EXOmiRNA, showing no detectable binding to CLmiRNA or the poly-A control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). hnRNPA2B1 is an ubiquitous protein that has been shown to regulate mRNA trafficking to axons in neural cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Moreover, the mRNA transport function of hnRNPA2B1 in neurons is mediated by its binding to a 21-nt RNA sequence called RNA trafficking sequence (RTS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Interestingly, this sequence contains both of the EXOmotifs identified here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). HnRNPA2B1 is thus a good candidate regulator of EXOmiRNA sorting to exosomes. The presence of hnRNPA2B1 in exosomes was confirmed using western blot of exosomes isolated with ultracentrifugation and floated with centrifugation to equilibrium density into a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>). Although this is the most stringent method for exosome purification, we cannot rule out the presence of other extracellular vesicles with similar size and density in these fractions. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis showed that hnRNPA2B1 fluorescence is higher in permeabilized exosomes than in non-permeabilized exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that the protein locates inside the exosomes. Confocal analysis revealed that hnRNPA2B1 is located mainly in the nucleus, but also in cytoplasmic granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4c,d</xref>). These data are supported using western blot analysis of hnRNPA2B1 in T-cell subcellular fractions, which show that hnRNPA2B1 cytoplasmic fraction is mainly associated with membranous organelles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4e</xref>). Moreover, hnRNPA2B1 colocalizes in the cytoplasm of cells with MVB markers such as ceramide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Specific binding of hnRNPA2B1 to miR-198 was verified with immunoprecipitation of hnRNPA2B1 from exosome lysates followed by qPCR of miRNAs; miR-198, but not miR-17, was amplified from hnRNPA2B1 immunoprecipitates, demonstrating specific binding of hnRNPA2B1 and miR-198 in exosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The specific binding of hnRNPA2B1 and miR-198 was confirmed using electrophoresis mobility shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This binding was inhibited when the EXOmotif of miR-198 was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), indicating that the binding of hnRNPA2B1 to miR-198 is dependent on the presence of the EXOmotif. HnRNPA2B1 also binds other EXOmiRNAs such as miR-601 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to investigate the role of hnRNPA2B1 in the packaging of miRNAs into exosomes, we assessed the effect of silencing or increasing its expression on the EXO miRNA profile in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6a,b</xref>). HnRNPA2B1 silencing significantly decreased the levels of the EXOmiRNA miR-198 in exosomes but did not significantly alter the levels of the CLmiRNA miR-18a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>); in contrast, hnRNPA2B1 overexpression increased the levels of miR-198 in exosomes without changing the levels of miR-18a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). In the overexpression experiments, the purification method used to recover exosomes was less stringent; therefore, it is possible that we were also detecting exosome-independent secreted miRNAs. These data indicate that hnRNPA2B1 controls the loading of specific EXOmiRNAs into exosomes.</p>

        <title>The loading of miRNAs is controlled by hnRNPA2B1 sumoylation</title>
        <p>Western blot analysis of hnRNPA2B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and hnRNPA1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7a</xref>) from exosomes revealed a higher molecular weight (m.w.) (~10â12âkDa more) in comparison with cells, suggesting that these proteins might be post-translationally modified in exosomes. Several hnRNPs including hnRNPA1 are known to attach to small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and the observed m.w. changes in exosomes are consistent with sumoylation. Moreover, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the hnRNPA2B1 protein sequence identified several predicted sites for SUMO conjugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>). To assess hnRNPA2B1 sumoylation, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with SUMO-1 and hnRNPA2B1-GFP (green-fluorescent protein) or GFP plasmids. After GFP immunoprecipitation, SUMO-1 was detected in cells transfected with hnRNPA2B1GFP but not in cells transfected with GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Sumoylation of hnRNPA2B1 was also demonstrated in T cells by the detection of SUMO-1 after hnRNPA2B1 immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). To confirm whether the higher m.w. of exosomal hnRNPA2B1 was because of sumoylation, we cultured Jurkat T cells in the presence of the specific sumoylation inhibitor anacardic acid (AA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7c</xref>). Whereas untreated exosomes contained barely detectable amounts of low-m.w. hnRNPA2B1, in the presence of AA the low-m.w. band could be readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These results indicate that the higher m.w. of exosomal hnRNPA2B1 is because of sumoylation, and that sumoylated hnRNPA2B1 is preferably sorted to exosomes. Further analysis revealed that treatment with AA reduced the levels of miR-198 in exosomes, whereas the levels of miR-17 and miR-18 did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Moreover, hnRNPA2B1 IP-qPCR experiments showed that there was less miR-198 bound to hnRNPA2B1 when sumoylation was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>), while exosome secretion or cell death did not change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7d</xref>). These data indicate that hnRNPA2B1-mediated loading of EXOmiRNAs into exosomes is controlled by the sumoylation of the protein.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report we identify short sequence motifs over-represented in miRNAs commonly enriched in exosomes. These motifs control the loading of these miRNAs into exosomes, and their directed mutagenesis enables the modulation of miRNA cargo in these vesicles.</p>
      <p>The ability of short nucleotide sequences to guide the transport of RNAs to different subcellular compartments has been reported previously. For example, a 20-ribonucleotide stem-loop sequence was shown to direct the import of nuclear-encoded mRNAs to mitochondria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and the hexanucleotide terminal motif of miR-29b was previously demonstrated to direct the nuclear enrichment of this miRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition, a 21-nucleotide sequence in the 3â² untranslated region (UTR) of the myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA was demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for the transport of this transcript along axons and its subsequent localization in the myelin compartment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. This sequence, known as RTS, binds the protein hnRNPA2B1, which is required for MBP transport and localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our proteomic analyses detected the specific binding of hnRNPA2B1 to the EXOmiRNA miR-198, which shares with the RTS the two motifs we found to be over-represented in EXOmiRNAs. We have demonstrated that hnRNPA2B1, which is present in exosomes, binds the EXOmiRNA directly and controls its loading into these microvesicles. In addition, hnRNPA2B1 in exosomes is preferentially sumoylated, and this sumoylation is important for the loading of EXOmiRNAs into exosomes. HnRNPA1 might work in a similar way, since it specifically binds the EXOmiRNA miR-198 and has been reported to be sumoylated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Interestingly, hnRNPA1 has been implicated in miRNA biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Unlike ubiquitination, sumoylation does not target proteins to proteasome degradation; instead, conjugation of SUMO has been shown to affect protein functions by altering their stability, subcellular localization or their ability to interact with other proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Interestingly, modification of protein properties by sumoylation has been reported to affect mRNA trafficking in axons by promoting the binding of the La protein to dynein over the binding to kinesin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. SUMO conjugation has been demonstrated to affect several hnRNPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, whose functions can also be modified by other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. In this regard, the interaction of hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPF with MBP mRNA can be modulated through phosphorylation by src-kinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Moreover, sumoylation and phosphorylation are associated events in many pathways; for instance, FAK protein sumoylation enables its interaction with src-kinases, resulting in phosphorylation and full activation of the protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>
      <p>The function of hnRNPA2B1 in transporting RNA to exosomes is probably dependent on its ability to interact with cytoskeletal components. Indeed, there is evidence that in neurons hnRNPA2B1 partly regulates motor activity through indirect contacts with microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, and monomeric or short oligomeric actin has been shown to associate with a subset of hnRNPs, including hnRNPA2B1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. HnRNPA2B1 was demonstrated to control HIV RNA trafficking and viral assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and given the convergences between HIV virus production and exosome biogenesis and secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, it is conceivable that both phenomena share common RNA transport mechanisms. In addition, hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 contain prion-like domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> that correspond to the âlow-complexity sequencesâ found in several hnRNPs that are essential determinants of RNA granule assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Prion-like domains are also involved in hnRNPA2B1 recruitment to stress granules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, which are cytoplasmatic ribonucleoprotein granules containing nontranslated mRNA and translation repressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Finally, hnRNPA2B1 has also been described to interact with TDP-43 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), another component of RNP granules that has been implicated in miRNA biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p>
      <p>Certain conserved RNA motifs are commonly present in specific secondary structures called RNA tetraloops, which usually serve as recognition sites for interaction with proteins or other RNA structural elements. The GGAG tetraloop has been reported to mediate the binding of HIV nucleocapsid protein to genomic ÏRNA packaging signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and also mediates RNAâprotein interactions in the signal recognition particle complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. It would be interesting to study whether the GGAG EXOmotif occurs in specific secondary structures in EXO miRNAs and whether these putative structures are essential for the binding to hnRNPA2B1.</p>
      <p>Cells have recently been shown to communicate with each other through the transfer of miRNA-loaded exosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. For example, monocyte-derived exosomes deliver miR-150 to endothelial cells and enhance their migration by reducing c-myb expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The miRNA content of exosomes plays a critical role in this type of cellâcell communication and determines the fate of the recipient cell. Thus, exosomes derived from the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells of myeloma patients promote tumour growth, and this effect depends on the content of miR-15a in exosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. HnRNPA2B1-mediated miRNA loading into exosomes is probably important for this novel mode of cellâcell communication. However, the functional relevance of hnRNPA2B1 and how it is regulated in different cell situations is still not understood. Another possible function for hnRNPA2B1-dependent export of miRNAs in exosomes is to provide a mechanism for eliminating undesired miRNAs.</p>
      <p>Our findings show that sumoylated hnRNPA2B1 directs the loading of certain miRNAs into exosomes through recognition of specific short motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). These RNA motifs may be useful for the artificial loading of selected small regulatory RNAs into exosomes and may prove to be suitable tools for the engineering of exosomes for gene therapy. These findings represent a major advance in our understanding of how miRNAs are loaded into exosomes and exported from cells.</p>

Microarray experiments were performed using the human miRNA and mRNA microarrays from Agilent. Arrays were used to analyse two RNA pools from four healthy donors of primary human resting and activated T lymphoblasts and their exosomes. Array data for mRNA and miRNA were normalized using the quantiles method (similar results were obtained for miRNA data using vsn2 normalization). After normalization, only those miRNA probes present in at least two samples and with an average expression above the 20th percentile of all average expressions were considered for further analysis (316 miRNAs).

        <title>FACS analysis of exosome-coupled beads</title>
        <p>Exosomes were obtained using ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient flotation, resuspended in PBS and coupled to 4âÎ¼m aldehyde-sulfate beads (Invitrogen) overnight at room temperature in rotation. Beads were washed and blocked for 60âmin at room temperature in 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS. For intracellular staining, bead-bound exosomes were permeabilized and fixed for 5âmin at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100, 2% formaldehyde in PBS. Beads were incubated with anti-hnRNPA2B1 (Santa Cruz) or anti-CD81 (5A6, Santa Cruz) for 1âh at 4âÂ°C, washed and incubated with Alexa-488-goat-anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30âmin. Beads were acquired on a FACSCalibur (BD) and data were analysed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Negative controls were obtained with exosome-coupled beads incubated with the secondary antibody.</p>
