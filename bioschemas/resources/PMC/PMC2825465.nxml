        <p>Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with deposition of triglycerides in tissues other than adipose tissue. Previously, we showed that a missense mutation (I148M) in PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 protein) is associated with increased hepatic triglyceride content in humans. Here we examined the effect of the I148M substitution on the enzymatic activity and cellular location of PNPLA3. Structural modeling predicted that the substitution of methionine for isoleucine at residue 148 would restrict access of substrate to the catalytic serine at residue 47. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays using recombinant PNPLA3 partially purified from <italic>Sf9</italic> cells confirmed that the wild type enzyme hydrolyzes emulsified triglyceride and that the I148M substitution abolishes this activity. Expression of PNPLA3-I148M, but not wild type PNPLA3, in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice increased cellular triglyceride content. Cell fractionation studies revealed that â¼90% of wild type PNPLA3 partitioned between membranes and lipid droplets; substitution of isoleucine for methionine at position 148 did not alter the subcellular distribution of the protein. These data are consistent with PNPLA3-I148M promoting triglyceride accumulation by limiting triglyceride hydrolysis.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Triglycerides are the major energy storage molecules in eukaryotes. In mammals, triglycerides are stored primarily in adipose tissue, which serves as an energy buffer during long term caloric depletion. Under conditions of sustained caloric excess, the deposition of triglycerides in non-adipose tissues may increase substantially, particularly in the liver. The extent of triglyceride accumulation varies markedly among individuals, ranging from less than 1% to more than 50% of liver weight in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). A variety of factors are associated with deposition of fat in the liver, including obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and alcohol ingestion, but the factors responsible for the wide individual differences in susceptibility to hepatic steatosis are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we identified a nonsynonymous polymorphism in PNPLA3 (I148M) that is strongly associated with hepatic fat content and with elevated serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, which are markers of liver inflammation. Subsequent studies have confirmed the association of this allele with hepatic fat content, elevated circulating liver enzyme levels, and liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Taken together, these studies support the notion that sequence differences in PNPLA3 lead to both fat deposition and inflammation in the liver.</p><p>The mechanism by which variation in PNPLA3 affects liver triglyceride content is not known. PNPLA3, alternatively referred to as adiponutrin, encodes a 481-amino acid protein of unknown function that belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The progenitor of the family, patatin, is a major protein of potato tubers and has nonspecific lipid acyl hydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). PNPLA3 is most closely related to PNPLA2 (adipose triglyceride lipase), which encodes the major triglyceride hydrolase of adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Human PNPLA3 was shown previously to hydrolyze triglycerides <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), but overexpression of PNPLA3 in human embryonic kidney cells is not associated with any change in cellular triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PNPLA3 does not affect the triglyceride content of 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear if PNPLA3 functions as a triglyceride hydrolase <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The tissue distribution and subcellular localization of PNPLA3 also have not been fully defined. Initially identified as a transcript restricted to the adipose lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>); subsequent studies indicated that PNPLA3 is also expressed in other tissues, including the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and adrenal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Baulande <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) reported that recombinant PNPLA3 pelleted completely with the membrane fraction after ultracentrifugation at 150,000 Ã <italic>g</italic>. Immunolocalization studies using confocal microscopy localized epitope-tagged recombinant PNPLA3 to membranes (but not lipid droplets) in cultured adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). These results were interpreted as being consistent with the prediction that PNPLA3 is an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>To examine the role of PNPLA3 in triglyceride metabolism and elucidate the mechanism by which the I148M substitution affects liver fat content, we expressed wild type and mutant forms of the protein in <italic>Sf9</italic> cells, in cultured hepatocytes, and in livers of mice. Our data indicate that PNPLA3 is a lipid droplet protein that can catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides <italic>in vitro</italic>. Overexpression of wild type PNPLA3 had little effect on triglyceride concentration in hepatocytes, but the I148M mutation promoted triglyceride accumulation when fatty acid acylation was inhibited, as did expression of an isoform of PNPLA3 containing a substitution in the catalytic site (S47A). These findings are consistent with the I148M substitution interfering with hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis and thus promoting hepatic steatosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Rabbit anti-PNPLA3 polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of human PNPLA3 (VPAGAEGLSTFPSFSLEKSL).

Single nucleotide changes were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A V5-epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) was placed at the C terminus of each plasmid construct except for PNPLA3-S47A.

Partially purified PNPLA3 was prepared as described by Jenkins <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Seventy-two hours after infection, cells were centrifuged at 2600 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (25 m<sc>m</sc> Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.8, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and 2 m<sc>m</sc> 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication (1-s bursts, 40% power, 30 times with a Branson Digital Sonifier 450 (Danbury, CT)) and centrifuged at 100,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 1 h to separate cytosolic and membrane fractions. The cytosolic fraction (2 mg/ml) was mixed with 3 ml of cobalt-resin (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 Â°C and then loaded into an Econo-column (1.5 Ã 10 cm; Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer plus 500 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl. PNPLA3 was eluted using an imidazole gradient (0â200 m<sc>m</sc>) in lysis buffer, and fractions containing the highest concentration of PNPLA3, as determined by Western blotting (see below), were used in the enzymatic assays. Triolein emulsions were prepared by sonicating 1.5 mg of unlabeled triolein (Sigma), 20 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cpm of [9,10-<sup>3</sup>H]triolein (60 Î¼Ci/Î¼mol), and 40 Î¼g of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in 1 ml of 170 m<sc>m</sc> potassium phosphate (K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>), pH 7.0, containing 200 Î¼<sc>m</sc> sodium taurocholate. After sonication, disodium EDTA and dithiothreitol were added to the emulsion to a final concentration of 4 m<sc>m</sc>. For each assay, 100 Î¼l of the substrate, [9,10-<sup>3</sup>H]triolein, was mixed with partially purified PNPLA3 (20â80 Î¼g Î¿f protein) in a glass tube to a final concentration of 60 Î¼<sc>m</sc> [9,10-<sup>3</sup>H]triolein.

A total of 20 Î¼l of the extracted lipids was loaded onto TLC plates and developed using chloroform/methanol/30% NH<sub>4</sub>OH (65/25/5) as the mobile phase. The lipids were visualized with iodine vapor, and the free fatty acid bands were scraped from the plates and quantitated by scintillation counting.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). An equivalent proportion (by volume) of each cell fraction was added to 5Ã sample loading buffer (0.313 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, 0.4 <sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol) to a final concentration of 1Ã. After heating to 95 Â°C for 5 min, the proteins were size-fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE at 150 V and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 100 V for 1 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The membranes were incubated in TBST buffer (0.05 <sc>m</sc> Tris, 0.138 <sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2.7 Î¼<sc>m</sc> KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0) with 5% dry nonfat milk (Nestle) at 4 Â°C overnight before adding the primary antibodies. Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and a polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI) were diluted 1:5,000 in TBST buffer with 5% dry nonfat milk and incubated with membranes for 60 min. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min each in TBST buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was diluted (1:10,000) in TBST buffer plus 5% dry milk and incubated with membranes for 60 min. Membranes were subject to three 10-min washes in TBST and visualized using SuperSignal-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of PNPLA3 in Cultured Cells</title><p>To generate cells that stably express PNPLA3, a human hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) was transfected with plasmids expressing wild type or mutant PNPLA3-V5. Three days after transfection, cells were passaged at low density in DMEM with 10% FCS containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Medium was changed every 2 days. After 7 days, cells were suspended with trypsin, counted, and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 cells/well in DMEM with 10% FCS containing 1 mg/ml G418.

Structural modeling indicated that the substitution does not perturb the position or orientation of the catalytic dyad residues (Ser-47 and Asp-166). Rather, the side chain of the methionine at residue 148 extends into the catalytic site, shielding the serine side chain from access to substrate. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays using recombinant PNPLA3 were consistent with the predictions of the structural model; whereas the wild type enzyme hydrolyzed emulsified triglycerides, the mutant enzyme was inactive against this substrate. Studies in mice indicated that the accumulation of triglyceride associated with the Met<sup>148</sup> isoform is due to expression of the mutant protein, rather than loss of the wild type enzyme activity. Overexpression of wild type human PNPLA3 did not affect liver triglyceride content in mice, suggesting that PNPLA3 may not be a major triglyceride hydrolase in this organ. In contrast, expression of the I148M isoform in the liver of mice increased liver triglyceride content. These findings were recapitulated in cultured hepatoma cells (HuH-7), even when <italic>de novo</italic> triglyceride formation from acyl-CoAs was inhibited by triacsin C. These data are consistent with the notion that expression of the mutant protein promotes triglyceride accumulation by inhibiting triglyceride hydrolysis in the cell.</p><p>The predicted structure of the patain domain of PNPLA3 is highly congruent with the crystal structure of heartleaf horsenettle patatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Patatins differ from the classical lipases in two key respects. First, patatins use a catalytic dyad (Ser-Asp), rather than the catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp) usually present in lipases. The predicted catalytic serine of PNPLA3 (Ser<sup>47</sup>) lies in a highly conserved hydrolase motif (Gly-<italic>X</italic>-Ser-<italic>X</italic>-Gly) at a hairpin turn between a Î²-strand and an Î±-helix. The patatin fold brings this serine into close apposition to Asp<sup>166</sup> at the edge of a putative substrate-binding groove formed by the side chains of several hydrophobic residues, including Ile<sup>148</sup>. In the wild type protein, the side chains of Ser<sup>47</sup> and Asp<sup>166</sup> project into the groove. When methionine is substituted for isoleucine at residue 148, the longer side chain of methionine is predicted to occlude access of substrates to the catalytic dyad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These structural predictions are consistent with the observation that the I148M substitution abolishes cleavage of emulsified triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Second, the patatin structure does not contain a lid domain, which mediates interfacial activation in classical lipases. Therefore, it has been proposed that patatins act on solubilized lipids rather than on micelles like the lid domain-containing lipases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast to plant patatins, which are soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), PNPLA3 is tightly associated with membranes and with lipid droplets. Constructs comprising the patatin domain alone were also firmly anchored to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Whereas these experiments do not preclude additional sites of interaction between PNPLA3 and membranes, they indicate that the patatin domain of PNPLA3 interacts with the membrane. Previous studies proposed that PNPLA3 contains membrane spanning domains on the basis of its predicted secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, our model of the tertiary structure of the enzyme indicates that all of the helices form part of the globular structure of the protein and do not span the membrane. The active site of PNPLA3 is surrounded by hydrophobic and lysine residues that are exposed on the protein surface and probably mediate interaction with the membrane. The close proximity of the active site to the membrane suggests that PNPLA3 is active on lipids in membranes and/or lipid droplets rather than solubilized lipids. Experiments are in progress to define the site of attachment of PNPLA3 to membranes.</p><p>The association of PNPLA3 with lipid droplets, together with the finding that the I148M substitution inactivates triglyceride hydrolysis by PNPLA3, suggests that the association between the I148M allele and hepatic triglyceride content in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) may be explained by a simple model in which PNPLA3 normally serves to hydrolyze hepatic triglycerides. In this model, the loss of enzymatic activity associated with the I148M substitution leads to triglyceride accumulation in this organ. However unlike PNPLA2 and hormone-sensitive lipase, which reduced liver triglycerides when overexpressed in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), overexpression of wild type PNPLA3 in mouse liver failed to lower triglyceride content, whereas overexpression of the mutant PNPLA3 actually increased hepatic triglyceride levels. These data suggest that PNPLA3 is not usually rate-limiting for triglyceride hydrolysis in the liver and that the increased liver triglyceride content associated with the I148M allele is due to the presence of the mutant protein rather than the absence of the wild type enzyme activity.</p><p>The lack of reduction in hepatic triglyceride content in the livers of mice expressing high levels of the wild type human PNPLA3 may reflect interspecies differences in the role of PNPLA3. This explanation seems unlikely because high level expression of PNPLA3 did not alter triglyceride levels in cultured human hepatocytes. An alternative explanation is that PNPLA3 stimulates fatty acid re-esterification, either directly, as proposed by Jenkins <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), or indirectly by activating a signaling molecule that promotes triglyceride accumulation. If PNPLA3 promotes both hydrolysis and transacylation of triglycerides, then inactivation of the catalytic site may disrupt hydrolytic activity but spare the transacylase function of the enzyme, promoting triglyceride formation. In preliminary studies using recombinant PNPLA3, we failed to show appreciable transesterification of mono- and diglycerides by either the wild type or the mutant enzyme (data not shown). Additional studies will be required to clarify the role of PNPLA3 in hepatic triglyceride metabolism relative to the other lipases.</p><p>It remains possible that the inactive PNPLA3 isoforms sequester a cofactor required for hydrolysis or restrict access of the active allele (or another lipase) to the substrate, thus causing triglyceride accumulation. Many triglyceride hydrolases, including PNPLA2, the major triglyceride hydrolase in adipose tissue, require protein co-factors for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), but a similar co-factor for PNPLA3 has not been identified. The mutant enzyme did not interfere with the wild type protein in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), but access to the substrate or to essential co-factors may be limited <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The localization of PNPLA3 to both the membrane and lipid droplet fractions in cultured hepatocytes mirrors the distribution reported previously for PNPLA2, the major triglyceride hydrolase of adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and may represent partitioning of the protein between a membrane reservoir and an active pool on the surfaces of lipid droplets. Substitution of isoleucine 148 with methionine did not affect the partitioning of the protein between the membrane and cytosol or its localization into lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). To exclude the possibility that PNPLA3 associates nonspecifically with lipid droplets during the isolation procedure, a recognized artifact of lipid droplet isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), we confirmed the localization of both the wild type and mutant proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy. Thus, it is unlikely that the mutation results in mistargeting the protein away from its normal sites of action.</p><p>Despite the apparent absence of a membrane-spanning domain, PNPLA3 is tightly associated with membranes; harsh treatment with high salt, high pH, or Triton X-100 failed to elute the protein from the membrane fraction. PNPLA3 may be targeted specifically to regions of the ER membrane that are destined to become nascent lipid droplets. Alternatively, PNPLA3 may be trafficked from the ER membrane to preexisting lipid droplets by components of the ER-Golgi transport machinery, as has recently been described for PNPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It is also possible that PNPLA3 performs distinct functions in membranes and lipid droplets. Elucidating the physiological substrate(s) of the enzyme will be essential to unraveling its role in lipid metabolism and in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease.</p></sec>
