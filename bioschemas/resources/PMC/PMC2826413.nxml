          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and degradation takes a central role in current paradigms of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Loss of DJ-1 function is a rare cause of familial PD. Although a critical role of DJ-1 in oxidative stress response and mitochondrial function has been recognized, the effects on mitochondrial dynamics and downstream consequences remain to be determined.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Using DJ-1 loss of function cellular models from knockout (KO) mice and human carriers of the E64D mutation in the <italic>DJ-1</italic> gene we define a novel role of DJ-1 in the integrity of both cellular organelles, mitochondria and lysosomes. We show that loss of DJ-1 caused impaired mitochondrial respiration, increased intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and characteristic alterations of mitochondrial shape as shown by quantitative morphology. Importantly, ultrastructural imaging and subsequent detailed lysosomal activity analyses revealed reduced basal autophagic degradation and the accumulation of defective mitochondria in DJ-1 KO cells, that was linked with decreased levels of phospho-activated ERK2.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>We show that loss of DJ-1 leads to impaired autophagy and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that under physiological conditions would be compensated via lysosomal clearance. Our study provides evidence for a critical role of DJ-1 in mitochondrial homeostasis by connecting basal autophagy and mitochondrial integrity in Parkinson's disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The identification of genetic causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) only ten years ago allowed first insights into the molecular mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in this common movement disorder. These mechanisms include the pathological misfolding of disease-related proteins, disturbed ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways and the accumulation of intraneuronal protein aggregates in affected brain areas, also known as Lewy bodies <xref rid="pone.0009367-Schiesling1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The identification of PD-specific mutations in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins provided the first genetic link to the variety of biochemical findings implicating a disturbed mitochondrial function in PD pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0009367-Valente1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Strauss1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Schapira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutations in the <italic>DJ-1</italic> gene were identified as a rare cause of autosomal-recessive PD <xref rid="pone.0009367-Bonifati1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and account for approximately 1â2% of all early-onset forms of PD <xref rid="pone.0009367-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To date, several homozygous deletions and point mutations in the DJ-1 gene encoding a highly conserved 189 amino acid protein are known to cause PD due to a loss of protein function <xref rid="pone.0009367-Bonifati1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Bonifati2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Hering1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The physiological role of DJ-1 implicates broad biological functions including modulation of transcription, chaperone-like functions and antioxidant properties <xref rid="pone.0009367-Cookson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although present in various subcellular compartments including cytoplasm and nucleus, targeting of DJ-1 to mitochondria was reported to contribute to its physiological cytoprotective role <xref rid="pone.0009367-CanetAviles1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Blackinton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In conditions of oxidative stress DJ-1 is converted into an acidic variant allowing it to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to localize to the mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0009367-Taira1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Cell culture experiments revealed that oxidation of a specific cysteine residue in position 106 of the DJ-1 peptide sequence is responsible for mitochondrial targeting and protection against oxidation-induced cell death <xref rid="pone.0009367-CanetAviles1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Blackinton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Indeed, promoting the mitochondrial localization of DJ-1 increased DJ-1 dimer formation at the outer mitochondrial membrane and the cytoprotective activity towards oxidative insults <xref rid="pone.0009367-Junn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, loss of DJ-1 function is linked to increased vulnerability to complex I inhibition as shown in fly and mouse models <xref rid="pone.0009367-Meulener1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in neuronal cell death in PD. Impaired mitochondrial function is critically linked to imbalanced dynamic fusion and fission events of mitochondria, to energetic depression and may subsequently result in the activation of programmed cell death mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0009367-Seppet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mandemakers1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Gellerich1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Hence, selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by lysosomal degradation pathways is critical for the maintainance of cellular integrity <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mandemakers1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Twig1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although a critical role of DJ-1 for mitochondrial homeostasis has been recognized by different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, no effects on mitochondrial dynamics and downstream lysosomal degradation pathways, such as macroautophagy (hereafter â=â autophagy) were reported. Here we provide evidence that loss of DJ-1 function causes a prominent disturbance of both, mitochondrial function and morphology, that is linked to decreased basal autophagy and impaired lysosomal degradation.</p>

        <p>For the functional analysis of the DJ-1 protein experiments were performed in immortalised DJ-1 knockout (KO) and DJ-1 wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) that have been described previously <xref rid="pone.0009367-Gorner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Stably back-transfected DJ-1 MEF were generated by transfecting DJ-1 KO MEF with pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen, USA) vector containing a DJ-1 WT construct or the empty control vector, respectively. Transfection was performed using Fugene 6 HD (Roche Diagnostics; Mannheim) according to the manufacturers' instruction.</p>
        <p>MEF cells were cultured in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) containing penicillin, streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Biochrom, Germany). Stable transfected DJ-1 knock-out MEF cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, USA) containing Zeocin (Invitrogen, USA, 400 Âµg/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Biochrom, Germany) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Moreover fibroblasts from members of the family carrying the E64D mutation in the <italic>DJ-1</italic> gene and a healthy control were included in our analyses <xref rid="pone.0009367-Hering1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Skin biopsies were taken from the index patient carrying the homozygous E64D mutation, two unaffected sibs carrying the E64D mutation in the <italic>DJ-1</italic> gene in a heterozygous state and a healthy age-matched control individual. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of TÃ¼bingen. All patients and controls gave written and informed consent. Primary fibroblast cells were maintained in RPMI medium with 10% FCS supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 Âµg/ml streptomycin and 1 mM pyruvate.</p>

        <title>Assessment of Mitochondrial and Lysosomal Parameters by Fluorescent-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)</title>
        <p>Analysis of intramitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass and lysosomal activity in DJ-1 KO MEF cells compared to DJ-1 WT MEF cells in living cells was performed by a FACS-based methods. Cells were harvested with 2 mM EDTA solution in PBS and washed with PBS. To analyze the production of intramitochondrial ROS cells were incubated with PBS containing 2 ÂµM MitoSOXÂ® (Invitrogen, USA) for 15 min at 37Â°C. The MMP was measured by staining with 200 nM tetramethylrhodaminemethylester (TMRM; Invitrogen, USA) in PBS for 15 min at 37Â°C. Mitochondrial mass and lysosomal activity in MEF were determined by staining the cells with either 50 nM MitoTrackerÂ® Green FM (Invitrogen, USA) or 1 ÂµM LysoTrackerÂ® (Invitrogen, USA), respectively. To determine the relative uptake of MitoTrackerÂ® or LysoTrackerÂ® the threshold was set at about 50% of the WT signal intensity and the percentage of shift in the fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) staining was determined with the Summit version 4.2 software (Beckman Coulter).</p>
        <p>For each sample, at least 30.000 cells were analyzed for the corresponding fluorescence on a CyAnTM ADP apparatus (Beckman Coulter) with a 488-nm or 415-nm laser. Experiments were performed three times with similar results.</p>

Cells (2Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) were incubated in a Hank's medium containing 10 mM pyruvate. Endogenous respiration was observed without any further additions. Oligomycin resistent respiration was followed in the presence of 10 Âµg/ml oligomycin. Then uncoupled respiration was measured by stepwise additions of 100 nM FCCP. Data as means Â± SE of 13 (wild type MEF, â¾) and 11 (KO MEF, â¢) single incubations performed of 5 different cell preparations. DJ-1 KO MEF showed significantly reduced oxygen consumption compared to controls (#: p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA). (B) Mitochondria were investigated by respirometry in cell homogenates of DJ-1 KO cells and WT controls using multiple substrate inhibitor titration. Measurements were performed in homogenates from 3Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml MMMPK buffer with 10 mM pyruvate and 2 mM malate as substrates (Additions: ADP, 5 mM ADP; Cyt c, 10 ÂµM cytochrome c; NADH, 150 ÂµM NADH; Rot, 1,5 ÂµM rotenone, Suc, 10 mM succinate; Cat, 50 ÂµM carboxyatractylate). Blue lines indicate the oxygen concentration in the oxygraph (left ordinate), red lines represent the first derivative of the oxygen time curve, directly indicating the rate of respiration (right ordinate).

        <p>To address whether or not specifically the complex I-dependent mitochondrial function is affected we investigated cell homogenates by means of a special substrate inhibitor titration protocol <xref rid="pone.0009367-ProikasCezanne2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Kuznetsov1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This protocol allows the sequential measurement of maximum phosphorylation rates (state 3) for two different substrates in the same sample. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> addition of 5 mM ADP increased the respiration using pyruvate and malate as substrates (state 3<sub>pyr/mal</sub>). However the increase in state 3 respiration was significantly lower (â50%) in DJ-1 KO cells compared to controls. After inhibition of the complex I-dependent respiration with rotenone the addition of complex II-dependent substrate succinate allowed the measurement of state 3<sub>suc</sub>.respiration. In both types of cells the complex II dependent respiration was comparable to each other indicating that the impairment of DJ-1 KO cells is restricted on the complex I-related mitochondrial metabolism. The ratios calculated from complex I- and complex II-dependent state 3 respiration measured in the same sample (state 3<sub>pyr/mal</sub>/state 3<sub>suc</sub>) allow the quantification of the complex I-related mitochondrial impairment <xref rid="pone.0009367-ProikasCezanne2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Specifically state 3<sub>pyr/mal</sub> respiration was significantly reduced in DJ-1 KO cells (â39%).</p>
        <p>By additions of cytochrome c and NADH to respiring mitochondria is it possible to prove whether the permeability of outer or inner membranes for these molecules is pathologically changed <xref rid="pone.0009367-ProikasCezanne2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>

        <title>Reduced Basal Autophagy in DJ-1 KO Cells</title>
        <p>Next, we asked whether impaired lysosomal degradation pathways in the absence of DJ-1 could be proven by upstream events that depend on functional lysosomes, such as autophagic clearance. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway responsible for the degradation of cytoplasmic material including long-lived proteins, misfolded proteins and cellular organelles such as mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mizushima2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mizushima3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, impaired autophagy has been correlated with the onset of neurodegeneration, such as the pathology of Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease <xref rid="pone.0009367-Klionsky1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, molecular targets that confer autophagic dysfunction in neurodegeneration are insufficiently identified. Here, we employed well established autophagy assays, such as LC3 protein monitoring <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mizushima1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and WIPI-1 puncta formation quantification <xref rid="pone.0009367-ProikasCezanne1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-ProikasCezanne2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-ProikasCezanne3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Klionsky1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Vergne1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> to assess autophagy in DJ-1 KO MEF versus WT controls. Upon autophagic stimulation, LC3 becomes conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3-II) and localizes at autophagosomal membranes. Unconjugated LC3 (LC3-I) is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and in the nucleous. Hence the increase of endogenous LC3-II protein abundance monitors the autophagic activity. Thereby, basal autophagy as well as induced or inhibited autophagy can be compared using different cellular backgrounds. In addition, LC3 protein monitoring allows to analyze the autophagic flux, meaning the process from autophagosome formation to autophagolysosomal degradation. In experimental set-ups where autophagolysosomal degradation is blocked by the addition of lysosomal inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors, the further increase of LC3-II protein abundance reflects that autophagic flux occurs properly <xref rid="pone.0009367-Rubinsztein1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The WIPI-1 puncta formation analyses also monitors autophagic activity, because WIPI-1 specifically binds to Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) upon autophagic stimulation and localizes at autophagosomal membranes. Using GFP-WIPI-1, PI(3)P-bound GFP-WIPI-1 (puncta) can easily be visualized and quantified by fluorescence microscopy as a measure for the autophagic activity. Cells that display GFP-WIPI-1 fluorescent puncta undergo autophagic stimulation, and in cells without GFP-WIPI-1 puncta (non-puncta) autophagy is inactive. Of note, the usage of GFP-LC3 in such experiments leads to unwanted protein aggregations of GFP-LC3 that do not reflect autophagosomal membrane formation. In contrast, the usage of GFP-WIPI-1 does not lead to such protein aggregations <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mizushima1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Here, we first used the method of endogenous LC3 protein monitoring to ask whether or not basal autophagy is altered in models of loss of DJ-1 function. Strikingly, basal autophagy levels were reduced in DJ-1 KO MEF compared to WT control cells as reflected by a decrease LC3-II protein abundance, a measure for autophagosome-bound LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). We normalized LC3-II signal intensities over GAPDH in standard ECL analyses and show that the LC3-II signal intensity in DJ-1 KO cells (MEF DJ-1 â/â) was reduced to 0.297 when compared to WT cells (MEF DJ-1 +/+, set to 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, the autophagic flux was not inhibited as shown by the addition of protease inhibitors (PI) during assay conditions that block final degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Comparing the LC3-II protein abundance during conditions with or without protease inhibitors, we found an increase of LC3-II signal intensity in WT cells from 1,000 to 3.013 (MEF DJ-1 +/+ PI) and also in DJ-1 KO cells from 0.297 (MEF DJ-1 â/â) to 2,539 (MEF DJ-1 â/â PI). This result was further verified when cells were incubated in amino acid-free medium as a treatment that induces autophagy. Here, the further increase of LC3-II signal intensities when compared to basal LC3-II intensity levels in both, WT cells (MEF DJ-1 â/â PI: 7.573) and DJ-1 KO cells (MEF DJ-1 +/+ PI: 3.392) confirm that the autophagic flux was maintained in MEF cells devoid of DJ-1 <xref rid="pone.0009367-Rubinsztein1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Next, we treated cells with the PI-3 kinase inhibitor compound LY294002 for 3 hours. Thereby, PI(3)P generation by Vps34/Beclin1 is inhibited and basal autophagy is reduced to a minimum. Under such circumstances, we compared basal autophagy in a time course after the LY294002 compound was removed and substituted with growth medium (Basal) or amino acid-free medium (EBSS) with or without protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5B, 5C</xref>). In all cases from the three independent experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> (upper panel) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5C</xref> (upper panel, lower panel), LC3-II protein abundance was reduced in the DJ-1 KO cells, but autophagic activity was not completely abolished (compare LC3-II signal intensities with and without the addition of protease inhibitors) as observed before. Normalized basal autophagy (0 min. time point in time courses from three independent experiments, boxed lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5B, C</xref>) was quantified by setting the LC3-II signal intensities in DJ-1 WT cells to 1.

In order to confirm that autophagy is not completely blocked, although the basal level was reduced in mutant DJ-1 cells, we transiently transfected DJ-1 WT and KO MEFs with GFP-LC3 and found puncta formation in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>

(B, C) WT (MEF DJ-1 +/+) or DJ-1 KO MEF (MEF DJ-1 â/â) were pretreated with LY290042 for 3 hrs to reduce autophagy to a minimum basal level. Thereafter, in the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors (protease inh.) control medium was added to analyze basal autophagy, or EBSS was added to induce autophagy for the indicated period of time (min.). LC3 and GAPDH protein levels from total protein extracts are shown. (B) The decrease in basal autophagy is presented in the lower panel graph as follows. From three independet sets of experiments shown in C (boxed lanes in the upper and lower panels) and B (boxed lanes in the upper panel) were used to quantify the LC3-II signal intensity normalized over GAPDH. The measurements for DJ1 +/+ MEFs were set to one. The LC3-II signal intensity in DJ1 â/â MEFs was compared to DJ1 +/+ MEFs (p-value 0.000676). (D) Although basal autophagy was reduced in DJ1 â/â MEFs, autophagy was not abolished as further shown by transient expression of GFP-LC3 and detecting GFP-LC3 puncta as an indicator for autophagosomes.</p>

        <title>Reduced Colocalization of Mitochondria with Lysosomes in Cellular Models of Loss of DJ-1</title>

To determine the colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes as a measure of lysosomal degradation of mitochondria we used specific dyes for differential staining of the respective organelles.

This is indicative for an increased mitochondrial mass in DJ-1-KO cells compared to controls and correlates with our findings on lysosomal function and colocalization of mitochondria with lysosomal structures. In order to further validate our FACS-based method to quantify mitochondrial mass, we performed Western blot analyses of the mitochondrial complex IV subunit I, to quantify mitochondrial mass and to validate our FACS-based experiments for quantification by MitroTracker green staining (Invitrogen).

(B) To further validate our observations on mitochondrial mass, we used an independent method quantifying complex IV subunit I as a mitochondrially encoded protein of the respiratory chain.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mitochondria have been early recognized as a critical interface between vital energy metabolism and cell death. Based on biochemical findings in affected brain regions of PD patients a role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage has been hypothesized in both ageing and neurodegeneration <xref rid="pone.0009367-Beal1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This hypothesis was further emphazised by the identification of nuclear genes mutated in familial forms of PD that are directly linked to mitochondrial function, i.e. Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 <xref rid="pone.0009367-CanetAviles1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Greene1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Exner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In the present study we demonstrate, that the Parkinson's disease associated protein DJ-1 integrates both mitochondrial and lysosomal function.</p>
      <p>We have shown that the loss of the mitochondrial protein DJ-1 KO in MEF cells causes multiple mitochondrial impairments including functional and morphological changes: (i) a significant increase of mitochondrial ROS formation in DJ-1 KO cells which could impair the oxidative phosphorylation as indicated by (ii) diminished pyruvate dependent respiration rates and (iii). reduced MMP. Importantly, the decreased MMP as a parameter of mitochondrial dysfunction was restored by complementation of the DJ-1 KO model with physiological active DJ-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). These metabolically detectable impairments were paralleled by morphological changes as decreased mitochondrial branching which could be explained by a relative augmentation of fission events. Since there was no change in the steady state levels of the main fusion/fission mediators Drp1, Mfn2, Fis1, and OPA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), we speculate that increased fission could be caused by a reduced energy supply to the energy consuming fusion processes. Indeed regarding our findings on mitochondrial depolarization these results support the notion that relevant reduction in the MMP negatively regulates the prevalence of fusion events (Twig et al., 2008). Disrupted fusion results in mitochondrial heterogeneity and decreased rates of cellular respiration was recently shown in cellular models of null mutations of Mfn1 and Mfn2 <xref rid="pone.0009367-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Moreover it seems that cells with impaired fusion/fission dynamics are unable to use mitochondrial redistribution in order to provide increased local ATP supply at cellular sites of particular demand <xref rid="pone.0009367-Kuznetsov2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Loss of DJ-1 shifted the mitochondrial network towards the status of reduced mitochondrial connectivity. Indeed our first study of fibroblasts derived from patients with homozygous mutations in the <italic>DJ-1</italic> gene revealed similar phenotype with reduced mitochondrial branching in the human condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g003">Fig. 3D, 3E</xref>) indicating that DJ-1 may interfere with the critical balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics.</p>
      <p>First evidence for a potential role of DJ-1 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology came from comparative studies of different generated DJ-1 mutants that influenced the oxidative modification of a critical cysteine in position 106 <xref rid="pone.0009367-Blackinton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the same study, functional mitochondrial connectivity was assayed in DJ-1 KO MEF by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurement and indicated a loss of connectivity. This is consistent with our present study using direct morphometry as an independent method to assess mitochondrial connectivity.</p>
      <p>Recently, effects on mitochondrial morphology and a critical role for mitochondrial homeostasis in PD has been attributed to the loss of PINK1 function, and it was suggested that the PD-associated proteins PINK1 and Parkin may act in the same pathway to modulate mitochondrial morphology <xref rid="pone.0009367-Exner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Poole1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In mammalian cells, loss of PINK1 led to increased fission events causing mitochondrial fragmentation, that were rescued by Parkin <xref rid="pone.0009367-Exner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, in invertebrate <italic>in vivo</italic> models loss of PINK1 function increased mitochondrial fusion events, that was rescued by increasing Drp1 gene dosage <xref rid="pone.0009367-Poole1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Thus species-specific differences in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics may exist and may explain the variable deflection of the critical balance between fusion and fission events in different <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models. In this context it is of note that we observed a similar phenotype in a murine and human cellular model of loss of DJ-1 function. Whether the mitochondrial phenotype caused by loss of DJ-1 (our study here) and PINK1 function reflects converging signaling pathways warrants further studies. However, previous data of our own research as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in Drosophila models of PINK1 inactivation argue against a functional compensation of PINK1 by DJ-1 <xref rid="pone.0009367-Exner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial integrity is critically secured by autophagic clearance <xref rid="pone.0009367-Kanki1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. During the process of autophagy unique vesicles, autophagosomes, are generated that sequester the cytoplasmic cargo, including cellular organelles and long-lived proteins. Subsequently, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes for cargo degradation. Autophagy occurs on a constitutive level in all eukaryotic cells and as a consequence, cellular homeostasis is secured by constant clearance and recycling of cytoplasmic constituents (basal autophagy). Importantly, due to a variety of cellular insults, including ROS production, autophagy is induced to an extended degree (induced autophagy) <xref rid="pone.0009367-Mizushima2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-ScherzShouval1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In this respect, ROS of mitochondrial origin, depolarization of mitochondria and increased fission events each have been reported to trigger autophagic activity <xref rid="pone.0009367-Dagda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, although we measured an increase of mitochondrial ROS production, a prominent depolarization of mitochondria in DJ-1 KO cells, and reduced mitochondrial connectivity, the basal autophagy levels in these cells were reduced compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Autophagic pathways are an important protection system against ROS-mediated damage of proteins and organelles in the cell <xref rid="pone.0009367-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. These pathways are compromised during aging and age-related disorders like PD are characterized by the accumulation of oxidized proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0009367-Schapira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Rubinsztein2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Cataldo1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Schapira2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In support, premature aging, that is hypothesized to be elementary connected to misregulated autophagy <xref rid="pone.0009367-Melendez1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, represents a known mechanism involved in PD pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0009367-vanHam1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Importantly, loss of key autophagy proteins, such as Atg5 have been shown to be responsible for reducing basal autophagy levels that led to neurodegenerative symptoms in mouse models <xref rid="pone.0009367-Hara1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. In Atg5-deficient peripheral T cells reduced levels of basal autophagy lead to an impaired removal of damaged mitochondria that resulted in increased mitochondrial mass <xref rid="pone.0009367-Stephenson1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Indeed we demonstrated that human and murine cells lacking physiological DJ-1 show evidence for a decrease in mitochondrial degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) and an increase in mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). In further support, the multilamellar lysosomal structures accumulating in DJ-1 KO cells are highly reminiscent of pigmented vacuoles that represent autophagic responses due to neurodegeneration and support the idea of a mitochondrial-lysosomal axis of aging <xref rid="pone.0009367-Sulzer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent studies provided first evidence for a potential role of DJ-1 in autophagic response to cellular stress. In human osteosarcoma cells an impairment of hypoxia-induced autophagy after DJ-1 knock-down was described by analyzing LC3 <xref rid="pone.0009367-Vasseur1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Moreover, a role of DJ-1 in the paradigm of paraquat-induced autophagy was defined in a knock-down model of DJ-1 in human neuroblastoma cells <xref rid="pone.0009367-GonzalezPolo1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. However, effects on basal autophagy as demonstrated in our DJ-1 KO cellular model, were not described in both siRNA knock-down models, most probably due to the remaining DJ-1 function mediated by residual protein levels of endogenous DJ-1 after siRNA treatment <xref rid="pone.0009367-Vasseur1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-GonzalezPolo1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In our model further induction of autophagy by amino acid deprivation or rapamycin treatment showed the presence of autophagic flux in both, DJ-1 KO and WT cells. However levels of autophagic activity remained reduced for the DJ-1 KO condition compared to control cells as demonstrated by LC3 protein monitoring.</p>
      <p>Based on our findings of a functional role of DJ-1 in preserving basal autophagy the observed changes in mitochondrial connectivity due to loss of DJ-1 may be secondary to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Indeed, lysosomal storage disorders are characterized by an inefficient autophagic clearence of mitochondria leading to loss in mitochondrial connectivity <xref rid="pone.0009367-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Mitochondrial alterations observed in lysosomal storage disorders were replicable by treatment of control cells with lysosomal inhibitors (Jennings et al., 2006). We also found that lysosomal inhibition of control MEF expressing physiological DJ-1 led to similar changes in MMP as observed in DJ-1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>).</p>
      <p>In order to understand the connection between ROS production and autophagy levels in more detail, it will be of great interest to identify signaling cascades by which ROS triggers autophagy <xref rid="pone.0009367-Meijer1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Here we provide evidence for a correlation of DJ-1 protein function and ERK1/2 signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of autophagy. Recent studies demonstrated an involvement of ERK2 in the regulation of autophagy <xref rid="pone.0009367-Dagda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. It has been shown that ERK1/2 is involved in the modulation of lysosomal degradation and that basal levels of ERK2 kinase activity are required for its effect on autophagy <xref rid="pone.0009367-Dagda2" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. In this context higher levels of phopho-ERK2 and/or mitochondrial ERK2 localization induced autophagy including mitochondrial clearance <xref rid="pone.0009367-Dagda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Consistently, we found that DJ-1 KO cells display both, a decrease in mitochondrial ERK2 activation and basal autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009367-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). In further support, the neuroprotective role of DJ-1 in terms of oxidative stress was recently found to be related to the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0009367-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Based on previous findings regarding the function of the DJ-1 protein and our present study, we suggest that DJ-1 might function in regulating cellular organelle homeostasis. Upon mitochondrial ROS production, DJ-1 quenches ROS levels <xref rid="pone.0009367-CanetAviles1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009367-Blackinton1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> thereby preventing cell death and preserving the integrity of mitochondria and lysosomes. Our findings suggest that loss of DJ-1 leads to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria characterized by increased intramitochondrial ROS levels and reduced MMP that under physiological conditions would be compensated by increased housekeeping-degradation of damaged organelles via autophagy. However, due to disturbed autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, as demonstrated by lysosomal alterations that include a reduction of lysosomal activity and of basal auophagy levels, and the appearance of multilamellar lysosome-like intracellular bodies, mitochondrial dynamics shift to reduced connectivity. On this basis it will be of great interest to define the regulative signaling cascades, such as the ERK pathway, that modulate the function of DJ-1 in maintaining mitochondria and lysosomal homeostasis.</p>
