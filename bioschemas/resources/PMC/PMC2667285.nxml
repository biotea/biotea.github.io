      <abstract>
        <p>An extensive proteinâprotein interaction network has been identified between proteins implicated in inherited ataxias. The protein sacsin, which is mutated in the early-onset neurodegenerative disease autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, is a node in this interactome. Here, we have established the neuronal expression of sacsin and functionally characterized domains of the 4579 amino acid protein. Sacsin is most highly expressed in large neurons, particularly within brain motor systems, including cerebellar Purkinje cells. Its subcellular localization in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was predominantly cytoplasmic with a mitochondrial component. We identified a putative ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain at the N-terminus of sacsin and demonstrated an interaction with the proteasome. Furthermore, sacsin contains a predicted J-domain, the defining feature of DnaJ/Hsp40 proteins. Using a bacterial complementation assay, the sacsin J-domain was demonstrated to be functional. The presence of both UbL and J-domains in sacsin suggests that it may integrate the ubiquitinâproteasome system and Hsp70 function to a specific cellular role. The Hsp70 chaperone machinery is an important component of the cellular response towards aggregation prone mutant proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore investigated the effects of siRNA-mediated sacsin knockdown on polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1. Importantly, <italic>SACS</italic> siRNA did not affect cell viability with GFP-ataxin-1[30Q], but enhanced the toxicity of GFP-ataxin-1[82Q], suggesting that sacsin is protective against mutant ataxin-1. Thus, sacsin is an ataxia protein and a regulator of the Hsp70 chaperone machinery that is implicated in the processing of other ataxia-linked proteins.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Causative genes have been identified for at least 45 inherited ataxias. These neurodegenerative disorders include autosomal dominant ataxias, such as the polyglutamine-mediated spinocerebellar ataxias, and the recessive diseases Friedreich's ataxia and autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C1">1</xref>).</p><p>Many of the proteins involved in inherited ataxias share common interacting partners indicating that they are functionally linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C2">2</xref>). Furthermore, although the clinical features of these conditions are variable there is substantial evidence for overlapping pathways of molecular pathogenesis in some forms of ataxia. These include perturbations in normal protein homeostasis that invoke cellular responses from both molecular chaperone and ubiquitinâproteasome systems (UPS).</p><p>Hsp70 molecular chaperone networks are associated with neurodegenerative diseases where protein conformational changes and subsequent aberrant protein folding are a feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C3">3</xref>). The pathogenesis of these conditions usually includes the formation of deposits of misfolded ubiquitylated protein with which Hsp70 and Hsp40/DnaJ proteins are frequently associated. Hsp70 and its co-chaperones, particularly Hsp40 proteins, have also been recognized as potent modulators of protein aggregation and survival in cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C3">3</xref>).</p><p>The Hsp70 molecular chaperone machine also functions in targeting proteins to the UPS for degradation. For example, the co-chaperone CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), which regulates Hsp70 chaperone activity and acts as an ubiquitin ligase for Hsp70 clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C4">4</xref>), has been shown to interact with ataxia proteins such as ataxin-1, thereby modulating their solubility and degradation.</p><p>ARSACS (OMIM: 270550) is characterized by early-onset spastic ataxia. Pathological features include atrophy of the upper cerebellar vermis and absence of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C5">5</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>SACS</italic> gene were identified as causing ARSACS in a Canadian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C6">6</xref>). Subsequent genetic studies indicate that this form of spastic ataxia may be far more common than originally presumed and have a global distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C7">7</xref>). Initially, the <italic>SACS</italic> gene was reported to consist of one 12 794 bp exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C6">6</xref>), in which homozygous missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations have been found. Recently, further mutations have been reported in newly identified 5â² exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C8">8</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>SACS</italic> gene is predicted to encode a large multidomain protein, sacsin, which has regions of sequence similarity to several proteins. The strongest similarity identified was between a region near the C-terminus of sacsin and the J-domain of Hsp40 proteins (approximately 60% identity over 30 residues compared with Hsp40/Hdj1). The highly conserved J-domain is the defining feature of the Hsp40 family of Hsp70 co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C9">9</xref>). Therefore, sacsin may represent a direct link between ataxia and the Hsp70 machinery.</p><p>This study represents the first characterization of sacsin. We have defined the localization of the sacsin protein in brain. The data show that sacsin has nine coding exons. We identified a ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain at the N-terminus of sacsin that can interact with the proteasome. Furthermore, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay to demonstrate that the J-domain of sacsin is functional. Finally, sacsin knockdown resulted in a reduction in cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1, which correlated with a loss of cells with large nuclear ataxin-1 inclusions. Together these data suggest that the large multi-domain sacsin protein is able to recruit Hsp70 chaperone action and has the potential to regulate the effects of other ataxia proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sacsin is expressed in the cell bodies and processes of neurons</title><p>The human <italic>SACS</italic> gene was initially reported to contain a single massive exon encoding a 11.5 kb open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C6">6</xref>). Subsequently eight additional 5â² putative coding exons have been annotated. We confirmed that the human gene transcribed a 9 exon transcript, which is predicted to code a 4579 amino acid protein (NM_014363.4), by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTâPCR) analysis of human brain mRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp067/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). In mouse, a sacsin isoform of 4579 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 520 kDa, is also predicted (UniProt accession number: Q9JC8).</p><p>To analyse the expression and localization of sacsin we developed an antiserum (<italic>r</italic>-sacsin<sup>1â17</sup>) to the N-terminus of sacsin and an antiserum (<italic>r</italic>-sacsin<sup>4489â4503</sup>) to a peptide sequence, which is located near the C-terminus. Western analysis of mouse and rat tissues with <italic>r</italic>-sacsin<sup>4489â4503</sup> detected a specific band of approximately 520 kDa in brain which was competed with immunizing peptide (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>A and B). <italic>r</italic>-Sacsin<sup>1â17</sup> was unsuitable for western blotting (not shown).</p><fig id="DDP067F1" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 1.</label><caption><p>Sacsin is predominantly expressed in the cell bodies and processes of neurons.

There was a strong correlation between the localization of immunoreactivity and <italic>SACS</italic> mRNA at the cellular level (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>). Expression appeared predominantly, if not exclusively neuronal, with sacsin protein localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies and processes including both dendrites and axons, the latter as evidenced by axonal tract labelling. Examination of sections with dual-label immunofluorescence histochemistry for <italic>r</italic>-sacsin<sup>4489â4503</sup> and NeuN, a neuron-specific marker that labels most neuronal cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C10">10</xref>), confirmed that all NeuN-positive neurons expressed detectable levels of sacsin protein (data not shown), therefore, there were no clear examples of sacsin-negative neurons.</p><p>In the forebrain, cerebral cortex expression of <italic>SACS</italic> mRNA and sacsin protein was abundant with large layer 5 corticospinal neurons expressing the highest levels (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>C and D). Neuropil labelling for sacsin immunoreactivity was prominent in the striatum and fibre tracts, such as the anterior commissure, exhibited fine labelling (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>E). In the thalamus expression levels for both mRNA and protein varied between nuclei with the anterodorsal nucleus showing highest expression (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>FâH).</p><p>In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells had the highest levels of expression of both <italic>SACS</italic> mRNA and sacsin protein. The molecular layer with Purkinje cell dendrites and contacting afferents was clearly stained for sacsin protein (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>IâK).</p><p>Between the forebrain and brainstem, an almost continuous band of large neurons expressing high levels of <italic>SACS</italic> mRNA and sacsin protein extended from the basal forebrain magnocellular system through the zona incerta and pontine and medullary reticular formation (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>L and M). Neurons of precerebellar nuclei including the red, pontine, vestibular and lateral reticular nuclei as well as cranial motor nuclei had relatively high levels of expression (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP067F1">1</xref>MâO).

UbL domains are present in ubiquitin-like proteins (such as NEDD8 and SUMO-1) and in a variety of other multidomain proteins of diverse biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C11">11</xref>). Many of these proteins have been shown to bind components of the proteasome via their UbL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C11">11</xref>). These include the DNA repair protein Rad23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C12">12</xref>), which has an N-terminal UbL domain with 43% identity over 65 residues to the putative sacsin UbL.

However, data presented in this study are consistent with a <italic>SACS</italic> mRNA, derived from a nine-exon gene, expressing a 4579 amino acid sacsin isoform, with a molecular weight of 520 kDa. This is in agreement with the recent identification of ARSACS mutations in exons 6, 7 and 8 of <italic>SACS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C8">8</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that sacsin is widely expressed in the brain. <italic>SACS</italic> message and sacsin protein were expressed at high levels in Purkinje cells. Consistent with this, cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration is a common pathology of ataxias, including ARSACS. Precerebellar nuclei which project afferent processes to the cerebellum also had significant expression of sacsin suggesting that input to the cerebellum could also be affected by altered sacsin function. Corticospinal tract and peripheral nerve axonal degeneration and changes in myelination and conductance are reported in ARSACS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C5">5</xref>). Interestingly, neurons contributing to the corticospinal tract and cranial motoneurones express high levels of sacsin and axons contain sacsin immunoreactivity.</p><p>Very large proteins, such as sacsin, are extremely difficult to express heterologously. Therefore, to elucidate the cellular role of sacsin we have adopted a strategy of analysing the function of specific domains and siRNA. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the N-terminus of human sacsin contains a putative UbL domain. This domain co-immunoprecipitated with the 20S proteasomal subunit and thus can occur in a complex with the proteasome, possibly interacting with it directly. Interestingly, a number of proteins that function in the UPS are linked to ataxias. These include ataxin-3, which contains a ubiqutin interaction motif (UIM) and functions as a de-ubiquitinating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C24">24</xref>). Furthermore, a number of proteinâprotein interactions have been observed between UbL and UIM domain proteins. For example, the UbL domain protein PLIC-1, which is a component of the quality control machinery that regulates protein aggregation, is able to interact with both the proteasome and some UIM domain proteins, including ataxin-3 and HSJ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C25">25</xref>). Thus, it is possible that sacsin may also interact with UIM-containing proteins.</p><p>The human proteome contains 12 Hsp70 family members, the activity of which is regulated by numerous co-chaperones, including nearly 50 Hsp40 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C26">26</xref>). Hsp70 switches from a low substrate affinity when bound to ATP, to a high affinity state upon the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C27">27</xref>). This cycle is regulated by Hsp70 co-chaperones and in particular Hsp40 proteins, which interact with Hsp70 via the J-domain, stimulating ATP hydrolysis and altering substrate-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C27">27</xref>). Importantly, Hsp40 proteins act to recruit the Hsp70 machinery to specific cellular locales and functions. We demonstrated that the sacsin J-domain is able to function with the <italic>E. coli</italic> Hsp70, DnaK, thus confirming that sacsin is a type III Hsp40 protein and supporting an alternative Hsp40 family member designation of DNAJC29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C26">26</xref>). As a component of the sacsin staining was observed to be associated with mitochondrial markers, sacsin could potentially recruit a Hsp70 to specific function at the surface of mitochondria. It will be important to establish with which Hsp70 partners sacsin functions <italic>in vivo</italic> to further understand its cellular role. Particularly, as although the Arg4331Gln change, which was reported as a compound heterozygous sacsin mutation, did not affect the ability of the sacsin J-domain to function with the <italic>E. coli</italic> Hsp70, DnaK, it may inhibit the ability of the sacsin J-domain to stimulate the ATPase activity of other Hsp70 proteins. Interestingly, in addition to its J-domain, sacsin also contains multiple regions of homology to Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C6">6</xref>), further suggesting a possible chaperone function.</p><p>We observed a significant enhancement in the toxicity of GFP-ataxin-1[82Q] when sacsin levels were reduced by siRNA. This reduction in cell number correlated with the loss of cells with the large nuclear inclusion phenotype from the population. These data suggest that sacsin is protective against polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1 toxicity. Interestingly, the overall level of GFP-ataxin-1[82Q], detected by western blot analysis of cell lysates, was not significantly altered after sacsin knockdown, even though there was a reduction in the number of cells with detectable GFP signal. This implies that the remaining cells have higher levels of GFP-ataxin-1[82Q] and may indicate a role for sacsin in the degradation of aberrantly folded ataxin-1.</p><p>The dynamics of ataxin-1 inclusion formation is controversial. Ataxin-1 nuclear inclusion formation has been shown to be dependent on RNA-binding. Wild-type ataxin-1, has been reported to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas the polyglutamine-expanded mutant protein cannot shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C28">28</xref>). This suggests a gain of function of the mutant protein such as retention of associated RNAs or proteins within the nucleus. Conversely, it has also been reported that polyglutamine expansion does not affect nuclear shuttling, but enhances the intracellular kinetics of ataxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C29">29</xref>). Inhibition of the proteasome leads to the apparent fusion of ataxin-1 nuclear inclusions and an increase in their size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C28">28</xref>), while the type I Hsp40 protein HDJ-2/DnaJA1 has been reported to suppress ataxin-1 aggregation and is localized to inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C30">30</xref>). It is unknown if sacsin's localization to ataxin-1-[Q82] inclusions, and effect on their incidence, is dependent on its J-domain, or UBL domain, or if it requires sacsin to bind ataxin-1 as a chaperone.</p><p>A recent study undertook a yeast two-hybrid-based screen to develop a proteinâprotein interaction network for proteins involved in inherited ataxias and disorders of Purkinje cell degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C2">2</xref>). The C-terminal region of sacsin was found to share four interacting partners with other ataxia proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C2">2</xref>). The best studied of these is PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase), which was identified as binding ataxin-7, PRKCG, aprataxin and frataxin. Interestingly, frataxin, mutations in which cause the autosomal recessive disease Friedreich's ataxia, is also targeted to mitochondria. The recruitment of sacsin to polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1 intranuclear inclusions and the disappearance of cells with these inclusions, when sacsin levels are reduced by siRNA, further points to sacsin being in common cellular pathways with other ataxia proteins.</p><p>Type I and II Hsp40 proteins predominantly act to stimulate Hsp70 general protein folding function, while type III Hsp40 proteins recruit Hsp70s to specialized roles. Sacsin's large size and multiple domains suggest that it may have additional cellular roles to protecting against mutant ataxin-1 expression. We hypothesize that sacsin may act as a molecular scaffold for assembly of a specific protein complex and that regulation of this complex requires integration of molecular chaperone machinery and the UPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sacsin antibody generation and characterization</title><p>Two rabbit antisera were raised against the human sacsin peptides DYAVRGKSDKDVKPT (amino acid residues 4489â4503) and METKENRWVPVTVLPGC (amino acid residues 1â17) conjugated to KLH.

UbL domain mutations L58/D60A and R50A/L51A were introduced to this construct by site-directed mutagenesis. CHO-1 cells transiently transfected with constructs expressing sacsin<sup>1â124</sup>-FLAG or HSJ1-FLAG, which was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP067C14">14</xref>), were harvested in 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris HCl pH 7.4, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors.
