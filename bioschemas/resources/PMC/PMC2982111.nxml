      <abstract>
        <p>Nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK), a multi-functional cytoskeletal protein critical to vascular homeostasis, is highly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. We identified multiple novel c-Ablâmediated nmMLCK phosphorylation sites by mass spectroscopy analysis (including Y<sup>231</sup>, Y<sup>464</sup>, Y<sup>556</sup>, Y<sup>846</sup>) and examined their influence on nmMLCK function and human lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier regulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of nmMLCK increased kinase activity, reversed nmMLCK-mediated inhibition of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, and enhanced binding to the critical actin-binding phosphotyrosine protein, cortactin. EC challenge with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent barrier-enhancing agonist, resulted in c-Abl and phosphorylated nmMLCK recruitment into caveolin-enriched microdomains, rapid increases in Abl kinase activity, and spatial targeting of c-Abl to barrier-promoting cortical actin structures. Conversely, reduced c-Abl expression in EC (siRNA) markedly attenuated S1P-mediated cortical actin formation, reduced the EC modulus of elasticity (assessed by atomic force microscopy), reduced nmMLCK and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation, and attenuated S1P-mediated barrier enhancement. These studies indicate an essential role for Abl kinase in vascular barrier regulation via posttranslational modification of nmMLCK and strongly support c-Abl-cortactin-nmMLCK interaction as a novel determinant of cortical actin-based cytoskeletal rearrangement critical to S1P-mediated EC barrier enhancement.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The EC cytoskeleton is a dynamic, functionally complex, spatially-targeted contractile structure responsible for cellular responses to external stimuli, bioactive agonists, and mechanical stress. In the lung microcirculation, the Ca<sup>+2</sup>/calmodulin-dependent nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK) isoform, a critical actin-binding protein and driver of actin cytoskeletal rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kamm and Stull, 2001</xref>), is required for the regulation of fluid flow, trafficking of inflammatory cells into the lung parenchyma, and alterations in vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Tinsley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dudek and Garcia, 2001</xref>). During acute inflammatory lung injury, nmMLCK activation by contractile agonists results in ratcheting of actin and myosin bonds catalyzed by myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation on Ser<sup>19</sup> and Thr<sup>18</sup>, resulting in spatially-localized actomyosin contraction via formation of barrier-disrupting cytoplasmic stress fibers and increases in paracellular gaps culminating in profound increases in vascular permeability, a defining feature of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Birukov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Birukova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Strategies that reduce nmMLCK activity serve to eliminate edemagenic agonistâinduced EC contraction and reduce inflammation-mediated permeability in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Wainwright <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and significantly attenuate leukocyte diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Consistent with the role of nmMLCK in inflammatory processes, several polymorphisms in the nmMLCK gene (<italic>MYLK</italic>) are highly associated with susceptibility to acute inflammatory states such as acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Flores <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to participation in inflammatory states after edema-promoting agonists, the nmMLCK isoform is also essential to vascular barrier protection, produced by barrier-enhancing or barrier-restoring agonists such as sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), by driving spatially-distinct rapid and dramatic increases in actin polymerization and MLC phosphorylation confined to lamellipodia membrane protrusions and the cortical actin ring. Together these activities serve to close inflammation-mediated paracellular gaps and restore barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This dual role for nmMLCK in barrier regulation highlights the need for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying spatially-specific cytoskeletal rearrangement and dynamic intracellular targeting of this key multi-functional enzyme, studies which greatly impact upon vascular barrier regulation.</p><p>In prior work, we demonstrated that spatially-distributed nmMLCK responses (kinase activity and cytoskeletal protein interactions) are differentially regulated by both Ser/Thr and Tyr nmMLCK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Birukov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). For example, cAMP-dependent protein kinase Aâmediated nmMLCK phosphorylation exerts paradoxical effects on kinase activity depending on the exact sites of Ser/Thr phosphorylation (within the unique nmMLCK N terminus, the putative SH3-binding domains, or Ca<sup>+2</sup>/calmodulin binding region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009a</xref>). We previously identified nmMLCK tyrosine phosphorylation catalyzed by pp60src occurring in the context of barrier disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) but also during EC barrier recovery or after barrier-enhancing stimuli (such as S1P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>). These studies demonstrated that pp60srcâmediated nmMLCK phosphorylation at Y<sup>464</sup> and Y<sup>471</sup> results in a threefold increase in MLC kinase enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Birukov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of Tyr phosphatase activity in EC monolayers evoked significant nmMLCK phosphotyrosine accumulation, increased nmMLCK kinase activity, EC contraction, and EC barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). These studies indicated differential regulation of nmMLCK splice variants by Tyr phosphorylation and implicated NH<sub>2</sub> terminal SH2- and SH3-binding domains (including an SH2-binding domain containing phosphorylated Y<sup>464</sup>) may regulate nmMLCK interactions with other cytoskeletal regulatory proteins.</p><p>In proteomic explorations of key barrier-regulatory proteins recruited to caveolin-rich EC lipid raft microdomains, essential for EC barrier protection after barrier protective agonists such as S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Singleton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), we noted a significant increase in lipid raft tyrosine phosphoproteins including the actin-binding tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, and nmMLCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>). The role of c-Abl and its target effectors in EC are unknown; however, given the central role of nmMLCK in EC barrier regulation, we speculated that the interaction between c-Abl and nmMLCK may be a key signaling event affecting lamellipodial formation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and focal adhesion dynamics, events which regulate EC barrier permeability. In the current study, we define the functional consequences of nmMLCK phosphorylation by c-Abl tyrosine kinase and examined the influence of these posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on nmMLCK responses. Our results indicate that Abl catalyzes site-specific nmMLCK phosphorylation (including Y<sup>231</sup>, Y<sup>464</sup>, Y<sup>556</sup>, Y<sup>846</sup>) resulting in significant alterations in nmMLCK function and cytoskeletal dynamics within barrier-promoting cortical actin structures. Abl activation and nmMLCK modification is essential for full EC barrier-enhancement elicited by S1P. These integrated translational studies provide mechanistic insights into vascular pathobiology, cytoskeletal regulation of EC barrier function, and the development of novel edema-reducing therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and Antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, reagents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Subconfluent ECs allow for better visualization of lamellipodia and peripheral actin structures because of the overlap between adjacent cells in a confluent monolayer. However, EC responses to S1P may differ somewhat in these two states, and therefore colocalization analysis of c-Abl and F-actin was also performed in confluent pulmonary ECs. Preliminary experiments revealed that that endogenous c-Abl immunofluorescent staining was insufficient for ICQ analysis in the periphery of these confluent cells. As a result, transfected GFP-labeled c-Abl was used to provide a stronger signal for ICQ colocalization analysis with F-actin. The results confirm the findings observed in subconfluent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) and demonstrate increased peripheral localization between c-Abl and F-actin after S1P (Supplemental Figure 4).

Interestingly, mean ICQ values across multiple cells for these conditions are all near zero, which is indicative of only random colocalization. There is a trend toward increased colocalization between c-Abl and VE-cadherin 30 min after S1P, but it does not reach statistical significance.

We have previously used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize structural and mechanical changes in the F-actin cytoskeleton of cultured ECs in response to both barrier-enhancing (induced by S1P) and barrier-disrupting (induced by thrombin) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arce <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). These AFM elasticity measurements suggested differential effects: for the barrier-protecting molecule S1P, the elastic modulus was elevated significantly on the periphery, whereas thrombin induced significant elevation of the elastic modulus in the central region of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arce <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). These prior experiments were limited by use of fixed EC, potentially obscuring the measurement of subtle changes in structure and elasticity. Therefore, in the current study, the elasticity distributions in living ECs were dynamically determined using AFM force mapping techniques, an approach which allows each individual cell to function as its own control before agonist stimulation. The distribution of elastic moduli (indicative of cell resistance to deformation induced by the AFM cantilever) from the nuclei to the periphery of the cells was analyzed for individual control siRNA-transfected ECs, as well as c-Ablâsilenced ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A). Whereas the normalized elastic modulus increases by â¼30% across this area in control EC after S1P stimulation, in c-Ablâsilenced ECs, this increase is significantly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>B). These highly sensitive measurements of living ECs are consistent with the model of EC barrier regulation via increased tethering forces generated during enhancement of peripheral actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Ingber, 1997</xref>) and demonstrate that c-Abl expressionâas we have previously demonstrated for cortactin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arce <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>)âis necessary for the structural changes that occur in association with EC barrier enhancement.</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Effect of c-Abl kinase silencing on S1Pâmediated increase in elastic modulus.

The full-length nmMLCK gene transcript is â¼210 kDa and is the only isoform expressed in human pulmonary EC, whereas the shorter â¼108-kDa smMLCK is preferentially expressed in smooth muscle. Both smMLCK and nmMLCK isoforms exhibit robust MLC kinase activity with a major distinguishing feature being the 922aa N-terminal stretch in nmMLCK which exhibits distinct cellular functions through unique interactions with other contractile proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) confirmed by studies using mice with selective knockout of the nmMLCK isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Wainwright <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). We have demonstrated nmMLCK as a key participant in the inflammatory response and regulation of vascular integrity and leukocyte influx into lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).

The pp60src-mediated nmMLCK1 phosphorylation sites at Y<sup>464</sup> and Y<sup>471</sup> lie within a region encoded by exon 11, which is deleted in the nmMLCK2 isoform variant generated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Lazar and Garcia, 1999</xref>) and results in a threefold increase in nmMLCK1 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Birukov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Inhibition of Tyr phosphatase activity evoked significant nmMLCK phosphotyrosine accumulation, increased nmMLCK kinase activity, and EC contraction and produced EC barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). These studies indicated differential regulation of nmMLCK splice variants by Tyr phosphorylation and implicated NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH2- and SH3-binding domains (including an SH2-binding domain containing Y<sup>464</sup>, Tyr phosphorylation) may regulate nmMLCK interactions with other cytoskeletal regulatory proteins.</p><p>In prior proteomic explorations of key barrier-regulatory proteins recruited to caveolin-rich EC lipid raft microdomains (obtained in response to S1P), we noted a significant increase in lipid raft tyrosine phosphoproteins including c-Abl tyrosine kinase, nmMLCK, and cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>). The role of c-Abl and its target effectors in ECs are unknown, however, given the central role of nmMLCK in EC barrier regulation, the interaction between c-Abl and nmMLCK may be a key signaling event affecting lamellipodia, cytoskeletal remodeling and focal adhesion dynamics, events which regulate EC barrier permeability. c-Abl is recognized to participate in membrane ruffling, cell spreading, cell migration, and neurite extension in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Woodring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) and cancer cells after HGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Frasca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), a potent inducer of EC cytoskeletal rearrangement and barrier enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, c-Abl is able to directly bind F-actin and interacts with a number of target effectors that regulate barrier-regulatory cytoskeletal structures including lamellipodia and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Woodring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Sossey-Alaoui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Kiely <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Given its reported capacity to interact directly or indirectly with these barrier-regulatory cytoskeletal structures, c-Abl is ideally positioned to participate in multiple pathways that determine vascular endothelial permeability. However, its role in barrier regulation remains unclear as prior studies have suggested both barrier enhancing and barrier disrupting effects of c-Abl activity. For example, in epithelial cells, c-Abl activity stimulated Rac GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Zandy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Zandy and Pendergast, 2008</xref>)âa central signaling effector in EC barrier regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Garcia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>)âto stabilize adherens junctions. Conversely in neurons, activated c-Abl weakened cadherin complexes by phosphorylating Î²-catenin at a specific site (Y<sup>489</sup>) which resulted in its release from these adherens junction complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Rhee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In addition, the Abl inhibitor STI571 (imantinib) attenuated both VEGF- and neuropeptide Yâinduced elevations of rat EC monolayer permeability in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Kurimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), suggesting that c-Abl participates in mediating endothelial barrier disruption by these agents.</p><p>In the current study, we sought to define the functional consequences of nmMLCK phosphorylation by c-Abl tyrosine kinase and examined the influence of c-Ablâmediated site-specific nmMLCK regulation via PTMs on nmMLCK responses using kinase and actin polymerization assays, protein binding assays, measurements of EC barrier function, sophisticated immunofluorescence analysis, and novel AFM live cell imaging. c-Abl produced site-specific nmMLCK phosphorylation (including Y<sup>231</sup>, Y<sup>464</sup>, Y<sup>556</sup>, Y<sup>846</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) resulting in significant increases in MLC kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), and nmMLCK binding to cytoskeletal proteins such as the actin-binding tyrosine phosphoprotein, cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). S1P stimulated a rapid increase in c-Abl kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and intracellular c-Abl demonstrated colocalization with barrier-promoting cortical actin structures after S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Reductions in c-Abl kinase (siRNA) resulted in marked attenuation of S1P-mediated EC barrier enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating an essential role for c-Abl kinase in vascular barrier regulation with nmMLCK representing one important intracellular target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>An important limitation of our data is that mass spectroscopy identification of c-Ablâcatalyzed phosphorylation sites on nmMLCK was obtained only from recombinant protein studies. Verification of these phosphorylation events is needed in nmMLCK isolated from pulmonary ECs to confirm that they represent actual cell signaling events. These mass spectroscopy studies are ongoing. Despite this limitation, in light of the data presented using the phospho-specific antibody for this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A), our results provide strong evidence that c-Abl phosphorylates the Y<sup>464</sup> residue on nmMLCK in pulmonary ECs.</p><p>Overall, our data indicate that after S1P nmMLCK is targeted to spatially-defined sites where other cytoskeletal components are aggregated and participate in EC signaling and barrier regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). We have shown that these important proteinâprotein interactions are altered by nmMLCK phosphorylation and have identified several novel proteins which bind nmMLCK including cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Wadgaonkar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and caspase 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Petrache <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Cortactin is an 80/85-kDa actin-binding protein and target for pp60src whose structure consists of a Pro- and Tyr-rich area which contains the major sites of pp60src phosphorylation, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), which is the site of nmMLCK binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Cortactin localizes in EC cortical structures and lamellipodia with Tyr phosphorylation, and SH3 domain binding, all necessary for optimal S1P-mediated EC barrier enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Using site-specific antibody and peptide studies, we defined aa #972-979 and aa #1019-1025 as sites of cortactin interaction within the nmMLCK actin-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Although recombinant nmMLCK-cortactin interaction in vitro failed to modulate nmMLCK enzymatic activity, both proteins are stably associated within the cortical actin ring and lamellipodia but not within stress fibers, suggesting cortactin may contribute to nmMLCK targeting to this cellular locale. Although the precise significance of this spatially-defined interaction is unknown, our work has demonstrated that the cortactin SH3 domain interaction with nmMLCK is required for the peripheral MLC phosphorylation induced by S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Cortactin activates the Arp2/3 complex at sites of peripheral cytoskeletal rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Uruno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). We now demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylation of nmMLCK reverses the ability of nmMLCK to down-regulate the enhancing effect of cortactin on Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). These intriguing findings suggest that the interactions of these three proteins, c-Abl, cortactin, and nmMLCK, may regulate the capacity for cortactin to cross-link and stabilize the cortical actin meshwork against depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Moreover, our data indicate that cortactin is itself rapidly phosphorylated on Y<sup>486</sup> by c-Abl in EC after S1P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Phosphorylation at this site (Y<sup>486</sup>) is necessary for optimal S1P-induced EC barrier enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dudek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and it has recently been described as an important target site for c-Abl during PDGF-induced dorsal wave formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Boyle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The precise effects of c-Abl phosphorylation on cortactin function are unclear, but the expression of both these proteins is essential for mediating the potent barrier-enhancing effects of S1P. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to correlate biophysical properties with cytoskeletal structural changes, we have previously demonstrated in fixed ECs that cortactin expression is required for S1P to induce peripheral elasticity changes that contribute to enhanced barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arce <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In the current study, we have advanced these AFM techniques to allow for dynamic measurement of biophysical properties in living cells and now demonstrate that c-Abl expression is also required for S1P to alter the elastic modulus across the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>These data lead us to hypothesize that c-Abl-cortactin-nmMLCK interaction is critical to the EC cytoskeletal rearrangement that promotes barrier integrity after S1P. Together these data strongly support c-Abl-cortactin-nmMLCK interaction as a novel determinant of cortical actin-based cytoskeletal rearrangement critical to S1P-mediated EC barrier enhancement. These integrated translational studies provide mechanistic insights into vascular pathobiology, cytoskeletal regulation of EC barrier function, and the development of novel edema-reducing therapies.</p></sec>
