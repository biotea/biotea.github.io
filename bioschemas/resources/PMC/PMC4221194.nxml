      <abstract>
        <p>The Angiogenin (<italic>ANG</italic>) gene is frequently mutated in patients suffering from the neurodegenerative disease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Most of the ALS-causing mutations in Angiogenin affect either its ribonucleolytic or nuclear translocation activity. Here we report the functional characterization of two previously uncharacterized missense mutations in Angiogenin - D22G and L35P. We predict the nature of loss-of-function(s) in these mutants through our previously established Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation extended to 100 ns, and show that the predictions are entirely validated through biochemical studies with wild-type and mutated proteins. Based on our studies, we provide a biological explanation for the loss-of-function of D22G-Angiogenin leading to ALS, and suggest that the L35P-Angiogenin mutation would probably cause ALS symptoms in individuals harboring this mutation. Our study thus highlights the strength of MD simulation-based predictions, and suggests that this method can be used for correlating mutations in Angiogenin or other effector proteins with ALS symptoms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrigâs disease, is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the preferential loss of motor neurons in the brain stem, motor cortex and spinal cord. As a result of this degenerative process, most patients die from paralysis and respiratory failure between 3â5 years of onset of symptoms <xref rid="pone.0111963-Redler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Hardiman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There is no primary, disease-halting therapy available for ALS at present; the only drug for treatment being an antiglutamatergic compound, riluzole, which extends the lifespan of ALS patients briefly, albeit without any improvement of symptoms.</p>
      <p>Mutations in a number of genes have been identified as causative factors for ALS. For example, missense mutations in genes such as <italic>SOD1</italic>, <italic>FUS</italic>/<italic>TLS</italic>, <italic>TARDBP</italic>, <italic>ANG</italic>, <italic>VAPB</italic>, <italic>DAO</italic>, <italic>OPTN</italic>, <italic>VCP</italic>, and a recently identified hexanucleotide-repeat expansion (GGGGCC) in <italic>C9ORF72</italic> have been documented to be ALS causative <xref rid="pone.0111963-Ferraiuolo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Renton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. One of the frequently mutated genes in ALS patients is <italic>ANG</italic>, which encodes a 14.1 kDa neuroprotective effector, Angiogenin <xref rid="pone.0111963-Greenway1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For execution of its essential neuroprotective functions â such as neovascularization, induction of angiogenesis, stimulation of neurite outgrowth and path finding, and protection of motor neurons from hypoxia-induced death, Angiogenin utilizes three distinct functional sites <xref rid="pone.0111963-Kishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The first site, a catalytic triad comprising residues His13, Lys40 and His114, is responsible for its ribonucleolytic activity; the second site, a nuclear localization signal <sup>29</sup>IMRRRGL<sup>35</sup>, helps in nuclear translocation of Angiogenin and resultant ribosomal biogenesis, protein translation and cell proliferation; while the third site, <sup>60</sup>NKNGNPHREN<sup>68</sup>
<sub>,</sub> acts as a receptor-binding site, allowing binding of angiogenin to motor neurons and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It has been shown previously that mutations which affect either the ribonucleolytic activity or the nuclear translocation activity of Angiogenin can cause ALS <xref rid="pone.0111963-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Crabtree1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A total of 29 mutations in <italic>ANG</italic> have been identified in ALS patients so far, of which 19 missense mutations have been correlated with alterations in the functionality of Angiogenin, and consequent ALS symptoms <xref rid="pone.0111963-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Vasaikar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>

      <p>We have previously reported a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation methodology based on certain structural and dynamic attributes, using which the loss-of-function(s) of ALS associated Angiogenin mutations can be effectively predicted <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We showed that while the loss of ribonucleolytic activity of Angiogenin is possibly due to a characteristic conformational switching of the catalytic residue His114, the loss of nuclear translocation activity is due to the local folding of nuclear localization signal residues <sup>31</sup>RRR<sup>33</sup>, resulting in reduction of solvent accessible surface area (SASA). Some of our predictions were experimentally corroborated later, which has encouraged us to validate our predictions for uncharacterized mutants of Angiogenin <xref rid="pone.0111963-Thiyagarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here we demonstrate, side-by-side, MD simulation-based predictions for loss-of-function mutations in Angiogenin and corroborating experimental evidence. One of the mutations, âD22Gâ, has been detected in a large United States ALS-phenotype cohort <xref rid="pone.0111963-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A second mutation, âL35Pâ, arising through a T195C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has not yet been clinically correlated with ALS <xref rid="pone.0111963-Ueki1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our loss-of-function results for these mutations in Angiogenin perfectly match our MD simulation-based predictions, suggesting the proposed molecular mechanism(s) obtained from simulations are accountable for loss of ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities.</p>

        <title>Molecular modeling and MD simulations of wild-type and mutated Angiogenin</title>
        <p>The crystal structure of human Angiogenin (PDB: 1B1I) was used as the starting point. The heteroatoms (crystallographic waters and cofactor, CIT) were removed from the structure before simulation. The Angiogenin proteins containing D22G and L35P mutations were prepared <italic>in silico</italic> by replacing the target amino acid residues with the desired ones, while keeping the secondary structures intact. All simulations were performed using energy minimizations, followed by gradual heating of the system. Each system was initially minimized employing 2500 steps of steepest descent followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. Topology and parameter files for the protein were generated using the âff99SBâ force field <xref rid="pone.0111963-Hornak1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. All hydrogen atoms were added using the Xleap tool of AMBER 11 <xref rid="pone.0111963-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The system was solvated in an octahedral box of TIP3P water with â¼10 Ã between the protein surface and the box boundary. The free protein was neutralized by adding Clâ counter ions for individual models. The SANDER module of AMBER 11 package was used for all the MD simulations <xref rid="pone.0111963-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As described in our previous report <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, all the MD simulations were performed for 100 ns in isothermal isobaric ensemble (NPT). MD simulations were carried out with periodic boundary conditions and using the Berendsen temperature coupling <xref rid="pone.0111963-Berendsen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The algorithm SHAKE was applied to fix all covalent bonds containing hydrogen atoms <xref rid="pone.0111963-Ryckaert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The particle-mesh-Ewald (PME) method was used for treating the long-range electrostatic interactions. Simulation of Angiogenin with a tag containing the Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) and hexa-histidine moieties was carried out in AMBER 11. The initial tagged structure was predicted and generated using the Bhageerath-H and I-TASSER protein structure prediction servers <xref rid="pone.0111963-Dhingra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The lowest energy structure obtained from these prediction servers was used for a 50 ns long MD simulation. MD simulations were performed on a single graphics processing unit (GPU) card, installed at the Supercomputing Facility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/">http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/</ext-link>) of Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.</p>

        <title>Cloning, expression and purification of wild-type and mutated Angiogenin</title>
        <p>The cDNA for human <italic>ANG</italic> gene (369 bp) was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pCMV6-XL4 (OriGene) and eventually cloned in the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector pGEX-6P-2 (GE-Healthcare), with a C-terminal hexa-histidine His-tag. The point mutations -D22G and L35P- were generated in <italic>ANG</italic> through site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Protein expression was induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells by addition of 1 mM Isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma), at an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Cells were harvested 4 hours post-induction, and cell pellets were disrupted by the addition of lysozyme (Sigma), followed by sonication (Branson sonifier 250, Netherlands). Following centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 hour, the Angiogenin-GST fusion proteins were recovered in the soluble fraction. Purification of wild-type and mutated proteins was performed through standard Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity-based purification procedure (Qiagen). Fractions containing eluted fusion proteins were pooled, dialyzed and concentrated, before being further purified through size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The concentration of wild-type and mutant proteins was determined using an extinction coefficient of 54945 M<sup>â1 </sup>cm<sup>â1</sup> at 280 nm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/protparam/">http://web.expasy.org/protparam/</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Ribonucleolytic activity of wild-type and mutated Angiogenin</title>
        <p>The ribonucleolytic activity of purified wild-type and mutated proteins were examined using yeast transfer RNA (tRNA) as substrate. 0.05â0.5 mg/ml of wild-type and mutant Angiogenin-GST proteins were added to a 300 Âµl assay mixture containing 0.6 mg yeast tRNA (Sigma), 30 Âµg RNase-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 30 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 6.8 (MP Biomedicals), and 30 mM sodium chloride (Sigma), and the assay mixtures were incubated for 2 hours at 37Â°C. Subsequently, 700 Âµl of 3.4% pre-chilled, ice-cold perchloric acid (Sigma) was added to assay mixtures to terminate the reactions. The mixtures were then rigorously vortexed, incubated on ice for 15 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4Â°C. The supernatants were collected, and their absorbance measured at 260 nm. The percentage loss of ribonucleolytic activity was calculated by considering the amount of mutated proteins required to generate 1.0 optical density (OD), keeping wild-type Angiogenin-GST as reference. RNAse-free water (Gibco) was used for preparing the buffers and assay mixtures to ensure RNAse-free systems. Experiments were done in triplicates.</p>

Our previous MD simulation results showed that both D22G and L35P Angiogenin mutants exhibit a characteristic conformational switching of the catalytic residue His114 by 99Â° from its native position <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We extended our previous MD simulations to 100 ns, and found that both mutants retained the His114 conformational switching during the longer simulations as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g002">Figures 2Aâ2C</xref>), while wild-type Angiogenin did not demonstrate any alteration within the catalytic triad. The HA-CA-CB-CG dihedral angle of His114 was measured during the course of simulations and it was observed that the dihedral angle changed from the mean â80Â° position of the wild-type Angiogenin and assumed a new dihedral orientation of â179Â° for D22G and L35P mutants <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Of the two mutants, the conformational switching of His114 was most severe in the D22G mutant. Our previous results using molecular docking experiments have indicated that this conformational switching of His114 is probably responsible for the loss of ribonucleolytic activity of Angiogenin. In the altered conformation, His114 is unable to form hydrogen bond interaction and salt-bridge with NCI-65828 (a known inhibitor of the ribonucleolytic activity of Angiogenin), while in the native conformation, a strong interaction with the inhibitor results in higher binding energy score <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Jenkins1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, based on the MD simulations of the D22G and L35P Angiogenin mutants, we predicted that both will demonstrate loss of ribonucleolytic activity, with the loss being more severe in the D22G mutant.</p>

      <p>Further, our 100 ns MD simulation showed dynamic alteration in residues <sup>31</sup>RRR<sup>33</sup> of the L35P mutant. Due to local folding, this region became less accessible to solvent in the L35P mutant, resulting in reduction of SASA <xref rid="pone.0111963-Vasaikar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g002">Figures 2Dâ2F</xref>). Wild-type Angiogenin and the D22G mutant retained an open conformation and loose packing of <sup>31</sup>RRR<sup>33</sup> residues during the simulations. Since the three successive Arginine residues (31â33) are known to play a pivotal role in the nuclear translocation activity of Angiogenin <xref rid="pone.0111963-Moroianu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Moroianu2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, we predicted that a decrease in SASA in this region will result in a loss of nuclear translocation activity of the L35P mutant.</p>
      <p>In order to confirm our predictions, we generated GST-tagged constructs of wild-type Angiogenin, D22G and L35P mutants, with C-terminus His-tags. While the GST tag was required to generate Angiogenin in the soluble form in a bacterial expression system, the His-tags were included for ease of purification. The proteins were purified to &gt;95% homogeneity through Ni-NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), where they eluted as dimers with approximate molecular weights of 80 kDa (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111963.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Initial characterization of the purified proteins was carried out through circular dichroic spectroscopy. It was observed that the far-UV CD spectra of the mutants were largely similar to that of wild-type Angiogenin-GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that the missense mutations did not significantly affect the secondary structure, overall stability or folding of Angiogenin-GST. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) profiles for D22G and L35P-Angiogenin also support our CD measurements, suggesting that the structural stability of the mutants was similar to that of wild-type Angiogenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g002">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g003">3B</xref>). In addition, MD simulation was carried out for wild-type Angiogenin conjugated with GST and a hexa-histidine His-tag, and it was observed that for the 50 ns duration of simulation, presence of the GST moiety did not affect the structural integrity or folding of Angiogenin, including its functional sites â the catalytic triad and nuclear localization signal residues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111963.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This indicated that the presence of GST- or His-tag will probably not interfere with the biochemical activity of Angiogenin.</p>

      <p>We first confirmed that the wild-type Angiogenin-GST is fully functional by comparing its ribonucleolytic activity with that of commercially available Ribonuclease A (Qiagen) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111963.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Subsequently, any loss-of-function in the mutants was established through comparison of their ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities with that of the GST-tagged wild-type Angiogenin. For detecting ribonucleolytic activity, equivalent amounts of wild-type and mutated Angiogenin proteins were added to a yeast tRNA substrate, the undigested tRNA precipitated by perchloric acid, and the acid soluble fragments quantified through spectroscopy. Our analyses showed that D22G and L35P-Angiogenin-GST proteins displayed 21% and 35% of the ribonucleolytic activity respectively as compared to wild-type Angiogenin-GST (considered 100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g003">Figures 3Câ3D</xref>). Free GST, purified similarly, and utilized in the same assay, did not show any ribonucleolytic activity. Thus, our experimental results were found to be in agreement with predictions from MD simulations, which showed that although residues D22 and L35 were located distal from the catalytic triad, mutations in these residues could potentially perturb the ribonucleolytic activity of Angiogenin. Since it is established that loss of ribonucleolytic activity in Angiogenin results in abolishment of angiogenic activity, neurite outgrowth, pathfinding and several other crucial biological functions <xref rid="pone.0111963-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, it is therefore expected that D22G and L35P mutations in Angiogenin will possibly cause ALS symptoms.</p>
      <p>The nuclear translocation abilities of D22G and L35P mutants were investigated through immunofluorescence assays. 2 Âµg/ml each of wild-type and mutated Angiogenin proteins were added to cultured HeLa cells. The fixed and permeabilized cells were stained with an anti-Angiogenin monoclonal antibody, coupled with an Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG labeled secondary antibody, while the nuclei were counter-stained with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dihydrochloride. Untreated HeLa cells showed negligible staining for Angiogenin (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111963.s004">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that minor quantities of endogenous protein is produced by the cells, and the immunofluorescence detected in treated cells corresponds primarily to the extraneously added Angiogenin protein. We observed that wild-type and D22G mutant distinctly translocated into the nucleus, while the L35P mutant remained primarily in the cytoplasm, and almost no localization to the nucleus was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the results of the nuclear translocation assays were also consistant with predictions from our MD simulations, where conversion of L35 to P35 in Angiogenin resulted in the local folding of the nuclear localization signal residues <sup>31</sup>RRR<sup>33</sup> and consequent reduction of SASA, indicating potential abrogation of nuclear translocation.</p>

      <p>Previous studies have shown that in the nuclear localization signal <sup>29</sup>IMRRRGL<sup>35</sup>, the three consecutive Arginine residues <sup>31</sup>RRR<sup>33</sup> are critical in governing the nuclear translocation activity of Angiogenin <xref rid="pone.0111963-Moroianu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Moroianu2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In contrast to the L35P Angiogenin mutant, the D22G mutant was able to translocate into the nucleus as effectively as wild-type. Our simulation studies for D22G-Angiogenin clearly predicted no effect of this mutation on the conformation of the nuclear localization signal in Angiogenin.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation has been effectively utilized in addressing essential questions in basic and applied sciences. Simulation routines to probe ligand docking and protein conformational change have found valuable applications in the biomedical field for development of new inhibitors, drugs and vaccines. Here we suggest that this technique can also be successfully employed in predicting the probability of disease causation by investigating functional changes in well-characterized, disease-associated proteins, as a result of mutations detected in corresponding genes.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have functionally categorized, through MD simulations and biochemical assays, two previously uncharacterized mutants of Angiogenin. Since its discovery, the <italic>ANG</italic> gene, which codes for the neuroprotector Angiogenin, has emerged as one of the frequently mutated genes found in ALS patients <xref rid="pone.0111963-Greenway1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Kishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is well established in literature that there is a strong correlation between decreased ribonucleolytic or nuclear translocation activity in Angiogenin due to mutations, and ALS pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0111963-Greenway1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0111963-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In order to validate our MD simulation-based loss-of-function predictions in D22G and L35P Angiogenin, we generated wild-type and mutated Angiogenin as GST fusions in <italic>E. coli</italic>, since free Angiogenin localizes in inclusion bodies during bacterial expression <xref rid="pone.0111963-Thiyagarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We used purified GST-tagged proteins in all assays since wild-type Angiogenin-GST had ribonucleolytic activity similar to that exhibited by commercially available Ribonuclease A (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111963.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and demonstrated substantial nuclear localization in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We found that the nature of loss-of-function of the two mutants, as predicted by our MD simulation routine, is entirely corroborated by functional assays. The D22G mutant had significantly reduced ribonucleolytic activity compared to wild-type Angiogenin, as this mutant exhibited a characteristic conformational switching of catalytic residue His114 during simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g002">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g003">3Câ3D</xref>). The observation that only the catalytic residue His114 exhibited a conformational switching was interesting, because specific mutation of this residue was previously shown to cause a 3300-fold reduction in the ribonucleolytic activity of Angiogenin, while mutating other residues in the catalytic triad caused only 300-fold reduction in activity <xref rid="pone.0111963-Shapiro1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus, the ALS manifestation seen in patients harboring the D22G mutation in Angiogenin is presumably due to the reduction in ribonucleolytic activity. The L35P mutant also displayed the characteristic conformational switching of His114 during MD simulation, and the predicted loss of ribonucleolytic activity was confirmed experimentally. In both the D22G and L35P mutants, a conserved hydrogen bond interaction path exists from the sites of mutation to His114, mediated through Leu115 and Thr44/Leu115 respectively <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Padhi2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which is possibly a valid reason for conformational switching of His114.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the D22G mutant, however, the L35P mutant failed to localize in the nucleus of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This loss of nuclear translocation activity for L35P Angiogenin was also foretold by our simulation, based on the local folding of the nuclear localization signal residues <sup>31</sup>RRR<sup>33</sup> and consequent reduction of SASA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111963-g002">Figures 2Dâ2F</xref>). The L35P mutation, which is encoded by the T195C SNP, has been discovered in <italic>ANG</italic> but has not been clinically correlated with ALS so far. However, our finding for the L35P mutant is supported by data from publicly available resources. The F-SNP database <xref rid="pone.0111963-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111963-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which provides an integrated information about the functional effects of SNPs obtained from 16 bioinformatics tools and databases, classifies the T195C SNP, encoding the L35P mutation, as a deleterious mutation. The functional significance (FS) score for this SNP is 0.764; which indicates that this mutation might have a detrimental effect on the functionality of Angiogenin and is likely to cause ALS. Therefore, based on our simulation studies and functional analyses, we suggest that the occurrence of this SNP in the <italic>ANG</italic> gene is likely to result in manifestation of ALS symptoms in individuals. However, further genomic scans of ALS patients across diverse ethnic groups are required to map the association of the L35P mutation with ALS pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the strong correlation between the MD simulation based loss-of-function predictions and the functional substantiation data for Angiogenin mutants highlights the strength of the MD simulation methodology and the prediction of molecular attributes responsible for loss of ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities. Therefore, this report, in addition to our earlier studies, provides a promising methodology and validation platform for understanding the possible molecular origins of functional loss of newly identified Angiogenin mutations and their association with ALS pathophysiology.</p>
