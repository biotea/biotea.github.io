      <abstract>
        <p>CTCF is a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene with diverse normal functions in genome structure and gene regulation. However the mechanism by which CTCF haploinsufficiency contributes to cancer development is not well understood. CTCF is frequently mutated in endometrial cancer. Here we show that most CTCF mutations effectively result in CTCF haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated decay of mutant transcripts, or loss-of-function missense mutation. Conversely, we identified a recurrent CTCF mutation K365T, which alters a DNA binding residue, and acts as a gain-of-function mutation enhancing cell survival. CTCF genetic deletion occurs predominantly in poor prognosis serous subtype tumours, and this genetic deletion is associated with poor overall survival. In addition, we have shown that CTCF haploinsufficiency also occurs in poor prognosis endometrial clear cell carcinomas and has some association with endometrial cancer relapse and metastasis. Using shRNA targeting CTCF to recapitulate CTCF haploinsufficiency, we have identified a novel role for CTCF in the regulation of cellular polarity of endometrial glandular epithelium. Overall, we have identified two novel pro-tumorigenic roles (promoting cell survival and altering cell polarity) for genetic alterations of CTCF in endometrial cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Uterine malignancies represent the most prevalent gynaecological cancers in the developed world. These tumours are becoming an increasing health burden due to associations with increased body mass index, nulliparity and increased life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The majority (95%) of these tumours are endometrial carcinomas that originate from the endometrial glandular epithelium. The remaining 5% have a mesenchymal component such as endometrial stromal sarcoma or are mixed epithelial and stromal tumours such as adenosarcomas and carcinosarcomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Within endometrial carcinoma, the majority of tumours (~80%) are endometrioid adenocarcinomas, which are generally hormone-responsive, are typified by <italic>PTEN</italic> deletion, and carry a good prognosis. The next most common subtypes are serous carcinoma (5â10%) and clear cell carcinoma (&lt;5%), which are generally non-hormone-responsive and associated with a poorer prognosis. Additionally, serous tumours often carry <italic>TP53</italic> mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Rarer subtypes include mucinous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and mixed carcinoma which by definition contains at least two histological cell types such as endometrioid and serous carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Cancer genome sequencing studies focusing on large patient cohorts of specific cancers are revealing the molecular genetic landscapes of tumours. Recently, we showed that endometrioid tumours had frequent mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>ARID1A</italic>, <italic>ARID5B</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> We also discovered that <italic>CTCF,</italic> encoding the chromatin organising protein CTCF is mutated in about one quarter of endometrial carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> This was verified in independent endometrial cancer cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Importantly, of 127 significantly mutated genes (SMGs) in 12 different cancers, <italic>CTCF</italic> was identified as an SMG in endometrial cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup>
<italic>CTCF</italic> mutations have also been identified at similar or lower frequencies in other tumour types including breast and prostate cancer, Wilmsâ tumour and leukaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> A CTCF mutation has been identified at relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> indicating a potential role for CTCF mutation in tumour relapse. Specific mutations in the zinc finger (ZF) domain of CTCF result in reduced or abrogated CTCF DNA binding activity at certain cognate target sites, but not others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>CTCF is an 11-ZF DNA binding protein that has been named the 'master weaver of the genome'<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> due to its diverse functions in the regulation of chromatin structure and function including: inter- and intra- chromosomal interactions, gene regulation, nucleosome positioning, gene insulation, genetic imprinting, demarcation of lamina associated domains, X-chromosome inactivation, alternative splicing and telomere elongation (reviewed in Marshall <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>). We first showed that CTCF can repress cell growth and colony formation suggesting a tumour suppressor function for CTCF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In addition, CTCF expression also confers a protective effect against apoptosis in various cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> CTCF has been shown to modulate the expression of various cancer-associated gene loci including notable examples: <italic>CMYC</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>
<italic>IGF2</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>
<italic>TP53</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>
<italic>TERT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> and <italic>INK4/ARF</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Loss of CTCF binding via aberrant DNA methylation of critical control regions can induce epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor loci or lead to activation of oncogenes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>
<italic>Ctcf</italic> heterozygous mice are prone to tumour development in various tissues including the uterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> This verifies <italic>CTCF</italic>âs role as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene.</p>
      <p>Here we show that CTCF mutations identified in primary human endometrial carcinoma predominantly showed loss-of-function phenotypes due to nonsense-mediated decay of mutant transcripts or abrogation of functional activity. In addition, we also identified a recurrent mutation in CTCF, K365T, which showed a gain-of-function phenotype promoting increased cell survival following apoptotic insult. To recapitulate <italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency in <italic>CTCF</italic> wild-type (WT) cells we used shRNA knockdown of CTCF. We show that reduced CTCF expression reduces the proportion of spheroids showing luminal localisation of apical polarity markers F-Actin and ZO-1 in 3D endometrial spheroid culture, indicating CTCF plays a role in regulating the normal structure of endometrial glands. Furthermore, our copy number variation analysis of primary human endometrial cancers demonstrates that <italic>CTCF</italic> deletion occurs more commonly in tumours with a propensity for relapse or metastasis, and in tumours with clear cell histology. These findings provide further evidence that genetic lesions in <italic>CTCF</italic> promote endometrial carcinogenesis.</p>

        <title><italic>CTCF</italic> is mutated in endometrioid adenocarcinomas and related cell lines</title>
        <p>We and others have identified over 200 somatic <italic>CTCF</italic> mutations occurring in primary human endometrial carcinoma samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The majority (71%) are inactivating mutations resulting from frameshift (45%), nonsense (20%) and splice site mutations (6%). The remaining mutations (29%) are missense mutations with the majority (43/60, 72%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 Fisherâs exact test) occurring within the 11-ZF DNA binding domain of CTCF. All of the recurrently mutated residues in CTCF (S345, K352, K365, G375, R377, P378, A387, and R567) occur within the ZF domain and are predominantly clustered within ZF 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.0041, Fisherâs exact test). As <italic>CTCF</italic> is a significantly mutated gene in endometrial cancer, we sequenced <italic>CTCF</italic> in five endometrial cancer cell lines and identified four mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and c</xref>). These included two recurrent <italic>CTCF</italic> mutations: T204fs*26 in Ishikawa and R342H in both HEC1A and HEC1B and two novel mutations: G19* in HEC1B and R278C in RL95-2. Interestingly HEC1B, which is a sub-strain of HEC1A isolated from a patient with grade II endometrial cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> has acquired an additional somatic mutation in <italic>CTCF</italic>, G19*. Only the KLE endometrial cancer cell line did not contain any <italic>CTCF</italic> mutations. KLE has previously been shown to be diploid for Ch16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> and does not contain focal deletions within Ch16q22.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> The location of missense mutations within the ZF domains of CTCF is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and includes mutations affecting zinc ion binding, DNA binding and non-binding residues.</p>
        <p>Within our published patient cohort <italic>CTCF</italic> was sequenced in 172 endometrioid adenocarcinomas and 60 serous carcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> In all, 16 missense and 25 inactivating mutations (including 17 nonsense and 8 frameshift mutations) were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

We determined the proportion of mutant to wild-type alleles in tumour samples following DNA and RNA sequencing. In tumour DNA, there was a similar ratio of mutant to wild-type alleles for missense mutations and inactivating mutations (37.6Â±3.2% and 32.8Â±2.3%, respectively, meanÂ±s.e.m) consistent with monoallelic mutation of <italic>CTCF</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The proportion of expressed alleles with missense mutations was 63.1Â±6.3% and with inactivating mutations was 7.7Â±3.2% (mean +/- s.e.m.), indicating that most nonsense- and frameshift-mutated alleles were eliminated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Consistent with nonsense-mediated decay being the mechanism by which nonsense- and frameshift-mutated alleles are degraded, all but two of these mutations obeyed the rule for termination-codon position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> in which the premature termination codon must be &gt;55 nt upstream of the last exon-exon junction to result in NMD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

When samples with somatic <italic>CTCF</italic> mutations were excluded, relative linear copy number values for <italic>CTCF</italic> correlated with CTCF mRNA expression (Ï=0.384, Spearmanâs log-rank correlation). Furthermore, samples with somatic <italic>CTCF</italic> deletion expressed significantly less CTCF mRNA (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, MannâWhitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). <italic>CTCF</italic> copy number gain was observed in only a single serous carcinoma sample.

        <title>CTCF knockdown promotes loss of endometrial cell line polarity in 3D culture</title>
        <p>As the majority of CTCF mutations identified in endometrial carcinoma effectively result in inactivation of one CTCF allele, we modelled this using inducible shRNA knockdown of CTCF. In shCTCF KLE cells we reduced CTCF expression by about half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). However, we did not detect any significant change in cell proliferation after CTCF knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). As with CTCF overexpression studies, we observed a decrease of colony formation with shRNA knockdown of CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This is consistent with preliminary CRISPR genome editing studies performed in our laboratory (data not shown). However, knockdown of CTCF did not have any effect on KLE cell survival in response to UV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). These data indicate that there is not a simple linear relationship between CTCF expression level and cell characteristics such as cell growth, colony formation and protection from apoptosis. Colony formation in particular shows that neither over- nor underexpression of CTCF is optimal for maximal colony formation.</p>
        <p>Endometrial cancer cell lines such as KLE are derived from glandular epithelium, and as such, can be induced <italic>in vitro</italic> to grow spheroids reminiscent of endometrial glands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> These endometrial spheroids display basal/apical polarity when stained for F-actin, a marker of apical polarity based on phalloidin staining, and the apical tight junction protein ZO-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Using this staining technique we found that spheroids generated from KLE cells after CTCF knockdown had a reduced proportion of spheroids showing apical/central F-actin and ZO-1 staining compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4e and f</xref>). This shows that reduced CTCF gene expression disrupts endometrial cancer cell polarity, a morphological change characteristic of epithelial cancer development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> There was no consistent change observed with CTCF knockdown compared to the three relevant controls in spheroid area, spheroid number, ZO-1 staining intensity or F-actin staining intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>We examined a small independent cohort of 23 primary endometrial malignancies as well as 8 primary tumour samples which developed local relapse and 7 primary tumour samples that presented or later developed metastasis. DNA isolated from FFPE samples was analysed using a custom Nanostring nCounter copy number variation panel of cancer-associated genes across the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q) with a particular focus on 16q22.1 where <italic>CTCF</italic> is located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Within the 23 primary samples only a single grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma showed <italic>CTCF</italic> deletion. Among the 8 tumours that relapsed, 3 showed <italic>CTCF</italic> deletion including a grade 2 endometrioid tumour and two clear cell carcinomas. Among tumours that developed metastases, two of seven showed <italic>CTCF</italic> deletion including a mixed grade 3 endometrioid/clear cell tumour and a grade 2 endometrioid tumour. Collectively <italic>CTCF</italic> was more likely to be deleted in endometrial tumours that developed relapse or metastasis than primary malignancies (<italic>P</italic>=0.0268, Fisherâs exact test). Moreover, two of three relapsed tumours exhibited clear cell histology and one of two metastatic tumours displayed mixed endometrioid/clear cell histology. This indicates a possible association between the presence of clear cell histology and <italic>CTCF</italic> deletion (<italic>P</italic>=0.0259, Fisherâs exact test), which warrants further investigation in a more extensive cohort.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> have shown that CTCF is mutated in about one quarter of endometrioid adenocarcinomas. The majority of these somatic <italic>CTCF</italic> mutations are inactivating mutations resulting from nonsense, frameshift or splice site mutations, which we show are rarely expressed due to nonsense-mediated decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> of mutant transcripts, consistent with other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The missense mutations which have been identified occurred predominantly in the 11-ZF DNA binding domain of CTCF. A number of CTCF ZF mutations previously identified in isolated cancers were shown to inhibit CTCF binding to specific DNA binding sites such as <italic>CMYC</italic> and <italic>IGF2/H19</italic> regulatory regions while binding to other sites such as the Î²-globin and <italic>APPÎ²</italic> regulatory regions was unaffected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In endometrial carcinoma these missense mutations appear to cluster within ZFs 4â5 of CTCF. ZFs 4-7 are responsible for binding to the 20âbp core binding motif of CTCF which constitutes ~80% of all CTCF target sites across the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Recurrent CTCF missense mutations in endometrial cancer occur within inter-ZF regions (R377H and P378L), and within conserved residues critical for zinc co-ordination or residues that directly contact the minor groove of DNA (K365T). R377H and P378L are loss-of-function mutations which abrogate the tumour suppressive effects of CTCF. These inter-ZF mutations may alter the conserved DNA binding domain structure and prevent normal CTCF function. Conversely, K365T did not disrupt the tumour suppressive effect of CTCF on cellular growth but enhanced CTCFâs response to UV-induced apoptosis indicating a pro-survival gain-of-function. As this residue directly contacts DNA, this mutation may alter DNA binding specificity. The exact nature or consequences of this altered binding has yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>Despite our demonstration of a gain-of-function mutation in CTCF, the majority of CTCF mutations in endometrial cancer result in loss-of-function. We and others have found that the mechanism of <italic>CTCF</italic> gene inactivation differs between cancer subtypes. Microsatellite instability (MSI)-positive endometrioid tumours are prone to strand slippage mutations in <italic>CTCF</italic> resulting in the recurrent T204fs*18 and T204fs*26 mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> We found that <italic>CTCF</italic> is genetically deleted in a further 22% of all endometrial carcinomas, and that the highest rates of CTCF genetic deletion occur in endometrial serous carcinomas (65.5%). Consequently, these result in a significant reduction in <italic>CTCF</italic> gene expression, indicating that haploinsufficient deletion of <italic>CTCF</italic> may be important in endometrial carcinoma pathogenesis and/or progression. In addition, other genes within Chr16q are often concurrently deleted with <italic>CTCF</italic>. The haploinsufficienct loss of these additional genes may synergise with <italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency in promoting more aggressive behaviour in endometrial carcinomas. Thus the mechanism of <italic>CTCF</italic> inactivation could contribute to tumour subtype and prognosis.</p>
      <p><italic>CTCF</italic> has previously been suggested as a target of 16q22.1 deletions observed in various cancer types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup>
<italic>CTCF</italic> is located within the minimally deleted region of 16q22.1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> however other candidate genes such as E-cadherin (<italic>CDH1</italic>) and <italic>ZFHX3</italic> have also been suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> E-cadherin is required for normal development and function of the endometrium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> while loss of E-cadherin staining is associated with endometrial carcinoma development and poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Likewise, somatic <italic>ZFHX3</italic> mutations occur in about 20% of endometrial cancers and are associated with poor patient outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> We have determined that haploinsufficient deletions of 16q, which usually contain <italic>CTCF,</italic> are associated with serous, and now potentially clear cell histology and poorer prognosis. This provides the first evidence that <italic>CTCF</italic> inactivation in conjunction with inactivation of <italic>CDH1</italic> and/or <italic>ZFHX3</italic> and/or other candidate genes on 16q contributes to the development of poorer prognosis tumour subtypes. Any additive or synergistic effect between <italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency and that of other candidate genes within 16q has yet to be investigated.</p>
      <p>CTCF has been established as a tumour suppressor gene due to its ability to suppress cancer cell growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Along with <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>ARID1A</italic>, <italic>CTCF</italic> has been classified as a significantly mutated gene in endometrial cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup>
<italic>Ctcf</italic> haploinsufficient mice, which are tumour prone, also develop endometrial cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> These observations firmly implicate <italic>CTCF</italic> mutation and haploinsufficiency in endometrial carcinoma pathogenesis. However the cellular consequences of <italic>CTCF</italic> mutation and haploinsufficiency had not been investigated. Here we show that at least one recurrent mutation in CTCF, K365T, exhibits a pro-survival gain-of-function phenotype which could contribute to tumourigenesis. To date, this gain-of-function mutation, K365T has been identified in two cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and one serous carcinoma case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> This K365T mutation is the only CTCF mutation to be identified in a worse prognosis serous subtype tumour. Conversely the majority of endometrial cancer-associated genetic changes to CTCF result in inactivation of one allele of <italic>CTCF</italic> leading to haploinsufficiency. Here we show that these can deregulate endometrial cell polarity, a phenotype which is associated with malignancy. Thus, loss-of-function missense mutations, inactivating mutations and genetic copy number loss are different mechanisms which achieve reduced <italic>CTCF</italic> gene dosage and/or expression and/or CTCF protein activity. To date, no homozygous deletion resulting in complete inactivation of CTCF has been reported in tumours. A single case has been reported showing homozygous deletion of <italic>CTCF</italic> exon 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> which encodes the entirety of the N-terminus of CTCF. RNA sequencing was not performed to determine if alternative transcripts of CTCF were expressed. CTCF is absolutely required for development as <italic>Ctcf</italic> null mouse embyros fail to develop into blastocysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Thus we expect complete loss of <italic>CTCF</italic> in tumours would be detrimental to cell viability and tumourigenesis, similar to when enforced deletion of both alleles of <italic>DICER1</italic>, a known haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene, leads to inhibition of tumourigenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup></p>
      <p><italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency also destabilises DNA methylation at epigenetically variable CpGs in normal tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> It is not clear what specific effects this global epigenetic instability would have on endometrioid cells, but such deregulation may accelerate carcinogenesis, and is indeed recognised as an enabling factor in cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Paradoxically we show that knockdown of CTCF can have both pro-tumourigenic (deregulation of cellular polarity) and anti-tumourigenic (inhibition of clonogenicity) activities. Also, either CTCF overexpression or knockdown inhibit colony formation in endometrial cancer cells. This indicates that CTCF must be tightly regulated to ensure normal cell function.</p>
      <p>The endometrium of a reproductive human female (from puberty to menopause, excluding pregnancy) is a dynamic tissue undergoing monthly cycles of proliferation, secretion and menstruation. This cycling is accompanied by dramatic morphological changes in the endometrial glands. However, despite these changes, the glandular epithelial cells maintain normal apical-basal polarity through specific subcellular expression of polarity proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Loss of cellular polarity allows cells to override normal contact inhibition signals and is thus a hallmark of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> This is consistent with the finding of Kemp <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> who showed that CTCF haploinsufficiency did not alter the proliferation of MEFs under subconfluent conditions but showed loss of contact inhibition at confluency. CTCF knockdown in the KLE endometrial cancer cell line reduces the proportion of endometrial cancer spheroids showing central luminal staining of apical polarity markers. Loss of cellular polarity is thought to be an early event in endometrial cancer development, as it is evident in endometrial atypical hyperplasia which progresses to malignant carcinoma in about a third of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Moreover, loss of cellular polarity is an important aspect of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) known to be involved in tumour progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Interestingly, in mice, <italic>Ctcf</italic><sup>+/</sup><sup>â</sup> tumours exhibit increased aggressiveness, including invasion, metastasis and mixed epithelial and mesenchymal morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> This is the first time that CTCF has been implicated in the regulation of cellular polarity, and could indicate an important role for CTCF haploinsufficiency in the development of endometrial and other cancers.</p>
      <p>Here we showed that knockdown of CTCF resulted in the significant deregulation of gene expression in KLE cells. Using gene process ontology analysis we found significant enrichment for genes associated with the retinoic acid receptor signalling pathway. Interestingly retinoic acid receptor signalling has been associated with differentiation, decidualisation and cancer formation in the endometrium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> and is also associated with the regulation of glandular epithelium polarity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> This may offer a gene regulatory mechanism by which CTCF haploinsufficiency contributes to endometrial cancer development.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that CTCF mutations and genetic deletions predominantly result in loss-of-function and more rarely pro-survival gain-of-function phenotypes. <italic>CTCF</italic> mutation is restricted to the endometrioid subtype of endometrial carcinoma, while genetic deletion of Ch16q including the <italic>CTCF</italic> locus, occurs predominantly in worse prognosis subtypes including serous carcinoma, and our preliminary studies indicate clear cell carcinoma. Inactivation of one allele of <italic>CTCF</italic> (<italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency) effectively reduces the amount of functional CTCF in endometrial cancer cells. CTCF knockdown to recapitulate haploinsufficiency resulted in deregulation of endometrial cancer spheroid polarity which likely contributes to endometrial cancer development and progression. Tumours with <italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency can now be shown to exhibit four different hallmarks of cancer: sustained proliferative signalling, resisting cell death, evading growth suppressors and epigenetic disregulation of the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Our study provides further evidence of CTCFâs role as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene. Future studies to explore the global consequences of <italic>CTCF</italic> haploinsufficiency on three-dimensional genomic architecture and the transcriptional landscape in cancer are now warranted.</p>

Samples were blocked in 20% (v/v) BlokHen (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR, USA) in PBS, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30âmin at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies as follows: mouse anti-HA (1:1,000; Covance) or rabbit anti-ZO-1 (1:100; Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA) in blocking buffer for 1.5âh at RT. Samples were then washed 3 times for 5âmin in PBS 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Secondary antibodies: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (1:5,000; Life Technologies) or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:5,000; Life Technologies) and rhodamine phalloidin to bind F-actin (1:200, Life Technologies) were incubated in blocking buffer for 1âh at RT. Samples were washed 3 times for 5âmin in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100. For spheroids the first wash contained 0.2âÎ¼g/ml DAPI (Life Technologies) to counterstain nuclei. Cells were mounted in Prolong Gold plus DAPI (Life Technologies), and spheroids were covered with PBS. Imaging of cells was performed on the DeltaVision Personal Deconvolution Microscope (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and images deconvolved using SoftWoRx software (GE Healthcare). Imaging of spheroids for scoring was performed on a BD pathway (Becton Dickinson) and representative images were taken on a Confocal SP5 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Spheroids were scored for central staining of both F-Actin and ZO-1 by a researcher blinded to sample identity. There were an average of 105Â±6 (meanÂ±s.e.m) spheroids per image, one image per well, and duplicate wells for each experiment. Four replicate experiments were analysed.</p>

        <title>Cell biology assays</title>
        <p>All cell biology assays were performed on GFP-positive cells as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Briefly, MTT cell proliferation assays were performed using 200-250 cells/well plated in a 96-well plate in triplicate and proliferation was assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 d by the addition of 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)â2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) overnight. The reaction was quenched with isopropanol/HCl and the optical density at 570 and 630ânm measured using a POLARstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Clonogenicity assays were performed using 1000 cells/10âcm dish in triplicate and incubated for 10-20 d. Cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol, then stained with Giemsa solution diluted 1:20 in H<sub>2</sub>O. The colonies were scored by a researcher blinded to sample identity. For apoptosis experiments, 1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with PBS and cells were UV irradiated (Ishikawa 1000âÎ¼J, KLE 4000âÎ¼J) in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, San Diego, CA, USA). After 18âh recovery, both adherent and non-adherent cells were stained for flow cytometry using Annexin V-APC (Becton Dickinson) and DAPI (Sigma, Croydon, UK). Viable cells were defined as those cells that were negative for both stains.</p>

        <title>Gene expression array analysis</title>
        <p>Triplicate samples of KLE cells expressing either shControl or shCTCF knockdown lentivectors were treated with doxycycline for 8 days prior to isolation of RNA. Gene expression analysis was performed using the GeneChIP PrimeView Human Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Analysis was performed using the Bioconductor packages affy and limma. Array data were normalised using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) approach. We applied an intensity based filter to remove probe sets that were not expressed. Differentially expressed genes were identified by fitting a linear model to the data and applying an empirical Bayes smoothing to the standard errors. <italic>P</italic>-values were Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted. Gene ontology analysis was performed using GOrilla (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il">http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> using a background of expressed genes, a <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of &lt;10<sup>â3</sup>, and FDR <italic>Q</italic>-value threshold of &lt;0.1.</p>

        <title>Genetic analysis of primary human samples</title>
        <p>Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary human endometrial cancer samples and associated clinical data (which was extracted from patient case notes and the secure password-protected hospital database) were deidentified and obtained from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in accordance with Sydney Local Health District-approved human ethics protocol (X12-0380). DNA from samples was isolated using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. DNA concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop) and 500âng of DNA was prepared for use on a custom nCounter Copy Number Variation Panel (Nanostring, Seattle, WA, USA) with probes measuring the copy number of cancer-associated genes along the long arm of chromosome 16. Copy number values were normalised to seven normal or benign endometrium FFPE samples isolated from the same location which were considered diploid.</p>

        <p>CTCF genetic deletion is associated with relapse and metastasis, and clear cell histology. A custom Nanostring nCounter Copy Number Variation (CNV) Code Set was designed to span cancer-associated genes in the long arm of chromosome 16 with particular focus on genes within 16q22.1 containing the <italic>CTCF</italic> locus (average of three probes, indicated by red border). Chromosome band and gene name are labelled above. An endometrial cancer cohort (<italic>n</italic>=23, top), endometrial carcinomas (EC) which relapsed (<italic>n</italic>=8, middle), and endometrial carcinomas (EC) which metastasised (<italic>n</italic>=7, bottom) were analysed. CNV counts were normalised to the average of seven normal or benign endometrium samples which were all considered diploid and any variation depicted on the heatmap. Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) tumour grading scores are shown. Endometrial cancer histologies included endometrioid (Endo), Serous (Ser), Clear Cell (CC), Carcinosarcoma (CS) and Squamous Carcinoma (Squ). Where mixed histologies were seen multiple subtypes are listed. The sites of local relapse or metastasis are listed, and if detected at diagnosis (at diag); (LN) lymph node.</p>
