      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in the A-type lamin (<italic>LMNA</italic>) gene are associated with age-associated degenerative disorders of mesenchymal tissues, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The molecular mechanisms that connect mutations in LMNA with different human diseases are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of a <underline>M</underline>uscle-enriched A-type <underline>L</underline>amin-<underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>P</underline>rotein, <italic>MLIP</italic> (<italic>C6orf142</italic> and <italic>2310046A06rik</italic>), a unique single copy gene that is an innovation of amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals). <italic>MLIP</italic> encodes alternatively spliced variants (23â57 kDa) and possesses several novel structural motifs not found in other proteins. MLIP is expressed ubiquitously and most abundantly in heart, skeletal, and smooth muscle. MLIP interacts directly and co-localizes with lamin A and C in the nuclear envelope. MLIP also co-localizes with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies within the nucleus. <italic>PML</italic>, like <italic>MLIP</italic>, is only found in amniotes, suggesting that a functional link between the nuclear envelope and PML bodies may exist through MLIP. Down-regulation of lamin A/C expression by shRNA results in the up-regulation and mislocalization of MLIP. Given that <italic>MLIP</italic> is expressed most highly in striated and smooth muscle, it is likely to contribute to the mesenchymal phenotypes of laminopathies.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lamins are intermediate filament proteins of the nuclear lamina that underlies the inner nuclear membrane of all multicellular eukaryotes. They are fundamentally important for nuclear architecture, chromatin organization, and transcriptional regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A-type lamin expression is closely associated with cellular differentiation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, beyond this, the molecular mechanisms responsible for transcriptional specificity and cellular commitment and differentiation are largely unknown.</p><p>More than 400 different mutations in the lamin A/C (<italic>LMNA</italic>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> gene have been described and result in a heterogeneous group of disorders that are collectively defined as laminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The diseases caused by the wide spectrum of <italic>LMNA</italic> gene mutations are characterized by a diverse variability of clinical phenotypes; ranging from cardiac and skeletal myopathies to partial lipodystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and premature aging. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been identified because mutations in the same codon can cause different diseases in unrelated families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and even among family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A complete loss of A-type lamins resulted in a postnatal appearance of abnormal nuclear structures that manifests as muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A recent study used hierarchical cluster analysis for assembling laminopathies into classes based on organ system involvement. They uncovered a nonrandom relationship between the class of laminopathy and the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Several hypotheses have been proposed for the pathogenesis of laminopathies, and most research has been focused on the âmechanical stressâ and âaltered gene regulationâ hypotheses. The structural integrity of the nucleus may be affected by the expression of mutant A-type lamins because mice that lack LMNA have varied nuclear morphologies with a significant redistribution of nuclear envelope proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The fragility of the nuclear envelope is believed to contribute (in part) to pathologies in tissues subjected to mechanical stresses, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. The complete loss of A-type lamins supports this hypothesis. The effect of autosomal dominant missense mutations on the structural integrity of the nucleus remains to be determined.</p><p>Evidence in support of the altered gene regulation hypothesis include many of the proteins that are involved in chromatin organization, transcription, and binding to DNA are either directly or indirectly associated with the nuclear envelope. Chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation of gene expression are therefore affected in specific ways due to the disruption of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We know very little about the molecular pathogenesis from mutations in the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene to heart phenotypes. Therefore, the question is how these different pathologies arise from alterations in the same gene (<italic>LMNA</italic>) that is almost ubiquitously expressed in adult cells.</p><p>To address this question we probed the first 230 amino acids of A-type lamin (rich in mutations associated with skeletal and cardiac muscle laminopathies) for new interactors. A muscle-enriched A-type lamin-interacting protein (MLIP, C6orf142) was identified in our laboratory. The <italic>MLIP</italic> gene encodes at least seven, alternatively spliced, LMNA-interacting factors. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <italic>MLIP</italic> is a unique, single copy gene that is found only in the genomes of amniotes. <italic>MLIP</italic> may represent an innovation of amniotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Yeast Two-hybrid</title><p>The bait-vector was constructed by subcloning human LMNA fragment (660 bp corresponding to the 1â230 aa) into EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The bait-vector was transformed into yeast (AH109). Yeast toxicity, autotranscription activation, and bait expression were all assessed. The bait-vector-transformed yeast were then mated with the pretransformed human heart library (Matchmaker<sup>TM</sup>, Clontech) and screened according to manufacture's protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech).</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial Protein Expression, Purification, and in Vitro Binding Assay</title><p>Bacterial expression plasmids for MLIP proteins and lamin A were constructed by subcloning MLIP cDNA into the His tag fusion vector pET100D (Invitrogen) and lamin A (1â230 aa) into the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare). Plasmids were transformed independently into the bacterial strain BL21 DE3(pLysS) and induced with 250 Î¼<sc>m</sc> isopropyl-1-thio-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside for 2 h during exponential growth phase. Cells were lysed in 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a mixture of protease (Sigma) inhibitors, and then centrifuged at 100,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 45 min. The His<sub>6</sub>-MLIP supernatant was loaded on to a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare), washed with 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, and 25 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole in the presences of 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl. The GST-lamin bacterial supernantants were run across a GSTrap 4B column (GE Healthcare) and washed, and the GST-lamin was eluted with 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl + 20 m<sc>m</sc> reduced glutathione, pH 8.0. The fractions containing the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged MLIP proteins or GST-lamin were then dialyzed against 10 m<sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The purity of each fusion protein was 95%, as determined by Coomassie Blue-stained protein gels. Various combinations of His<sub>6</sub>-MLIP and GST-lamin recombinant proteins were mixed together (as indicated) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 10 m<sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 0.05%Triton X-100. Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose beads were added to each reaction mixture, and complexes were isolated and washed by centrifugation in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100. Complexes were eluted by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-GST (Cell Signaling) and anti-MLIP polyclonal antibodies. A 1:10 dilution of the total starting material was run on the same gel. The assay was repeated two additional times with similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Mouse HL1 cell line were cultured at 37 Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in growth medium consisting of Claycomb medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 m<sc>m</sc> <sc>l</sc>-glutamine.

Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 Â°C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For co-immunprecipitation experiments affinity purified (against MLIP COOH-terminal peptide NH<sub>2</sub>-LRKDEEVYEPNPFSKYL-COOH) was covalently coupled to an agarose bead according to the manufacturer's instructions (co-immunoprecipitation kit; Pierce). 20 Î¼l of a 50% slurry of anti-MLIP resin or 20 Î¼l of MLIP-peptide neutralized anti-MLIP resin (control) was added to 100 Î¼g of precleared total mouse heart lysates and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. Primary antibody-protein complexes were isolated and eluted from the antibody-resins according to the manufacturer's instructions (co-immunoprecipitation kit). Eluted protein complexes were resolved on a 15% 0.75-mm-thick SDS-Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gel (200 V) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) for 1 h at 100 V at 4 Â°C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20. The MLIP primary antibody concentration used was 1:100,000. Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblot signals were detected with a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent kit (Thermo Scientific) and visualized on x-ray film (Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Isolation, RT-PCR, RACE, and Cloning of MLIP from Mouse Hearts</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from adult mouse hearts using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were DNase-treated prior to RT-PCR (Promega). RNA samples were assessed for quality using the Bioanalyzer Nano chips (Agilent Technologies). cDNA was reverse-transcribed using AffinityScript Multiple Temperature Reverse Transcriptase (Stratagene) from 1 Î¼g of RNA with an oligo(dT) primer. MLIP DNA was amplified with primers for MLIP-5â²-UTR (5â²-ACC TCT CTC TCA TTC TTT CAC CAT G-3â²) and mMLIP-3â²-UTR (5â²-CAC TTC CAC TCC AGC TTC C-3â²). Gene amplification was carried out as follows: 95 Â°C for 5 min followed by 34 cycles in 3 steps, 95 Â°C for 30 s, 55 Â°C for 30 s, 72 Â°C for 3 min, and 72 Â°C for 5 min using <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (NEB). PCR products were subsequently TA-cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). MLIP clones were then sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). 5â²/3â²-RACE was performed on cDNA isolated from mouse hearts as described in the 5â²/3â²-RACE kit, second generation (Roche Applied Sciences) using primers specific to MLIP exons 1, 3, and 9.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>HL1 and C2C12 cells were grown on gelatin/fibronectin-coated coverslips in 12-well cell culture-treated plates (Fisher Scientific). Cells were fixed using precooled methanol (â20 Â°C) for 20 min at â20 Â°C and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were further permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS + 5%FBS for 3 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS (5 min each). To reduce nonspecific binding, cells were then blocked with PBS supplemented with 5% FBS for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cells were then incubated with anti-MLIP (1:5,000), anti-lamin A/C (1:1,000), and anti-PML (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1.5% FBS/PBS overnight at 4 Â°C. Primary antibodies were detected by fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000) Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1 Î¼g/ml) and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Images were then visualized using fluorescent microscopy (Carl Zeiss AxioImager Z1 Microscope). Bleed-through control experiments were performed while acquiring images. There is no evidence of bleed-through under the conditions in which we acquired all of our immunofluorescence images (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraffin-embedded mouse tissue sections (5â7 Î¼m thick) were stained for MLIP (1:1,000 dilution) or peroxiredoxin 3 (1:5,000; Abcam) using a Zyagen rabbit peroxidase detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

A previous study has demonstrated that the localization of nuclear envelope-associated proteins (both lamin C and Emerin) are dependent on lamin A expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). We therefore used a shRNA specific for lamin A to down-regulate lamin A in C2C12 myoblasts and examine MLIP expression levels and cellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>).

We also observed a reduced but variable level of lamin C expression by Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). This observed decrease in lamin A protein was due to 85% of the treated cells lacking lamin A and lamin C protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.165548/DC1">supplemental Fig. 3</ext-link>).

The lamin A/C antibody used in this study was unable to discriminate between A-type and C-type lamins by immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>, <italic>HâK</italic>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Lamin A is required for normal MLIP expression and cellular localization.</bold> <italic>A,</italic> Western blot of whole cell lysates showing reduced lamin A protein.

Interestingly, MLIP protein levels were up-regulated in the LMNA down-regulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>, Î±-MLIP), suggesting that lamin A is not only required for normal MLIP localization to the nuclear envelope but also for normal MLIP protein expression.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we present the identity of <italic>C6orf142</italic>, a unique, single copy gene found only in amniotes that encodes a novel nuclear Lamin A/C interacting protein that we named MLIP. No previously known structural motif is present in MLIP and is ubiquitously expressed and enriched in muscle. The emergence of <italic>MLIP</italic> in amniotes suggests that <italic>MLIP</italic> might assume a novel biological function unique to amniotes. <italic>MLIP</italic> is 1 of the 1,021 genes that are unique to amniotes. Unlike <italic>MLIP</italic>, the majority of these amniote-specific genes have at least one paralogous homolog.</p><p>The <italic>MLIP</italic> gene encodes alternatively spliced variants ranging in size from 23 to 57 kDa that exhibit tissue-specific expression. The MLIP isoforms possess several novel structural motifs not found in other proteins. MLIP was found to distribute in the cytosol and the nucleus, and this may be reflective of isoform specific localization. A recent study focused on alternative splicing of 11,769 full-length human cDNAs identified <italic>MLIP</italic> (<italic>C6orf142</italic>) to be 1 of 261 genes with multiple variable first exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). MLIP was found to be highly expressed in the human heart with an abundant alternative transcriptional start site found only in both fetal and adult brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The transcriptional start site identified in human hearts by Wakamatsu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was homologous to the transcriptional start site we identified in the mouse heart. This raises many intriguing questions as to the functional role MLIP plays in both heart and brain.</p><p>Of significance is the finding that MLIP interacts and co-localizes with lamin A/C, a major component of nuclear lamina found between the inner nuclear membrane and the peripheral chromatin. Our data suggest that MLIP expression and localization to the nuclear rim are dependent on lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>), further supporting our original observation that MLIP interacts with lamin A/C. Thus, by association, MILP may serve important biological roles in regulating lamin function that includes important roles in maintaining nuclear structure, chromatin organization, DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>A large number of proteins that interact with lamin A/C proteins have been previously reported and include actin (LMNA<sub>461â536aa</sub> and LMNA<sub>563â646</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), PKCÎ± (LMNA<sub>500â664</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), 12(<italic>S</italic>)-LOX (LMNA<sub>463â664</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), histones (LMNA<sub>396â430</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), SREBP1 (LMNA<sub>389â664</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), Narf (LMNA<sub>389â664</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), Emerin (LMNA<sub>384â566</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), LAP2Î± (LMNA<sub>319â566</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), retinoblastoma (LMNA<sub>247â355</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), and MOK2 (LMNA<sub>243â387</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). In none of these previously reported cases did the lamin A/C interaction occur within the first 230 amino acids of lamin A/C that includes the amino-terminal globular head domain (1â30 aa), coil 1A (31â66 aa), linker 1 (67â77 aa), coil 1B (78â220 aa) and part of linker 12 (221â239 aa). Thus, MLIP is the first protein to be described that interacts with this portion of lamin A/C. As a unique amniote gene, MLIP also provides new protein structural motifs that confer A-type lamin binding.</p><p>A wide range of human diseases, encompassing more than 10 different clinical syndromes, have been associated with mutations in the gene that encodes A-type lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The molecular mechanism of the relationship between lamin A/C mutations with the pathogenesis of complex degenerative disorders and aging remains poorly defined. Furthermore, undifferentiated embryonic stem cells of both human and mouse origin lack lamin A/C expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) whereas partially differentiated cells express lamin A/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). There is increasing evidence that lamin A/C plays a critical role in stem cell regulation, differentiation, and cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). MLIP is only expressed in amniotes, but lamin mutations cause muscular and aging phenotypes in non-amniotes <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Drosophila have two lamin genes, lamC and lamDm<sub>0</sub>, that are expressed in a pattern similar to mammalian lamin B and lamin A/C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> only has one lamin gene, suggesting that this singular gene is sufficient for providing the necessary functions of the different lamins genes in other species. What we find particularly intriguing about this discrepancy is that not only does MLIP co-localize with lamin A/C in the nuclear envelope but MLIP was also observed to be co-localized with PML protein in the nucleus of cells in a punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>J</italic>). A wide variety of biological processes have been associated within PML bodies that include protein posttranslational modifications, transcriptional regulation, DNA damage responses, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). PML, like MLIP, is only expressed in amniotes, suggesting that a functional link between the nuclear envelope and PML bodies may exist through MLIP.</p><p>The precise function of MLIP remains undefined. MLIP may function as a tethering protein linking LMNA to unidentified factors either within the nuclear envelope or within PML bodies. In support of this, a significant reduction in lamin A/C expression in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>) resulted in the mislocalization of MLIP away from the nuclear envelope with an up-regulation in MLIP protein levels and isoform type. This dysregulation of MLIP localization and expression may (in part) be associated with skeletal and cardiac muscle laminopathies. However, a reduction of MLIP was reported in a microarray screen of the hearts of LMNA H222P mutant mouse model of autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (wild type <italic>versus</italic> homozygous mutant <italic>p</italic> = 0.0035 and wild type <italic>versus</italic> heterozygous mutant <italic>p</italic> = 0.0399; NCBI GEO profile GDS2746 record). MLIP has also been reported to be 1 of 36 genes differentially expressed in the placentas of women destined to develop preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). MLIP was observed to be down-regulated in the affected placentas and because we report here that MLIP is expressed in smooth muscle, this suggests that MLIP may have a role in maintaining normal smooth muscle function and vascular tone. It remains to be determined whether MLIP has a direct signaling or mechanistic role in A-type lamin-mediated biology.</p><p>A-type lamins have been implicated in the maintenance of cellular commitment and differentiation. Like lamin A/C, MLIP is ubiquitously expressed with tissue-specific isoforms, which may suggest that MLIP possibly plays a role in A-type lamin associated maintenance of cellular commitment and differentiation. The tissue-specific MLIP isoform patterns we observe may be necessary for the maintenance of that tissue differentiation. In addition, because we observe MLIP within PML bodies, we can infer that MLIP may have alternative functions beyond merely binding to lamin A/C. The identification of MLIP as an amniote lamin-interacting factor provides a new direction to study the mechanisms of lamin A/C during amniote development, aging, and disease.</p></sec>
