          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Intracellular magnesium is abundant, highly regulated and plays an important role in biochemical functions. Despite the extensive evidence for unique mammalian Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transporters, few proteins have been biochemically identified to date that fulfill this role. We have shown that epithelial magnesium conservation is controlled, in part, by differential gene expression leading to regulation of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport. We used this knowledge to identify a novel gene that is regulated by magnesium.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to identify a novel human gene that encodes a protein involved with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked transport. We have designated this magnesium transporter (MagT1) protein. MagT1 is a novel protein with no amino acid sequence identity to other known transporters. The corresponding cDNA comprises an open reading frame of 1005 base pairs encoding a protein of 335 amino acids. It possesses five putative transmembrane (TM) regions with a cleavage site, a <italic>N-</italic>glycosylation site, and a number of phosphorylation sites. Based on Northern analysis of mouse tissues, a 2.4 kilobase transcript is present in many tissues. When expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes, MagT1 mediates saturable Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake with a Michaelis constant of 0.23 mM. Transport of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>by MagT1 is rheogenic, voltage-dependent, does not display any time-dependent inactivation. Transport is very specific to Mg<sup>2+ </sup>as other divalent cations did not evoke currents. Large external concentrations of some cations inhibited Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport (Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in MagT1-expressing oocytes. Ca<sup>2+</sup>and Fe<sup>2+ </sup>were without effect. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis using a specific antibody demonstrated that MagT1 mRNA and protein is increased by about 2.1-fold and 32%, respectively, in kidney epithelial cells cultured in low magnesium media relative to normal media and in kidney cortex of mice maintained on low magnesium diets compared to those animals consuming normal diets. Accordingly, it is apparent that an increase in mRNA levels is translated into higher protein expression.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>These studies suggest that MagT1 may provide a selective and regulated pathway for Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport in epithelial cells.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Magnesium is the second most abundant cation within the cell and plays an important role in many intracellular biochemical functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite the abundance and importance of magnesium, little is known about how eukaryotic cells regulate their magnesium content.</p>
      <p>Intracellular free Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentration is in the order of 0.5 mM which is 1â2% of the total cellular magnesium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Accordingly, intracellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is maintained below the concentration predicted from the transmembrane electrochemical potential. Intracellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentration is finely regulated likely by precise controls of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry, Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux, and intracellular storage compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The transporters comprising these pathways have only begun to be identified.</p>
      <p>Few magnesium transporters have been identified at the molecular level. Schweyen and colleagues have demonstrated that the <italic>mitochondrial RNA splicing2 </italic>(<italic>Mrs2</italic>) gene encodes a protein that is present in yeast and mammalian inner mitochondrial membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Mrs2 mediates high capacity Mg<sup>2+ </sup>influx in isolated yeast mitochondria driven by the inner membrane potential but also transports a range of divalent cations such as Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>Mrs2 </italic>increases influx while deletion of the gene abolishes uptake suggesting that it is the major mitochondrial system. This data suggests that Mrs2 protein may mediate Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport in mammalian mitochondria. Nadler et al first identified TRPM7, a widely expressed member of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) ion channel family, that produces a Mg<sup>2+ </sup>current in a wide variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. TRPM7 is regulated by intracellular MgÂ·ATP levels and is similarly permeable to both major divalent cations, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, but also many of the trace elements, such as Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Using a positional cloning approach, Schlingmann et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and Walder et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found that hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH) was caused by mutations in <italic>TRPM6</italic>, a new member of the TRPM family. HSH is an inherited disease affecting both intestinal and renal Mg<sup>2+ </sup>absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The functional characteristics of the TRPM6 transporter have not been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Other magnesium transporters have been functionally described but they have not been characterized at the molecular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is disparaging that, despite the significance of cellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>, only three specific magnesium transporters have been described in mammalian cells to date.</p>
      <p>Mammalian magnesium homeostasis is a balance of epithelial intestinal magnesium absorption and renal magnesium excretion. The kidney plays a major role in control of vertebrate magnesium balance, in part, by active magnesium transport within the distal tubule of the nephron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Using the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line obtained from canine distal tubules and immortalized mouse distal convoluted tubule cells (MDCT), we have shown that Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry is through specific and regulated magnesium pathways that are controlled by a variety of hormonal influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However these hormones do not provide selective control as they also affect calcium and in some cases sodium and potassium transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Selective and sensitive control of cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport is regulated by intrinsic mechanisms so that culture in media containing low magnesium results in upregulation of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake in these cells. This adaptive increase in Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry was shown to be dependent on <italic>de novo </italic>transcription since prior treatment of the epithelial cells with actinomycin D prevented the adaptation to low extracellular magnesium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The data suggest that epithelial cells can somehow sense the environmental magnesium and through transcription- and translation-dependent processes alter Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport and maintain magnesium balance. These conclusions using isolated epithelial cells are consonant with our views of magnesium conservation in the intact kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>In an attempt to identify genes underlying cellular changes resulting from adaptation to low extracellular magnesium, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to screen for magnesium-regulated transcripts in epithelial cells. This approach revealed one transcript whose relative level was dramatically altered by extracellular magnesium. Thus, this transcript potentially represented a species of mRNA whose synthesis was regulated by changes in cell magnesium. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of this novel transcript referred to as MagT1. Our data indicate MagT1 may mediate Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport in a wide variety of cells and may play a role in control of cellular magnesium homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Identification of MagT1</title>
        <p>With the knowledge that differential gene expression is involved with selective control of epithelial cell magnesium conservation, our strategy was to use microarray analysis to identify candidates that were up-regulated with low magnesium. Using Affymetrix GeneChip<sup>R </sup>technology, we showed that 116 DNA fragments were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.0002) from the 24,000 mouse ESTs represented on the chips. The RNA of one of these was significantly increased, greater than 2-fold, n = 3, determined by real-time RT-PCR. The full length human cDNA was identified from clone DKFZp564K142Q3 obtained from RZPD Resource Center, Berlin, in pAMP1 vector and bidirectionally sequenced at NAPS, University of British Columbia. Based on the cDNA sequence, electrophysiological properties and cation selectivity of the encoded protein, we designated it as MagT1 for Magnesium Transport protein, subtype 1. MgT was not used to avoid confusion with the bacterial MgtA/B and MgtE magnesium transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Primary structure of MagT1</title>
        <p>MagT1 cDNA comprises 2241-base pairs (bp) with an open reading frame of 1005 bp that predicts a protein of 335 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 38,036 Da (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Hydropathy profile analysis suggested that MagT1 is an integral membrane protein containing five hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning (TM) Î± helical regions, the first of which is likely cleaved to form the final product with four TM domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). MagT1 contains a <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site at residue 215 located in the first extracellular loop. The N-terminal region of MagT1 contains four putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites at residues S73, S108, T153 and S162 and four possible protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at residues S38, T48, S103, T111. The short C-terminal cytoplasmic region does not possess any cAMP-dependent or protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. The presence of putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A and protein kinase C in the cytoplasmic domain suggests that transport might be regulated by phosphorylation.</p>

        <p>The human origin, chromosomal location, and intron-exon organization of the MagT1 gene were deduced from the expressed sequence tag (EST) database and the human genome data. There may be an alternative splicing of MagT1 but only one transcript could be seen on the Northern blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Mouse mMagT1 gene is comprised of 10 exons spanning 41,680 bp located on the X chromosome (unplaced). The human hMagT1 gene is composed of 11 exons spanning 69,137 bp and is also on the X chromosome (Xq13.1â13.2).</p>

        <p>A BLAST search yielded a number of poorly characterized proteins with similar amino acid sequences to MagT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Using the BESTFIT sequence alignment program, MagT1 shows 100% identity to a human unnamed protein (GenBankâ¢ CAB66571.1, BAC11592.1), 88% to a mouse implantation associated protein (GenBankâ¢ NP_080228.1, BAB28739.1, BAB31313.1, AAH03881.1), 87% to a rat implantation associated protein (GenBankâ¢ IAG2_RAT, NP_446398.1, AAB63294.2), 66% (first 131 amino acids) to a human implantation associated protein (GenBankâ¢ XP_497668) and to an unknown protein MGC:56218 from the zebra fish (AAH46002.1). MagT1 shares some similarity (65â67%) to the human (GenBankâ¢ AAH10370.1, AAB18376.1, AAB18374.1, G02297, N33_HUMAN, NP_006756.1, AAB18375.1), mouse (GenBankâ¢ BAC25795.1), and rat (GenBankâ¢ XP_214356.1) putative prostate cancer tumor suppressor protein. There is also some similarity (23â54%) to a number of un-characterized proteins in <italic>Anopheles </italic>(GenBankâ¢ EAA13927.1), Drosophila melanogaster (GenBankâ¢ AAL68198.1, AAF52636.2, NP_609204.2), <italic>Ochlerotatus trisertiatus </italic>(GenBankâ¢ AF275675.1), and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>(GenBankâ¢ NP_498691.1, AAA28222.1, S44911, Y013_CAEEL). None of these proteins, with similar amino acid sequences to MagT1, are sufficiently characterized to suggest a common functional purpose. MagT1 has a more distant relationship (<italic>P </italic>= 3 Ã 10<sup>-12</sup>) to the OST3 gene of <italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae </italic>that encodes a regulatory subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharyltransferase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A gapped alignment of these sequences showed only 21% identical residues between the hMagT1 and OST3 sequences extending throughout most of both proteins.</p>

        <title>Tissue distribution of MagT1 expression</title>
        <p>Northern analysis of cultured mouse distal convoluted tubule cells and tissues harvested from mice revealed a single strong transcript of about 2.4 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The kidney, colon, heart and liver possessed relatively high levels of MagT1 mRNA and smaller amounts were found in intestine, spleen, brain, and lung (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Accordingly, MagT1 mRNA appears to be widely expressed among tissues but the transcript is variably expressed among these tissues.</p>
        <p>The MagT1 antibody recognized two protein bands, 35 and 38 kDa, in tissues expressing the MagT1 transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Two bands were apparent in kidney and liver tissue whereas one was evident in heart, colon, and brain. The molecular size of MagT1 calculated from cDNA is 38 kDa. A significant difference in the calculated molecular size and that the smaller band found by immunoblot analysis raises the possibility that MagT1 may be cleaved to yield the 35 kDa carboxyl-terminal protein detected by MagT1 antibody. There was very little MagT1 protein in the small intestine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Other than liver tissue, there appears to be a good correlation between the respective amounts of transcripts and the protein content. The discrepancy between the levels of MagT1 mRNA and protein expression in liver (abundant mRNA detected but little protein detected) suggests that a posttranslational mechanism may play a role in tissue-specific expression of the MagT1 protein. In summary, the 38 kDa MagT1 protein is expressed to a variable extent in all of the tissues sampled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) but the 35 kDa band appears to be present in only some of the tissues. Although this is a limited survey of tissues, the results suggest that MagT1 is expressed in many tissues with an apparent correlation of mRNA and protein but expression may be post-translationally modified in a tissue-specific fashion such as the liver.</p>
        <p>The specificity of the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-MagT1 antibody was assessed by Western blots of the total protein extract from the MDCT cells probed with a preimmune serum. No protein of the predicted size (~35 kDa) was detected when the preimmune serum was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that the affinity-purified anti-MagT1 antibody specifically reacts with the endogenous MagT1 protein.</p>

        <title>Human MagT1 elicits Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes</title>
        <p>The functional properties of MagT1-evoked Mg<sup>2+ </sup>currents were characterized using two-microelectrode voltage clamp analysis in Xenopus oocytes injected with hMagT1 cRNA. The electrophysiological data gave evidence for a rheogenic process with inward currents in hMagT1 cRNA-injected oocytes whereas there were no appreciable currents in control H<sub>2</sub>O- or total poly(A)<sup>+</sup>RNA-injected cells from the same batch of oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Human MagT1-mediated Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked uptake was linear for at least 20 min and did not display any time-dependent decay during repetitive stimulation with voltage steps (data not shown). The reversal potential was significantly shifted to the right as would be expected of a magnesium transporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In consonant with the notion that MagT1 protein mediates the observed Mg<sup>2+ </sup>currents is the association of the magnitude of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked current with the quantity of MagT1 protein in oocytes injected with MagT1 cRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In this study oocytes were selected according to the size of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked current and Western blotting performed on the same oocyte. Both 38 and 35 kDa molecular size bands were correlated with the measured currents. Steady-state Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents were saturable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The Michaelis constant (K<sub>m</sub>) was 0.23 mM, n = 29, when measured at -125 mV holding potential (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, insert). The Michaelis constant was independent of the V<sub>m </sub>used to determine the saturation kinetics. The Michaelis constants (K<sub>m</sub>) were +25 mV, 0.22 mM; -50 mV, 0.19 mM; -75, 0.20 mM; -100 mV, 0.19 mM; -125 mV, 0.23; -150 mV, 0.23 mM (data not shown).</p>

        <p>The Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents were not altered with deletion of external sodium by substitution with choline (89 Â± 9 %, n = 3, of control currents) or replacement of chloride with nitrate (100 Â± 1 %, n = 3, of control) suggesting that transport does not depend on extracellular Na<sup>+ </sup>or Cl<sup>- </sup>(data not shown). Niflumic acid (0.5 mM), a Cl<sup>- </sup>channel antagonist, did not affect Mg<sup>2+ </sup>currents (data not shown). Next, we determined the effect of transmembrane H<sup>+ </sup>gradients on Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in MagT1-injected oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Currents are maximal at physiological pH, 7.4, and diminished with acidic and alkaline pH values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Moreover, amiloride (0.1 mM), a Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+ </sup>exchange inhibitor, did not influence expressed Mg<sup>2+ </sup>currents in oocytes (data not shown). This data suggests that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents are not coupled to H<sup>+ </sup>movement but are sensitive to external pH. On balance, these data indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in MagT1-injected oocytes are not coupled to Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, or H<sup>+ </sup>but are influenced by external pH values.</p>

In the experiments shown, the permeability ratios (E<sub>rev </sub>for tested cation relative to E<sub>rev </sub>for Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were corrected for changes in membrane resistance caused by the respective divalent cation using values from H<sub>2</sub>O-injected oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p>
        <p>Some divalent cations inhibited Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents at relatively large concentrations of the respective inhibitor, 0.2 mM, in the presence of 2.0 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The cations Ni<sup>2+</sup>and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>markedly shifted the ÎE<sub>rev </sub>to the left whereas Mn<sup>2+</sup>was less effective and Gd<sup>3+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+ </sup>and Cu<sup>2+ </sup>were modest inhibitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The multivalent cation, Gd<sup>3+</sup>, is a nonselective channel blocker that inhibits most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels and known TRP channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The presence of 0.2 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) or 10.0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 98 Â± 8 % (data not shown), was without effect on the amplitude of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents. Fe<sup>2+ </sup>had no influence on MagT1-mediated currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). On balance, these data indicate that hMagT1 cRNA-induced transport in oocytes is highly selective for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Other divalent cations may be blockers but our evidence is that they are at most very weak agonists.</p>
        <p>We have shown that relatively high concentrations of 1,4-dihydropyridine analogues, organic blockers of L-type Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels, inhibit Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry into distal tubule epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present experiments, nifedipine (10 Î¼M) did not inhibit Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents (0.61 Â± 0.08 Î¼A at -125 mV, n = 5) but its analogue nitrendipine (10 Î¼M) was an effective inhibitor (0.15 Â± 0.02 Î¼A, n = 7) in MagT1 expressed oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Control Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced currents were 0.59 Â± 0.09 Î¼A, n = 6, in this series of experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). These findings were similar to our experience with MDCK and MDCT epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Again in consonant with our previous studies, the channel agonist, BAY K8644 (10 Î¼M) stimulated Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in expressing oocytes (0.80 Â± 0.18 Î¼A, n = 5) supporting the above electrophysiological data that MagT1 is a channel-like protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>).</p>

        <title>MagT1 expression is responsive to magnesium</title>
        <p>The rationale for these studies is based on the observation that renal magnesium conservation is principally regulated by differential expression of genes encoding magnesium transport proteins. Accordingly, we determined the response of MagT1 to changes in magnesium at the messenger and protein levels. These studies were performed with distal tubule epithelial cells, MDCT, cultured in media containing normal (1.0 mM) or low (nominally magnesium-free) magnesium concentrations for 16 h and on kidney cortex tissue harvested from mice maintained on either normal or magnesium-restricted diets for 5 days. The mRNA and protein expression was relatively stronger in cells cultured in low magnesium media and in tissue of mice maintained on low magnesium diets (urine and plasma magnesium concentration, 1.1 Â± 0.3 and 0.13 Â± 0.01 mM, respectively) compared to normal cells and tissue of animals on normal diets (urine and plasma magnesium, 13.2 Â± 1.2 and 0.75 Â± 0.09 mM, respectively). MDCT and tissue mMagT1 mRNA, as measured by real-time RT-PCR was increased by 2.1-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). In association with the increases in mRNA, MagT1 protein was increased by 31 Â± 12% in the cultured epithelial cells and 33 Â± 6 % in kidney cortex with low magnesium relative to the respective controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>). Accordingly, it is apparent that an increase in mRNA levels is translated into higher protein expression and by inference leads to greater magnesium transport (the latter conclusion is based on the urinary magnesium excretion of animals maintained on low magnesium relative to normal diets).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite the extensive evidence for unique mammalian Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transporters, few proteins have been biochemically identified to date that fulfill this role. Moreover, functional characterization has not been fully investigated for those that have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. With the knowledge that the kidney, particularly the distal tubule, regulates magnesium conservation through transcriptional mechanisms, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify MagT1, a novel Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The MagT1 transcript is a 2.4-kb mRNA that encodes a protein comprising a relatively long <italic>N</italic>-terminal segment, a putative region of four TM domains, and a short C-terminal sequence. The cytoplasmic segments possess a number of characteristic phosphorylation motifs. MagT1 shows no structural similarity to any known transporter. Functional expression of MagT1 in oocytes results in large Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents with little permeability to other divalent cations. However, some divalent cations, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Mn<sup>2+</sup>inhibit Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents at relatively large external concentrations. These cations are not found in the extracellular or intracellular fluid at the concentrations used here, 0.2 mM. The other major extracellular divalent cation, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, was neither transported nor were Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents inhibited by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. MagT1 is widely distributed among tissues particularly those of epithelial structure. Finally, MagT1 expression is regulated in these tissues by external magnesium as predicted by our starting premise. Accordingly, MagT1 fulfills the role of a dedicated mammalian magnesium transporter. The function of MagT1 in cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>balance remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>The electrophysiological characteristics of MagT1 expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes are reminiscent of our observations of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport in intact renal epithelial cells measured by microfluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There is not a suitable isotope of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>for use in physiological experiments so that we have used fura-mag-2 fluorescence to investigate Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have shown that Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake in a variety of epithelial cells is driven by the electrochemical gradient of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Membrane hyperpolarization stimulates Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport whereas depolarization abrogates uptake (19). There was no evidence in renal distal tubule cells for coupling of apical Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry to other ions such as Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, or H<sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Magnesium transport in immortalized mouse distal convoluted tubule (MDCT) cells is dependent on the transmembrane concentration gradient and uptake is saturable, as determined by fluorescence. The apparent affinity constant is in the order of 0.5 mM that is similar to that observed for MagT1 expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This affinity is appropriate for a physiological role of the transporter in cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in oocytes expressing MagT1 is highly specific for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, an observation that is again consonant with our views of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport in MDCT cells and in vivo kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The microfluorescence experiments suggest that there may be some variability in cationic inhibition of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake depending on the cell-type used so that other transporters may be present with differing selectivity that are tissue specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Relatively large concentrations of nitrendipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine channel blocker, inhibited Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in MagT1-expressing oocytes not unlike the inhibition of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry into distal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Intriguingly, nifedipine did not influence Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced currents in MagT1-expressing oocytes that is similar to our previous reports using MDCT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although both antagonists are dihydropyridines, they have differing efficacy based on their structural differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Again, reminiscent of our observations using MDCK and MDCT epithelial cells, the channel agonist, BAY 8644, increased Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The 1,4-dihydropyridines analogues are not highly selective channel blockers/activators but these findings support the notion that Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry into MagT1-expressed oocytes or distal epithelial cells is via channel-like proteins. Two other characteristics are noteworthy. First, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-evoked currents in MagT1-expressed oocytes are greater at physiological pH values relative to acidic pH. This is also true for Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake in distal tubule epithelial cells and magnesium conservation by the intact kidney in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Magnesium reabsorption is greater and urinary excretion is less in metabolic alkalosis than acidosis. Indeed, magnesium wasting may be sufficient in chronic metabolic acidosis to lead to hypomagnesemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Second, the presence of multiple putative protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites in MagT1 may suggest phosphorylation-dependent regulation. We have shown that Mg<sup>2+ </sup>entry into epithelial cells is stimulated by peptide hormones, such as parathyroid hormone, glucagon and calcitonin, that act through protein kinases A and C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. On balance, many of the functional characteristics of MagT1 expressed in oocytes are harmonious with our earlier physiological observations using kidney distal convoluted tubule cells.</p>
      <p>MagT1 is a membrane protein that may comprise ER, early and late endosomes or apical and basolateral plasma membrane fractions. The role of each of these structures in cellular magnesium homeostasis is poorly understood. Using single cell spatial imaging, we have previously shown that intracellular ionized Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentration is heterogenously distributed across the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The ER or sarcoplasmic reticulum normally contains high concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ranging from 0.4â2.0 mM, relative to the cytosolic concentration, 0.5 mM, and nucleus, 0.32 mM. It is clear that Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is transported into and out of a variety of intracellular compartments and there is likely dedicated magnesium transporters for each event. Further studies are required to establish the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>and the role of MagT1 protein.</p>
      <p>Our evidence is that the expression of MagT1 mRNA and protein is responsive to cellular magnesium. The ability of epithelial cells to selectively respond to the availability of essential nutrients, such as Zn<sup>2+ </sup>and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, is not unique but the cellular mechanisms are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Presumably epithelial cells may sensitively sense intracellular nutrient concentration and through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms adjust transport rates appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our studies indicate that this response within the cell is the basis for sensitive and selective control of magnesium balance in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>Epithelial cells comprising the intestine and kidney are primarily involved with dietary magnesium absorption, urinary magnesium excretion, and total body magnesium homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Accordingly, MagT1 may, in part, be responsible for intestinal and renal tubular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>conservation. In support of this is the observation that the MagT1 transcript is present in these tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, magnesium is necessary in all cells and the wide-spread distribution of the MagT1 transcript may suggest a housekeeping role for this transporter. It is also germane to note that MagT1 mRNA is regulated in all cells investigated. Further studies are needed to define the function of MagT1 in intestine and kidney and the role in overall cellular magnesium balance.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We have identified a novel magnesium transporter, probably a channel, that is regulated by extracellular magnesium. To our knowledge this is the first report of a highly selective Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transporter. Its role in cellular magnesium homeostasis and transepithelial magnesium absorption is unknown but our evidence from our differential gene expression studies indicate that it plays an important in cellular magnesium homeostasis.</p>

The MDCT cell line has been extensively used by us to study renal magnesium transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Cells were grown in Basal Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12, 1:1, media (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), 1 mM glucose, 5 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin in a humidified environment of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>- 95% air at 37Â°C. Where indicated, subconfluent MDCT cells were cultured in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free media (Stem Cell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC) for 4 h.

Samples of total RNA (20 Î¼g) or poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA (8 Î¼g) were denatured in 2.2 M formaldehyde, 50% (v/v) formamide buffer and electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose 3 M formaldehyde, 0.02 M MOPS, 8 mM Na acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0 gels. The size-fractionated RNA was transferred to GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN) by downward alkali transfer and UV crosslinked (Stratagene Stratalinker 1800). Membranes were probed with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probes made from gene specific inserts represented in the microarray analytical results. The probe templates were prepared from PCR products representing inserts using specific primers on cDNA prepared from MDCT cells. The inserts were ligated into pGEM-t vector (Promega) following QiaexII gel (Qiagen) purification. Blots were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5 X SSPE, 100 Î¼g/ml denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 5 X Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 42EC in a rotating hybridization oven (Tyler HI-16000).

Affinity-purified rabbit anti-human MagT1 antibody was diluted in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.5 % BSA at a final concentration about 0.7 Î¼l/ml.

Oocytes were injected with MagT1 complementary RNA (cRNA) or for control observations, H<sub>2</sub>O or kidney total poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA; no Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced currents were detected in the latter.</p>
        <p><italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes were prepared and injected with cRNA and electrophysiological recordings were preformed according to previously described techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Briefly, defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes were typically injected with 25 ng cRNA in 50 nl H<sub>2</sub>O.

All experiments were performed at room temperature (21Â°C).</p>
        <p>Steady-state membrane currents were recorded with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Electrophysiology consisted of a voltage clamp step profile consisting of a holding potential of -15 mV, followed by 8 episode series of +25 mV steps of 2 s duration, from -150 mV to +25 mV within an episode duration of 6.14 sec. Each episode recorded 1536 data points collected at 4 ms intervals. The data was filtered at the appropriate frequency before digitization. In order to assess the permeability of different divalent cations, we used the shift in the reversal potentials of the respective cation from the reversal potentials of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>currents, ÎE<sub>rev</sub>, and calculated by the permeability ratio by:</p>
        <p><italic>P</italic><sub>x</sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub>Mg </sub>= exp/(ÎE<sub>rev </sub>X <italic>F</italic>/<italic>RT</italic>)</p>
        <p>where <italic>R</italic>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>F </italic>have their standard meanings. Voltage clamp episodes in the presence of extracellular test cations were corrected against episodes in the absence of external test cations.</p>
        <p>All experimental conditions were performed on oocytes harvested from a minimum of 3 different animals.</p>

Current-voltage relationships obtained from linear voltage steps from -150 mV to +25 mV in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free solutions or those containing the indicated concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of -15 mV and stepped from -150 mV to +25 mV in 25 mV increments for 2 s at each of the concentrations indicated. Shown are average I-V curves obtained from control H2O-injected (n = 13) or MagT1-expressing (n =/&gt;7) oocytes. Note, the positive shift in reversal potential, indicated by arrows, with increments in magnesium concentration. Values are mean Â± SEM of observations measured at the end of each voltage sweep for the respective Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. </p>
