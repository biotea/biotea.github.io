      <abstract>
        <p>Signaling output of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) is determined by two sets of opposing interactions, one with heterotetrameric complexes of cell surface receptors, the other with secreted antagonists that act as ligand traps. We identified two mutations (N445K,T) in patients with multiple synostosis syndrome (SYM1) in the BMPârelated ligand <italic>GDF5</italic>. Functional studies of both mutants in chicken micromass culture demonstrated a gain of function caused by a resistance to the BMPâinhibitor NOGGIN and an altered signaling effect. Residue N445, situated within overlapping receptor and antagonist interfaces, is highly conserved among the BMP family with the exception of BMP9 and BMP10, in which it is substituted with lysine. Like the mutant GDF5, both BMPs are insensitive to NOGGIN and show a high chondrogenic activity. Ectopic expression of BMP9 or the GDF5 mutants resulted in massive induction of cartilage in an in vivo chick model presumably by bypassing the feedback inhibition imposed by endogenous NOGGIN. Swapping residues at the mutation site alone was not sufficient to render Bmp9 NOG-sensitive; however, successive introduction of two additional substitutions imparted high to total sensitivity on customized variants of Bmp9. In conclusion, we show a new mechanism for abnormal joint development that interferes with a naturally occurring regulatory mechanism of BMP signaling.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The development of the human skeleton is regulated by intricate signaling pathways involving secreted molecules that bind to cell surface receptors to elicit a response in the target cell. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are an important part of this process. Their signaling capacity is regulated on several levels including the extracellular space where inhibitors such as Noggin prevent BMPs from binding to their cognate receptors. We here describe that specific mutations of a single amino acid in GDF5, a member of the BMP family, cause congenital fusion of joints. Investigating the effect of the mutation in detail, we can show that the mutant GDF5 is no longer inhibited by Noggin, thus providing a functional explanation for the patients' phenotype. Furthermore, we show that the mutated residue (N445) is conserved throughout the BMP family, with the exception of BMP9 and BMP10, that carry the same amino acid at this position as the mutant GDF5. Both are, just as the mutant, resistant to inhibition by Noggin. Variants of BMPs that are insensitive to antagonists may induce bone formation more effectively, providing a source for effective, low-dose therapeutics for clinical applications.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and the related Growth &amp; Differentiation Factors (GDFs) are phylogenetically conserved signaling proteins that belong to the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFÎ²) superfamily. Originally identified for their ability to induce bone, they were subsequently shown to be involved in multiple aspects of body patterning and morphogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Kishigami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Urist1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mutations in BMPs and their receptors can cause a wide variety of congenital and postnatal diseases <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Seemann1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite their different functions, all BMPs share a common signaling mechanism. They are translated as precursor proteins consisting of a prodomain, which is released proteolytically by members of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Constam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which is important to activate signaling that is conferred through the mature domain <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Plger1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The highly conserved mature domain is characterized by seven cysteine residues. Six of them form an intramolecular cysteine knot whereas the fourth of the seven cysteines is important for the dimerization of the BMP monomers <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Scheufler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. BMPs are secreted peptides that act as homo- or heterodimers and bind to two different types of membrane-spanning serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I BMP receptors (ACVRL1, ACVR1, BMPR1A, BMPR1B) and type II BMP receptors (BMPR2, ACVR2). Binding of BMPs to heterotetrameric receptor complexes activate the SMAD as well as other intracellular signaling pathways, like the MAPK pathway <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Nohe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

        <p>We identified a heterozygous missense mutation c.1335T&gt;G leading to an exchange of the hydrophilic asparagine to basic lysine (p.N445K) in three family members with SYNS1. The mutation segregated in an autosomal dominant manner. The clinically unaffected mother of two affected children did not show the p.N445K mutation arguing for the presence of a germline mosaicism. In addition, we identified a de novo asparagine to threonine (p.N445T) mutation (c.1334A&gt;C) in another patient with SYNS1. All four affected patients exhibited the characteristic features of severe SYNS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The radiographs showed bilateral fusions of carpal and tarsal bones as well as proximal symphalangism in fingers and toes. Distal phalanges of fingers and toes II to V were hypoplastic and some nails appeared small. Fusions between humerus and radius were present in all four patients leading to fixation of the elbow joints in a flexed position. Mild cutaneous syndactyly was present in some individuals. The phenotype was congenital and appeared to be non-progressive.</p>

        <title>BMP9 and BMP10 are naturally insensitive to inhibition by NOG</title>
        <p>BMP9 and BMP10 share the same amino acid residue at this position as one of the SYNS1- associated mutants. We analyzed Bmp9 and Bmp10 in the micromass system and observed an even stronger chondrogenic effect than for wtGdf5, indicating that they are potent inducers of chondrogenic differentiation. Co-expression of Nog did not suppress chondrogenesis significantly, demonstrating that both ligands are naturally Nog-insensitive unlike most other Bmps. To test whether the substitution shared by Bmp9 and Bmp10 conferred resistance to Nog, we swapped the wildtype lysine residue of Bmp9 with asparagine (K371N), the residue shared by most Bmp family ligands, including Gdf5. This exchange was not sufficient to transform Bmp9 into a Nog-sensitive Bmp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g004">Figure 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D</xref>), indicating that additional residues must contribute to diminished binding.

Introducing a second swap (YH415Q) at a contact with the NOG N-terminal extension or âclipâ diminished biological activity substantially upon co-expression of Nog. A third successive mutation (K348L), located on the periphery of the type II receptor interface, rendered Bmp9 completely Nog-sensitive relative to the control, without significantly affecting the prochondrogenic potential of the custom variant in the absence of Nog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>).</p>

Although rhBMP2 was completely inhibited by equimolar rhNOG, the apparent affinity of rhGDF5 for the antagonist was markedly less pronounced, requiring super-stoichiometric ratios to achieve total inhibition.

        <title>Increased biological activity of NOG-insensitive BMPs from bypassed feedback inhibition of Nog upregulation</title>
        <p>Stimulation of micromass cultures with recombinant proteins revealed stronger chondrogenic differentiation with rhN445T GDF5 than with rhGDF5 or rhBMP2. Because of the high potency of rhBMP9, a 1â¶20 dilution was employed to prevent saturation effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Quantitative real time PCR showed that treatment of micromass cultures with rhGDF5, rhN445T GDF5, rhBMP2 or rhBMP9 resulted in an upregulation of Nog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Upregulation of Nog by exogenous rhBMP was also examined in vivo. Heparin beads soaked with recombinant protein were implanted into chicken limb buds and in situ hybridization for Nog was performed. Implantation of rhBMP9 soaked beads (0.5 mg/ml) at day four (HH25â27) resulted in early lethality (nâ=â40). To avoid this effect, the beads were implanted at a later stage (HH29/30) containing less protein (0.25 mg/ml). In agreement with the in vitro results, we observed a strong upregulation of endogenous Nog surrounding beads indicating that wildtype as well as mutant BMPs induce the expression of their inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). To further evaluate and compare activity of growth factors in vivo, we overexpressed wtGdf5, N445T Gdf5, N445K Gdf5 and Bmp9 in developing chicken hind limb buds. Overexpression of wtGdf5 caused a general thickening of skeletal elements, with fusions of joints as well as digits. Overexpression of N445K and N445T Gdf5 resulted in a much more severe phenotype. The entire limb morphed into a single cartilage element, without joints or even soft tissue. Injection of Bmp9 had a lethal effect; however the Bmp9-infected embryos that survived (7 out of 40) showed a phenotype similar to N445 Gdf5 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, the increased biological activity of the GDF5 mutants as well as BMP9 may arise in large part from insensitivity to endogenously upregulated Nog.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Transduction of temporally and spatially specific signals through the BMP pathway in a diverse array of cellular contexts is achieved in part by differential affinities of the receptors of the heterotetrameric-signaling complex for the array of ligands in the family. However, differential affinity to secreted inhibitors that act as ligand traps plays a reciprocal, equally important role in context-specific tuning of BMP signals. Here, we show that single point mutations (N445K,T) in the wrist epitope of the BMP-related ligand GDF5 lead to a resistance to Nog, and a subsequent dramatic increase in the intensity of the signaling output. Moreover, we show that wildtype BMP9 and BMP10, two divergent members of the family that harbor the asparagine for lysine substitution, are markedly resistant to Nog in limb bud micromass and C2C12 myoblast cell assays.</p>
      <p>The GDF5 mutations N445K,T are associated with an inherited skeletal disease characterized by joint fusions in fingers, toes and elbows. This phenotype is similar to that of SYNS1, previously associated with hypomorphic alleles of <italic>NOG</italic>. SYM1, a less severe condition in which symphalangism is limited to the small interphalangeal joints of the fourth and fifth finger, is also caused by mutations in <italic>NOG</italic>. We have previously shown that a SYM1-like phenotype can also result from gain of function mutations in <italic>GDF5</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Seemann2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GDF5 mutations described here affect the wrist epitope, which is the polypeptide segment between the third and fourth conserved cysteine residue that is most divergent as shown in the multiple sequence alignment of TGFÎ² superfamily ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Because the wrist epitope is a key element of the type I receptor interface, the divergence may reflect the differential affinity of the superfamily of signaling ligands for their specific receptors. In addition, the diversity may reflect differential affinity for the array of secreted antagonists. For example, TGFÎ² ligands are deposited extracellularly as an inactive latent complex not regulated by secreted antagonists, whereas BMP/GDF ligands can bind with picomolar affinity, or evade inhibition almost entirely, as we have shown here for the interaction of NOG with the divergent BMP9, BMP10 pair <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Massague2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Zimmerman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Functional studies of the N445K,T mutations suggest a dual effect of the mutations - an altered signaling effect on the one hand and resistance to NOG on the other. Whereas the insensitivity of N445K,T mutations was clearly demonstrated in retroviral overexpression studies or by stimulation with recombinant proteins, the altered signaling effect could not be finally clarified on a molecular level. The fact that - in contrast to rhGDF5 - the rhN445T GDF5 mutant induced significant amounts of ALP in C2C12 cells prompted us to speculate on altered receptor specificity. This hypothesis was further analyzed by neutralization assays of different TGFbeta type 1 receptors and Biacore analyses. RhN445T GDF5 seemed to be slightly more sensitive to the inhibition by BMPR1Aecd and BMPR1Becd, but no significant changes of receptor affinities were detected. The different signaling effect might be explained either by different association and dissociation rates of the ligand-receptor complex or by the involvement of other co-receptors.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the reported R438L mutation in GDF5 lies within the same domain, i.e. the wrist epitope (type I receptor interface as well as NOG binding interface). Yet it results in altered receptor specificity with increased affinity to the BMPR1A, and not affecting the inhibition by NOG. The R438 position is not conserved within the BMP/GDF subgroup. We demonstrated that the rhR438L GDF5 mutant has a higher affinity for the BMPR1A receptor than rhGDF5, giving this mutant BMP2-like properties. BMP2 is also inhibited by NOG, which indicates that this amino acid change seems to have an effect on the receptor specificity only, but otherwise it is well tolerated by the BMP antagonist NOG.</p>
      <p>The similarity of the resulting phenotypes caused by either loss of function NOG mutations or activating mutations in GDF5 argues in favour of GDF5 representing the most important target for NOG during the critical phase of joint development and indicates that SYM1/SYNS1 are associated with an increased biological activity of GDF5.</p>
      <p>The crystal structure of the NOG-BMP7 complex showed that NOG, a covalently linked homodimer, inhibits BMP signaling by blocking the molecular interfaces of the binding epitopes for both type I and type II receptors, sequestering the covalently linked homodimeric ligand in an inactive complex <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Groppe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the crystal structure of GDF5 <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Schreuder1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, the conserved asparagine (N445) is located near the amino terminal end of the large helix (Î±3), its amide sidechain projecting tangential to, and hydrogen bonding with, the backbone of the long finger 2 at a main chain carbonyl (E491) across the dimer interface. Superposition of the GDF5 crystal structure on BMP7 in the NOG-BMP7 complex provides a model of the NOG-GDF5 complex for interpretation of the role of the conserved asparagine and the consequences of the mutations. In the model, just as in the NOG-BMP7 crystal structure, the amide nitrogen of the asparagine sidechain is hydrogen bonded to two main chain carbonyl groups, one across the dimer interface (GDF5 E491) and one along the extended N-terminal 14 clip of the antagonist (NOG A36). In addition to this triangulated interaction, the carbonyl oxygen of the N445 sidechain also forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain via the amide nitrogen of NOG A36. Furthermore, in a superposition model of a GDF5-type I receptor complex, the asparagine sidechain appears to interact with E81 and G82 across the ligand-receptor interface. Thus, loss of the amide group by substitution with a lysine or threonine side chain in the N445K,T mutants would on the one hand disrupt two stabilizing interactions within the NOG-GDF5 complex, and, on the other hand, alter the ligand-receptor interface resulting in a broader specificity. With respect to the differential effects of threonine substitution on interaction with NOG, superposition of GDF5 and BMP7 in the crystal structure of the BMP7-NOG complex reveals a major structural difference between the two ligands at the interface with the key residue of the N-terminal extension of NOG, P35, also a site of several human mutations linked to SYM1 <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Groppe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Lehmann1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Due largely to major conformational differences in the backbone and side chains of the short finger 1 of GDF5 relative to the BMPs, the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the proline side chain is predicted to be only half formed, which would disrupt the stabilizing interaction to a similar extent as mutation of P35. Thus, interaction between wildtype GDF5 and NOG is anticipated to be weaker than that between BMPs and NOG, as evidenced by our titration assays which required super-stoichiometric ratios (<italic>cf.</italic>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000747-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), perhaps so much so that disruption of the adjacent interaction between the conserved asparagine and the backbone of the N-terminal extension (A36) is sufficient to abolish formation of the GDF5-NOG complex. BMP9 and BMP10, which are not responsive to inhibition by NOG, do not bear the homologous asparagine residue. However introduction of the asparagine in BMP9 was not sufficient to confer sensitivity to NOG. Successive introduction of two additional GDF5-like substitutions, removal of a BMP9-specific insert (YH415Q) and K348L, imparted near total sensitivity. In conclusion, while substitution of the single asparagine is sufficient to impart NOG sensitivity in GDF5, other BMPs require further structural alteration in order to impart sensitivity, or resistance. Because ligand-receptor and ligand-antagonist complexes are sufficiently structurally conserved within the BMP/GDF family, GDF5 function was successfully transferred to BMP9 by rounds of rational design.</p>
      <p>Currently, rhBMP2, rhBMP7, and rhGDF5 are used in clinical applications for bone regeneration or are under investigation in clinical trials. Although BMPs are very potent in cell culture systems or small animal models (nanograms), significantly higher concentrations are needed for measurable effects in humans (milligrams). It was shown that BMP antagonists are regulated during fracture healing <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Hecht1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, indicating that endogenous regulation of the BMP signaling cascade may neutralize exogenously applied rhBMPs, necessitating higher doses than required in vitro. In keeping with this hypothesis, the in vivo and in vitro studies presented here demonstrated induction of Nog after treatment with rhBMPs, an apparent physiological response to regulate and constrict BMP action. The upregulation of inhibitors in response to exogenous growth factors may therefore also be applied for BMP treatment, which can only be partially compensated for by high dosage due to feedback control mechanisms <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Gazzerro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1000747-Merino1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1000747-Nifuji1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Thus, variant BMPs that are insensitive to antagonist may induce bone formation more effectively, providing a source for effective, low-dose therapeutics for clinical applications.</p>
