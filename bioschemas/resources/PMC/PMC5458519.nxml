      <abstract>
        <p>Pladienolide, herboxidiene and spliceostatin have been identified as splicing modulators that target SF3B1 in the SF3b subcomplex. Here we report that PHF5A, another component of this subcomplex, is also targeted by these compounds. Mutations in PHF5A-Y36, SF3B1-K1071, SF3B1-R1074 and SF3B1-V1078 confer resistance to these modulators, suggesting a common interaction site. RNA-seq analysis reveals that PHF5A-Y36C has minimal effect on basal splicing but inhibits the global action of splicing modulators. Moreover, PHF5A-Y36C alters splicing modulator-induced intron-retention/exon-skipping profile, which correlates with the differential GC content between adjacent introns and exons. We determine the crystal structure of human PHF5A demonstrating that Y36 is located on a highly conserved surface. Analysis of the cryo-EM spliceosome B<sup>act</sup> complex shows that the resistance mutations cluster in a pocket surrounding the branch point adenosine, suggesting a competitive mode of action. Collectively, we propose that PHF5AâSF3B1 forms a central node for binding to these splicing modulators.</p>

  <body>
    <p>RNA splicing is catalysed by the spliceosome, a dynamic multiproteinâRNA complex composed of five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) and associated proteins. The spliceosome assembles on pre-mRNAs to establish a dynamic cascade of multiple RNA and protein interactions that catalyse excision of the introns and ligation of exons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Accumulating evidence has linked human diseases to dysregulation in RNA splicing, e.g., mutations in splicing regulatory sequences that disrupt the splicing of specific genes or functional alterations of spliceosomal components that impact the splicing of many genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Recent studies have revealed that splicing factors such as SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2 are frequently mutated in multiple haematological malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing splicing-modulating small-molecules or oligonucleotides as therapeutic approaches to treating these diseases. Some of these have been or are being tested in clinical trials for cancer and severe neuromuscular diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>A number of small-molecule compounds have been identified to possess selective activities in modulating or inhibiting splicing; however, the direct targets and/or exact mechanism of action are still ambiguous. Using biotinylated chemical probes and photo-crosslinking, the SF3b complex was identified as a binding target for spliceostatin A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, pladienolide B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and herboxidiene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The SF3b complex is part of the U2 snRNAâprotein complex (snRNP) assembled by U2 snRNA, splicing factors SF3a and SF3b, and other associated proteins. Together, these form the 17S U2 snRNP that assembles in an ATP-dependent fashion at the 3â² side of the intron to form the A complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The SF3b core complex contains several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs), including SF3B1/SAP155, SF3B2/SAP145, SF3B3/SAP130, SF3B4/SAP49, SF3B5/SAP10, SF3B6/SAP14a and PHF5A/SAP14b. These proteins are thought to bind to the branch point region. The most characterized target of small-molecule splicing modulators is SF3B1, which has been co-immunoprecipitated by biotinylated spliceostatin A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and crosslinked to herboxidiene analogue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p>In addition to probing the physical interaction, phenotypic-resistant clone profiling has been utilized as a powerful method to uncover the cellular targets for small-molecule inhibitors, based on the hypothesis that under selection pressure, resistant mutation(s) in the target(s) or relevant pathway(s) are likely to offer the most survival advantage. This approach can also be used prospectively to predict resistance mutations that may emerge in a clinical setting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and typically involves either stepwise induction of compound dosage or multiple rounds of enrichment to select for the most resistant clones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Indeed, such an approach led to the discovery of a single amino acid substitution (R1074H) in SF3B1, which almost completely abolished the splicing-modulating and antiproliferative effects of pladienolide B and E7107 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). This established that SF3B1 is likely a direct binding partner for pladienolides. However, the precise compound binding site and the role of other components of the SF3b complex remain unclear.</p>
    <p>Here, by integrating structural and biochemical approaches with a modified chemogenomic strategy utilizing structurally different splicing modulators at permissive dosage for resistant mutation(s) mapping, we report that PHF5A, a core component of the SF3b complex, is a common cellular target of splicing-modulating chemical probes, including herboxidiene, pladienolide, spliceostatin and sudemycin. We also show that PHF5A-Y36, SF3B1-V1078 and SF3B1-K1071, in addition to previously reported SF3B1-R1074 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), are key residues for small-molecule splicing modulators to bind to the SF3b complex. These mutations confer resistance to splicing modulation and cell growth inhibition induced by these compounds. Mechanistic investigation on PHF5A-Y36C reveals a dynamic splicing modulation (exon skipping (ES)âintron retention (IR) switch) by small-molecule splicing modulators, which reflects the differential sensitivity of individual introns to splicing modulator activities. Analysis of our crystal structure of human PHF5A and the yeast cryo-EM structure of the spliceosome B<sup>act</sup> complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> place these mutations at the interface of PHF5A and SF3B1 in the branchpoint adenosine (BPA) binding site. Biochemical analysis with reconstituted splicing modulator-binding protein complex and mutagenesis data of the Y36 residue further confirm the mechanism of the resistance mutation. Taken together, we propose PHF5AâSF3B1 form a binding site for these small-molecule splicing modulators, offering approaches to modulate specific splicing events.</p>

        <title>Splicing modulator-resistant mutations in PHF5A and SF3B1</title>
        <p>A group of splicing modulators were first discovered as natural products that are cytotoxic to cancer cells and later shown to target the SF3b complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To further investigate their mechanism of action, we explored the possibility of resistant clone generation with lower stress levels of compound via continuous administration of either lower dosage of E7107 (4ânM, â¼3 Ã GI<sub>50</sub>), a pladienolide derivative, or a less potent, structurally different splicing modulator, herboxidiene at 20ânM (â¼3 Ã GI<sub>50</sub>) in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), whereas previous approaches used stepwise induction of pladienolide B or E7107 doses up to 100ânM (â¼130 Ã GI<sub>50</sub> in WiDR cells) to isolate resistant clones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. This less stringent approach could potentially mitigate off-target activity at high concentrations, as well as enhance the possibility to identify subtle but common mechanisms of splicing modulators. After 2 weeks of selection, six resistant clones from each treatment were expanded and subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WXS) to identify candidate causal genes for resistance to splicing modulators. Compared to the parental line, totally about 11,000 single-nucleotide variants and indels were identified with greater than 20% allele frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). However, after cross-referencing with our curated splicing related gene list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>) and focusing on genes affected in at least three individual clones, mutations in only two genes were consistently scored. Five out of six E7107-resistant clones and two of the six herboxidiene-resistant clones carried mutations in SF3B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), including the previously identified R1074H mutation and two previously unidentified mutations, V1078A and V1078I, strengthening the evidence that this region of SF3B1 is critical for splicing modulator action. Interestingly, the remaining E7107-resistant clone and four herboxidiene-resistant clones carried a Y36C mutation in PHF5A, an essential component of the SF3b complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). All identified mutations in PHF5A and SF3B1 were further confirmed by targeted Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, Sanger sequencing revealed that one independent clone from 20ânM herboxidiene treatment appeared to be a pool of two individual populations, which harboured both PHF5A-Y36C and a K1071E mutation in SF3B1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). While the apparent bias in mutation occurrences in either SF3B1 or PHF5A in the resistant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) may implicate differences in how the pladienolide and herboxidiene scaffolds interact with the SF3b complex, these data strongly suggest that both proteins are common cellular targets for splicing modulators.</p>
        <p>Growth inhibition profiling of the different resistant clones revealed that the SF3B1-R1074H mutation conferred the most robust resistance to E7107 whereas the PHF5A-Y36C and SF3B1-V1078 mutations were weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the SF3B1-R1074H mutation also conferred better resistance to spliceostatin A and sudemycin D6, both chemically related to FR901464, which is structurally different from pladienolides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). In contrast, the PHF5A-Y36C mutation rendered more resistance in response to herboxidiene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>), in line with the higher percentage of clones harbouring this mutation after herboxidiene selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Mutations in SF3B1 or PHF5A did not affect the cell lines' sensitivity to bortezomib, a pan-cytotoxic proteasome inhibitor, highlighting the specificity of the mutations toward splicing modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). To validate the apparent preference for different scaffolds, we expanded growth inhibition profiling to additional compounds and directly compared the GI<sub>50</sub> shift in the SF3B1 R1074H clone over the parental line versus the GI<sub>50</sub> shift in the PHF5A Y36C clone. It is evident that both resistant mutations conferred resistance to all examined splicing modulators. More importantly, compounds appeared to cluster based on their scaffold, with PHF5A Y36C showing better resistance to the herboxidiene analogues and SF3B1 R1074H showing better resistance to the pladienolide and spliceostatin analogues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>PHF5A-Y36C confers resistance to splicing modulators</title>
        <p>To further validate PHF5A-Y36C as a mechanism underlying resistance to splicing modulation, we expressed either wild-type (WT) PHF5A or Y36C PHF5A at similar levels in the parental HCT116 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Despite the sequence conservation of this tyrosine residue through evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, expression of either PHF5A-WT or Y36C has no apparent effect on cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), localization of SF3B1 protein or formation of nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Given that PHF5A is one of seven proteins in the SF3b complex, we then examined if the mutation could disrupt interactions with any of the core components and alter the overall composition of the complex. Immunoprecipitated (IP'ed) samples by anti-SF3B1 antibodies from WT and mutant cell lines were subjected to western blot and mass-spectrometry analysis to qualitatively assess their composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We did not observe any significant differences in the overall composition of the complexes containing WT or Y36C PHF5A, suggesting that aside from this mutation they are otherwise intact and functional. Whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis confirmed that expression of PHF5A-Y36C accounted for â¼92% of the total <italic>PHF5A</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>) in the engineered cell line but had minimal effects on global splicing or gene expression when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6b and 8</xref>). Importantly, whereas parental cells and cells expressing WT PHF5A were sensitive to splicing modulator treatment, expression of PHF5A-Y36C conferred resistance to a panel of splicing modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), phenocopying the spontaneous PHF5A Y36C resistant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1câf</xref>). This resistance phenotype appears to be general as it was also observed when PHF5A-Y36C was introduced to another cell line (Panc0504, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next examined the behaviour of the PHF5A-Y36C mutation at the biochemical level. Consistent with the cellular data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assays with an exogenous pre-mRNA substrate showed that the Y36C mutant protected against the inhibition by splicing modulators of different scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To validate whether similar levels of protection are also present <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used quantitative real-time PCR analysis to assay the splicing of two endogenous pharmacodynamic marker genes that were used previously in the phase I clinical trial of E7107 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In agreement with the effect observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assays, Y36C mutation also reduced the inhibition on the production of spliced, mature <italic>SLC25A19</italic> mRNAs and the accumulation of unspliced, immature <italic>EIF4A1</italic> pre-mRNA elicited by splicing modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>

        <title>PHF5A-Y36C alters E7107 induced aberrant splicing</title>
        <p>To examine how global splicing is affected by splicing modulators, we applied whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis in both WT- and Y36C PHF5A-expressing cells treated with 100ânM E7107. Unsupervised clustering based on gene expression and principal component analysis of splicing junction usage confirmed that the Y36C cells treated with E7107 clustered away from their WT counterpart but near the DMSO-treated controls, suggesting that the Y36C mutation weakened E7107 activity as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Detailed differential splicing analysis further unveiled the quantitative and qualitative effects imposed by the Y36C mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). Specifically, compared to the respective DMSO-treated controls, IR events were predominant in WT cells treated with E7107 as measured by both the number of events and average fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, left bar). Consistent with the protective effect of Y36C, the overall amount of IR events and their average fold change were greatly reduced in the mutant cells treated with E7107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, right bar). Surprisingly, the number of compound-induced ES events was increased in the mutant cells compared to WT upon E7107 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>), suggesting that PHF5A-Y36C-mediated resistance to splicing modulation involves a differential response at the global level.</p>
        <p>The regulation of IR and ES events is known to be associated with exon/intron length and nucleotide content, as well as with specific chromatin marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Particularly, a differential in GC content between neighbouring introns and exons may have evolved as recognition signals for the splicing machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Therefore, we sought to examine whether intronic GC content might also affect splice site recognition in PHF5A-WT or Y36C cells under splicing modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). In WT cells, E7107-induced IR introns harbour higher GC content and less differential with the downstream exons as compared to the randomly selected background introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Interestingly, IR introns/exons in PHF5A Y36C cells treated with E7107 displayed much higher GC composition and minimal differential between affected introns and exons as compared to its WT counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, whereas ES junctions in compound treated WT cells showed lower GC composition than the background, ES junctions in Y36C cells treated with E7107 presented with higher GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In aggregate, these data suggest that intron/exon GC content may contribute to Y36C-mediated interference of splicing modulation.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, the intron/exon GC contents of IR events in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, blue curve) are comparable to those of ES events in Y36C cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, red curve). In addition, E7107 treatment induced more ES events but fewer IR events in PHF5A-Y36C cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that some of these ES-related introns from the Y36C cells might be switched to IR in the WT cells under the same E7107 treatment. To this end, we calculated the percentage (percent spliced in, PSI) of the individual 3â² intronâexon junction usage for these ES events in both PHF5A WT and Y36C cells. Theoretically, the outcome of these 3â² junctions would be either ES, IR or exon inclusion (for scheme of the calculation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> and Methods). Consistent with our ES/IR switch hypothesis, 2,470 out of these 3,883 Y36C-related ES junctions (â¼64%) showed reduced ES PSI and increase IR PSI in the WT cells treated with E7107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). This provided further evidence at the global level that PHF5A Y36C could weaken the activity of splicing inhibitors by modulating the usages of specific intronâexon junctions both quantitatively and qualitatively, utilizing the evolutionarily developed relative GC content of the neighbouring introns/exons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>

        <title>PHF5A-Y36C alters E7107-induced IR-ES profile of <italic>MCL1</italic></title>
        <p>We next focused on the specific genes modulated by E7107 in both genotype backgrounds. Despite differences in the number of splicing events elicited by E7107, the overall numbers of affected genes from WT or Y36 cells were comparable and shared a large overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also identified candidate genes linked to essential pathways in either WT- or Y36C-specific genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). To validate our global differential splicing analyses that revealed an IR/ES switch by splicing modulators in PHF5A-Y36C cells, we focused on genes that were associated with significant IR events in WT cells treated with E7107 as compared to DMSO controls, but were linked to significant ES events in Y36C under compound treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). A large number of pivotal genes such as <italic>MCL1</italic>, <italic>CDC25B</italic>, <italic>RBM5</italic> and <italic>CDK10</italic> were among the group, and individual Sashimi plots validated the differential in splicing behaviour between WT and Y36C cells treated with E7107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). <italic>MCL1</italic> exists as two isoforms, <italic>MCL1-L</italic> and <italic>MCL1-S</italic>, and was previously reported as a major target for splicing modulators such as meayamycin B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and sudemycin D1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Interestingly, the second intron of <italic>MCL1</italic> harbours a low (38%) GC content compared to the GC-rich (51%) upstream intron. Sashimi plots of the <italic>MCL1</italic> RNA-seq data confirmed that in DMSO-treated control samples, both ES and IR events occurred at very low levels in WT and Y36C cells, resulting in dominant production of the canonical <italic>MCL1-L</italic> form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Upon E7107 treatment, IR was the dominant event observed in WT cells. In contrast, upon PHF5A Y36C expression, the effect of E7107 was largely altered, and mainly ES events were observed yielding the <italic>MCL1-S</italic> form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we utilized <italic>MCL1</italic> as a biomarker to expand our analysis of the ES/IR switch to additional splicing modulators of different scaffolds and multiple dosages. Taqman gene expression not only confirmed the RNA-seq analysis but also revealed a correlation between the potency of splicing modulators and the relative rates of induction for ES and IR events. Specifically, in PHF5A WT cells, the more potent spliceostatin A (GI<sub>50</sub>=0.76ânM in HCT116) led to similar kinetics for dose-dependent induction of <italic>MCL1</italic> ES and IR events, whereas the slightly less potent E7107 (GI<sub>50</sub>=1.5ânM in HCT116) presented with âearlier' induction of <italic>MCL1</italic> ES events than IR events at lower doses. The weaker herboxidiene (GI<sub>50</sub>=7.6ânM in HCT116) showed an even more pronounced effect, and finally the IR events were not observed with the weakest compound tested, sudemycin D6 (GI<sub>50</sub>=149ânM in HCT116) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, left panels). These data strengthened the observation that the low GC containing intron 2 of <italic>MCL1</italic> was more resistant to splicing modulation than the higher GC containing intron 1 in the same gene. Importantly, expression of the PHF5A Y36C mutation delayed or blocked the onset of the <italic>MCL1</italic> IR events in the presence of these splicing modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, right panels). Interestingly, <italic>MCL1-S</italic> production, representing ES events, was enhanced to a higher level in PHF5A-Y36C cells compared to WT upon increasing dosage of E7107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, second row). Taken together, these data confirmed the observation that PHF5A Y36C controlled the switch between compound induced IR events and ES events.</p>

        <title>Crystal structure of human PHF5A</title>
        <p>Given that Y36C PHF5A has no effect on basal splicing but plays a critical role in hindering and altering splicing modulators' effect on RNA splicing, we sought to explain the role of PHF5A in the context of the three-dimensional structure. We purified the WT protein and determined the crystal structure at 1.8âÃ resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Our final model contains residues 2â93 out of 110 total. PHF5A forms a mushroom-like structure with a triangular-shaped cap and a stem composed of antiparallel strands from the N and C termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11d</xref>). The cap is formed by a left-handed, triangular, deep trefoil knot containing three zinc ions and five CXXC motifs, which are permuted between the zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>). PHF5A contains 13 Cys residues and 12 of these coordinate 3 zinc ions in tetrahedral geometry. The remaining cysteine was mutated to serine (C40S) to enhance soluble protein expression. Interestingly, PHF5A incorporates three different types of zinc finger. Zinc-finger 1 (ZnF1) folds into a gag knuckle and has C4 coordination from the first and fourth CXXC motifs. The first of these has a short helical turn (Î·1) while the fourth has a zinc knuckle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Zinc-finger 2 (ZnF2) is formed by the second and fifth CXXC motifs. The first of these motifs is a zinc knuckle and the second comes from helix-Î±4 and therefore resembles the treble clef GATA-like zinc finger<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Zinc-finger 3 (ZnF3) is formed by the third CXXC motif from helix-Î·2 and two individual cysteines from the loops connecting the first and the last beta strands of the mushroom stem. This third zinc finger resembles an interrupted classical Î²Î²Î± finger with a short helix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Given the location of PHF5A-Y36 on the surface near the second zinc finger, and the evidence that it does not alter any tested cellular activities, we would predict that mutation to Cys would have minimal effect on the overall fold but rather act locally altering the surface topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
        <p>While classified as a PHD finger, PHF5A has low sequence homology with other PHD fingers and differs from the canonical fold. A high level of sequence identity across diverse eukaryotic organisms shows its unique trefoil knot topology is likely to be conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). At the same time, PHF5A has very low sequence identity when compared to other sequences within the same organism, suggesting a unique biological role in the cell. However, proteins with low sequence identity can still share similar three-dimensional structures and have similar function. To explore this possibility, we compared our structure to all other available structures in the PDB and found only one other protein with similar fold, Rds3, a PHF5A homolog from yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The Rds3 structure was solved by NMR, containing 80 residues and unstructured coils at the N- and C- termini<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. It also has three zinc fingers and the same trefoil knot fold (<italic>Z</italic>-scores 12.6 and RMSD 2.2âÃ)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
        <p>The full-length Rds3 protein was recently observed in the cryo-EM structure of the spliceosome B<sup>act</sup> complex at a resolution range of 3.0â3.5âÃ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. This structure shows that Rds3/PHF5A is a central scaffolding protein, interacting with Hsh155/SF3B1, Rse1/SF3B3, Ysf3/SF3B5, U2 snRNA and the intron RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Here, the SF3B1 HEAT repeats (HR) form a right-handed superhelical spiral of one complete turn forming a central ellipsoid cavity of approximately 34 Ã 39âÃ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). PHF5A nestles into this cavity forming extensive contacts along its sides with HR 2â3, 6, 15 and 17â20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Of 110 total residues in PHF5A, 28 are forming contacts with SF3B1 burying 19% (1,337âÃ<sup>2</sup>) of surface area and a high degree of sequence conservation between the two interfaces. The C-terminal HR-20 helix and N-terminal helix of SF3B5 form a parallel helixâhelix interaction that completes the superhelical turn while forming additional interactions with PHF5A (residues F6-L12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). SF3B3 sits along the top face of the SF3B1âPHF5A complex forming contacts with both, while the intronic RNA sits along the bottom face of the complex. Most of these interactions are to the phosphodiester backbone, as evidenced by complementary electropositive surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Superimposing the yeast and human PHF5A structures reveals structural differences at only two regions, which both form interactions with the intron RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11d</xref>). The last helix (G93-R110) of the C-terminus, which is missing in the PHF5A crystal structure, contains conserved basic residues located between HR-2 from SF3B1 and the intron-U2 RNA duplex. These basic residues form multiple contacts to the intron nucleotides (+1-CACAUU) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11d</xref>) downstream of BPA (position 0). A minor difference is at the helix (Î·2)âloopâhelix (Î·3) (from N50-R57) near ZnF3 where it has lower sequence conservation and also adopts multiple conformations in the Rds3 solution structure, suggesting this part of the molecule might be flexible. This region is making contact to two nucleotides (+9-AU) from the intron and the flexibility could accommodate conformations of different intronic RNAs.</p>

        <title>Structural analysis of resistant mutations in PHF5AâSF3B1</title>
        <p>Recently, several cryo-EM structures have provided snapshots of the pre-catalytic and catalytic steps in the splicing reaction. The SF3b complex was only observed in the pre-catalytic B<sup>act</sup> complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In the next step, rearrangements occur triggering dissociation of the SF3b complex and formation of the C complex, in which the phosphodiester bond has been made between the 2â²-OH of the BPA and the 3â² phosphate of guanosine at the 5â²-splice site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Strikingly, the yeast B<sup>act</sup> complex cryo-EM structure shows that the interface between PHF5A and SF3B1 is where the BPA binds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These proteins from the SF3b complex apparently shield the reactive group from premature nucleophilic attack. Indeed, in this model, PHF5A-Y36 forms direct contacts with the BPA, clearly implicating PHF5A in branchpoint recognition. This specialized biological role may explain its high sequence conservation and lack of any other apparent counterparts in the cell, which is consistent with previous finding of its key roles in splicing regulation and splicing modulator sensitivity in glioblastoma stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The HEAT repeats of SF3B1 that define this binding pocket (HR15-17) are also highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Interestingly, the resistance mutations identified in this study, PHF5A-Y36C, SF3B1-K1071E, SF3B1-V1078A/I, and previously reported SF3B1-R1074H, all cluster around this pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). Moreover, crosslinking data show that these splicing modulators interact directly with SF3B1 and SF3B3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), which sits immediately above this pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>). These striking coincidences provide strong evidence that this BPA-binding pocket is also the region where splicing modulators bind. While conferring resistance, remarkably these mutations are not detrimental to basal splicing despite their proximity to the BPA. Detailed analysis shows that SF3B1-K1071 is a conserved residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>) and forms H-bonds with the 2â²-hydroxyl of the BPA ribose sugar and also with the hydroxyl of PHF5A-Y36, which helps to position and orient these residues at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Since mutation of either of these residues results in resistance, this interaction is likely important for modulator binding. PHF5A-Y36 also forms extensive van der Waals interaction with another conserved residue, SF3B1-R1075, which also helps orient this side chain and alter the binding pocket. Based on our Y36C model, the mutation does not cause a significant change to the electrostatic surface but does alter the surface topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). The loss in affinity suggests the aromatic side chain at this position is critical for splicing modulator binding. SF3B1-R1074H is located at the base of this binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). It does not make any direct interactions with RNA or PHF5A, but mutation would alter the shape of the binding pocket and could affect compound binding but not BPA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). SF3B1-V1078A/I is near the top of this pocket and not conserved between yeast and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). In yeast, this residue forms an H-bond to the BPA adenosine, but in humans this residue is likely to result in a relatively subtle change and indeed confers the least amount of overall resistance.</p>

        <title>Reduced binding affinity of splicing modulator to PHF5A-Y36C</title>
        <p>To demonstrate the splicing modulator binding site is at the interface composed by SF3B1, PHF5A and SF3B3, we engineered a recombinant protein complex based on the yeast B<sup>act</sup> cryo-EM structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. By co-expressing these three proteins with SF3B5, we were able to reconstitute a stable 250âkDa complex that could be purified in two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). To validate this recombinant complex can recapitulate a functional modulator binding site, we captured it on scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads and probed its interaction with a <sup>3</sup>H-labelled pladienolide analogue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. SPA assays revealed <sup>3</sup>H-labelled pladienolide probe bound to the complex and other non-radioactive splicing modulators were able to compete off the bound probe, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). In this competition assay, reduced signal from titrating non-radioactive modulators reveals the relative affinity of these three compounds to the complex compared to the pladienolide-like analogue and is consistent to the potency and rank ordering seen in the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing (IVS) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and the cellular assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This validates that these four proteins reconstitute a functional binding site for splicing modulators.</p>
        <p>Next, the corresponding complex containing PHF5A-Y36C was generated to inspect whether the observed resistance mutation is a result of reduced binding between splicing modulator(s) and the SF3b complex. The purified PHF5A-Y36C recombinant complex was captured on the SPA beads and the same <sup>3</sup>H-labelled tracer compound<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> was used to probe the interaction at two different concentrations, 10 and 1ânM. SPA assay reveals that an approximate five-fold induction of the 10ânM <sup>3</sup>H-labelled probe binding to the WT PHF5A containing complex over background, whereas the binding to the PHF5A-Y36C complex was equal to background. This demonstrates that the single Y36C mutation is sufficient to reduce modulator binding significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>) and suggests Y36 makes critical interactions to modulators. The reduced affinity was also observed in the IP'ed SF3b complex from PHF5A-Y36C cell nuclear lysates, confirming that this mutation is able to decrease modulator binding in a physiological relevant protein complex as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mutagenesis shows Y36 is critical for modulator activity</title>
        <p>Our structural and functional analysis implicates the importance of an aromatic side chain for splicing modulator binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). To further dissect the importance of this interaction, we generated cell lines expressing additional amino acid substitutions at the Y36 and neighbouring V37 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7eâg</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed comparable expression levels of most exogenous PHF5A variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). We then examined the levels of cell growth inhibition elicited by splicing modulators in these lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7fâg</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, substitution of Y36 with either phenylalanine (F) or tryptophan (W) only conferred a very minor protective effect against splicing modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>, dark and light green lines). Indeed, unsupervised clustering of the IC<sub>50</sub> shift (PHF5A variant over WT cells) grouped WT cell lines and Y36F/W cell lines together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). In contrast, when Y36 was mutated to either serine (S) or alanine (A), mimicking the smaller size of cysteine (C), strong resistance to splicing modulators was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>, dark and light red lines), and Y36S/A clustered closely with the Y36C-expressing cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Interestingly, introducing a charged amino acid at this position also reduces compound action. Specifically, when Y36 was mutated to glutamic acid (E), a bulky residue with negative charge, almost complete resistance to splicing modulators was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>, orange lines and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Whereas when the residue was mutated to the positive charged arginine (R), albeit at a much higher expression level than other variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>), the level of resistance was milder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>, purple lines and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the aromatic group is required for binding and smaller residues or charged residues reduce modulator binding. In contrast, substitution of the V37 residue with cysteine (C) did not provide any protection against splicing modulators even at high expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>, light blue lines and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7eâg</xref>). Consistent with previous data, the resistance only occurred to the treatment with splicing modulators but not bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f,g</xref>). Importantly, for all Y36 variants tested, the bias between resistances to different splicing modulator scaffolds persists, suggesting that the Y36 residue is more critical for interaction with herboxidiene than for pladienolide and sudemycin, which highlights that these splicing modulators could adopt different poses within this common binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f,g</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Spliceosomes undergo multiple ATP-dependent conformational changes involving a number of snRNPs, and this dynamic complexity makes it challenging to determine where and when splicing modulators bind. Previous photocrosslinking studies with pladienolide and herboxidiene analogues narrowed down the interaction point to the SF3b complex, one of the subunits of the U2 snRNP, specifically to the individual proteins SF3B3 and SF3B1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The resistant mutation SF3B1-R1074H generated under high doses of pladienolide B and E7107 provided further evidence that SF3B1 is critical for compound binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. By applying a genomic resistance mapping approach with low doses of E7107 and herboxidiene, we were able to elicit a number of different resistance mutations. This allows us to further refine the splicing modulator binding pocket and potentially to account for mechanism of action among certain introns. We uncovered a series of key mutations, Y36C in PHF5A, V1078A/I, K1071E and the previously identified R1074H<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> in SF3B1, which, together with the reported photocrosslinking data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, allow us to pinpoint the modulator binding pocket to the interface between PHF5A and SF3B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). It remains possible that E7107 can act on additional regulators in the spliceosome subcomplex. The other two modulators, spliceostatin A and sudemycin D, also show resistance to the Y36C clone, indicating these compounds interact with this site as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Indeed, we confirmed the binding of splicing modulators to this common binding pocket by reconstituting a functional 4-protein complex consisting of PHF5A, SF3B1, SF3B3 and SF3B5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). The single amino acid substitution of Y36C reduced the binding of the pladienolide probe to background levels, suggesting that the mechanism of resistance is due to the decreased affinity of splicing modulators to the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Detailed site-directed mutagenesis of Y36 shows that both the aromatic ring and electrical charge at the Y36 residue is critical for the activity of splicing modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7eâg</xref>). Furthermore, mutations at Y36 revealed different levels of protection against these modulators with different scaffolds, indicating that these modulators may adopt slightly different poses within mode of interaction at this common binding pocket. Webb <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> have previously hypothesized several pharmacophore features for herboxidiene activity including a hydrophobic motif (a diene group) between C8 and C11. Pladienolide and herboxidiene share this diene moiety, implying this may bind at the proximity of Y36. Thus, it would be interesting to examine the relations between the aromatic ring of Y36 and this motif in the future.</p>
      <p>Given the location of the resistance mutations around the BPA binding site, one possible model for the mechanism of action is that the splicing modulators are BPA competitive inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). This close proximity of splicing modulators binding pocket to the BPA is consistent with previous reports from the Valcarcel group and Reed group that both spliceostatins and pladienolides impair the canonical base pairing between U2 snRNA and pre-mRNA branch point region in the presence of heparin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Collectively, these observations led to a model where splicing modulators directly impact on the fidelity of SF3B1 branch site recognition with consequences on the 3â² splice site recognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This competitive binding model immediately suggests several possible functional consequences that can be examined at the global splicing level. Specifically, weaker GC-rich intron substrates would be easier to inhibit than stronger intron sequences and this differential could manifest itself through alterations in splicing preferences in the presence of different compounds.</p>
      <p>Consistent with this model for inhibition, we observed a nonlinear dose response in global splicing due to variations in individual intron âstrength'. Splicing modulation is a global phenomenon which impacts more than 200,000 introns in the human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Despite several conserved features within introns and adjacent exons, regulation of individual introns during splicing is both diverse and complex. This variation and complexity means that small-molecule inhibition will have differential effects on splice junction usage. Here, a protective mutation in PHF5A allowed us to examine the individual cellular responses of introns upon splicing modulation, which revealed transitions between IR and ES events.</p>
      <p>It has been proposed that during evolution, the generally shorter, low GC containing introns in lower eukaryotes evolved under two different routes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>: one group of introns remained short, but had markedly increased GC percentage and had less differential in term of GC composition compared to their neighbouring exons. Due to the shorter length of these introns, they are more likely to be recognized by an intron-defined splicing mechanism. Interestingly, these introns appear to be more susceptible to IR upon E7107 treatment. More importantly, we observed that when the effect of E7107 was weakened in the presence of PHF5A Y36C mutation, the average GC compositions of IR event-related introns were markedly higher with little to no differential from downstream exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Given that the differential in GC composition between introns and surrounding exons might contribute to splicing machinery recognition, it is plausible to hypothesize that these kinds of introns are inherently more difficult for the splicing machinery to recognize, which in turn might make them easier to inhibit with splicing modulators. It has also been proposed that higher GC content around BPA may lead to a more stable secondary structure of the pre-mRNA; therefore, it is also plausible that GC content may affect the effectiveness of competition between pre-mRNAs and splicing modulators via structural and spatial mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
      <p>In contrast, another group of introns maintained their low GC composition and large differential with adjacent exons during evolution, but underwent significant increases in length, which likely brought them out of the range of intron-defined splicing and converted them to an exon-defined splicing mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Intriguingly, under E7107 treatment, introns associated with increased ES events are associated with lower GC composition and higher GC differential with the skipped exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Similar to the observation in IR events, the GC content of compound induced ES introns in the presence of Y36C was also higher than that of the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). A higher differential in GC composition between introns and exons has been linked to increased nucleosome occupancy and enrichment of SF3B1 association with the chromatin, which presumably primes these junctions for co-transcriptional splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Further characterization of the genomic structure of the junctions associated with ES events may yield additional insight in our understanding of the complex link between transcription and splicing.</p>
      <p>Our observation that 2,470 junctions can be switched between IR and ES upon E7107 treatment depending on the genotype of PHF5A strengthens the hypothesis that introns possess differential sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The fact that IR and ES events affect the same 3â² junction are not mutually exclusive further unveils the plasticity of splicing regulation and a fine-tuning mechanism of the usage of individual junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). It is conceivable that in PHF5A WT cells, E7107 was efficient in competing with the canonical BPAs in these 2,470 junctions and led to IR events. However, upon PHF5A Y36C expression, E7107 would become less efficient in the competition with these junctions while maintaining its competence with the immediate upstream introns, which induced more ES events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Collectively, these differential sensitivities from cellular introns are consistent with the model that splicing modulators act as competitive BPA inhibitors, and are likely to result in the nonlinear response to differential dosages of splicing modulators.</p>
      <p>Phenotypic screening of small-molecule libraries is a powerful way to identify potential drugs. However, cellular target identification for the screening hits has been an unremitting challenge. Several unbiased approaches have been developed to identify the cellular targets and mechanisms of action, including biochemical approaches such as affinity purification coupled with quantitative proteomics, genetic interaction approaches such as RNAi screening and domain-focused CRISPR screens, and computational inference approaches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. More recently, we and others used next-generation sequencing-based genomic or transcriptomic profiling of phenotypically resistant cell populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> to identify unique recurrent single-nucleotide variations or expression alterations to illuminate potential cellular targets of compounds. Here, we further developed the method by screening structurally unrelated compounds at different low concentrations, in order to (1) mitigate the potential off-target activity at high concentrations and (2) enhance the possibility to identify subtle but common mechanisms of chemical probes. This allowed us to uncover multiple mutations/genes encoding proteins co-existing in the same complex. Interestingly, in our case, the finding of resistant mutations to PHF5A-Y36, SF3B1-V1078 and K1071, in addition to confirming the previously reported SF3B1-R1074, suggests the proximity of these residues to the action site of splicing modulators. The fact that corresponding amino acids of these residues in yeast were recently shown to form a pocket that accommodates the invariant adenosine in the BPS demonstrates that this genomic profiling strategy can provide faithful and informative insights into the action of candidate compounds. Hence, we propose that further expansion of the genomic profiling approach will offer a unique way to explore the MoA (mechanisms of action) for compounds using the â2-dimensional' genomic fingerprint dissection. This is particularly valuable when the protein structure and/or biochemical assays with purified proteins are not readily available as exemplified in this study by the complex and dynamic spliceosome.</p>
      <p>In summary, we identify PHF5A as a key node of interaction for small-molecule splicing modulators. Our structural analysis pinpointed a common binding site around the branch point adenosine-binding pocket. Also, our results demonstrate how a single amino acid change on PHF5A Y36 weakened the inhibitory effect of splicing modulators and altered the global splicing pattern between ES events and IR events. We expect these findings will assist future development of more specific small-molecule splicing modulators for treating diseases associated with aberrant splicing.</p>

Lysates were then centrifuged for 10âmin at top speed, and the supernatants were subjected to SDSâPAGE. For nuclear extract preparation, cells were first washed and then scraped into PBS. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in five packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10âmM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10âmM KCl, 0.2âmM PMSF, 0.5âmM DTT) and centrifuged at 1,700<italic>g</italic> for 5âmin. Cell pellets were resuspended in three packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer and swelled on ice for 10âmin. Swollen cells were then lysed using a dounce homogenizer and spun at 1,500âg for 15âmin at 4âÂ°C. The pellets contained the nuclei and were suspended with Â½ packed nuclei volume of low-salt buffer (20âmM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20âmM KCl, 0.2âmM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2âmM PMSF, 0.5âmM DTT) gently. Â½ packed nuclei volume of high salt buffer (20âmM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.4âM KCl, 0.2âmM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2âmM PMSF, 0.5âmM DTT) was then added and mixed gently. The lysates were rocked for 30âmin in cold room before centrifuged at 9,000<italic>g</italic> for 30âmin at 4âÂ°C. The supernatants contained the nuclear extracts and were dialysed for 4âh using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes with 30,000 MWCO cutoff in dialysis buffer (20âmM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2âmM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2âmM PMSF, 0.5âmM DTT) with a change of buffer after 2âh. The nuclear extract was then aliquoted and flash frozen.</p>
