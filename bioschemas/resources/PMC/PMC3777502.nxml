      <abstract>
        <p>A recently identified protein, FAN1 (FANCD2-associated nuclease 1, previously known as KIAA1018), is a novel nuclease associated with monoubiquitinated FANCD2 that is required for cellular resistance against DNA interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents. The mechanisms of FAN1 regulation have not yet been explored. Here, we provide evidence that FAN1 is degraded during mitotic exit, suggesting that FAN1 may be a mitotic substrate of the anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex (APC/C). Indeed, Cdh1, but not Cdc20, was capable of regulating the protein level of FAN1 through the KEN box and the D-box. Moreover, the up- and down-regulation of FAN1 affected the progression to mitotic exit. Collectively, these data suggest that FAN1 may be a new mitotic substrate of APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> that plays a key role during mitotic exit.</p>

    <p>DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are formed when bifunctional agents covalently link the two strands in a double helix. ICLs are toxic lesions that prevent strand separation, which is necessary for transcription and DNA replication. Forks that stall at ICLs recruit signaling complexes, including the Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins and FA-associated proteins. FA is an inherited recessive condition characterized by developmental defects, skeletal abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">[2]</xref>. The FA pathway, which includes at least 13 known FA-associated genes, plays a role in repairing ICL and damaged DNA. Eight FA proteins comprise a multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (referred to as the FA core complex). After DNA damage has occurred, the FA core complex adds a single molecule of ubiquitin to FANCD2, which is a key step in the activation of the pathway. FANCD2 then associates with other downstream proteins to promote the repair of damaged DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">[4]</xref>.</p>
    <p>FANCD2-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), previously known as KIAA1018, is a newly identified nuclease that contains an N-terminal ubiquitin zinc finger (UBZ) domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">[5]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">[8]</xref>. Although FAN1 was discovered independently using different approaches, different groups collectively found that FAN1 possesses nuclease activity that is required for cellular resistance against ICL agents. FAN1 is recruited to the damaged DNA via the UBZ domain through associating specifically with monoubiquitinated FANCD2.</p>
    <p>To date, most studies of FAN1 have focused on its role in regulating DNA ICLs during S phase. The FA pathway was thought to be largely inactivated during mitosis due to the absence of monoubiquitinated FANCD2, as determined by western blotting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">[9]</xref>. Mitotic phosphorylation and degradation of FANCM (Fanconi anemia, complementation group M), which leads to the release of the FA core complex, may be one mechanism for inhibiting FANCD2 monoubiquitination during mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">[11]</xref>. Because FAN1 associates rather specifically with monoubiquitinated FANCD2, which is absent during mitosis, the regulation and the role of FAN1 during mitosis have not yet been explored.</p>
    <p>The anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex (APC/C), an E3 ubquitin ligase complex, plays crucial roles in mitosis and during G<sub>1</sub> phase by degrading cell cycle-related proteins, such as Securin, Cyclins, Plk1, and Skp2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">[12]</xref>. The temporal cell cycle specificity of APC/C is achieved by the activation of two closely related proteins, Cdc20 and Cdh1, which facilitate the recruitment of substrates and ubiquitination by the core complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">[13]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">[15]</xref>. In early mitosis, APC/C binding to Cdc20 leads to the initiation of anaphase. In late mitosis, the association of APC/C with Cdh1 maintains APC/C activity throughout the subsequent G<sub>1</sub> phase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">[13]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">[20]</xref>. The switch from Cdc20 binding to Cdh1 binding by APC/C is induced by the inactivation of Cdk1, which also leads to destruction of Cdc20 mediated by Cdh1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">[22]</xref>. The Cdc20-and Cdh1-bound forms of APC/C represent different substrate specificities. Cdc20 recognizes D-box-containing proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">[23]</xref>, whereas Cdh1 recognizes proteins containing either D-box or KEN-box sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">[24]</xref>. Interestingly, both a KEN-box and a D-box motif present at the N-terminus of FAN1. The presence of these sequences in FAN1 prompted us to test whether FAN1 is regulated by APC/C and whether it plays a role in mitotic exit. As described below, FAN1 may be a new mitotic substrate of APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>.</p>

        <p>Cdc20- and Cdh1-activated APC/C plays key roles in mediating the ubiquitination-dependent destruction of many KEN-box- and D-box-containing proteins during mitotic exit. Interestingly, there is a D-box (aa 14-17) and a KEN-box (aa 212-214) in the FAN1 protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and these two motifs are evolutionarily conserved in different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, endogenous protein levels of FAN1 were significantly decreased in cells transiently transfected with Cdh1, but not with Cdc20.

        <p>To test whether the degradation of FAN1 is mediated by an APC/C-catalyzed ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway, cells were treated with MG132, a selective inhibitor of the proteasome, and FAN1 protein levels were analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, MG132 treatment partially rescued the protein levels of exogenous FAN1, which were significantly decreased in the cells transiently transfected with Cdh1.</p>
        <p>The endogenous protein levels of FAN1 were increased when cells were transfected with siRNA targeting Cdh1, but not Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g001">Figure. 1E</xref>). Levels of Cdh1 were not increased by the treatment of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Skp2, a well known substrate of Cdh1, was used as the positive control. Taken together, Cdh1 was capable of down-regulating FAN1 protein through the proteasome pathway.</p>

        <title>FAN1 interacted with Cdh1</title>
        <p>Next, we tested whether there was an interaction between FAN1 and Cdh1. Myc-tagged Cdh1 was co-transfected with SFB-tagged FAN1 into HEK-293T cells. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using anti-Myc and anti-Flag conjugated agarose beads was performed. Because endogenous FAN1 protein levels were decreased when cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged Cdh1, the cells were incubated with MG132 for 8 h prior to the cell harvest. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, an interaction between these two proteins was clearly detected in cell lysates. This interaction was further confirmed at the endogenous level, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. Endogenous FAN1 was clearly detected in immunoprecipitation reactions with an anti-Cdh1 antibody. These results indicate that FAN1 physically interacts with Cdh1 in cells.</p>

        <p>As APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> plays a key role in mitotic exit and G<sub>1</sub> phase, we monitored FAN1 protein levels during mitotic exit. U2OS cells were synchronized at mitotic pro-metaphase by nocodazole, a microtubule polymerization inhibitor, and released at indicated time points. The cell cycle profile was monitored by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

This degradation of FAN1 during mitotic exit was similar to that of Cdc20, a well-known mitotic substrate of APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>. As expected, the mRNA levels of FAN1 remained constant during mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cjc-31-09-440-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

        <title>FAN1 might play a crucial role during mitotic exit</title>
        <p>Because FAN1 is regulated by APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> and is degraded during the mitotic exit, we sought to determine whether FAN1 plays a role in the mitotic progression. U2OS cells treated with siRNAs targeting FAN1 or scrambled siRNA were synchronized in M phase using nocodazole and then released.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrated that human FAN1 was degraded during mitotic exit and that APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> potentially mediated this degradation through interactions with FAN1. Thus, FAN1 may be a new mitotic substrate of APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup> and play an important role in mitotic exit.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that regulators of early mitosis are typically targeted for degradation by association with Cdc20 via a D-box motif, whereas Cdh1 targets regulators of late mitosis for degradation via D-box and KEN-box motifs. Interestingly, although there are both D-box and KEN-box sequences in FAN1, we demonstrated that only Cdh1 targets FAN1 for degradation. In agreement with these observations, Cdh1 was able to interact with FAN1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and modulating FAN1 protein levels in cells altered the progression of mitotic exit.</p>
      <p>Several studies have indicated that the FA pathway plays important roles in mitosis. FA-deficient cells exhibit increased chromosomal breaks at fragile sites, and the high incidence of these breaks may be linked to high cancer rates in FA patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">[33]</xref>. Here, we found that overexpression or depletion of FAN1, an FA-related protein, affected the progression of mitotic exit in U2OS cells. Therefore, it will be very interesting to investigate whether FAN1 has functional interactions with the FA pathway during mitosis to prevent chromosomal instability. As FAN1 specifically interacts with monoubi-quitinated FANCD2, which is absent in mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">[9]</xref>, it is possible that FAN1 may have additional functions during mitotic exit that are not related to the FA pathway. SNM1A, another nuclease, is also involved both in the DNA damage response and in an early mitotic prophase checkpoint in response to spindle stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">[35]</xref>. The exact function of FAN1 in mitotic exit remains to be further explored, and the identification of the physiologic substrate (s) of FAN1 during ICL will be the key to understanding the role of this nuclease.</p>
      <p>The FAN1 protein contains 1017 amino acids and has a theoretical molecular weight of 114 kDa. However, we noticed that there were multiple bands observed by western blotting with higher molecular weights of approximately 130 kDa when U2OS cells were synchronized at mitotic phase, and there were fewer bands with lower molecular weights during progression through mitotic exit. This indicates that FAN1 may become phosphorylated in M phase, which is common for mitotic substrates of APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">[27]</xref>. In fact, sequence analysis using the NetPhos 2.0 computer program revealed several putative serine/threonine residues that are potentially phosphorylated by Cdks during M phase. Further research needs to be performed to elucidate the mechanisms of posttranslational regulation of FAN1 activity to shed light on the role of FAN1 in mitosis.</p>
