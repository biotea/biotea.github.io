      <abstract>
        <p>External stimuli are powerful tools that naturally control protein assemblies and functions. For example, during viral entry and exit changes in pH are known to trigger large protein conformational changes. However, the molecular features stabilizing the higher pH structures remain unclear. Here we elucidate the conformational change of a self-assembling peptide that forms either small or large nanotubes dependent on the pH. The sub-angstrom high-pH peptide structure reveals a globular conformation stabilized through a strong histidine-serine H-bond and a tight histidine-aromatic packing. Lowering the pH induces histidine protonation, disrupts these interactions and triggers a large change to an extended Î²-sheet-based conformation. Re-visiting available structures of proteins with pH-dependent conformations reveals both histidine-containing aromatic pockets and histidine-serine proximity as key motifs in higher pH structures. The mechanism discovered in this study may thus be generally used by pH-dependent proteins and opens new prospects in the field of nanomaterials.</p>

    <p>Proteins commonly undergo changes in their three-dimensional (3D) structures to perform their functions. Biologically induced conformational changes can involve motions of groups of atoms or even whole domains of proteins. Changes in protein shape can be triggered by charges, such as calcium and phosphate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, or protonation in pH-dependent activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The detailed comprehension of the underlying molecular mechanisms is an important contribution to the general understanding of protein function. For instance, a wide range of viruses take advantage of the low pH found in host cell endosomes to sense their cellular location and become activated at the right time and place, for example, to mediate viral and host membrane fusion. The viral proteins responsible for this process have been widely reported to commonly undergo large-scale pH-triggered conformational and oligomerization changes during the membrane fusion process. This is the case for varied pathogens such as influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, tick-borne encephalitis virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and dengue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> virus. Histidine protonation is suspected to be involved in the molecular switch that induces the protein pH-dependent motions. However, experimental demonstrations of single histidines as biomolecular switches have been few, indicating that the precise molecular mechanisms of the protein conformational changes are not well understood, particularly the molecular determinants that stabilize the high-pH protein conformation and trigger its destabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p>In addition, the perfect size monodispersity and the responsiveness of these biological self assemblies correspond to the major challenges for future advanced nanomaterials, that is, (i) the predictable control of the size and morphology of the self-assembled architectures by the chemical structure of the building blocks and (ii) the design of versatile systems that can be triggered by external stimuli. The monodispersity of the final organization and the accuracy of the bio-inspired self-assembly mechanisms have recently attained quasi-perfection with various biological building blocks, such as nucleic acids and amino acids. Any two-dimensional (2D) or 3D nano-object can be designed with DNA origamis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, while DNA-responsive architectures have been obtained, such as a nano-sized box that can be locked or opened in response to a short-single-stranded DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Responsiveness is, however, limited by the DNA interaction and functionalization possibilities. In this respect, RNA or mixed RNA/DNA origami may be more promising thanks to RNA softness and aptamer recognitions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The potential of amino acids for the construction of responsive nanomaterials is correspondingly huge and yet to be tapped. Proteins and peptides are made of building blocks and secondary structures exhibiting a huge variety of interactions and responsive functions. Indeed, proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and peptides can be rationally modified to control the self-assembly shapes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> as well as to finely tune the diameter of nanotubes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this letter, we report on a decapeptide that self-assembles into either 50ânm diameter nanotubes at high pH or 10.7ânm diameter nanotubes at low pH. The peptide conformation switches from a globular one at pH&gt;7.5 to an extended one at pH&lt;6.5. The high-pH crystal structure obtained at 0.85âÃ resolution reveals a histidine-serine H-bond and histidine-aromatic interactions, whereas the low-pH molecular structure demonstrates these key interactions have disappeared, likely in favour of cation-Ï proximities. Interestingly, reanalysing protein structures with pH-dependent functions reveals that these specific interaction networks are present in viral, bacterial and human proteins. This molecular switch is demonstrated to have a high potential for the bottom-up design of pH-responsive nanomaterials.</p>

        <p>Triptorelin is a decapeptide with uncharged N- and C-termini pE<sub>1</sub>âH<sub>2</sub>âW<sub>3</sub>âS<sub>4</sub>âY<sub>5</sub>â(D)W<sub>6</sub>âL<sub>7</sub>âR<sub>8</sub>âP<sub>9</sub>âG<sub>10</sub>âNH<sub>2</sub> that contains three aromatic side chains (Y<sub>5</sub>, W<sub>3</sub> and W<sub>6</sub>), and three ionizable residues, R<sub>8</sub> and Y<sub>5</sub> (pKa&gt;10) and a histidine, H<sub>2</sub> (pKa=6.1 in water; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In the following, the influence of pH is studied in the range 5â8, that is, with the R<sub>8</sub> remaining positively charged for all the conditions here explored. The triptorelin peptide self-assembles in water into either twisted bundles of small nanotubes at low pH (pH&lt;6.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâf</xref>) or large nanotubes at high pH (pH&gt;7.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Given that the peptide single histidine (H<sub>2</sub>) is the only residue with a pK<sub>a</sub> in this range of pH, we explored its protonation state. As shown by the corresponding attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>), H<sub>2</sub> is protonated as a positively charged imidazolium group in the low-pH assemblies (infrared absorption at 1,097âcm<sup>â1</sup>), whereas it is deprotonated in the high-pH assemblies, as a neutral and aromatic Ï-tautomer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> mainly (infrared absorption at 1,106âcm<sup>â1</sup>, deprotonated histidine on the N<sub>1</sub> nitrogen). From one structure to the other, the Fourier-transformed Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman) evidences a major change in the environments of the aromatic residues and especially tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). The ATR-FTIR amide I spectra further reveal the presence of Î²-sheet hydrogen bond networks in the low-pH assemblies, whereas such networks are only weakly detected in the high-pH ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). All together, these results show that the peptide conformation, the peptide molecular packing and the assembly morphology of the triptorelin self-assemblies depend on the protonation state of the peptide single histidine, H<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>

        <title>High-pH single crystal</title>
        <p>To obtain insights into the nanotube structure at atomic level, the peptide was crystallized as used for amyloid structure determination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The crystallization strategy was inspired by our previous investigations on the lanreotide nanotubes. We reported that specific steric hindrance modifications within the nanotube walls induced predictable variations of the lanreotide nanotube diameter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. When the lanreotide nanotubes reach a maximal diameter, the system tends to crystallize as flat lamellae packing, that is, with flat walls. Small triptorelin crystals were formed in the presence of phosphate anions that are larger than acetate. By optimizing the crystallization conditions large single crystals diffracting up to 0.85âÃ resolution were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The 2D-unit cell extracted from the large nanotube X-ray diffraction pattern (<italic>a</italic>=13.35âÃ, <italic>b</italic>=12.93âÃ and <italic>Î³</italic>=88.5Â°) is fully compatible with the layer of the large crystals (<italic>b/2</italic>=13.75âÃ, <italic>c</italic>=13.1âÃ and <italic>Î²</italic>=90Â°) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the micro-Raman spectrum shows that the two W present in the peptide sequence are in two distinct environments and that there is no Î²-sheet network within the three types of assemblies, that is, large nanotubes, small and large crystals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). This information allows us the use of the high-resolution atomic structure obtained by X-ray crystallography to decipher the structure of the wall of the large nanotube. Hence, the 25-Ã-thick bilayer observed in the crystal structure (fully compatible with the 26âÃ determined by SAXS) is essentially maintained by aromatic stacking, as shown by the side view of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and in agreement with the low Î²-sheet content observed by ATR-FTIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>). The histidine tautomer in the crystal and in the nanotubes is the Ï tautomer. Remarkably, the histidine residue is part of a hydrophobic aromatic cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) and its orientation is locked by two strong hydrogen bonds with the S<sub>4</sub>OH group and the backbone amine at distances (nitrogen to proton) of 2.1 and 2.21âÃ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Finally, in agreement with both ATR-FTIR and Raman data, almost no direct intra- or inter-molecular hydrogen bonds stabilize the peptide conformation or the peptide packing except within the type IIâ² Î²-turn induced by the (D)W<sub>6</sub>.</p>

        <title>Low-pH nanotubes</title>
        <p>At low pH, the triptorelin assemblies consist of bundles of regularly twisted small nanotubes (diameter â¼10ânm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâd</xref>, white arrows on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and zoom on a moirÃ© pattern <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). Despite the lack of a crystal form at low pH, we could infer a reliable low pH, small nanotube molecular model. To that end, we combined structural information from X-ray diffraction patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), from ATR-FTIR and Raman spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) and from electron microscopy.</p>
        <p>The moire patterns within the bundles indicate a well-defined inter-distance between the nanotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). The aligned X-ray fibre pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), with a mosaicity corresponding to the bundle twist, exhibits three well-defined scattering planes, an equatorial one and two layers corresponding to 4.85âÃ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The equatorial diffuse scattering is fitted in terms of poly-disperse bundles of nanotubes with a hexagonal packing of 107âÃ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> for the model, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). The SAXS peak intensities are in agreement with a wall formed by two shells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The nanotube wall full thickness is 26âÃ with the outer shell (10âÃ) exhibiting a higher electron density than the inner layer. This indicates that there are more aromatic residues located on the outer surface of the nanotube and that they are involved in the close contact between neighbours. The ATR-FTIR spectra show a turn in the peptide structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Consistently with NMR structure determination of Gonadorelin analogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, this turn is likely localized at the level of the (D)W<sub>6</sub>. ATR-FTIR spectra further show an extended antiparallel Î²-sheet network. The axial position of the 4.85âÃ peaks of the X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrates that the Î²-sheet H-bond network lies along the nanotube axis and forms protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The additional equatorial diffuse scattering at 8â12âÃ thus corresponds to the interdistance between these protofilaments. The large number of Bragg peaks in the first layer indicates a very high 3D crystalline sixfold order between nanotubes. This order is only possible with nanotubes that exhibit a six-fold axis, for example, 6n protofilaments per nanotube. Indeed, 30 protofilaments per nanotube yield the correct diameter. The repeat distance along the nanotube axis is the size of the Î²-hairpin 9.7âÃ, for example, 2 Ã 4.85âÃ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> for the structure of the protofilament). The systematic absence of three layers l=2n+1 indicates a centred packing, which corresponds to a 4.85âÃ translational shift between each protofilament.</p>
        <p>From all this information we built the nanotube molecular model and extract the residue close contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). In this model, the (D)W<sub>6</sub> points out of the nanotube. The hexagonal packing of the nanotubes is therefore stabilized by inter-nanotube (D)W<sub>6</sub> Ï-stacking as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Remarkably, at acid pH, the protonated histidine H<sub>2</sub> residues are on the inner surface close to W<sub>3</sub> and in contact with water.</p>

        <title>A key motif of pH-dependent proteins</title>
        <p>The knowledge of both structures that provides the interaction networks stabilizing the high-and low-pH architectures also allows proposing a mechanism of the pH induced diameter change. At high pH, the monocationic peptide with a single-positive charge on R<sub>8</sub> is coiled at the level of the five contiguous residues H<sub>2</sub>âW<sub>3</sub>âS<sub>4</sub>âY<sub>5</sub>â(D)W<sub>6</sub> with five intramolecular interactions among them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, right). At low pH, the repulsive electrostatic forces between the cationic residues, (R<sub>8</sub>)<sup>+</sup> and (H<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> induce an extended conformation of the (H<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup>âW<sub>3</sub>âS<sub>4</sub>âY<sub>5</sub>âW<sub>6</sub> sequence of the peptide separating as much as possible the two positive charges on the outer and inner faces of the nanotube wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, left).</p>
        <p>At high pH, H<sub>2</sub> is involved in an intramolecular interaction network, that is, two strong H-bond H<sub>2</sub>âS<sub>4</sub> and Ïâ Ï interactions between H<sub>2</sub> and Y<sub>5</sub> (intra- and inter-molecularly) and between H<sub>2</sub> and W<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref> right). By decreasing the pH, the histidine group protonates (H<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> and both H-bond acceptor and aromatic interactions are lost. The coulomb repulsion with (R<sub>8</sub>)<sup>+</sup> favours the extension of the five contiguous residues H<sub>2</sub>âW<sub>3</sub>âS<sub>4</sub>âY<sub>5</sub>â(D)W<sub>6</sub> to seclude (H<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> from (R<sub>8</sub>)<sup>+</sup> inducing a Î²-hairpin conformation of the peptide. The turn localized around the (D)W<sub>6</sub> is maintained and the two cations, (R<sub>8</sub>)<sup>+</sup> and (H<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup>, get close to W<sub>6</sub> and W<sub>3,</sub> respectively, forming possible cation-Ï stabilizing interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, left). This large conformational change during the pH jump induces a major packing modification. The well-packed high-pH bilayer essentially maintained by aromatic residues stacking with almost no intramolecular H-bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) turns into a typical amyloid like cross-beta organization at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). At high pH, the inner and outer leaflets are quasi-similar so that the wall bending is limited and generates large diameter nanotubes. In contrast, at low pH the high curvature is due to the large steric hindrance mismatch between the two parts of the peptide exposed on the inner and outer faces.</p>
        <p>Consequently we here show that the short peptide sequence (H<sub>2</sub>âW<sub>3</sub>âS<sub>4</sub>âY<sub>5</sub>âW<sub>6</sub>âL<sub>7</sub>âR<sub>8</sub>) folds either as an extended or as a globular conformation depending on pH. The stabilizing forces of the globular folding at high pH come from both tight H-bonding (H<sub>2</sub>âS<sub>4</sub>) and ÏâÏ interactions while the repulsive coulomb interaction between the two cations acts as an extender at low pH. These enforce distinct mono- and dicationic peptide conformations that are both hydrophobic enough to self-organize into curved layers, providing two distinct packings into nanotubes exhibiting consequently two distinct diameters (10.7 vs 50ânm), reversibly switchable by pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The high efficiency of this pH-induced mechanism of peptide conformational switch suggests biological relevance. We therefore asked whether it might regulate proteins whose function requires large conformational changes precisely triggered by a pH shift. One extensively studied example of such proteins is the diverse families of membrane fusion proteins that enveloped viruses use to enter cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Many such viral fusion proteins are triggered by the acidification in endosomes after virus internalization. Protonation of histidines has been scrutinized as the triggering mechanism but definite identification of specific pH sensors has been mostly unsuccessful so far<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Strikingly, reanalysis of atomic structures from the PDB and the literature shows that very divergent or even unrelated viral fusion proteins seem to have converged towards combinations of histidine-aromatic clusters and histidine-serine pairs in the key regions that dissociate and/or change structure on lowering of pH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 7</xref>). The evidence for this aromatic-histine-serine switch could be extended to other types of conformationally pH-sensitive proteins. Indeed, the structures of the pH-dependent bacterial membrane channel OmpG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and of the soluble protein M-ficolin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> also support this motif as involved in the mechanisms of pH-dependent conformational change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 7</xref>). This non-exhaustive protein structure analysis shows that aromatic pockets and histidine-serine H-bonds may be used by a wide variety of proteins with a biological function that requires a pH-induced conformational switch.</p>
      <p>Beyond the biological relevance, this mechanism opens significant downstream perspective in the field of nanomaterials. Indeed, there are very few self-assemblies having well-defined organizations with peptides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> or DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and even less that can be continuously tuned<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. One major challenge is the design of systems that can be triggered by external stimuli such as the pH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Our example of pH-responsive nanotube diameter is based on a very short peptide sequence of 10 amino acids. The chemical variety of amino acids opens easier and richer functionalization perspectives than other advanced bio-inspired self-assemblies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we decipher the atomic details of pH-tuned alternate conformations that result in large self-assembly differences. The basic conformation is stabilized by a highly specific histidine-serine H-bond and by histidine-aromatic stacking. The acid conformation is imposed by the repulsive coulomb interactions between both cationic protonated histidine and arginine. This molecular switch is general, as we have found such switches in a large range of proteins including human, viral and bacterial proteins either soluble or insoluble. The conformational molecular switch described here may also be involved in protein folding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Finally, this mechanism opens prospects in the field of nanomaterials where systems that can be reversibly triggered by external stimuli are highly desirable.</p>
