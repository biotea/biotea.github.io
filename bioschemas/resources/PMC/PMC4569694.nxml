        <p>The potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2, encoded by <italic>SLC12A5</italic>, plays a fundamental role in fast synaptic inhibition by maintaining a hyperpolarizing gradient for chloride ions. KCC2 dysfunction has been implicated in human epilepsy, but to date, no monogenic KCC2-related epilepsy disorders have been described. Here we show recessive loss-of-function <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutations in patients with a severe infantile-onset pharmacoresistant epilepsy syndrome, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS). Decreased KCC2 surface expression, reduced protein glycosylation and impaired chloride extrusion contribute to loss of KCC2 activity, thereby impairing normal synaptic inhibition and promoting neuronal excitability in this early-onset epileptic encephalopathy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) is an early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) previously known as migrating partial seizures of infancy. It is characterized by multifocal seizures, developmental arrest or regression and a distinct ictal pattern on electroencephalogram (EEG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. EIMFS is genetically heterogeneous<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and the underlying cause remains elusive for many affected infants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p>
    <p>In this study, we report a novel genetic cause of EIMFS, identifying recessive <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutations in four affected children from two unrelated families. <italic>SLC12A5</italic> encodes the potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2, which plays an integral role in neuronal inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and maturation of cortical dendritic spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.

        <title>Recessive <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutations in patients with EIMFS</title>
        <p>From a cohort of 42 patients (39 families) with EIMFS, we identified two families, one kindred of Swedish origin (Family A, unrelated asymptomatic parents) and one of Pakistani descent (Family B, consanguineous first cousin healthy parents). Each family had two affected children who developed clinical features of EIMFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). All four patients presented similarly with infantile-onset focal migrating seizures, with rapid escalation to a severe pharmacoresistant epileptic disorder (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Interictal multifocal epileptiform discharges were observed on EEG, and ictal activity migrating from one hemisphere to the other was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In all cases, there was significant neurological regression leading to severe developmental delay. One patient died (at the age of 2.5 years) due to secondary cardiorespiratory complications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Using an autozygosity mapping strategy in kindred B, and exome sequencing in both Families A and B, we identified monogenic recessive <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutations in all affected children with EIMFS. Exome sequencing for both parents and children of Family A was undertaken and all variants scored and ranked using the Mutation Identification Pipeline weighted sum model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) that uses multiple parameters, but emphasizes Mendelian inheritance patterns, conserved, rare and protein damaging variants. This left only one gene, <italic>SLC12A5</italic>, with adequate coverage in all individuals sequenced that conformed to autosomal recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3a</xref>). For Family B, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis revealed seven common regions of homozygosity (6â43âMb in size) in the affected children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3b</xref>). Stringent filtering for homozygous, potentially pathogenic variants within these homozygous regions identified four genes, of which, after detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3b</xref>) <italic>SLC12A5</italic> was deemed by far the most biologically plausible candidate for this phenotype. Results from exome analysis were confirmed on direct Sanger sequencing. The children from Family A were confirmed compound heterozygotes for missense mutations c.1277T&gt;C (L426P) and c.1652G&gt;A (G551D), while the two affected patients from Family B were homozygous for the missense variant c.932T&gt;A (L311H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). All mutations showed appropriate familial disease segregation (parents were heterozygous carriers) and were not reported in healthy control populations (dbSNP137, 1000 Genomes SNP calls and the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project). Affected amino acids were highly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In both families, no potentially pathogenic variants were found in other genes known to cause EIMFS or EIEE. A further 38 patients (from 37 families) with EIMFS were screened for mutations in <italic>SLC12A5</italic> and no mutations were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). There were no discernible phenotypic differences between the <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients.</p>

        <title>KCC2 mediates physiological neuronal chloride extrusion</title>
        <p>KCC2 is a membrane protein located at the somatodendritic cell compartment of mature neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. KCC2 is exclusively expressed in the central nervous system, including neurons in all layers of the neocortex, CA1-4 subfields of the hippocampus and cerebellum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In mature neurons, KCC2 is the major extruder of intracellular chloride and in the presence of low intraneuronal chloride levels, the binding of GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) and glycine to their ionotropic receptors results in chloride influx with subsequent hyperpolarization contributing to neuronal inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. During brain development, the neuronal chloride equilibrium potential (E<sub>CI</sub>) gradually hyperpolarizes, in parallel with upregulation of KCC2, which contributes to the establishment and maintenance of hyperpolarizing inhibitory post-synaptic potentials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Recent evidence additionally implicates KCC2 as a structural protein involved in the morphological and functional maturation of cortical dendritic spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. A number of further investigations were therefore undertaken to elucidate the impact of the identified mutations on KCC2 function.</p>
      </sec>

        <title>Homology modelling for identified KCC2 mutants</title>
        <p>KCC2 exists in both monomeric and oligomeric forms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and consists of 12 transmembrane (TM) helices interconnected by a series of extracellular and intracellular loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1d</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>). Alternative splicing gives rise to two isoforms KCC2a and KCC2b, differing by an extra 40 amino acids in the N-terminus of KCC2b. The changes identified in our patients are present in both isoforms, and protein homology modelling studies were undertaken to predict damaging effects on the structure-function properties of KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). Located within TM6, L426 is almost universally conserved in the 100 most similar proteins and substitution with a proline residue is expected to disrupt this TM helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). G551, located in the intracellular loop between TM8âTM9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), is also well conserved in similar proteins, and substitution with the significantly larger negatively charged aspartate residue may interact unfavourably with other residues in the loop region or block other molecular interactions. L311H is located extracellularly between TM5 and TM6 and the extended loop region between residues 303 and 407 is not amenable to accurate modelling because of lack of sequence identity. Most KCC2 homologues have a hydrophobic residue at this position 311 (typically valine, methionine, isoleucine or phenylalanine), and a leucine/histidine exchange would therefore be expected to break hydrophobic interactions, thereby disrupting structural stability of the TM5âTM6 loop. L311 is also adjacent to one of four evolutionarily conserved cysteines (C310, C325, C345 and C354) in the TM5âTM6 region that are vital for KCC2 transport activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. L311 may be part of a hydrophobic pocket formed with a cysteine disulphide bond, in which case L311H may also interfere with the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulphide bonds.</p>

        <title>KCC2 mutants affect chloride homeostasis</title>
        <p>To investigate the functional consequences of the identified mutations on KCC2 transporter function and chloride (Cl<sup>â</sup>) homeostasis, we recorded in voltage-clamp mode from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and the glycine receptor (GlyR) Î±<sub>2</sub> subunit, which forms homopentameric glycine-gated chloride channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Recordings were also obtained from cells co-transfected with a plasmid either encoding the wild-type KCC2b isoform or one of the mutants L311H, L426P and G551D. Pressure application of glycine evoked large inward currents (I<sub>Gly</sub>) in eGFP-positive cells held at â80âmV (<italic>n</italic>=33), but not in eGFP-negative cells (<italic>n</italic>=8). The I<sub>Gly</sub> amplitude varied linearly with the holding potential and reversed in polarity. Fitting the IâV relationship, cells transfected with both GlyR Î±<sub>2</sub> and wild-type KCC2 yielded a more hyperpolarising E<sub>Cl</sub> than cells solely expressing GlyR Î±<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), consistent with Cl<sup>â</sup> extrusion by KCC2. KCC2 mutants, however, exhibited a depolarized E<sub>Cl</sub> relative to wild-type KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The estimated E<sub>Cl</sub> for all three mutants was similar and did not differ significantly from that in cells solely expressing GlyR Î±<sub>2</sub> and eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), consistent with passive equilibration of Cl<sup>â</sup> ions as predicted from the pipette and extracellular solutions. To further explore impaired mutant KCC2 activity, we measured the rate at which E<sub>Cl</sub> recovers to a starting value after a period of chloride load, as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Glycine was applied every 30âs while holding cells at â80âmV then at +40âmV to load them with Cl<sup>â</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). When the holding potential was reset to â80âmV, glycine-evoked currents were larger due to the increased driving force. In cells transduced with wild-type KCC2, glycine-evoked currents I<sub>Gly</sub> returned to the initial amplitude consistent with transporter-mediated extrusion of chloride. The rate at which I<sub>Gly</sub> amplitude recovered for the three KCC2 mutants was much slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). The recovery rate in cells expressing L426P and G551D mutants was not significantly different from cells expressing only GlyR Î±<sub>2</sub> and eGFP, consistent with near complete loss of KCC2 function. The recovery rate for the L311H mutant was intermediate, suggesting some residual KCC2 activity. Thus, the identified missense changes in KCC2 render the transporter either near non-functional (L426P and G551D) or partly functional (L311H), and are predicted to lead to intracellular Cl<sup>â</sup> accumulation in neurons with loss of a hyperpolarizing driving force for GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and GlyRs.</p>

        <title>Mutant KCC2 shows reduced expression/altered glycosylation</title>
        <p>To further investigate disease mechanisms in KCC2-associated EIMFS, an <italic>in vitro</italic> heterologous expression system for immunoblotting and surface protein biotinylation was used to compare total and cell surface expression levels of wild-type and mutant KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). When compared with wild-type, the mutants L311H, L426P and G551D showed significantly reduced KCC2 expression at the cell surface versus total (whole-cell lysate) expressed transporter (two bands representing glycosylated and unglycosylated protein occur at â¼130âkDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The proportion of wild-type KCC2 existing in the glycosylated state was 50% at the surface and 43% in whole-cell lysate; significantly lower proportions were observed for all three mutants at both the cell surface and in total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The missense changes therefore appear to impair cell surface expression and post-translational modification of KCC2. To further investigate the cell surface expression of KCC2 mutants, HEK 293 cells were transfected with KCC2, FLAG-tagged at the second extracellular loop, and HcRed NLS, to visualize the cell nucleus and provide confirmation of effective transfection. Immunostaining of permeabilised cells revealed that all three mutants were overall expressed at similar levels to wild-type KCC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5eâh</xref>). However, while wild-type KCC2 was robustly detected at the surface of intact cells, much less KCC2 was detected in cells expressing KCC2-L311H, -L426P and -G551D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5aâd</xref>), further suggesting that these three mutations lead to expression of mutant KCC2 transporters with impaired cell-surface localization.</p>

        <title>KCC2 knockout zebrafish model reveals early motor deficit</title>
        <p>A zebrafish disease model was utilized to study the effect of KCC2 deficiency on circuit function at an early stage of development. Zebrafish have two KCC2 orthologs, KCC2a and KCC2b (due to ancestral gene duplication) and TALEN-mediated genome editing was undertaken to generate knockout zebrafish models. An 8-bp deletion was induced in exon 4 of <italic>KCC2a</italic> to disrupt KCC2a and similarly, a 5-bp deletion was induced in exon 4 of <italic>KCC2b</italic> to disrupt KCC2b. Wild-type zebrafish larvae at 2 days post fertilization (dpf), showed a typical escape swimming response upon touch, with rhythmic side-to-side contraction of the trunk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Neither single KCC2a nor KCC2b knockout zebrafish displayed developmental or motor defects, and both survived into adulthood. A KCC2a-KCC2b double knockout zebrafish model was then generated, and tactile-induced motor behaviour was assessed. In contrast to wild-type, the KCC2a-KCC2b double knockout zebrafish showed abnormal jerky spasmodic movements during the escape response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). Severe motor phenotypes are also reported in other loss-of-function KCC2 animal models. Null mutations in <italic>Kazachoc</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of <italic>KCC2</italic>) lead to lethality, while partial loss-of-function causes increased seizure susceptibility mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Complete knockout of <italic>kcc2</italic> in mice also leads to neonatal lethality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. A murine model retaining â¼5% KCC2 function displays frequent spontaneous seizures and excess hippocampal excitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Mice with one null and one hypomorphic allele resulting in 15â20% overall residual KCC2 protein have an increased susceptibility to induced seizures with abnormal cognitive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Overall, our data suggests that, as evident in a number of other animal models, loss of KCC2 function causes an early motor deficit in zebrafish, characterized by jerky spasmodic movements. While the double knockout zebrafish may represent a useful model for EIMFS, true comparability to the human disease is limited by genetic and biological differences between the two model systems.</p>

        <title>KCC2 in epilepsy and other neurological disorders</title>
        <p>The physiological role of KCC2 in mediating neuronal inhibition has led to considerable speculation about the potential involvement of this transporter in the pathogenesis of human epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our report of autosomal recessive loss-of-function <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutations in EIMFS substantiates this hypothesis. A role for KCC2 in human epilepsy is further evident by the recent identification of heterozygous missense <italic>SLC12A5</italic> polymorphisms in other epilepsy phenotypes, as R952H and R1049C exhibit statistical association with idiopathic generalized epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These variants reside in conserved residues in the KCC2 cytoplasmic C-terminus and display reduced Cl(<sup>-</sup>)-extrusion capacities leading to less hyperpolarized glycine equilibrium potentials (E<sub>Gly</sub>), and impair KCC2 stimulatory phosphorylation at serine 940, a key regulatory site. Furthermore, R952H has been reported in an Australian family with febrile seizures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and KCC2-R952H reduces neuronal Cl<sup>â</sup> extrusion with impaired ability to induce dendritic spines. Reduced surface expression of KCC2-R952H is postulated to contribute to these functional deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Pathogenic processes governing KCC2-related seizure disorders therefore appear multifactorial, with mechanistic overlap between the different epilepsies. Impaired KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) from defective transporter activity, decreased cell-surface KCC2 expression and reduced protein glycosylation contribute to loss of KCC2 function in the severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy described in this report. Developing novel therapeutic molecules that increase the expression and efficacy of KCC2 for early clinical translation are now a research priority. Genotype-phenotype correlations will become evident over time, as more cases are reported, but <italic>SLC12A5</italic> gene dosage (recessive versus dominant disorders), mutation type and the effect of mutations on protein activity may indeed influence epilepsy phenotype, including age of disease onset and clinical severity. Identification of additional <italic>SLC12A5</italic> mutations in humans will no doubt further expand the clinical spectrum and solidify genotype-phenotype observations in KCC2-related human diseases.</p>

        <p>Family A was enrolled in a Swedish study investigating EIEE with exome sequencing at the Karolinska University Hospital. Family B was recruited to a United Kingdom EIMFS genetic study from Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. In addition, patients with EIMFS (without mutations in known disease genes) were identified through international collaborators. This included 18 UK patients, 1 Swedish patient, 7 patients from the USA and 12 patients from an Australian cohort. Detailed electroclinical phenotyping was performed in all cases. Written informed consent was obtained from participants, and all studies were approved by local ethics committees (The Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden and South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee, UK) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Whole exome sequencing data were anonymised and deposited in secure databases at each participating academic institution with data access to members of the research teams involved in each study.

        <p>In Family A, bioinformatic analysis was performed using the Mutation Identification Pipeline (MIP) v.1.5.6 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mip-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">http://mip-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html</ext-link>. The data were annotated, scored and ranked using MIP. MIP annotates the variants with information from external and in-house databases as well as the genetic inheritance pattern (including compound mutations; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). A weighted sum model based on a subset of these annotations is then applied to generate a rank score for each variant. The variants are then sorted according to disease causing potential based on the rank score. Most weight in the rank score model is put on the inheritance pattern, minor allele frequency, gene coding annotation, functional annotation and protein predictions. Thus, MIP retains all variants but prioritizes them according to disease causing potential based on the rank score. Briefly, the sequence reads were aligned to the whole human genome reference GRCh37 using Mosaik (v.2.2.3) and PCR and optical duplicates were marked using PicardTools (Picard 2013, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net:">http://picard.sourceforge.net:</ext-link>).

        <p>In Family B the sequencing data were mapped to the canonical chromosomes (chr1-22, X, Y and M; UCSC genome browser) of the hg19 (GRCh37) reference human genome using the Novoalign Software. After removal of PCR duplicates (MosaikDupSnoop/Picard) and reads without a unique mapping location (MosaikSort), quality score recalibration and indel realignment were performed using the GATK package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Variants were extracted using the Maq model in SAMtools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and filtered by the following criteria: coverage &gt;8 Ã , consensus quality &gt;30, SNP quality &gt;30 and root mean square mapping quality &gt;30. These variants were further filtered against dbSNP build 135 and 1000 Genomes and annotated based on the UCSC known Canonical transcript database (UCSC genome browser) using Annovar. Genes containing non-synonymous or splice-site variants or coding indels were considered further. Due to the family structures for both families, we employed an autosomal recessive model, and genes containing one or more homozygous variants (Family A and B) or two or more heterozygous non-synonymous, splice-site or coding indels variants (Family A) were considered candidate genes. The candidate genes left after filtering were investigated for putative involvement in EIMFS by literature and database searches.</p>

The crystal structure of the <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> ApcT Transporter (PDB: 3GIA; 2.35âÃ resolution) was identified as the best template for residues 115â682 (TM middle domain), (HHPred e-value: 2.4 Ã 10<sup>â36</sup>). The HHpred alignment was used as preliminary pairwise sequence alignment for homology modelling. The extended loop region between TM5 and TM6 (residues 303â407) could not be accurately modelled due to lack of sequence identity and was therefore removed. A preliminary homology model of KCC2 middle domain was calculated using MODELLER-9v10<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The ConSurf web server<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> with default parameters, was used to evaluate the evolutionary conservation and improve the quality of the alignment accordingly.

The access resistance, monitored throughout the experiments was &lt;15âMÎ© and results were discarded if it changed by more than 20%.

Local pressure application of glycine (1âmM in control HEPES solution) was delivered via a patch pipette connected to a Picospritzer (General Valve Corporation). The puff pipette was positioned roughly 10â20âÎ¼m away from the recorded cell and the bath perfusion arranged to keep it downstream of this position. Cells were first held at â80âmV while several glycine applications were made at 30âs intervals to ensure that no desensitisation occurred. Glycine puffs (3â5âms, 5â10âpsi) were then delivered every minute at different holding potentials (â80 to +20âmV, 20âmV increment). A linear regression of I<sub>Gly</sub> amplitude plotted against the holding potential was used to analyse the voltage dependence.

        <p>The full-length human wild-type KCC2 and the three mutant KCC2 sequences were cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCMVâMyc. We amplified the sequences from the Origene KCC2 wild-type expression vector and the mutagenized vectors using the Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Life Technologies), custom-designed cloning primers (available on request) and 94âÂ°C for 2âmin followed by 30 cycles of 94âÂ°C for 30âs, 55âÂ°C for 30âs and 68âÂ°C for 3âmin 30âs. Then using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) purified PCR products and the pCMVâMyc plasmid were successively digested first with EcoRI and then with Acc65I (isoschizomer of KpnI) according to manufacturer's protocol. Following purification with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit the PCR products were ligated into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the vector pCMV-Myc (which was kindly provided from Dr Paul Gissen) using T4 DNA ligase (Promega). For amplification of Myc-tagged KCC2 constructs we transformed NEB 10-beta competent E.coli cells (New England BioLabs) with the plasmids and subsequently isolated the plasmids with the QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN). All expression constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the entire coding region, to ensure that during PCR amplification no additional mutations had been introduced. LLC-PK cells (non-transfected LLC-PK1 cells kindly supplied by Dr Roxanne A. Vaughan, University of North Dakota) were then transiently transfected with equal amounts of WT, L311H, L426P and G551D constructs. After 24âh, surface proteins were labelled with biotin and cells were lysed. Biotinylated fraction and total cell lysates were eluted with 8% Tris-glycine, separated on a SDS polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-myc antibodies.

        <title>Clinical and molecular genetic findings in families with EIMFS.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Family A (Caucasian origin) and Family B (Pakistani origin). Squares represent males. Circles represent females. Affected individuals are represented by black shading. Double parallel horizontal bars indicate consanguinity in Family B. (<bold>b</bold>) The left upper and lower EEG recording are two consecutive EEG segments, each 1âmin long, from the ictal EEG of proband A-II:1. Seizure activity is boxed in black with rhythmic spike-waves evident initially on the left hemisphere (red), then fading and seizure activity starting up in the right (blue) temporal area. Expanded segments below (10âs) show the spike-wave activity in more detail. Montage: Longitudinal bipolar according to the 10â20 system. Only lateral channels shown. The right upper (compressed) and lower EEG recording from proband B-II:4 reveal central/vertex and right parietal epileptiform activity (purple/red and boxed in red, upper right figure) that wanes with a return to the interictal state before onset of left centro-temporal ictal activity associated with facial twitching (blue and boxed in red, lower right figure). (<bold>c</bold>) <italic>SLC12A5</italic> consists of 26 exons (purple rectangles). Both wild-type (WT) and mutant DNA sequence is displayed. Three point mutations were identified in four patients with EIMFS (WT sequence indicated by yellow arrow, mutated base by orange arrow). The children from Family A harboured missense mutations in exon 9 (c.1277T&gt;C, L426P) and 13 [c.1652G&gt;A, G551D], while the two affected Family B patients were homozygous for missense variant c.932T&gt;A (L311H) in exon 8. (<bold>d</bold>) The KCC2 protein structure consists of 12 transmembrane (TM) helices (numbered blue cylinders) interconnected by a series of extracellular and intracellular loops. Sites of phosphorylation at the C-terminus are depicted as light green hexagons. N-linked glycosylated sites are indicated as dark green Y-shaped structures present at the extracellular loop between TM5 and TM6. The EIMFS mutations are indicated in red circles, located in the extracellular loop between TM5 and TM6 (L311H), within TM6 (L426P) and in the intracellular loop between TM8 and TM9 (G551D). Variants associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and febrile convulsions are represented as purple circles at the C-terminus.</p>

        <title>Structural modeling of KCC2 mutants.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) A homology model of KCC2 showing a transmembrane (TM) protein consisting of 12 TM helices interconnected by intracellular and extracellular loops. (<bold>b</bold>) In our homology model, L426 (shown in a surface representation) is located in the unwound TM6 (TM6a). This helix, together with TM1, is pivotal for the transporter function. In the L426P mutant, the substitution of a leucine with a proline (not shown) is likely to introduce a kink in TM6, which will result in alternation of the interaction with TM1b. A comparative analysis of different structures of transporters (LeuT, vSGLT and ApcT structures) shows that the conformation of TM1b plays a key role in allowing access to the substrate binding pocket (maintaining a conformation that completely occludes access to the post-synaptic space but only partially occludes access to the cytosolic side). Thus, the presence of a proline in KCC2 TM6 could lead to an alteration of the extracellular occlusion formed by TM1b and TM6. (<bold>c</bold>) Our KCC2 model predicts that G551 (shown in a surface representation) is located in the intracellular loop between TM8 and TM9 (residues 539â557). In the G551D mutant, the substitution of the glycine with an aspartic acidâa larger and negatively charged amino acidâis likely to introduce a distortion in the orientation of TM8. The latter helix contains the putative substrate binding residues A521 and S525, based on homology to ApcT (A287 and T291, respectively, PDB: 3GIA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, introducing an aspartic acid in position 551 could lead to disruption of the binding site thereby affecting substrate binding.</p>

        <p>L311H, L426P and G551D substitutions impair cell-surface expression of KCC2. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with KCC2-FLAG and HsRed-NLS and immunostained using anti-FLAG and AlexaFluor 488 antibodies. KCC2 WT is detected at the cell surface of intact cells (<bold>a</bold>) whereas KCC2-L311H, -L426P and -G551D display very little cell surface expression (<bold>b</bold>â<bold>d</bold>) Expression of KCC2-WT,-L311H,-L426P and -G551D is detected in permeabilised cells (<bold>e</bold>â<bold>h</bold>) Scale bar is 20âÎ¼m.</p>

        <title>Schematic representation of postulated disease mechanisms in KCC2-EIMFS.</title>
        <p>A post-synaptic neuron is schematically represented for (<bold>a</bold>) wild-type and (<bold>b</bold>) mutant KCC2 in EIMFS. Neurotransmitters and ions are depicted as shapes, namely GABA (red circle), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>, magenta diamond) and chloride (Cl<sup>â</sup>, blue circle). The mature KCC2 transporter (orange) with N-linked glycosylated extracellular domains (black branched structure) is located at the synaptic membrane. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) is a purple oval. In normal mature neuronal cells (<bold>a</bold>) KCC2 transporter (bold orange) maintains low intraneuronal chloride (represented by blue fluid level) through chloride extrusion (solid orange lines). With GABA binding, the resultant gradient allows an influx of chloride via the GABA<sub>A</sub>R resulting in a hyperpolarizing IPSP (inhibitory post-synaptic potential), which contributes to neuronal inhibition. In KCC2-EIMFS (<bold>b</bold>) a number of mechanisms contribute to loss of KCC2 function (faded orange KCC2 transporter) and impaired transporter ability to extrude chloride (dashed orange lines), including reduced cell surface transporter expression and abnormal protein glycosylation. This results in a depolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potential, thereby leading to impaired neuronal inhibition.</p>
