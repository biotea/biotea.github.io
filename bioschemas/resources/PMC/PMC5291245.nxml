        <p>Histone H3.Y is a primate-specific, distant H3 variant. It is evolutionarily derived from H3.3, and may function in transcription regulation. However, the mechanism by which H3.Y regulates transcription has not been elucidated. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of the H3.Y nucleosome, and found that many H3.Y-specific residues are located on the entry/exit sites of the nucleosome. Biochemical analyses revealed that the DNA ends of the H3.Y nucleosome were more flexible than those of the H3.3 nucleosome, although the H3.Y nucleosome was stable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, the linker histone H1, which compacts nucleosomal DNA, appears to bind to the H3.Y nucleosome less efficiently, as compared to the H3.3 nucleosome. These characteristics of the H3.Y nucleosome are also conserved in the H3.Y/H3.3 heterotypic nucleosome, which may be the predominant form in cells. In human cells, H3.Y preferentially accumulated around transcription start sites (TSSs). Taken together, H3.Y-containing nucleosomes around transcription start sites may form relaxed chromatin that allows transcription factor access, to regulate the transcription status of specific genes.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are the major protein components of chromatin, which packages the genomic DNA within the nucleus in eukaryotes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, in which about 150 base pairs of DNA and a histone octamer, containing two each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, form a disc-like structure (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the nucleosome, the DNA is tightly wrapped around the histone octamer, and is generally inaccessible to DNA binding proteins. To overcome this nucleosome barrier, cells modulate the structures and dynamics of nucleosomes to regulate genomic DNA functions. The histone composition and the chromatin structure around transcription start sites (TSSs) are distinct from those of protein coding regions (gene bodies), especially in actively transcribing genes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, the specific chromatin architecture may play an essential role in transcription regulation.</p><p>Histone modifications may function to modulate chromatin structures, and to up- and down-regulate gene expression in chromatin (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, non-allelic isoforms of histones H2A and H3 have been widely found in eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Among the histone H3 variants, H3.3, H3T (H3.4), H3.5, H3.X, H3.Y and CENP-A (CenH3) have been identified in humans (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), in addition to the two canonical H3.1 and H3.2 variants, which are produced in S-phase cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These H3 variants have different expression profiles in tissues, suggesting that they may perform specific functions during cell differentiation and tissue development (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Histone H3.Y has been identified as a primate-specific, distant H3 variant evolutionarily derived from H3.3. A previous study reported that, in humans, H3.Y is expressed in several normal and malignant tissues (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). H3.Y is also present in the human hippocampus, highlighting the possibility that H3.Y may have a specific function in brain development. Interestingly, H3.Y preferentially accumulates in euchromatin, and the H3.Y knockdown leads to more genes being transcriptionally suppressed, rather than enhanced (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, endogenous H3.Y production was observed in some osteosarcoma cells, and, intriguingly, the H3.Y production was enhanced by particular stress stimuli (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The H3.Y knockdown leads to changes in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, and consequently diminished cell growth (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that the nucleosome containing H3.Y may play a role in transcription activation and may function in cell differentiation. However, no link between the function and structure of H3.Y has been established.</p><p>In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of the H3.Y nucleosome, and analyzed the biochemical and structural properties of the H3.Y nucleosome <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> mobility and genome-wide localization of H3.Y were also studied. The results consistently suggested that H3.Y is stably assembled at TSSs, to form an accessible chromatin configuration with flexible DNA ends and reduced linker histone H1 binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Purification of recombinant human histones and Nap1</title><p>The DNA fragment encoding human H3.Y was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA fragment encoding human H3.3.

Purification of human histones was performed by the method described previously (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). For the preparation of the heterotypic nucleosome containing H3.Y and H3.3, His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tagged H3.3 was used, and the heterotypic nucleosome was prepared by the method described previously (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Human Nap1 was purified as described previously (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

To do so, we focused on the H3.3 Arg42 residue, which is located near the entry/exit sites of the nucleosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This residue is substituted by Lys42 in H3.Y (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We then purified the H3.3 R42K and H3.Y K42R mutants, in which the corresponding residues are replaced with each other.

In humans, H3.Y production is extremely limited, and is undetectable in HeLa cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, we used the HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-H3.Y for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, although the production of GFP-H3.3 was about 2-fold higher than that of GFP-H3.Y in cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

The heterotypic H3.Y/His-SUMO-H3.3 nucleosome migrated faster than the homotypic His-SUMO-H3.3 nucleosome, but slower than the homotypic H3.Y nucleosome. We then purified the H3.Y/His-SUMO-H3.3 nucleosome by preparative native PAGE (Supplementary Figure S6D). After the purification, the His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO portion of the heterotypic H3.Y/His-SUMO-H3.3 nucleosome was proteolyzed by PreScission protease, and the resulting H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome was further purified by a second round of preparative native PAGE (Supplementary Figure S6E and F).</p><p>The heterotypic H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome was more susceptible to MNase than the H3.3 nucleosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">B</xref>), indicating that the flexible nature of the DNA in the H3.Y nucleosome is also conserved.

H3.Y mRNA expression is observed in primary cells from human testis and brain, except the thalamus, in addition to cancer cells, such as breast, lung, bone and ovary tumors (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). H3.Y production is also observed in the human osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS, especially under nutrient starvation and/or overgrowth conditions. The H3.Y knockdown significantly affects cell growth, and changes the expression profiles of many genes related to cell cycle control (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the amount of the endogenous H3.Y protein is extremely low in these cells. These findings suggested that the H3.Y nucleosomes may be incorporated into specific genomic loci, and may regulate the genomic DNA function at these loci.</p><p>Previous analyses revealed that ectopically produced H3.Y preferentially localizes in transcriptionally active euchromatic regions, and many genes are supressed by H3.Y knockdown (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), implying that the H3.Y nucleosome actually plays a role in transcription activation. However, the mechanism by which the H3.Y nucleosome contributes to transcription activation has remained unknown, because no structural and biochemical studies have been reported.</p><p>To understand the contribution of H3.Y to chromatin structure and gene regulation, in the present study, we performed structural, biochemical and genomic analyses of human H3.Y. We obtained five major findings: (i) the H3.Y nucleosome forms a relaxed chromatin configuration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which is induced by its flexible DNA ends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); (ii) the H3.Y nucleosome binds linker histone H1 less efficiently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); (iii) the H3.Y nucleosome is very stable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>); (iv) H3.Y preferentially accumulates on the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes in cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>); and (v) the DNA end flexibility and reduced H1 binding characteristics of the H3.Y nucleosome are conserved in the heterotypic H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), which may be the predominant form of the H3.Y-containing nucleosome in cells. It is interesting to imagine that the heterotypic H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome may dictate the direction of transcription by its semi-flexible nature. Future studies are awaited to understand these interesting questions.</p><p>Based on these findings and the previous reports, we propose a model for the regulation and function of H3.Y (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). H3.Y assembles into nucleosomes around TSSs, probably as the H3.Y/H3.3 heterotypic form. Once assembled, the H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome is maintained and provides an accessible chromatin configuration platform, with flexible ends that reduce histone H1 binding. This is consistent with the previous genomic analysis, which revealed that H1 is generally depleted at active promoters (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). In such a relaxed chromatin configuration, the transcription enzymes, such as RNA polymerase, have better access to the TSS regions of active genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Thus, the stable association of H3.Y in chromatin may function to maintain the active gene status. However, it is unclear how H3.Y becomes accumulated at TSSs. H3.Y shares the binding motif for the H3.3-specific chaperone, DAXX, with H3.3 (63, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). If H3.Y employs the common assembly pathway with H3.3, then the TSS accumulation of H3.Y may be established as a result of the H3.Y removal from the gene body region, but not from TSSs. This may occur by nucleosome removal by a transcribing RNA polymerase.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>A model for the H3.Y nucleosome function. H3.Y (purple) predominantly accumulates around TSSs, probably forms the heterotypic H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome, and reduces the binding of the linker histone H1 (second row). The resulting accessible chromatin region containing H3.Y may be targeted by the transcription machinery (third row). The stable properties of the H3.Y nucleosome enable it to stay around the TSS, and it maintains the relaxed chromatin configuration. This specific characteristic of the H3.Y nucleosome may allow it to continuously function during the transcription process, even the expression level of H3.Y is extremely low in cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw202fig9"/></fig><p>The H3.Y-mediated relaxed chromatin formation is probably due to its DNA flexibility. DNA end flexibility has also been found in the nucleosome containing the centromeric H3 variant, CENP-A (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>â<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). However, the sedimentation assay revealed that the CENP-A poly-nucleosomes are rather compacted, as compared to the poly-nucleosomes containing H3 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Interestingly, Fang <italic>etÂ al</italic>. showed that the compaction of the CENP-A poly-nucleosome strictly depends on the CENP-A specific RG loop (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). This loop is not conserved in other H3 variants, including H3.Y. Therefore, the compaction of the CENP-A poly-nucleosome may be mediated by a different mechanism from that of the H3.Y poly-nucleosome.</p><p>Finally, the stable chromatin association and TSS accumulation of H3.Y may underlie its function as an epigenetic marker, which allows the TSS location to be inherited in daughter cells. To do so, the cell-cycle dependent transition from the homotypic H3.Y/H3.Y nucleosome to the heterotypic H3.Y/H3.3 nucleosome may be required around TSSs. Identification of the H3.Y chaperone and/or exchange mechanism for the specific recruitment/displacement of H3.Y to promote this homotypic-heterotypic nucleosome transition is an important future issue to address.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>The structural data of the H3.Y nucleosome have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5AY8).
