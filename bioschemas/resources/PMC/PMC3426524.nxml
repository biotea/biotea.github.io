      <abstract>
        <p>The conserved TREX complex, which contains UAP56, Aly, CIP29, and the multi-subunit THO complex, functions in mRNA export. Recently, several putative new components of the human TREX complex were identified by mass spectrometry. Here, we investigated the function of two of these, PDIP3 and ZC11A. Our data indicate that both of these proteins are components of a common TREX complex and function in mRNA export. Recently, we found that both CIP29 and Aly associate with the DEAD box helicase UAP56 and with the TREX complex in an ATP-dependent manner. We now show that this is also the case for PDIP3 and ZC11A. Thus, together with previous work, our data indicate that the TREX complex participates in multiple ATP-dependent interactions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During gene expression, pre-mRNAs are synthesized in the nucleus, undergo RNA processing, followed by export of the mature mRNA to the cytoplasm for translation. The TREX complex, which is conserved from yeast to human, functions in mRNA export <xref rid="pone.0043804-Strasser1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Kohler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The known components of the conserved TREX complex are UAP56, Aly, CIP29, and the multi-component THO complex <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Jimeno1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Jimeno2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Both CIP29 and Aly interact with the DEAD box helicase UAP56 in an ATP-dependent manner and require ATP for recruitment to TREX via UAP56 <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recent mass spectrometry studies of immunopurified human TREX revealed five additional putative new components that appear to be unique to the metazoan TREX complex <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These are ZC11A, PDIP3, ELG, SRAG, and ERH.</p>
      <p>Here we investigated the function of two of the putative new human TREX components, PDIP3 and ZC11A. We show that both proteins are immunoprecipitated (IPâd) by antibodies to known TREX components in RNase-treated nuclear extracts, and PDIP3 and ZC11A reciprocally co-IP in these extracts. Functional studies indicate that both PDIP3 and ZC11A function in mRNA export. Surprisingly, we found that both PDIP3 and ZC11A, like CIP29 and Aly, require ATP for association with UAP56 and the TREX complex. These data indicate that multiple ATP-dependent interactions are involved in TREX complex assembly.</p>

        <title>PDIP3 and ZC11A co-IP with TREX Components</title>
        <p>To further characterize the human TREX complex, we sought to analyze the putative new components. PDIP3 was of particular interest because of its high similarity to Aly (â¼40% identical) <xref rid="pone.0043804-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To characterize PDIP3, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal peptide. This antibody recognizes the two major forms of PDIP, PDIPÎ± and Î², and IPs both forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The Î± and Î² forms of PDIP3 are splice variants that are 46 and 43 kD, respectively, and both forms contain an RRM that is 42% identical to that of Aly <xref rid="pone.0043804-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To characterize ZC11A, we used a commercially available polyclonal antibody, which recognizes a protein of the correct size by Western, and this protein is specifically IPâd by the ZC11A antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). ZC11A contains three amino terminal zinc fingers of the CCCH type and nothing else is known about this protein to our knowledge. To further investigate PDIP3 and ZC11A, we RNase-treated HeLa nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) and used them for IP/Westerns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). This analysis revealed that PDIP3Î± and Î² efficiently co-IP with TREX components, including THOC2, UAP56 and Aly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Previous work showed that PDIP3 (also known as Skar <xref rid="pone.0043804-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) interacts with and is a substrate of S6K1 <xref rid="pone.0043804-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. PDIP3 was also reported to associate with the exon junction complex (EJC), which is recruited to exon junctions during splicing <xref rid="pone.0043804-LeHir1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We did not identify a significant association between PDIP3 and the exon junction complex <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, like its relative Aly, we found that PDIP3 is abundantly associated with TREX complex components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These differences in associations with the EJC and TREX complex may be due to the assay systems used and/or may indicate that a handoff of PDIP3 occurs between the TREX complex and the EJC during the mRNA export pathway. As observed with PDIP3, we also found that ZC11A efficiently co-IPs with TREX components in RNase-treated nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

        <title>PDIP3 and ZC11A Associate with the TREX Complex in an ATP-dependent Manner</title>
        <p>In recent work, we found that both Aly and CIP29 associate with UAP56 and the THO complex in an ATP-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In contrast, the THO complex associates with UAP56 in an ATP-independent manner <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For the IP/Westerns carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g001">Figs. 1D and E</xref>, we included ATP in our nuclear extracts. Thus, we next sought to determine whether ATP affected the association of PDIP3 or ZC11A with UAP56. To do this, we incubated RNase-treated nuclear extract in the presence or absence of ATP, followed by IP/Westerns. Remarkably, this analysis revealed that both PDIP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, top panels) and ZC11A (2A, bottom panels) associate with UAP56 in the presence, but not in the absence, of ATP. We next examined whether ATP affected the association between PDIP3, ZC11A, and the THO complex. Significantly, PDIP3, ZC11A, and THOC2 co-IPâd only in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). As expected from our previous work, the association between UAP56 and THOC2 was ATP-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, together, our data indicate that both PDIP3 and ZC11A, like Aly and CIP29, interact with UAP56 and the THO complex in an ATP-dependent manner. Moreover, the observation that ZC11A and PDIP3 co-IP both with each other and with other TREX components suggests that these proteins form one common TREX complex.</p>

        <title>PDIP3 and ZC11A Function in mRNA Export</title>
        <p>We next asked whether PDIP3 and ZC11A have roles in mRNA export. Although PDIP3 was efficiently knocked down using RNAi, we did not observe an export phenotype. We also knocked down Aly alone or in combination with PDIP3, as these two proteins are related. Consistent with previous work <xref rid="pone.0043804-Okada1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Hautbergue1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a significant inhibition of polyA+ export was observed with the Aly knockdown alone, but this inhibition was not further exacerbated by the PDIP3 knockdown. Thus, to investigate whether PDIP3 plays a role in mRNA export, we overexpressed full length HA-tagged PDIP3 or a HA-tagged negative control protein (HA-DDX3). Western blots confirmed that the HA-tagged proteins were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, IF with HA antibodies showed that HA-PDIP3 is present in nuclear speckles domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), as observed with other known TREX components <xref rid="pone.0043804-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. We then transfected HeLa cells with empty vector, HA-tagged PDIP3 or HA-tagged DDX3 and carried out fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for total polyA+ RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). DAPI was used to identify the nucleus and immunofluorescence (IF) was used to identify cells containing the overexpressed HA-tagged proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Significantly, this analysis revealed that polyA+ RNA export was potently inhibited in the cells containing overexpressed PDIP3, but was unaffected in cells containing the empty vector or the overexpressed negative control DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, higher magnification images of cells transfected with HA-PDIP3 revealed that the polyA+ RNA accumulated in discrete nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In recent work, we found that polyA+ RNA accumulates in nuclear speckle domains when either UAP56 or Aly are knocked down <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, polyA+ RNA also accumulates in nuclear speckle domains in PDIP3-overexpression cells, as the foci containing the polyA+ RNA co-localize with the nuclear speckle domain marker protein SFRS2. The observation that PDIP3 overexpression inhibits mRNA export suggests that this protein may be functioning as a dominant negative and thus may play a role in mRNA export. In addition, it is possible that, similar to other TREX components <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dias1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, PDIP3 functions in releasing polyA+ RNA from nuclear speckle domains. Alternatively, PDIP3 may retain polyA+ RNA in speckles because the mRNA accumulates together with PDIP3 in speckles when PDIP3 is overexpressed.</p>

            <p>A, B. The knockdown efficiency of ZC11A (A) or UAP56 (B) in HeLa cells was analyzed by Western. Loading controls were eIF4A3 (A) and CBP80 (B). Non-targeting siRNA was used as a control (cntl). C. Knockdown of ZC11A or UAP56/DDX39A results in retention of polyA+ RNA in the nucleus. PolyA+ RNA was visualized by FISH using an Alexa Fluor labeled oligo dT(70) probe. Scale bar, 10 Âµm. D. Same as C, except showing higher magnification of FISH images. Scale bar, 10 Âµm.</p>

        <p>To determine whether ZC11A functions in mRNA export, we transfected HeLa cells with siRNAs targeting ZC11A. Non-targeting siRNA was used as a negative control, and siRNAs targeting UAP56 (and its close relative DDX39A) were used as a positive control. Western analysis showed that ZC11A and UAP56 were efficiently knocked down by their respective siRNAs but not by the negative control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). We then carried out FISH for total polyA+ RNA in the knockdown cells. Significantly, this analysis revealed that mRNA export was abolished in the ZC11A knockdown cells, as observed with the UAP56 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, there was no effect on mRNA export with the negative control knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). To further characterize the ZC11A phenotype, we examined the cells under higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043804-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Unexpectedly, this analysis revealed that polyA+ RNA was evenly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (note that the dark regions are nucleoli) rather than retained in nuclear speckles, as observed with knockdown of other TREX components (e.g. UAP56 and Aly). These data suggest that ZC11A functions at a different step in the mRNA export pathway than the factors that result in nuclear speckle retention.</p>
        <p>In this study, we have characterized PDIP3 and ZC11A as two new components of the human TREX complex, and we have provided evidence that both proteins function in mRNA export. Remarkably, as we observed with Aly and CIP29 <xref rid="pone.0043804-Dufu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, both PDIP3 and ZC11A associate with UAP56 and the TREX complex in an ATP-dependent manner. In future studies it will be essential to understand the role of these numerous ATP-dependent interactions in TREX function. The observation that all of these proteins associate with a common TREX complex suggests that they remain in the TREX complex but may function in its dynamic remodeling during the mRNA export pathway.</p>
