      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Aberrant nucleic acids generated during viral replication are the main trigger for antiviral immunity, and mutations disrupting nucleic acid metabolism can lead to autoinflammatory disorders. Here we investigated the etiology of X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR), a primary immunodeficiency with autoinflammatory features. We discovered that XLPDR is caused by an intronic mutation that disrupts expression of <italic>POLA1</italic>, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-Î±. Unexpectedly, <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency results in increased type I interferon production. This enzyme is necessary for RNA:DNA primer synthesis during DNA replication and strikingly, POLA1 is also required for the synthesis of cytosolic RNA:DNA, which directly modulates interferon activation. Altogether, this work identified POLA1 as a critical regulator of the type I interferon response.</p>

    <p id="P2">Innate immunity relies on the ability of the host to detect unique molecular patterns displayed by potential pathogens. Viruses and their distinctive replication cycles can generate a variety of aberrant nucleic acids that activate innate immune sensors, resulting in type I interferon production. Mutations affecting genes involved in these sensing mechanisms can lead to immunodeficiency in humans<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In addition, autoinflammatory syndromes characterized by spontaneous hyperactivation of the type I interferon pathway have been linked to mutations in various genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism or signaling. The most prominent condition in this category is Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome (AGS), a rare genetic disorder affecting the brain, skin and other organs<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. About half of AGS cases are due to mutations in any of the three subunits of the RNase H2 complex<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, a nuclease with RNase activity directed at RNA:DNA hybrids that is required for removal of misincorporated ribonucleotides or RNA primers generated during DNA replication<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. In addition, studies of autoimmune disorders have highlighted that critical aspects of anti-viral signaling pathways in humans can be involved in the inherited susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">The study of defined syndromes of altered immune function can lead to powerful insights into gene function and the specific organization of immune responses in humans. With this goal in mind, we examined the genetic etiology of X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR, MIM 301220), a rare entity characterized by both recurrent infections and sterile inflammation in various organs. To date, seven families and 14 affected individuals have been reported<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The disease typically manifests in the first few months of life, when patients usually develop recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis, chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. Diffuse skin hyperpigmentation with a distinctive reticulate pattern is universally evident by early childhood, and this is later followed in many patients by hypohidrosis, corneal inflammation and scarring, enterocolitis resembling inflammatory bowel disease, and recurrent urethral strictures. Some of these features resemble the phenotypes associated with other mutations that affect immune function, particularly mutations in <italic>IKBKG</italic> (also known as NEMO), which can result in similar pigmentary changes and hypohidrosis<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Males with XLPDR also have a characteristic facies with frontally upswept hair and flared eyebrows. Female carriers are only known to have restricted pigmentary changes along Blaschkoâs lines.</p>
    <p id="P4">Our report demonstrates that XLPDR is due to a unique hypomorphic mutation of the <italic>POLA1</italic> gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-Î±, an essential component of the DNA replication machinery. Furthermore, our results revealed a previously unrecognized role for this replicative polymerase as a modulator of interferon activation through the generation of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids.</p>

        <title>XLPDR is caused by an intronic mutation in <italic>POLA1</italic></title>
        <p id="P5">Prior linkage analyses had mapped the <italic>XLPDR</italic> locus to a 4.9 Mb interval of the X chromosome<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, Sanger and exome capture sequencing failed to identify any causal mutation. For the genetic analysis performed here, we included five of the seven known XLPDR families, as well as seven new families not previously reported (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The additional probands all displayed characteristic pigmentary changes of XLPDR, and most had the distinctive facies (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Skin biopsies from two new probands demonstrated the presence of melanophages and amyloid-like material in the upper dermis, as has been previously reported in XLPDR<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">Given the failure of prior sequencing efforts to identify a mutation in coding exons or flanking splice sites within the linkage interval, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of four unrelated probands from Canada, Australia, Italy, and Waco, Texas (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, red arrows). Within the previously identified linkage interval, we investigated both nonsynonymous protein-coding changes and non-coding variants predicted to affect mRNA splicing, searching for variants that targeted the same gene in all four probands. Due to the rarity and high penetrance of the disease, variants were excluded if present with minor allele frequency &gt;1% among HapMap samples or the 1000 Genomes Project. Additional variants were excluded if they were present in WGS data from 18 males known not to have XLPDR whose genomes were sequenced using the same WGS method<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. No gene in the linkage interval harbored rare nonsynonymous variants in all four patients, in agreement with prior exome sequencing efforts. However, all four probands shared the same rare intronic variant, chrX:24744696 (hg19), predicted to alter splicing of <italic>POLA1</italic>, a gene in the XLPDR linkage region (NM_016937.3:c.1375â354A&gt;G). <italic>POLA1</italic> encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-Î±, a DNA-directed DNA polymerase that in vertebrates exists in a stable complex with Primase. The PolÎ±-Primase complex synthesizes RNA:DNA primers which initiate Okazaki fragment synthesis, and is therefore essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P7">As expected for a disease-causing mutation, the variant segregated with XLPDR or carrier status in five multiplex families tested (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and was absent from 1,133 genomes (452 male, 681 female) from an ethnically diverse cohort<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, DNA samples from other unrelated probands harbored the NM_016937.3:c.1375â354A&gt;G variant (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Only two individuals with the diagnosis of XLPDR were negative for this variant: a previously reported child from Lebanon<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and an atypical case from China who lacked the characteristic facial features of the syndrome (not shown here). Further analysis of these two individuals was not possible due to limited availability of DNA.</p>
        <p id="P8">To further investigate <italic>POLA1</italic> as a candidate gene for XLPDR, we hypothesized that there would be a paucity of loss-of-function (LoF) variants identified in public resequencing cohorts. In agreement with this notion, the Exome Aggregation Consortium of 60,706 individuals analyzed by next-generation sequencing (ExAC database) reports two different predicted LoF splicing variants, each in only a single heterozygous female. However, closer inspection of the predicted effects of these variants suggests that they may not be true LoF (not shown here). To more robustly assess the population prevalence of potentially deleterious missense variants, the Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) for <italic>POLA1</italic> was ascertained<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The RVIS measures the departure from the average number of common functional mutations found in genes with a similar mutational burden at a genome-wide level. A negative score indicates that the gene has less common functional variation than predicted and most often reflects purifying selection. The RVIS for <italic>POLA1</italic> is â0.795, which corresponds to the 12<sup>th</sup> percentile for scores genome-wide. This indicates that <italic>POLA1</italic> is under significant purifying selection, as predicted for a gene with such essential biological functions.</p>
        <p id="P9">Given the recurrent nature of the variant among most cases with XLPDR, we performed kinship analysis<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> which indicated that the four individuals sequenced were no closer than 5th degree relatives. Around the shared <italic>POLA1</italic> intronic variant, two probands (P1 and P7) shared a segment of 140 kb estimated to be identical by descent using BEAGLE<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The other two probands (P4 and P5) did not share this segment, and at most shared 3.7 kb in this region. Thus, while two of the families showed evidence of a distant founder effect, other cases have clearly emerged independently. Furthermore, the South Dakota proband was found to carry a <italic>de novo</italic> POLA1 mutation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Altogether, our genetic data indicated that a recurrent intronic mutation in <italic>POLA1</italic> is responsible for XLPDR.</p>

        <title>The XLPDR mutation results in <italic>POLA1</italic> missplicing</title>
        <p id="P10">Next, using dermal fibroblasts derived from three XLPDR probands and five control lines, we compared the expression levels of genes from the XLPDR linkage interval. Only <italic>POLA1</italic> was significantly underexpressed in XLPDR cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, POLA1 protein expression in fibroblasts was markedly reduced as well (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Quantitation using Li-COR indicated that POLA1 protein levels in XLPDR fibroblasts were reduced to about 35% of that seen in wild-type cells, and this was closely matched by the reduction observed by qRT-PCR at the mRNA level (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). An analogous effect on mRNA and protein expression was noted in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e,f</xref>). Despite having reduced POLA1 levels, mutant fibroblasts did not display altered proliferative capacity or changes in cell cycle distribution (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Similarly, mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected in two probands from the Waco, Texas family (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, POLA1 silencing by siRNA to a degree comparable to that seen in XLPDR did not lead to cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells with an integrated cell-cycle reporter system (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Thus, the reduction of <italic>POLA1</italic> expression in XLPDR did not appear to compromise cell replication, in agreement with the lack of a growth phenotype in most patients.</p>
        <p id="P11">Next, we examined the mechanism by which the NM_016937.3:c.1375â354A&gt;G variant disrupts <italic>POLA1</italic> gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> predicted that the XLPDR mutation creates a splice donor site located 76 nucleotides downstream of a cryptic splice acceptor sequence present in the same intron, introducing a novel exon 13a into the <italic>POLA1</italic> transcript (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Indeed, RT-PCR confirmed the presence of an aberrant <italic>POLA1</italic> transcript in mutant fibroblasts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), which by sequencing included the predicted exon 13a. Transcript specific qRT-PCR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) demonstrated a 65% reduction in wild-type mRNA levels in XLPDR fibroblasts, suggesting that a substantial proportion of missplicing occurs in these cells. The misspliced mRNA was much less abundant, suggesting that inclusion of exon 13a destabilizes the transcript. Meanwhile, in XLPDR-derived LCLs the aberrant transcript could be amplified only by RT-PCR primers specific to exon 13a (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>), suggesting that it is much less abundant in these cells compared to fibroblasts. To confirm that the intronic A&gt;G mutation was solely responsible for aberrant splicing, we introduced <italic>POLA1</italic> intron 13 and its surrounding exons into an exon trapping plasmid system<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Intron 13 containing the XLPDR mutation led to two transcripts, and sequencing of the larger one confirmed the presence of exon 13a (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). Although the aberrant exon 13a introduces a frameshift mutation, immunoblotting showed no evidence of a truncated protein; only reduced expression of full-length POLA1 protein was observed (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Altogether, the data indicate that the XLPDR mutation creates a hypomorphic <italic>POLA1</italic> allele, ultimately reducing POLA1 protein expression. In addition, the data suggest that the magnitude of reduction of POLA1 expression may be subject to tissue-specific differences in missplicing.</p>

        <p id="P12">To understand how <italic>POLA1</italic> might be linked to the XLPDR phenotype, we compared the transcriptome profiles of four control dermal fibroblasts lines against cells derived from two unrelated XLPDR patients (primary and telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts). Furthermore, we contrasted those findings to the effects of POLA1 silencing by siRNA in control fibroblasts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Compared to control fibroblasts, primary and immortalized XLPDR-derived cells displayed concordant alterations in gene expression for 177 genes, and nearly two-thirds of these changes (102 genes) were recapitulated by silencing of POLA1 in control fibroblasts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Most of these changes represented increased gene expression in <italic>POLA1</italic> deficient cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Ontology analysis indicated that these genes were primarily involved in the type I interferon signaling pathway, regulated by members of the IRF and NF-ÎºB families of transcription factors (<bold>Table</bold>). Therefore, we analyzed the response of mutant cells to activation of IRF- or NF-ÎºB-dependent gene expression, following poly(dA:dT) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation, respectively. In both instances, <italic>POLA1</italic>-deficient cells primarily displayed more robust activation of genes that map to the IRF and NF-ÎºB pathways (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In the case of poly(dA:dT) treatment, 35% of the gene response was affected by <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency, mostly resulting in greater gene expression (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, 137 of 387 genes). This included a number of genes such as <italic>IFNA21</italic>, several chemokines, NF-ÎºB regulatory proteins, and multiple histone genes (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), which were minimally induced unless cells were <italic>POLA1</italic> deficient. Similar results were noted after TNF treatment, where nearly 40% of the responsive genes were affected by <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, 108 of 276 responsive genes). Mutant fibroblasts were not only hyper-responsive to poly(dA:dT) and TNF, but also to other forms of cytosolic dsDNA, cytosolic dsRNA, IL-1Î², and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Furthermore, these alterations were mimicked by siRNA-mediated silencing of POLA1 in wild-type fibroblasts and HeLa cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that reduced POLA1 expression leads to constitutive enhancement of IRF and NF-ÎºB dependent gene expression, including canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other pro-inflammatory factors.</p>

In terms of functional analysis of the immune system, some patients displayed mild neutrophilia and lymphopenia, but morphologic features of white blood cells, including myeloid cell ultrastructure, were normal (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). There were no changes in critical lymphoid sub-populations or oxidative burst capacity of neutrophils.

        <title><italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency leads to TBK1 and IKK activation</title>
        <p id="P17">Next, we examined whether signaling events that activate the IRF and NF-ÎºB pathways are upregulated by <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency. In the IRF pathway, activation of various sensors results in the phosphorylation of the TBK1 and IKKÎµ kinases, which in turn then phosphorylate IRF family members, promoting their dimerization and nuclear translocation<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Fibroblasts from XLPDR patients displayed robust TBK1 phosphorylation, even at baseline conditions, far exceeding the signature noted in wild-type cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Similarly, silencing of POLA1 in HeLa cells led to phosphorylation of both TBK1 and IKKÎµ, which exceeded that achieved in control cells after stimulation with poly(dA:dT). This signature was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of IRF3 in nuclear fractions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). In the NF-ÎºB pathway, we found that XLPDR fibroblasts achieved similar degrees of IÎºB degradation and nuclear NF-ÎºB (RelA) accumulation after TNF stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>).

This event is mediated by the IKK complex and can increase transcriptional induction<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

Thus, these data show that <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency leads to activation of signaling cascades that converge on TBK1, IKKÎµ and the IKK complex. Blockade of TBK1 using a specific kinase inhibitor was sufficient to reverse the increased ISG expression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), indicating that the activation of this kinase in XLPDR cells is necessary for the activation of IRF and its downstream gene targets.

        <p id="P18">To explain the constitutive activation of the IRF pathway in XLPDR, we examined whether increased amounts of cytosolic nucleic acids could be a possible trigger. To this end, we used antibodies with defined reactivities against specific nucleic acids to immunoprecipitate these molecules from cytosolic fractions and stained the recovered material with PicoGreen<sup>Â®</sup>, a double-stranded nucleic acid dye (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Cytosolic dsDNA was mildly decreased in XLPDR fibroblasts, whereas cytosolic RNA:DNA was almost undetectable (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).

To test this notion, we first examined the subcellular localization of POLA1 and found that a substantial proportion of POLA1 localized to the cytosol, as determined by both immmunofluoresce staining and biochemical fractionation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Moreover, cytosolic POLA1 colocalized with RNA:DNA with a speckled pattern (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Indeed, cytosolic POLA1 (and not other DNA binding proteins tested) co-immunoprecipitated with nucleic acids, as determined by PicoGreen<sup>Â®</sup> staining of beads (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). This material was sensitive to both DNase and RNase treatment (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), and after elution from POLA1, could in part be re-immunoprecipitated by the RNA:DNA antibody (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). The eluted nucleic acids could be resolved by on-chip capillary electrophoresis or by agarose gel electrophoresis and consisted predominantly of 40â100 bp fragments (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d,e</xref>).

We made synthetic RNA:DNA duplexes consisting of 30 bp of DNA annealed to an RNA:DNA strand (consisting of 10 RNA and 20 DNA bp), meant to mimic the RNA:DNA primer that is synthesized by the PolÎ±-Primase complex during DNA replication. Transfection of this material indicated that RNA:DNA duplexes of this type can suppress the abnormal activation of IRF target genes observed as a result of <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref>). Thus, endogenous and synthetic RNA:DNA hybrids can directly rescue the effects of POLA1 deficiency â at least with respect to select ISG expression.</p>

        <p id="P23">Finally, we examined whether the effects of cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids can be mapped to a specific nucleic acid sensor pathway upstream of TBK1. To test this question, we used primary mouse embryo fibroblasts with defects in key genes involved in nucleic acid sensing: <italic>Myd88<sup>â/â</sup>Ticam1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> (Myd88 x TRIF double knockout), <italic>Tmem173<sup>â/â</sup></italic> (Sting knockout), <italic>Cgas<sup>â/â</sup></italic> (also known as <italic>Mb21d1</italic> and encoding cGAS), and <italic>Mavs<sup>â/â</sup></italic>.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P24">This study demonstrates that XLPDR is caused by a recurrent intronic mutation resulting in missplicing and reduced <italic>POLA1</italic> expression. This mutation previously escaped detection because it lies deep within an intron, highlighting the utility of WGS for elucidating the genetic basis of rare diseases. That a unique <italic>POLA1</italic> mutation causes XLPDR is intriguing. The recurrent nature of the mutation might indicate that this genomic position is a mutational hotspot. When considering this possibility, it is important to note that this mutation might result in tissue-specific effects on missplicing and variable effects on <italic>POLA1</italic> expression. If this is the case, other mutations causing ubiquitous <italic>POLA1</italic> deficiency likely result in phenotypes such as AGS, a possibility that will require future investigation. Therefore, it is possible that phenotypic ascertainment and not mutational frequency might be responsible for the fact that we found only one mutation associated with XLPDR. The notion that the XLPDR mutation results in a gain-of-function effect cannot be completely excluded, but seems quite unlikely since we did not detect any aberrant protein but instead observed perfectly concordant cellular phenotypes of the XLPDR mutation and POLA1 siRNA silencing.</p>
      <p id="P25">This study also provides a detailed characterization of this syndrome, including a careful evaluation of the immune phenotypes in these patients. As shown here, XLPDR has the molecular signature of an interferonopathy and is associated with suppressed IL-17A and IFN-Î³, changes that are probably linked to the history of autoinflammation and recurrent infections. Interestingly, suppression of IL-17A has been previously linked to IRF activation<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. While these molecular features are similar to those of AGS, most of the clinical features of XLPDR are quite distinct, including the paucity of neurologic involvement which is central to the presentation of most AGS cases. In addition, the development of hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, and facial features in XLPDR remain unexplained from a mechanistic standpoint. We anticipate that as additional cases are identified, new insights into the pathogenesis of this disorder will be gained. The role that POLA1 plays in cytosolic RNA:DNA synthesis was completely unexpected, based on our current knowledge of the PolÎ±-Primase complex. We predict that this complex mediates the same biochemical steps in cytosolic nucleic acid biosynthesis as have been previously defined during DNA replication; as such, template DNA is the likely substrate for cytosolic RNA:DNA synthesis and the source for this DNA will need to be ascertained. This nonreplicative function for <italic>POLA1</italic> is in agreement with its abundant cytosolic localization in many cell types and its persistent expression in post-mitotic cells<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P26">Similarly, the finding that cytosolic RNA:DNA plays a role in preventing spontaneous activation of the IRF pathway was also quite unexpected. These data stand in contrast with prior reports that synthetic RNA:DNA duplexes can have stimulatory effects. It is therefore important to note key differences in our approach compared to prior studies<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. First, to our knowledge, this is the first study to test the effect of native RNA:DNA extracted directly from the cytosol. This material captures the heterogeneity of chemistry and nucleotide length that is likely present <italic>in vivo</italic>, including possible hybrid duplexes (DNA annealed to RNA), or hybrid strands (ribonucleotides and deoxinucleotides linked together), or a combination of these. Thus, this experiment avoids the use of RNA:DNA chemistries of unclear physiologic relevance such as long synthetic palindromic RNA:DNA duplexes (&gt; 1kb), which according to our analysis do not represent the predominant composition of cytosolic RNA:DNA. In addition, for studies with synthetic nucleotides, we used RNA:DNA consisting of a short duplex DNA strand annealed to a hybrid RNA:DNA strand, meant to recapitulate the product synthesized by PolÎ±-Primase during DNA replication. In aggregate, our results suggest a mechanistic model where RNA:DNA hybrids synthesized by cytosolic POLA1 act to squelch the responses generated by stimulatory nucleic acids. One possible mechanism might be that cytosolic RNA:DNA could bind to nucleic acid sensors without triggering their activation, competing with their cognate ligands, and thus setting a higher threshold for signal generation. Based on the genetic evidence presented here, cytosolic RNA:DNA may in fact modulate multiple sensors. Finally, the fact that partial reduction of POLA1 expression alters immune regulation without blocking DNA replication suggests that DNA polymerase-Î± may provide a new target for therapeutic modulation of innate immunity.</p>

A cytosolic fraction extracted from 15â20Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells were precleared with 10 Î¼l of Protein-G agarose slurry for 30 minutes at 4Â°C, and incubated overnight with 10 Î¼g of RNA:DNA antibody (clone S9.6, Kerafast, ENH001), anti-POLA1 antibody (polyclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-5921) or non-specific IgG as control, together with 20 Î¼L of Protein-G agarose slurry. Following 3 washing steps with Triton X-100 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), beads were incubated with 50 Î¼L of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with 2% SDS for 10 minutes at 75Â°C. SDS concentration was diluted down by adding 450 Î¼l of hot water, and heated 10 minutes at 75Â°C. Samples were slowly cooled down to room temperature. The supernatants were collected and eluted nucleic acids were precipitated using a standard phenol/ethanol precipitation procedure. The pellet was reconstituted in 50 Î¼L of TE and analyzed by on chip capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 21000 Bioanalyzer) or by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA:DNA was stored at â20Â°C, and transfected into the cells (1Î¼g/mL, 16 hours) using LyoVec (Invivogen) as the transfection reagent following the original protocol. Alternatively, we also utilized synthetic RNA:DNA duplexes which consisted of an <underline>RNA</underline>:DNA forward chimeric primer: 5â-r[<underline>CGGCGGGCAG</underline>]d[CCTGGATGGG AATTCCCATCCAGGGAT] - 3â, and complemented with a DNA primer: 5â-d[ATCCCTGGAT GGGAATTCCCATCCAGGCTGCCCGCCG]-3â (Sigma).</p>
