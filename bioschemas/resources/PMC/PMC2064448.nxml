        <p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) modulates a plethora of cytoskeletal interactions that control the dynamics of actin assembly and, ultimately, cell migration. We show that the type IÎ³ phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase 661 (PIPKIÎ³661), an enzyme that generates PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>, is required for growth factor but not G proteinâcoupled receptorâstimulated directional migration. By generating PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> and regulating talin assembly, PIPKIÎ³661 modulates nascent adhesion formation at the leading edge to facilitate cell migration. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor directly phosphorylates PIPKIÎ³661 at tyrosine 634, and this event is required for EGF-induced migration. This phosphorylation regulates the interaction between PIPKIÎ³661 and phospholipase CÎ³1 (PLCÎ³1, an enzyme previously shown to be involved in the regulation of EGF-stimulated migration). Our results suggest that phosphorylation events regulating specific PIPKIÎ³661 interactions are required for growth factorâinduced migration. These interactions in turn define the spatial and temporal generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> and derived messengers required for directional migration.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) has been implicated in many biological processes, including vesicular trafficking (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Downes et al., 2005</xref>), secretion (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2001</xref>), focal adhesion and cytoskeleton assembly (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>), regulation of ion channels (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Delmas et al., 2005</xref>), and nuclear signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gonzales and Anderson, 2006</xref>). PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> has a role not only as a substrate of PLC and phosphoinositol 3-kinaseâmediated second messenger production, but also as a direct effector that binds to and regulates the function of many PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-interacting proteins (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Marchesi, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Heck et al., 2007</xref>). The generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> in cells primarily occurs through the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol(4) phosphate (PI[4]P) by type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKI; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Doughman et al., 2003a</xref>). Three isoforms of PIPKI (IÎ±, IÎ², and IÎ³) have been characterized along with several splice variants. By associating with their unique binding partners, different PIPKI isoforms produce PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> with distinct subcellular distributions, from which they perform individual biological functions (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Coppolino et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Doughman et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Heck et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Cell migration requires the coordination of many biochemical events, including organized adhesion formation and turnover as well as dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz and Parsons, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> binds to and regulates many proteins that are crucial for the assembly of the migratory machinery. For example, PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by associating with Î±-actinin, WASP/N-WASP, gelsolin, cofilin, profilin, and villin (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Niggli, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>). PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> has also been proposed to regulate adhesions by binding to and modulating talin, vinculin, ezrin/radixin/moesin, calpain, and other proteins involved in adhesion dynamics (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Niggli, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>). PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> is therefore positioned to play key roles in migration by modulating adhesion dynamics and cytoskeleton rearrangement.</p>
      <p>Many observations indicate that PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> is a key signaling molecule in the regulation of cell migration, yet the role of specific PIP kinases in the regulation of cell migration remains to be clarified. PIPKIÎ³ is alternatively spliced in cells, resulting in at least two major variants, PIPKIÎ³635 and PIPKIÎ³661, which differ by a 26-amino-acid C-terminal extension (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1998</xref>). Most interesting, the 26-amino-acid C-terminal extension binds to talin and targets PIPKIÎ³661, but not PIPKIÎ³635, to adhesions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>). This specific targeting of PIPKIÎ³661 allows for the generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> at adhesions, which is known to enhance the association between integrin and talin (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The binding of talin to Î²-integrin enhances the affinity of integrin for its ligands and activates the integrin heterodimer (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). As a result, PIPKIÎ³661 may manipulate the inside-out activation of integrin signaling and the adhesion formation through its association with talin. Other than facilitating the assembly of talin into adhesions, PIPKIÎ³661 may also influence the recruitment and activation of other adhesion components through the local generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. These combined data indicate that PIPKIÎ³661 may play key roles in regulating adhesion dynamics that are critical for cell migration.</p>
      <p>Unlike PI3,4,5P<sub>3</sub>, total levels of cellular PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> are relatively high and undergo only modest changes upon stimulation of cell migration (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation is tightly controlled, both spatially and temporally, to fulfill the requirements of rapid adhesion turnover and cytoskeleton rearrangement that are critical to the process of cell migration. Here, we demonstrate that PIPKIÎ³661 is required specifically for growth factorâstimulated directional migration, supporting a role for PIPKIÎ³661 in generation of the PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> required for cell migration toward an EGF concentration gradient.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of PIPKIÎ³661 attenuates EGF but not lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)â or stromal cellâderived factor (SDF) 1Î±âstimulated migration</title>
        <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that PIPKIÎ³661 is targeted very specifically to adhesions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 2004</xref>). The localized generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> at adhesions has been proposed to have roles in both integrin activation and adhesion formation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>), and these events are key for cell migration. To explore the possible role of PIPKIÎ³661 in cell migration, siRNA specifically targeting PIPKIÎ³668 (human homologue of mouse PIPKIÎ³661) was designed. As shown in Fig. S1 A (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1</ext-link>), PIPKIÎ³668-specific siRNA could specifically knock down expression of PIPKIÎ³668 but had no effect on the expression of PIPKIÎ³640 (human homologue of PIPKIÎ³635).</p>
        <p>The effect of PIPKIÎ³ knockdown on EGF-stimulated cell migration was quantified using a modified Boyden chamber transwell assay (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Neptune and Bourne, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, the knockdown of global PIPKIÎ³ by pan-PIPKIÎ³ siRNA blocked EGF-stimulated migration of HeLa cells. To determine if this effect is specifically due to the knockdown of the PIPKIÎ³661 splice variant, PIPKIÎ³668-specific siRNA was used in the same assay. Specific PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown had the same effect as global PIPKIÎ³ knockdown on attenuation of EGF-stimulated migration of HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The efficacy of these two siRNAs on PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; the expression of PIPKIÎ³668 in HeLa cells was efficiently knocked down by both of these two siRNAs without affecting the expression level of other proteins, such as talin, FAK, and actin. To distinguish the role of PIPKIÎ³668 in directed migration or random migration, a checkerboard assay was used. As shown in Fig. S1 B, knockdown of PIPKIÎ³668 attenuated EGF-induced directional migration but not random migration. These results provide the first evidence that PIPKIÎ³661 plays a role in directional migration. Equivalent results were observed using MtLn3 and A431 cell lines (unpublished data), confirming the observation that PIPKIÎ³661 is required for EGF-stimulated cell migration in these cells as well.</p>

        <p>To determine if the function of PIPKIÎ³661 in regulating migration is specific for EGF, the effect of PIPKIÎ³661 knockdown on migration induced by other chemoattractants, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), LPA, and SDF1Î±, was investigated. HGF-induced cell migration was blocked by PIPKIÎ³661 knockdown (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). This result further confirmed the role of PIPKIÎ³661 in growth factorâinduced migration. Remarkably, the results from these migration assays showed that the knockdown of PIPKIÎ³661 did not affect LPA- or SDF1Î±-stimulated cell migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1</ext-link>). SDF1Î± is the ligand of CXCR4 chemokine receptor. Both CXCR4 and LPA receptor belong to the G proteinâcoupled receptor family. These data indicate that PIPKIÎ³661 plays a specific role in growth factor receptorâstimulated cell migration.</p>

        <p>In addition, the effect of PIPKIÎ± knockdown on EGF-stimulated migration was also investigated. siRNAs specifically targeting PIPKIÎ± were used to knock down the expression of PIPKIÎ± in HeLa cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, â¼85% of endogenous PIPKIÎ± was knocked down by PIPKIÎ±-specific siRNA in HeLa cells. However, the knockdown of PIPKIÎ± did not affect EGF-stimulated migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), demonstrating specificity for the PIPKIÎ³661 isoform.</p>

        <title>EGF-stimulated cell migration requires PIPKIÎ³661 kinase activity and its talin binding ability</title>
        <p>To further investigate the mechanism of how PIPKIÎ³661 regulates EGF-stimulated cell migration, HeLa stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant mouse PIPKIÎ³661 using a tet-off expression approach were established with the goal of rescuing endogenous PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown phenotype through the expression of specific mouse PIPKIÎ³661 mutants. siRNA specific for PIPKIÎ³668 was used to knock down PIPKIÎ³668 in these HeLa cell lines, and the rescuing effects of wild-type and mutant mouse PIPKIÎ³661 expression on EGF-stimulated cell migration were quantified.</p>
        <p>To determine if PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> generation was required for PIPKIÎ³661 control of EGF-stimulated migration, the kinase-dead PIPKIÎ³661 (PIPKIÎ³KD)âexpressing cell line was used in the rescue experiment. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, expression of PIPKIÎ³KD could not rescue EGF-stimulated cell migration in PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown cells. However, the expression of the wild-type mouse PIPKIÎ³661 fully rescued EGF-stimulated cell migration. These findings demonstrate that the ability of PIPKIÎ³661 to produce PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> is required. PIPKIÎ³661 binds to talin, and binding is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation on Y644 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Talin is a key protein in regulating adhesion turnover (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cram and Schwarzbauer, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Nayal et al., 2004</xref>). To determine if talin binding is necessary for PIPKIÎ³661 to mediate EGF-stimulated migration, the Y644 to phenylalanine mutant of PIPKIÎ³661 (PIPKIÎ³Y644F) was assayed to rescue the endogenous knockdown. PIPKIÎ³Y644F has in vivo defects in the association with talin (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the mutant could not rescue the effect of PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown on EGF-stimulated cell migration. Furthermore, expression of PIPKIÎ³635, the short splice variant of PIPKIÎ³, which does not bind talin, was also unable to rescue the effect of PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown on EGF-stimulated migration.</p>
        <p>The same region of PIPKIÎ³661 that interacts with talin also associates with the Î¼ subunits of the adaptor protein (AP) 1B and AP2 complexes. Both PIPKIÎ³Y644F and PIPKIÎ³635 also have in vivo defects in the association with Î¼ subunits (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). To exclude the possibility that PIPKIÎ³661 effects on EGF-induced migration is due to its binding with Î¼ subunits of the AP1B and AP2 complexes but not with talin, an S645 to phenylalanine mutant of PIPKIÎ³661 (PIPKIÎ³S645F) was used. PIPKIÎ³S645F has in vivo defects in the association with talin but maintains the ability to associate with Î¼ subunits of the AP1B and AP2 complexes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the mutant could not rescue the effect of PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown on EGF-stimulated cell migration. It is important to note that the PIPKIÎ³Y644F also loses the ability to associate with the AP1B and AP2 complexes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that PIP kinase activity, talin binding, and possibly AP complex binding, are required for PIPKIÎ³661 regulation of EGF-stimulated migration.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³661 is necessary for EGF-induced talin assembly into adhesions</title>
        <p>Because talin binding is required for PIPKIÎ³661 effects on EGF- induced migration, regulating talin assembly into adhesions is a likely mechanism by which PIPKIÎ³661 regulates EGF-induced migration. To determine if talin assembly into adhesions is altered in PIPKIÎ³661-deficient cells, the impact of PIPKIÎ³661 knockdown on EGF-induced talin assembly of adhesions was assessed. A vector-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down PIPKIÎ³668 expression in HeLa cells. This vector also expresses a red fluorescent protein, DsRed, alongside the expression of the PIPKIÎ³668-specific shRNA. In this way, the PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown cells can be identified as the red fluorescence positive cells. Transfection of this vector-based shRNA into HeLa cells resulted in efficient knockdown of PIPKIÎ³668 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, in the absence of EGF, there are relatively few talin-containing adhesions found in either the control shRNAâtransfected HeLa cells or in the PIPKIÎ³668 shRNAâtransfected HeLa cells. Stimulation with EGF leads to talin recruitment to adhesions in DsRed-negative or control shRNAâexpressing HeLa cells. However, in the PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown HeLa cells, the EGF-induced talin recruitment to adhesions was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). This result indicates that PIPKIÎ³668 is required for EGF-induced talin assembly into adhesions. Furthermore, in the PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown HeLa cells, the EGF-induced vinculin recruitment to adhesions was also decreased (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1</ext-link>). This result further confirmed that PIPKIÎ³668 is required for EGF-induced adhesion formation.</p>

        <title>PIPKIÎ³661 is required for EGF-induced talin assembly into nascent adhesions at the leading edge</title>
        <p>At the onset of cell migration, cells extend protrusions of the plasma membrane at their leading edge and then assemble nascent adhesions serving as points of traction and help to establish cell polarity (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Smilenov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). As PIPKIÎ³661 is required for EGF-induced talin assembly into adhesions, it is possible that PIPKIÎ³661 is required for EGF-induced talin recruitment to the leading edge and to regulate adhesion assembly.</p>
        <p>To determine if PIPKIÎ³661 is required for the polarized recruitment of talin to the leading edge in a gradient of chemoattractant, a micropipette-stimulation assay (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mouneimne et al., 2006</xref>) that can selectively stimulate cells with locally released EGF was used. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>, a micropipette filled with EGF was placed near cells, and constant pressure was added to the micropipette to create a concentration gradient of EGF. Vector-based shRNA was used to knock down the expression of PIPKIÎ³668, and knockdown cells were visualized with DsRed. To assess talin turnover at the leading edge in real time, a GFP-talin construct (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Franco et al., 2004</xref>) was transfected into HeLa cells to detect its dynamic assembly at adhesions. GFP-talin assembly rate was quantified in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>. Rate constants for talin assembly of individual adhesions were calculated as described in Materials and methods. GFP-talin assembly into adhesions at the leading edge at different time points of micropipette stimulation is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>. In the cells expressing control shRNA, local stimulation with EGF by the pipette led to rapid recruitment of GFP-talin to the leading edge and assembly into nascent adhesions. In the cells expressing PIPKIÎ³668 shRNA, however, GFP-talin recruitment to nascent adhesions was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>; and Videos 1 and 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1</ext-link>). These findings indicate that EGF induces new adhesions in the direction of the growth factor concentration gradient, and this requires PIPKIÎ³661.</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 at Y634 is required for EGF-induced talin assembly and migration</title>
        <p>The function of PIPKIÎ³661 is regulated by its tyrosine phosphorylation. Src-mediated phosphorylation of Y644 increases the PIPKIÎ³661-talin binding affinity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>) and blocks the PIPKIÎ³661 interaction with AP complexes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>). To determine if EGF can stimulate PIPKIÎ³661 tyrosine phosphorylation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 was quantified. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, EGF stimulation noticeably increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661. To determine if this effect is specifically due to the activation of EGF receptor (EGFR), cells were preincubated with EGFR-specific inhibitor PD153035, and this blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661. Interestingly, when Y644 of PIPKIÎ³661, the known Src phosphorylation site, was mutated to phenylalanine (PIPKIÎ³Y644F), the EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>), suggesting that Y644 is not required for EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 in vivo. To identify the key tyrosine residues for the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, a series of tyrosine residues were mutated, and the Y634 to phenylalanine mutant of PIPKIÎ³661 (PIPKIÎ³Y634F) was found to ablate EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Y634 is the key tyrosine residue for EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.</p>

        <p>EGFR is a tyrosine kinase, and ligand binding to the extracellular portion of the EGFR leads to autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic region, which stimulate the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Carpenter and Cohen, 1990</xref>). To determine if EGFR could directly phosphorylate PIPKIÎ³661, an in vitro EGFR kinase assay was used. The reconstructed wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 C terminus or the mutant PIPKIÎ³Y634F C terminus was purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and subjected to in vitro EGFR kinase assay as substrates of purified EGFR. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (E and F), wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 C terminus can be phosphorylated directly by purified EGFR. In this assay, mutant PIPKIÎ³Y634F C terminus lost EGFR-induced phosphorylation compared with wild-type PIPKIÎ³661. Interestingly, in the Y644 to F mutant of PIPKIÎ³661 (PIPKIÎ³Y644F), EGFR-induced phosphorylation was also reduced compared with wild-type PIPKIÎ³661. Mutation of both Y634 and Y644 in PIPKIÎ³661 to phenylalanine resulted in a loss of the EGFR-induced phosphorylation compared with the wild type. In vivo<italic>,</italic> the mutation of Y634, but not Y644, resulted in the loss of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661. These data demonstrate that EGFR phosphorylates Y634 in vivo and in vitro and are also consistent with results showing that Y644 is preferentially phosphorylated by Src (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>The results demonstrate that Y634 of PIPKIÎ³661 is phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation. To determine if Y634 phosphorylation is required for PIPKIÎ³661 effects on EGF-induced migration, the PIPKIÎ³Y634F-expressing stable HeLa cell line was used in a cell migration assay to demonstrate its effect on EGF-induced migration. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, the expression of PIPKIÎ³Y634F could not rescue the effect of PIPKIÎ³668 knockdown on EGF-induced directional migration.

        <p>As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (B and D), PIPKIÎ³Y634F still retains the ability to bind talin. Quantification of PIP kinase activity demonstrated that PIPKIÎ³Y634F retains kinase activity on a level that is comparable to wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 (unpublished data). It is interesting to determine if Y634 phosphorylation is required for EGF-induced talin assembly to facilitate migration. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, both wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 and talin are recruited to adhesions after EGF stimulation. However, in comparison, PIPKIÎ³Y634F was less efficiently recruited to adhesions by EGF stimulation. Also, talin recruitment to adhesions was decreased in these same cells. The expression of PIPKIÎ³KD (kinase dead) also decreased talin recruitment to adhesions after EGF stimulation, similar to the PIPKIÎ³Y634F mutant. These data demonstrate that both Y634 phosphorylation and the kinase activity of the PIPKIÎ³661 are required for efficient talin assembly into adhesions induced by EGF stimulation. In addition, PIPKIÎ³S645F, the mutant that has in vivo defects in association with talin and does not rescue directional migration, also was not recruited to adhesions after EGF stimulation. Correspondingly, cells expressing PIPKIÎ³S645F showed decreased talin recruitment to adhesions after EGF stimulation compared with cells expressing wild-type PIPKIÎ³661. This result indicates that the collaboration of PIPKIÎ³661 and talin is required for their recruitment to adhesions induced by EGF. Furthermore, Y634 phosphorylation and the kinase activity of the PIPKIÎ³661 are also required for efficient vinculin assembly into adhesions induced by EGF stimulation (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200701078/DC1</ext-link>).

        <title>Phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 at Y634 regulates the association of PLCÎ³1 with PIPKIÎ³661</title>
        <p>Although phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 at Y634 does not alter the ability of PIPKIÎ³661 to bind talin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and D</xref>), Y634 phosphorylation may affect the association of PIPKIÎ³661 with other proteins involved in regulating migration. To explore this possibility, the binding ability of wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 and PIPKIÎ³Y634F with PIPKIÎ³-associating proteins other than talin was compared. AP1B and AP2 complexes bind to PIPKIÎ³661 with the same sequence that binds talin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>). When PIPKIÎ³Y634F was assayed for binding to AP1B and AP2 complexes, this mutant associated with both AP complexes in a manner that was indistinguishable from the wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we have shown that PLCÎ³1, an enzyme also required for EGF-stimulated directional migration (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Piccolo et al., 2002</xref>), associates with the PIPKIÎ³661 complex. Further, PLCÎ³1 was found to be differentially associated with wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 and PIPKIÎ³Y634F. As shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>, PLCÎ³1 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PIPKIÎ³ and is the first evidence that PLCÎ³1 could associate with the PIPKIÎ³661 complex. Both wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 and PIPKIÎ³Y634F associate with PLCÎ³1, whereas PIPKIÎ³Y634F had a stronger interaction with PLCÎ³1 than did wild-type PIPKIÎ³661 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Intriguingly, association of PIPKIÎ³661 with PLCÎ³1 was lost after EGF stimulation, whereas the PLCÎ³1 association with PIPKIÎ³Y634F could not be efficiently disrupted by EGF treatment (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, C and D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Directional cell migration is critical to many biological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, the inflammatory response, atherosclerosis, tissue repair and regeneration, and cancer metastasis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> modulates many key components of the cell migration machinery and is proposed to be synthesized in a highly spatial and temporal fashion to regulate this process (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Doughman et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Santarius et al., 2006</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism for the restricted generation of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> that regulates migration is poorly understood. PIPKIÎ³ was proposed to be the major enzyme responsible for PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> synthesis at synapses (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>), and much of the work on the biological functions of PIPKIÎ³ since then have been focused on this system. Recently, compelling observations revealing the critical biological roles of PIPKIÎ³ in nonneuronal systems have emerged. PIPKIÎ³635 has been reported to have important functions in G proteinâcoupled receptorâmediated IP<sub>3</sub> generation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). More interesting, PIPKIÎ³661 is implicated in focal adhesion assembly (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2002</xref>), AP2-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>), and the endocytosis and basolateral sorting of E-cadherin (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). Our current findings demonstrate that PIPKIÎ³661 is required for EGF-stimulated directional migration.</p>
      <p>The role of PIPKIÎ³661 in regulating EGF-stimulated directional migration is unique, as neither PIPKIÎ³635 nor PIPKIÎ± can compensate for the loss of PIPKIÎ³661. In coordination with Rac signaling, PIPKIÎ± plays roles in dorsal membrane ruffling stimulated by PDGF (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Doughman et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kisseleva et al., 2005</xref>), and PIPKIÎ± interacts with the LIM domain protein Ajuba and appears to coordinate the targeting to membrane ruffles (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kisseleva et al., 2005</xref>). Membrane ruffles are often found on the cell surface and at the advancing front of a lamellipodium and serve as sites of actin polymerization (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cheresh et al., 1999</xref>). Although membrane ruffling is thought to be important for migration, it is not necessary for migration of all cells. For example, Rac1-deficient macrophages exhibit defects in membrane ruffling but show normal directional migration (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wells et al., 2004</xref>). Investigation in epidermal keratinocytes demonstrated that high membrane ruffling rates correlated with low lamellipodia persistence and inefficient migration (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Borm et al., 2005</xref>). PIPKIÎ±-induced membrane ruffling may be required for certain types of migration but may not be essential for the EGF-stimulated migration of epithelial cells like HeLa, MtLn3, and A431.</p>
      <p>Cell migration is an integrated process that requires the continuous, coordinated formation and disassembly of adhesions (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Smilenov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). Our results demonstrate that PIPKIÎ³661 is required for talin assembly into nascent adhesions forming at the leading edge toward the direction of the growth factor concentration gradient. This supports the hypothesis that PIPKIÎ³661 regulates growth factorâmediated migration ultimately through modulation of adhesion dynamics. These data indicate that PIPKIÎ³661 works as an effector of growth factor signaling to provide a link to the corresponding intracellular adhesion dynamics required for migration. Talin plays key roles in adhesion turnover and cell migration by providing a link between integrin and the cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Priddle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Critchley, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cram and Schwarzbauer, 2004</xref>). Reduction of talin expression leads to defects in normal cell migration in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cram et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the critical roles in cell migration, how talin is recruited to and regulated at adhesions is poorly understood. The results presented here support a role for PIPKIÎ³661 in talin recruitment and regulation downstream of EGF-induced directional migration.</p>
      <p>Y634 phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 is required for talin recruitment in response to EGF. It is interesting that the phosphorylation of Y634 does not obviously affect the kinase activity of PIPKIÎ³661 or its talin binding affinity. The phosphorylation of Y634 regulates the interaction between PIPKIÎ³661 and PLCÎ³. Therefore, current results provide a possible model of how Y634 phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 is involved in EGF-induced migration (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). By associating with PIPKIÎ³661, PLCÎ³1 could hydrolyze the PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> produced by PIPKIÎ³661; the hydrolysis would diminish the PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> required to regulate talin assembly to adhesions. EGF-induced phosphorylation of PIPKIÎ³661 at Y634 causes a disassembly of the PLCÎ³1âPIPKIÎ³661 complex, and this could enhance PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> accumulation and thus enhance talin assembly into adhesions.</p>

By modulating talin assembly, PIPKIÎ³661 regulates adhesion formation at the leading edge and facilitates EGF-induced migration.</p>

      <p>It is established that PLCÎ³1 regulates EGF-induced migration (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Piccolo et al., 2002</xref>). Activation of PLCÎ³ is required for protrusion formation at the leading edge. PLCÎ³1 cleaves PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> and releases actin binding proteins gelsolin and cofilin to initiate protrusion and define the direction of cell migration (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mouneimne et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, PLCÎ³1 also modulates the polarized localization of m-calpain and regulates the adhesion detachment (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2006</xref>). In this context, PIPKIÎ³661 and PLCÎ³ likely work together to regulate local PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> level at the leading edge to facilitate the protrusion formation and stabilization of adhesions. As the involvement of PIPKIÎ³661 seems specific for growth factor stimulation and not LPA and SDF1Î± stimulation, it is likely that G proteinâcoupled receptors use distinct downstream elements to modulate the formation of protrusions. Together, this unexpectedly indicates that PIPKIÎ³661 is a unique and key signaling component specific for growth factorâinduced directional cell migration.</p>
      <p>Tyrosine 644 is another residue site on PIPKIÎ³661 that is phosphorylated by Src. This phosphorylation enhances the PIPKIÎ³661-talin binding affinity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2003</xref>). Src can be activated by EGFR via a Ral-GTPaseâdependent mechanism (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Goi et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that EGF treatment could also lead to PIPKIÎ³661 phosphorylation at Y644 by activating Src. Although our results show that EGF stimulation under these conditions did not lead to obvious change of cellular PIPKIÎ³661-talin binding affinity, EGF stimulation may modulate PIPKIÎ³661-talin association at specific sites, such as adhesions via Src-mediated phosphorylation of Y644. EGF stimulation may lead to an ordered set of phosphorylation events that regulate PIPKIÎ³661 interactions with its partners, such as PLCÎ³1 and talin, and, via this mechanism, regulate directional migration.</p>
      <p>By regulating adhesion dynamics at the leading edge, PIPKIÎ³661 may play a role in the regulation of cell protrusion toward the direction of stimulation. Cell adhesion and protrusion are highly interrelated during migration. Protrusion results primarily from actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells. Nascent adhesions forming at leading edge could stabilize the new protrusion and help establish cell polarity during migration. Talin binds actin and provides a molecular linkage between adhesion and actin that inhibits retrograde flow and thus regulates the rate of protrusion by counterbalancing the forward movement of actin polymerization (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Horwitz, 2006</xref>). It is plausible that PIPKIÎ³661 participates in stabilization of protrusions by enhancing the recruitment of talin to the leading edge; via this mechanism, PIPKIÎ³661 would determine the direction of migration.</p>
      <p>The same region of PIPKIÎ³661 that interacts with talin also associates with the Î¼ subunit of the AP1B and AP2 complexes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bairstow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, membrane trafficking also regulates the directional migration of cells (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bershadsky and Futerman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tayeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rosse et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our results are equally consistent with a role for the PIPKIÎ³661 in membrane trafficking in controlling EGF-stimulated directional migration. Endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a key role in growth factorâstimulated chemotaxis (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jekely et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Le Roy and Wrana, 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, endocytic trafficking is required for directional migration stimulated by EGF and EGFR homologues in vivo (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jekely et al., 2005</xref>). We have explored the possibility that PIPKIÎ³661 modulates EGFR endocytosis. Knockdown of PIPKIÎ³661 or expression of the PIPKIÎ³661 kinase-dead mutants did not effect EGFR internalization upon agonist binding (unpublished data). Nevertheless, this result does not eliminate a potential role for PIPKIÎ³661 in modulation of membrane trafficking within the EGF-stimulated migration pathway. There are other trafficking events that may be crucial for PIPKIÎ³661 to regulate EGF-stimulated migration, such as trafficking of integrins (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>PIPKIÎ³661 also regulates the ability of epithelial cells to assemble E-cadherin based cellâcell contacts (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ling et al., 2007</xref>), and here we show that it also regulates the ability of cells to migrate toward an EGF gradient. Therefore, PIPKIÎ³661 has been implicated to be required for two key physiological processes: cellâcell adhesion and directional cell migration. This is very significant, as these two processes are fundamental in early stages of the metastasis of cancers of epithelial origin. In breast cancer metastasis, the sequential loss of E-cadherin and cellâcell contacts allows tumor cells to migrate (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). The migration toward blood vessels is stimulated in some cases by a gradient of EGF, and this facilitates a key step called intravasation, where the tumor cells migrate through the vessel wall to be transported throughout the body (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2006</xref>). Further exploration of the underlying signals and mechanisms that regulate PIPKIÎ³661 will be crucial to understanding the complete role of this enzyme in cell migration and tumor metastasis.</p>

Fluorescence intensities of individual adhesions from background-subtracted images were measured over time using MetaMorph Imaging software. For rate constant measurements, periods of assembly (increasing fluorescence intensity) of adhesions containing GFP-talin were plotted on separate semilogarithmic graphs representing fluorescence intensity ratios over time. Semilogarithmic plots of fluorescence intensities as a function of time were generated using the following formula: Ln([I]/[I0]) for assembly, where I0 is the initial fluorescence intensity and I is the fluorescence intensity at various time points. The slopes of linear regression trend lines fitted to the semilogarithmic plots were then calculated to determine apparent rate constants of assembly. For each rate constant, measurements were made on at least 10 individual adhesions of the cell, for a total of &gt;50 adhesions in six separate cells. All measurements shown are the mean Â± SEM.
