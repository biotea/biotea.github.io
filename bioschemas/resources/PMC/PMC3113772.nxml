        <p>Using two different TRAPP subunits as bait, we have identified four additional components of this human vesicleâtethering complex. Functional studies suggest that TRAPP functions early in ER-to-Golgi traffic, at or before the level of the ERGIC compartment.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>TRAPP is a multisubunit tethering complex implicated in multiple vesicle trafficking steps in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and conserved throughout eukarya, including humans. Here we confirm the role of TRAPPC2L as a stable component of mammalian TRAPP and report the identification of four novel components of the complex: C4orf41, TTC-15, KIAA1012, and Bet3L. Two of the components, KIAA1012 and Bet3L, are mammalian homologues of Trs85p and Bet3p, respectively. The remaining two novel TRAPP components, C4orf41 and TTC-15, have no homologues in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. With this work, human homologues of all the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TRAPP proteins, with the exception of the <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>-specific subunit Trs65p, have now been reported. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that the novel proteins are bona fide components of human TRAPP and implicate C4orf41 and TTC-15 (which we call TRAPPC11 and TRAPPC12, respectively) in ER-to-Golgi trafficking at a very early stage. We further present a binary interaction map for all known mammalian TRAPP components and evidence that TRAPP oligomerizes. Our data are consistent with the absence of a TRAPP Iâequivalent complex in mammalian cells, suggesting that the fundamental unit of mammalian TRAPP is distinct from that characterized in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic intracellular vesicle trafficking requires a suite of molecular activities to ensure appropriate targeting of the vesicle and its contents. These activities include sorting, budding, movement, tethering, and fusion of the vesicle, with each step adding a layer of specificity to the trafficking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bonifacino and Glick, 2004</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TRAPP is a multisubunit tethering complex, with two distinct forms called TRAPP I and TRAPP II, implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi and late Golgi trafficking, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Sacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although TRAPP is conserved in all eukaryotes, the function and composition of mammalian TRAPP are not well characterized. It is notable that mutation in the human orthologue of Trs20p, TRAPPC2/sedlin, is the causative lesion in X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Gedeon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Tiller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Shaw <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TRAPP I consists of Bet5p, Trs20p, Bet3p, Trs23p, Trs31p, and Trs33p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Sacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2001</xref>), with the mammalian orthologues named TRAPPC1, TRAPPC2, TRAPPC3, TRAPPC4, TRAPPC5, and TRAPPC6a/b, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Sacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for nomenclature used in this paper). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Trs85p associates with TRAPP I but has recently been proposed to form a distinct subcomplex with a role in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Nazarko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Meiling-Wesse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Lynch-Day <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). TRAPP II consists of the TRAPP I âcore,â with the additional subunits Trs65p, Trs120p, and Trs130p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Sacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).

In addition to its role as a COP IIâvesicle tethering factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Sacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), the complex acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ypt1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). These activities are dependent on the subunits Bet3p, Trs31p, Trs23p, and Bet5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Functions have yet to be definitively assigned to the remainder of the subunits, although it has been suggested that Trs120p and Trs130p switch the GEF activity from Ypt1p to Ypt31/32p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Morozova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Direct demonstration of mammalian TRAPP as a vesicle tether has yet to be shown, but it has recently been reported to stimulate nucleotide exchange on the Ypt1p-related protein Rab1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Yamasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We recently used a bioinformatic approach to identify a novel TRAPP-interacting protein, TRAPPC2L (for simplicity, mammalian subunits will henceforth be referred to without the âTRAPPâ prefix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Scrivens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The protein displays homology to yeast Trs20p and a previously uncharacterized open reading frame YEL048c/<italic>TCA17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Montpetit and Conibear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Scrivens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). C2L cofractionated with the mammalian TRAPP complex and its depletion with small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to an identical Golgi fragmentation phenotype to that seen upon C2 knockdown, supporting the hypothesis that C2L is a component of mammalian TRAPP. Here we have used tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged C2 and C2L coupled to mass spectrometry to demonstrate that both proteins are found in stable TRAPP complexes in mammalian cells. As well as the mammalian TRAPP I orthologues listed above, we find that C2 and C2L stably associate with a putative Trs85p orthologue, KIAA1012, which we here refer to as C8. Both also associate with the previously reported Trs120p and Trs130p orthologues, NIBP (C9) and TMEM1 (C10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cox <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In addition, here we report two novel TRAPP proteins, C4orf41/Gryzun (now designated TRAPPC11) and TTC-15 (now designated TRAPPC12) that, while being found throughout eukarya including diverse fungi, are absent in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Whereas Trs85p was recently implicated in autophagy in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we provide evidence that the mammalian Trs85p orthologue C8, as well as C11 and C12, are bona fide TRAPP components with roles in ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Specifically, we implicate C11 in membrane traffic between the ER and the ERGIC compartment. Using a combination of binary yeast two-hybrid analysis and biochemical studies, we provide evidence that TRAPP oligomerizes and present an initial model of the architecture of mammalian TRAPP. Our study suggests the absence of a TRAPP I subcomplex in mammalian cells and implies fundamental differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and mammals in how TRAPP regulates early secretory pathway trafficking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>TAP-tagged C2 and C2L identify new TRAPP interactors in human cells</title><p>The yeast orthologue of C2L, Tca17p, was shown to associate loosely with TRAPP and implied, based in part on yeast genetic interactions, to have a TRAPP IIâspecific function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Montpetit and Conibear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Scrivens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In an effort to discern a functional difference between C2 and C2L, we precipitated tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged C2 and C2L followed by SDSâPAGE and mass spectrometry. Somewhat surprisingly, the pattern of associated bands detected by silver staining was essentially indistinguishable between the two proteins, suggesting that the two proteins are found in equivalent complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The presence of C2 and C2L in the same complex was indeed confirmed as seen by the coprecipitation of myc-tagged C2 with FLAG-tagged C2L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the notion that C2L completes the symmetry of the TRAPP core, residing opposite C2, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Scrivens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Identification of novel mammalian TRAPP components.

In some cases, bands were not resolved and the entire eluate was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The bait band refers to either C2 (lane 2) or C2L (lane 3). TTC15/TRAPPC12 is marked with an asterisk since it was not identified in a gel slice but rather following mass spectrometric analysis of a non-gel-resolved protein preparation. Note that the uneven staining of the gel is due to the use of a discontinuous gradient in the resolving portion of the gel. (B) Lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-C2L and myc-C2 (lane 1) were treated with preimmune rabbit serum (lane 2) or antiâFLAG IgG (lane 3), and the precipitates were subjected to Western analysis using antiâmyc IgG.

The fragmentation of the Golgi observed upon knockdown is indicative of such a role, but to address this notion directly, we examined the effect of C11 and C12 depletion on the trafficking of the temperature-sensitive, fluorophore-tagged VSV-G mutant ts045-VSV-G-GFP. At temperatures above 38Â°C, this mutant protein is retained in the ER, but upon shifting to the permissive temperature of 32Â°C, it is efficiently released, first to the ERGIC and then further through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Scales <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). HeLa cells were depleted of C11 or C12 using siRNA for 48 h and then transfected with a plasmid containing ts045-VSV-G-GFP (VSV-G). The following day, VSV-G was blocked in the ER by incubation at the restrictive temperature for 6 h. VSV-G was then released by shifting to 32Â°C for 30 min in the presence of cycloheximide. In cells treated with a nonspecific oligonucleotide, the fluorescent signal appeared in the perinuclear region within 30 min and colocalized with the Golgi marker Man II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). On knockdown of C11 or C12, however, the mutant protein did not traffic to a perinuclear region typical of the Golgi, but rather accumulated in punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, BâE</xref>, and Supplemental Figure 7). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that these punctae costain for ERGIC53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, D and E</xref>) and are closely apposed to Sec31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, B and C</xref>), markers for the ERGIC and ER-exit sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

To more formally demonstrate that VSV-G is not merely labeling a functional Golgi mini-stack after a short release, we examined its localization in C11-depleted cells after long incubation times. It has been demonstrated via live-cell imaging that VSV-G reaches the cell surface within â¼100 min after release from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hirschberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Vasserman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

We postulated that VSV-G had failed to reach the Golgi and tested this hypothesis by treating C11-depleted cells with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA), which causes rapid collapse of the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>medial</italic>- Golgi into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Lippincott-Schwartz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>) and a redistribution of ERGIC53 to ER exit sites or closely associated peripheral ERGIC elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Saraste and Svensson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Marie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).

To ensure that all possible TRAPP subunits were included in this study, we mined GenBank for TRAPP-related proteins. Indeed, we identified a protein annotated as Bet3-like (using our convention of subunit nomenclature of the mammalian orthologues, we will refer to this protein as C3L). C3 and C3L are clearly related, displaying â¼60% identity at the amino acid level (Supplemental Figure 8A). Key features previously identified on C3, including residues that make up a basic patch on one surface and a cysteine residue that can be acylated, are preserved in C3L. Strikingly, although C3 and C3L are nearly identical in size, C3L has a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 8.11, whereas C3 is considerably more acidic with a pI of 4.88. This difference is readily seen at the carboxy terminus: whereas the carboxy terminus of C3 is acidic, the carboxy terminus of C3L is highly basic.</p><p>To confirm that C3L is capable of interacting with TRAPP, a FLAG-tagged version was expressed in HEK293T cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against several TRAPP proteins and then probed for the presence of FLAG-C3L.

Because several of these proteins have non-TRAPP-associated pools (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the coimmunoprecipitation experiment was performed on a TRAPP-enriched, high-molecular-weight fraction by first fractionating the lysate by size exclusion chromatography. Again, for each subunit examined, one tagged version of the TRAPP protein coprecipitated the other tagged version of the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that TRAPP forms oligomers in human cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although yeast TRAPP is increasingly well-characterized, the components and function of mammalian TRAPP are less defined. The similarity of the C2- and C2L-TAP-purified TRAPP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) suggests that we are likely to have discovered most, if not all, mammalian TRAPP components through this methodology. Vesicle trafficking in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and mammalian cells is characterized not only by conserved molecular assemblies and pathways, but by distinct differences between organelle structure and function. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, for example, need to coordinate membrane traffic to a large vacuole, which is absent in mammalian cells. Likewise, differences are seen in Golgi organization, presence or absence of the ERGIC, and distribution of ER exit sites. Distinct trafficking steps in yeast are mediated by discrete subassemblies of TRAPP, with TRAPP I mediating ER-to-Golgi and TRAPP II mediating late Golgi vesicle trafficking. In contrast, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Loh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kummel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Yamasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) have shown that no TRAPP I equivalent (a complex composed of C1âC6) is present in mammalian cells, but rather that the fundamental unit of TRAPP is a much larger assembly. This raises the question of whether and how mammalian TRAPP, like yeast TRAPP, mediates discrete trafficking events, which is addressed below.</p><p>Together with the extensive yeast two-hybrid analysis, we present a model for the architecture of mammalian TRAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Based on our most stringent growth criterion in the yeast two-hybrid analysis, we speculate that the C2 and C2L ends of the TRAPP core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, blue circles) mediate interactions with the high-molecular-weight subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, mauve ovals). Oligomers may form by association of two or more such units. Yeast two-hybrid data and the partial destabilization of TRAPP observed upon C11 knockdown suggest that C11 may mediate the interactions between the TRAPP core (through C2L and C6) and other large TRAPP subunits. Preliminary data on the interactions of various domains of C11 support this notion (B.N. and M.S., unpublished observation). The orientation of the two TRAPP cores is unclear, and they may align either parallel or antiparallel as depicted in our model. However, either model allows for interactions between subunits that were not seen in the crystal structure of the core by interactions between two or more cores of the TRAPP oligomer.</p><p>The most closely related yeast complex to human TRAPP is TRAPP II, whose architecture was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Yip <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In TRAPP II, the core is flanked by the high-molecular-weight subunits Trs130p and Trs120p. Dimerization was mediated by interactions between either of these two high-molecular-weight subunits and Trs65p. Although similar to the yeast TRAPP II architecture, our model differs in several respects. First, higher eukaryotes do not have a Trs65p homologue (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and therefore oligomerization must be mediated by another subunit. Second, higher eukaryotes contain C11 and C12, proteins that are not found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Therefore the âcapsâ on the ends of the TRAPP core may vary quite significantly from those of yeast TRAPP II. The subunits comprising the caps in human TRAPP may provide functions to the complex that are not needed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Finally, given the similar phenotype between C8, C11, C12, C2, and C2L knockdowns, our model suggests that all of these subunits may be present in the oligomers of TRAPP, whereas the orthologues of C8 and C2L (Trs85p and Tca17p, respectively) were not detected in TRAPP II purified with tagged Trs120p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Yip <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our model is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that C6a and C6b cofractionate by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kummel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Because neither the crystal structure of yeast nor mammalian TRAPP suggested the presence of multiple copies of C6, we suggest that cofractionation of two isoforms of this subunit is due to oligomerization of the complex.</p><p>Oligomerization of TRAPP can give rise to complexes with variable components in any one of several positions (i.e., C6a/b, C3/C3L) and might allow for a combinatorial diversification of TRAPP function, perhaps regulating cell-specific activities. Indeed, C3L appears to have a limited expression profile (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BET3L&amp;search=bet3l">http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BET3L&amp;search=bet3l</ext-link>) relative to C3, suggesting a functional diversification. Intriguingly, residues previously implicated as critical for Ypt1p GEF activity in Bet3p are conserved in C3 but not in C3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>What, then, is the function of the complex? Localization of subunits by fluorescence microscopy has proven difficult due to the large soluble pools of the proteins. However, C3 was reported to be localized to ER exit sites, whereas C2, C4, and C10 were reported to be bound to COP I vesicles at or near the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Yamasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Here we report that C12 is largely found in punctae throughout the cell and knockdowns of either C11 or C12 arrest a cargo protein in a BFA-resistant compartment. It was recently suggested that such a BFA-resistant compartment represents peripheral elements of the ERGIC in close association with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Marie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, C3 was proposed to be involved in formation of the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Together with the present study, we suggest that TRAPP functions either at ER exit sites or at peripheral ERGIC (BFA-resistant) elements. A defect at the ERGIC may be expected to have an indirect effect on the ability of cargo to properly exit the ER. It remains a possibility that TRAPP may function at both stages (ER exit and early ERGIC) in the early secretory pathway. This notion is supported by several pieces of evidence. Yeast TRAPP acts as a GEF for Ypt1p and precipitation of C10 coprecipitates a Rab1 GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Yamasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A function for activated Rab1 during vesicle budding has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Allan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and therefore its GEF would be expected to associate with budding vesicles at ER exit sites. Thus, TRAPP, or a subset of TRAPP proteins, may play an as yet undefined role during vesicle budding accounting for a defect in cargo exit from the ER as we report. Given its well-documented role as a vesicle tether in yeast, the complex may in fact migrate on ERGIC membranes to the Golgi, where it performs a second (tethering) function. The localization of subunits on Golgi-derived COP I vesicles may represent a means to recycle the complex back to ERGIC membranes and, analogous to yeast, may thus function in traffic to the early Golgi. The necessarily dynamic nature of the membrane association of TRAPP proteins could account for differences in their reported localization. Alternatively, C12 appears to fractionate in a second pool distinct from other TRAPP proteins and its localization may be linked to this pool.</p><p>C8 (KIAA1012) was found to copurify with TAP-C3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gavin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Its copurification with several other TRAPP components and its implication in vesicle trafficking as demonstrated in this study confirm that it is a bona fide TRAPP subunit. Although its yeast orthologue Trs85p was suggested to be in a complex distinct from TRAPP I and TRAPP II that functions in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Lynch-Day <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), our study clearly links the mammalian protein to the early secretory pathway. Although our results indicate a general role for C8 in membrane trafficking, they do not preclude a second role for this protein in autophagy in mammals.</p><p>Recombinant expression of the yeast equivalent of C1âC6 resulted in a stable, functional core complex, whereas recombinant expression of the mammalian proteins did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). It was previously speculated that the recombinant mammalian TRAPP core required other subunits to facilitate its stable assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Sacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Our identification of a number of new proteins, the loss of two of which (C11 or C12) appears to partially destabilize the complex in vivo, supports this notion. A detailed analysis of the structure of human TRAPP will help to explain this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two hybrid</title><p>Modified pGADT7 and pGBKT7 plasmids containing TRAPP subunits were transformed into AH109 and Y187 yeast, respectively.
