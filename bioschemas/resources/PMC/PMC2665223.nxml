      <abstract>
        <p>DNA polymerase Î¸ (Pol Î¸) is a low-fidelity DNA polymerase that belongs to the family A polymerases and has been proposed to play a role in somatic hypermutation. Pol Î¸ has the ability to conduct translesion DNA synthesis opposite an AP site or thymine glycol, and it was recently proposed to be involved in base excision repair (BER) of DNA damage. Here, we show that Pol Î¸ has intrinsic 5â²-deoxyribose phosphate (5â²-dRP) lyase activity that is involved in single-nucleotide base excision DNA repair (SN-BER). Full-length human Pol Î¸ is a â¼300-kDa polypeptide, but we show here that the 98-kDa C-terminal region of Pol Î¸ possesses both DNA polymerase activity and dRP lyase activity and is sufficient to carry out base excision repair <italic>in vitro</italic>. The 5â²-dRP lyase activity is independent of the polymerase activity, in that a polymerase inactive mutant retained full 5â²-dRP lyase activity. Domain mapping of the 98-kDa enzyme by limited proteolysis and NaBH<sub>4</sub> cross-linking with a BER intermediate revealed that the dRP lyase active site resides in a 24-kDa domain of Pol Î¸. These results are consistent with a role of Pol Î¸ in BER.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>DNA sequences homologous to the mus308 gene of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were identified in human genome database, and the corresponding cDNA was cloned and mapped to chromosome 3q13.31. As the partial human cDNA encoded a 1762-amino-acid DNA polymerase with a molecular mass of 198 kDa, this new polymerase was designated DNA polymerase Î¸ (Pol Î¸), and the corresponding vertebrate locus was named POLQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Subsequently, a full-length cDNA for POLQ was cloned and shown to encode a 2592-amino-acid polypeptide with an amino-terminal helicase domain, a carboxy-terminal polymerase domain and an intervening spacer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The mammalian POLQ and <italic>Drosophila</italic> mus308 gene products have similar domain arrangements. In addition to these orthologs, vertebrates have paralogs of the POLQ gene, HEL308 and POLN. The HEL308 gene product has homology to the helicase domain of POLQ but does not have a polymerase domain, whereas the POLN gene product has homology to the polymerase domain of POLQ, but does not contain a helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>DNA polymerase Î¸ belongs to the family A polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) typified by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Biochemical studies showed that purified full-length human Pol Î¸ exhibited template-directed DNA polymerase activity on nicked double-stranded DNA and on a single-primed DNA template. Consistent with family A DNA polymerases, this activity was resistant to aphidicolin and inhibited by dideoxynucleotides. In addition, Pol Î¸ exhibited a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Fidelity measurements of human Pol Î¸ revealed that the polymerase generates single base pair substitutions at a rate 10- to 100-fold higher than other characterized family A DNA polymerases, making it one of the least faithful member of the family A DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Pol Î¸ is capable of conducting translesion DNA synthesis by inserting bases opposite an AP site or thymine glycol residue in the template strand. It also can extend an unpaired primer base opposite these lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, Pol Î¸ is sufficient for both the insertion and extension steps required for bypass of an abasic site. In contrast, Pol Î¸ cannot insert bases opposite a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer or a (6â4) photoproduct, but is able to extend primers after DNA polymerase Î¹ had inserted a base opposite these UV-induced photoproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A role for Pol Î¸ in somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes has been proposed where the excision of uracil by uracilâDNA glycosylase (UDG) during SHM generates an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that is repaired by either translesion bypass or a base excision repair (BER) process involving several DNA polymerases and accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10â14</xref>). Recently, Takeda and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) suggested that Pol Î¸ and Pol Î² are involved in BER of DNA damage in DT40 cells. They reported that POLQ<sup>â/â</sup> cells exhibited no significant increase in sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or HmdUrd, but deletion of the genes for both POLQ and Pol Î² resulted in cells more sensitive to these base-damaging agents. Furthermore, subcellular localization studies demonstrated that Pol Î¸ is rapidly recruited to sites of base damage that are induced by laser-delivered irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These data along with extract-based <italic>in vitro</italic> repair assays suggested that Pol Î¸ participates in BER in mammalian cells under certain conditions.</p>
      <p>To understand the potential involvement of Pol Î¸ in BER in mammalian cells, we cloned, overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity the C-terminal 98-kDa region of Pol Î¸, corresponding to the core polymerase domain. We also prepared a polymerase-deficient variant of the enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis, and assessed activities associated with BER. Our results reveal that the Pol Î¸ polymerase domain possesses both 5â²-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase and DNA polymerase activities that function together during single-nucleotide BER <italic>in vitro</italic>. The 5â²-dRP lyase activity was also fully active in the polymerase-deficient mutant. Our observation that Pol Î¸ exhibits DNA polymerase and 5â²-dRP lyase activities <italic>in vitro</italic> lends credence to the argument that Pol Î¸ may have a role in BER <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <p>Based on the cDNA sequence of human Pol Î¸ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), a 2.7-kb cDNA clone was amplified for overexpression and production of a 98-kDa C-terminal fragment of human Pol Î¸ using a 5â²-BamH1 primer: 5â²-TGC CAA TCA TGA TGG ATC CTC ATC CCT CTT ACC-3â² and a 3â²-Sal1 primer: 5â²-CTC TGT TCT TTG CAG TCG ACT GCA TCT GCA C-3â². The amplified DNA was digested with BamH1 and Sal1 restriction enzymes, and the correct DNA fragment was gel-purified and ligated into BamH1âSal1 digested pQE80L (Qiagen). The resulting plasmid pQE80L-Î¸2.7 was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21-CodonPlus-RP cells (Stratagene) for protein production.</p>
        <p>Pol Î¸ was purified from 1 to 2 l of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21-CodonPlus-RP cells transformed with pQE80L-Î¸2.7 following induction with 1.0 mM IPTG at a temperature of 30Â°C for 3.5 h. After harvesting by centrifugation and storage at â80Â°C, cells were resuspended in buffer (35 ml) containing 50 mM TrisâHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol and a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors. Cells were disrupted in a French Press chilled to 4Â°C with a constant pressure of 25 000 psi. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12 000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, and the supernatant was saved for further purification. Imidazole was added to the cleared lysate to a final concentration of 20 mM before being applied to a 2-ml NiâNTA column (Qiagen).

For the time course experiment, the reaction mixture (50 Âµl) was assembled at 0â1Â°C in the above buffer. Reactions were initiated by adding 400 nM Pol Î¸ or the dilution buffer (control), as indicated in figure legends, and incubated at 37Â°C. Aliquots (9 Âµl each) were withdrawn at different time intervals and transferred to 0â1Â°C to stop the reaction. DNA products were stabilized by addition of 20 mM NaBH<sub>4</sub> and incubated for 30 min on ice. Then, an equal volume of gel-loading buffer was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 75Â°C for 2 min. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen, Pre-cast gel) for 30 min at constant voltage (200 V). To quantify the reaction products, gels were scanned on a PhosphorImager and the data were analyzed as above. Reaction rates were determined by plotting the amount of substrate released as a function of time, and data were fitted to the appropriate equation by nonlinear least squares methods. To examine the influence of protein concentrations on dRP removal, the reactions were assembled on ice, as above, and initiated by adding appropriate dilutions of Pol Î¸, as indicated in the figure legends. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min and processed as above.</p>

        <title>Limited proteolysis and amino-terminal sequencing of Pol Î¸</title>
        <p>The purified human Pol Î¸ 98-kDa polymerase domain (66 Âµg) was subjected to limited proteolysis by mixing with trypsin (0.66 Âµg) at a 1:100 weight ratio (trypsin:Pol Î¸) in 100 mM TrisâHCl, pH 8.0 and then incubating the solution at 25Â°C. The final reaction mixture volume was 90 Âµl. Aliquots (20 Âµl each) were withdrawn at 5-, 15-, 30- and 60-min time intervals. A portion of each sample (18 Âµl) was mixed immediately with 10 Âµl SDSâPAGE gel-loading buffer, boiled for 5 min and separated by electrophoresis in a 12% NuPAGE BisâTris gel with a MOPS running buffer system. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto an Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (7 Ã 8.4 cm) (Bio-Rad) using a transfer buffer that contained 10 mM CAPS [3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid] and 10% methanol, pH 11.0 at 50 V (7 V/cm) for 1 h. The membrane was stained briefly with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie blue R-250 in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid and destained with 90% methanol and 10% acetic acid. The membrane was air-dried, and protein bands were cut with a scalpel. Amino-terminal sequencing was performed using a Model 492 Procise sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) at Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. The remaining portion of the trypsin digested sample (2 Âµl) was subjected to NaBH<sub>4</sub> cross-linking to a 5â²-end labeled dRP lyase DNA substrate, as described above. The resulting gel was subjected to phosphorimaging, and then the same gel was silver-stained for protein detection.</p>

        <title>Production of Pol Î¸ polymerase domain</title>
        <p>To facilitate the high-yield production of recombinant human Pol Î¸ in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we expressed several nested POLÎ¸ cDNA clones and screened them to find the largest fragment that retained DNA polymerase activity. From the full-length human Pol Î¸ cDNA (1,2, Copeland, unpublished data), we amplified 2.7-, 2.1-, 1.8- and 1.3-kbp cDNA fragments containing the DNA polymerase domain. Expression of the 2.7-kbp cDNA fragment, corresponding to the 98-kDa polymerase domain at the C-terminus of Pol Î¸ (amino acids 1712â2590), produced soluble protein with the highest yield (data not shown). A (His)<sub>6</sub> affinity tag was added to the N-terminus by transferring this fragment to the pQE80L expression plasmid, and protein was overproduced in the <italic>E. coli</italic> host BL21-CodonPlus-RP cells. As described in âMaterials and Methodsâ section, recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential passage over a NiâNTA affinity column, a buffer exchange column, and a Mono S cation exchange column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 2). As a control for analysis of the polymerase activity, a mutant variant of the Pol Î¸ polymerase domain was constructed that abolished DNA polymerase activity. This was achieved by altering critical carboxylate residues that bind active site Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Similar alterations in other DNA polymerases are known to abolish DNA polymerase catalytic activity without dramatically affecting the overall structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Asp829 and Glu830 (corresponding to residues 2540 and 2541 in the full-length Pol Î¸) in motif C were changed to Asn and Gln, respectively. This mutant of the Pol Î¸ domain harboring D829N and E830Q substitutions was overexpressed and purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type 98-kDa Pol Î¸ preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 3).

        <p>DNA polymerase activity of the purified wild-type and mutant Pol Î¸ proteins was determined using an oligonucleotide primer/template as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The wild-type 98-kDa Pol Î¸ readily incorporated a single nucleotide when only dCTP was included in the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lane 3) and could incorporate 2 nt when the next correct nucleotide also was added (lane 4), but the enzyme was unable to extend the primer further when all four nucleotides were present (lane 5). Thus, the 98-kDa Pol Î¸ C-terminal domain exhibited altered activity compared to the full-length 298-kDa Pol Î¸, which easily extends DNA primers to the end of an oligonucleotide template (2,9 and Copeland, unpublished data). Control incubations utilizing the 98-kDa Pol Î¸ double mutant failed to display any DNA polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), indicating complete inactivation of Pol Î¸ polymerase function, as well as the absence of any significant contaminating nuclease or polymerase activities that may have been carried over from the <italic>E. coli</italic> host. A comparison of the single-nucleodide primer-extension DNA polymerase activity of full-length Pol Î¸ and the 98-kDa Pol Î¸ is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

        <title>5â²-dRP lyase activity of Pol Î¸</title>
        <p>To examine a potential role of human Pol Î¸ in BER and to further characterize its biochemical properties, we assessed the ability of the purified wild-type 98-kDa Pol Î¸ and its polymerase-deficient mutant (D829N/E830Q) to process a BER intermediate substrate. Pol Î² was included in the experiments as a reference. A 34-bp oligonucleotide duplex that contained a uracil residue at position 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) was used to measure the release of the 5â²-dRP group by dRP lyase activity. The uracil-containing DNA strand was 3â²-end-labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]ddAMP and annealed to its complementary strand; the duplex DNA then was pretreated with UDG and APE. The prepared DNA substrate, contained a 1-nt gap with a 5â²-dRP group and <sup>32</sup>P-label at the 3â²-end of the dRP-containing strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The removal of the dRP group from the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrate strand is visualized in a denaturing gel as a band migrating approximately one-half nucleotide faster than the substrate. The preincised substrate was incubated with wild-type Pol Î¸ (98-kDa peptide), mutant Pol Î¸ or Pol Î². The results demonstrated that both wild-type Pol Î¸ and the mutant Pol Î¸ could release the dRP group from the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), and the activities appeared to be similar. The apparent rates of dRP removal of Pol Î¸ and Pol Î² were 0.016/min and 0.64/min, respectively. Under the same reaction conditions, the rate of dRP lyase activity of Pol Î¸ appeared to be about 40-fold lower than that of Pol Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

        <title>Kinetics and mechanism of dRP lyase</title>
        <p>To determine kinetic parameters of 5â²-dRP group removal by Pol Î¸, we prepared a 34-bp duplex DNA that contained uracil at position 16 and a nick between positions 15 and 16, by annealing both a 15-mer and a 5â²-end <sup>32</sup>P-labeled uracil-containing 17-mer to the 34-mer complementary DNA strand. The resulting <sup>32</sup>P-labeled nicked DNA was pretreated with UDG to generate the 5â²-dRP-containing single-nucleotide gapped substrate; the DNA substrate, thus prepared, contained a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled dRP flap in a single-nucleotide gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, 16-mer + <sup>32</sup>P-dRP). The rate of dRP removal by Pol Î¸ was determined under single turnover conditions (i.e. enzyme/DNA = 4). The results revealed that Pol Î¸ cleaved 5â² dRP in a time-dependent manner as monitored by disappearance of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), with an observed rate of dRP removal of â¼0.14/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In other experiments where substrate was in excess, removal of the 5â²-dRP group from the substrate was dependent on the enzyme concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B).
<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Kinetic measurements of dRP lyase activity of Pol Î¸. The loss of dRP from the nicked AP-site containing DNA substrate was examined as a function of incubation time, and the rate of dRP removal by Pol Î¸ was determined under single turnover conditions (i.e. enzyme/DNA = 4). The reaction was performed with Pol Î¸ as described under Materials and Methods section. (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the DNA substrate prepared by annealing a 15-mer oligonucleotide, a 17-mer oligonucleotide containing <sup>32</sup>P-labeled uracil at the 5â²-end, and a 34-mer oligonucleotide template.

Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time intervals and stabilized by the addition of 20 mM NaBH<sub>4</sub> and incubation on ice for 30 min. Then, an equal volume of gel-loading dye buffer was added, and the reaction products were separated by precast 15% TBE-Urea gels.

        <p>To confirm that the 5â²-dRP lyase activity of Pol Î¸ was intrinsic to the 98-kDa peptide, we utilized the NaBH<sub>4</sub> cross-linking technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This cross-linking technique relies on the ability of the C1â²-aldehyde group of the 5â²-deoxyribose in the substrate to react with a lysine Î³-amine of a protein to form a Î²-elimination intermediate (Schiff base) proteinâDNA complex; this Schiff base is recovered as a covalent bond by NaBH<sub>4</sub> trapping. We had previously shown that DNA polymerases, such as Pol Î², Pol Î³ and Pol Î¹, catalyze dRP removal from the BER intermediate via Î²-elimination, and the Schiff base intermediate between these polymerases and DNA can be trapped by NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, both wild-type Pol Î¸ and the polymerase-deficient mutant Pol Î¸ could form covalent proteinâDNA products with the BER intermediate substrate upon treatment with NaBH<sub>4</sub>. This indicates that the Pol Î¸ polymerase domain possesses functional 5â²-dRP lyase activity.

        <title>Domain mapping of the 98-kDa peptide of Pol Î¸</title>
        <p>To probe domain organization of the Pol Î¸ 98-kDa polymerase domain and to localize the 5â²-dRP lyase active site of Pol Î¸, we subjected the purified protein to controlled proteolysis with trypsin, and then we identified the digestion products by amino-terminal sequencing. Samples from the incubation with trypsin were withdrawn at different time intervals. A portion of each sample was separated by SDSâPAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing as described under âMaterials and Methodsâ section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Digestion for 5 min completely degraded the 98-kDa enzyme and produced two major fragments with molecular masses of about 33 and 24 kDa; several minor polypeptides of higher and lower molecular masses also were produced. With longer incubations of 30 and 60 min, four fragments persisted and were designated as fragments II, III, IV and V, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The 24-kDa fragment appeared to be further digested to a smaller molecular mass polypeptide resulting in a doublet in the gel, whereas the 20-kDa polypeptide and some high-molecular-mass polypeptides almost disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of several of these protease-resistant fragments (denoted as IâVI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) revealed that the 33-, 24-, 23-, 14- and 9-kDA polypeptides (II to VI) begin with Phe<sup>124</sup>, Cys<sup>545</sup>, Gly<sup>557</sup>, Leu<sup>423</sup> and Asn<sup>41</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). These results indicated that the 23-kDa (IV) polypeptide resulted from removal of 12 amino acids from the amino terminus of the 24-kDa (III) polypeptide. Fragment I, with a molecular mass of 42 kDa, failed to exhibit reasonable sequence data due to low abundance. The domains of the 98-kDa Pol Î¸ were aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) based on the molecular masses of these protease-resistant fragments and their amino-terminal sequences.

        <title>Localization of the dRP lyase active site</title>
        <p>To localize the dRP lyase active site within the 98-kDa Pol Î¸, portions of the tryptic digests of Pol Î¸ (see above) were incubated with the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled dRP lyase substrate and subjected to NaBH<sub>4</sub> cross-linking as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. This protocol was used to assess the capacity of the tryptic fragments for cross-linking and if successful to improve the yield of cross-linked material for sequencing. Reaction mixtures that were digested with trypsin for 5 min or 15 min produced major 33-kDa and 24-kDa fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), but only the 24-kDa fragment was radiolabeled following cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). Furthermore, longer incubations of 30 min and 60 min revealed that the radiolabeled 23- and 24-kDa peptides persisted and appeared as a doublet in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), similar to the doublet observed upon staining with Coomassie blue or silver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and E, respectively). These observations suggested that even prolonged incubation with trypsin only partially converted the 24-kDa peptide to the 23-kDa peptide, and that both fragments contain the Schiff base dRP lyase nucleophile, i.e. dRP lyase active site. Taken together, these results indicate that the 24-kDa tryptic fragment is a domain of Pol Î¸ that contains the dRP lyase active site and retains the ability to form a covalent DNAâprotein complex with a BER intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Abasic sites in DNA are common intermediates in several important DNA transactions within eukaryotic cells, including SHM, translesion DNA synthesis and BER. For example, SHM of immunoglobulin variable region genes is triggered by the action of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which deaminates deoxycytosine to deoxyuracil. The abasic sites could be processed by AP endonuclease and Pol Î² in an error-free pathway, but such a repair system would not be beneficial for SHM. Several lines of evidence support the idea that faithful repair mediated by Pol Î² is suppressed during SHM. First, using a mouse model Rajeswky and his associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) demonstrated that Pol Î² is not required in SHM. Second, we recently showed that the expression of Pol Î² in the SHM-proficient human BL2 cell line was strongly down regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Third, Maizels and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) reported that during immunoglobulin gene diversification in B cells, AP sites were preferentially processed by the MRE11-RAD50-NSB1 nuclease complex rather than by AP endonuclease.</p>
      <p>Although Pol Î¸ is a family A DNA polymerase, it exhibits unusual properties that permit efficient bypass of abasic sites. In fact, Pol Î¸ is able to synthesize through these damaged sites with an efficiency that is comparable to that displayed on a corresponding undamaged template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The unique ability of Pol Î¸ to insert and extend mispaired nucleotides opposite AP sites suggests an important role for Pol Î¸ in SHM consistent with the observation that deletion of the Pol Î¸ gene in mice decreased mutations in the Ig H chain by more than 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). While these studies suggested involvement of Pol Î¸ in translesion bypass during SHM, recent observations with DT40 cells also support some role for Pol Î¸ in BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this report we established that Pol Î¸, primarily known as a lesion bypass DNA polymerase, also possesses 5â²-dRP lyase and single-nucleotide gap-filling activities that are usually associated with BER. The dRP lyase activity is independent of polymerase activity, since a polymerase inactive mutant retained full dRP lyase activity. Using limited proteolysis and sodium borohydride cross-linking techniques, we demonstrated that the dRP lyase activity resides in a 24-kDa domain in the 98-kDa carboxy-terminal region of Pol Î¸. This 24-kDa domain contains the three conserved motifs (A, B and C) found in all family A and B polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the 24-kDa domain Lys2383, near motif B, is conserved in Pol Î¸ from vertebrate species as well as in other family A polymerases, and this residue could represent a candidate nucleophile for the dRP lyase activity. In investigating roles for the N-terminal 2/3 of the enzyme, it will be of interest to determine how the full-length enzyme influences overall BER efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, Pol Î¸ is highly expressed in germinal center B cells, where SHM and class switch recombination occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Identification of protein partners or cofactors that interact with full-length Pol Î¸ may help to assign roles for Pol Î¸ in these processes.</p>
