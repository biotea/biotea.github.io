        <p>Sequestration of misfolded proteins into pericentriolar inclusions called aggresomes is a means that cells use to minimize misfolded protein-induced cytotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism by which misfolded proteins are recruited to aggresomes remains unclear. Mutations in the E3 ligase parkin cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease that is devoid of Lewy bodies, which are similar to aggresomes. Here, we report that parkin cooperates with heterodimeric E2 enzyme UbcH13/Uev1a to mediate K63-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded DJ-1. K63-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded DJ-1 serves as a signal for interaction with histone deacetylase 6, an adaptor protein that binds the dyneinâdynactin complex. Through this interaction, misfolded DJ-1 is linked to the dynein motor and transported to aggresomes. Furthermore, fibroblasts lacking parkin display deficits in targeting misfolded DJ-1 to aggresomes. Our findings reveal a signaling role for K63-linked polyubiquitination in dynein-mediated transport, identify parkin as a key regulator in the recruitment of misfolded DJ-1 to aggresomes, and have important implications regarding the biogenesis of Lewy bodies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A prominent feature common to most neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of misfolded proteins in cytoplasmic inclusions, such as Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD) and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in these diseases most likely occurs due to a chronic imbalance in the generation and clearance of misfolded proteins. Misfolded proteins can be generated by genetic mutations (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg, 2003</xref>) or oxidative modifications (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dalle-Donne et al., 2006</xref>). Misfolded proteins are prone to aggregation and have the potential to impair cellular functions (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gregersen et al., 2006</xref>). Cells combat the buildup of misfolded proteins either by chaperone-mediated refolding or by proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, when the proteasome becomes overwhelmed or impaired, misfolded proteins are transported by the retrograde dynein motor complex to pericentriolar inclusions called aggresomes (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Mata et al., 2002</xref>). It has been proposed that aggresome formation is a specific and active cellular response serving to sequester potentially toxic misfolded proteins (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 2000</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that there are similarities between Lewy bodies and aggresomes (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Olanow et al., 2004</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in recognition and targeting of misfolded proteins to aggresomes remain unclear.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitination is a dynamic post-translational modification that serves diverse cellular roles (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Weissman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pickart and Fushman, 2004</xref>). Ubiquitin is covalently attached to a substrate protein through the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and the É-amino group of a lysine residue on the substrate by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. Successive conjugation of ubiquitin molecules to one of the seven internal lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) within the preceding ubiquitin molecule results in formation of a polyubiquitin chain (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pickart and Fushman, 2004</xref>). K48-linked polyubiquitination acts as the canonical signal for targeting the substrate to the proteasome for degradation. In contrast, K63-linked polyubiquitination has recently been shown to have a proteasome-independent role in the regulation of several cellular processes, including endocytosis, signal transduction, and DNA damage (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pickart and Fushman, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Haglund and Dikic, 2005</xref>). Although K48-linked polyubiquitination has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying polyubiquitination via K63 or other lysine linkages.</p>
      <p>Mutations in the E3 ligase parkin account for â¼50% of all recessively transmitted early-onset PD cases (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Kitada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lucking et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hattori and Mizuno, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, parkin-associated PD is devoid of Lewy bodies (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Mori et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that parkin function may be required for the formation of these inclusion bodies (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Sulzer, 2007</xref>). Parkin is present in Lewy bodies in sporadic PD (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Schlossmacher et al., 2002</xref>) and is recruited to aggresomes in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Junn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ardley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Muqit et al., 2004</xref>). However, the precise role of parkin in the biogenesis of Lewy bodies or aggresomes is unclear. Two studies suggest that parkin is capable of mediating K63-linked polyubiquitination (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Doss-Pepe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2005a</xref>). However, the cellular role of parkin-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and the molecular mechanism by which parkin mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination remain undefined.</p>
      <p>DJ-1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that is mutated in an autosomal recessive, early-onset form of PD (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abou-Sleiman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bonifati et al., 2003</xref>). We and others have previously shown that the PD-linked L166P mutation disrupts DJ-1 protein folding, resulting in a misfolded protein that is prone to aggregation (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Shendelman et al., 2004</xref>). The folding state of other parkin-interacting proteins has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study we investigated the role of parkin in ubiquitinating misfolded proteins, using the L166P mutant DJ-1 as a model. Our findings reveal a novel proteasome-independent role for parkin in the regulation of aggresome formation and have important implications for understanding the biogenesis of Lewy bodies in PD.</p>

        <title>Parkin selectively recognizes and ubiquitinates L166P mutant DJ-1, but not wild-type DJ-1</title>
        <p>We and others have previously shown that the L166P mutation-induced misfolded DJ-1 is selectively polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baulac et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2004</xref>). The molecular machinery that recognizes and ubiquitinates L166P mutant DJ-1 is unknown. We have proposed that L166P mutant DJ-1 might be a substrate for the E3 ligase parkin (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, immunoprecipitation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged L166P mutant DJ-1, but not wild-type DJ-1, was able to coprecipitate Myc-tagged parkin, providing evidence for an interaction of these two proteins in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Given the reported interaction of Parkin and L166P mutant DJ-1 with Hsp70 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Imai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2005</xref>), we considered the possibility that these three proteins might be present in a complex. However, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that, even with high levels of Hsp70 overexpression, Hsp70 did not associate with L166P mutant DJ-1 under the experimental conditions used (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, we found that GST-parkin bound Myc-tagged L166P mutant DJ-1 expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, but not Myc-tagged wild-type DJ-1 or endogenous DJ-1 (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, GST-parkin was able to efficiently pull down in vitro translated [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled L166P mutant DJ-1, but not wild-type DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Together, our data indicate that parkin directly binds L166P mutant DJ-1, but not wild-type DJ-1, and that this interaction does not require Hsp70 as a recruiting factor.</p>

        <p>Next, we performed in vivo ubiquitination assays to examine whether the interaction with parkin targets misfolded DJ-1 for parkin-mediated ubiquitination. In agreement with previous reports (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baulac et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2004</xref>), we found that L166P mutant DJ-1, but not wild-type DJ-1, was selectively polyubiquitinated in cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 was significantly increased by coexpression of parkin in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Under the same conditions, parkin did not promote the ubiquitination of wild-type DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that parkin selectively recognizes and ubiquitinates misfolded DJ-1 in vivo.</p>

        <title>Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination has no apparent effect on the degradation of misfolded DJ-1</title>
        <p>To determine whether parkin-mediated ubiquitination targets L166P mutant DJ-1 for degradation by the proteasome, we assessed the effect of parkin overexpression on the steady-state levels of wild-type and L166P mutant DJ-1 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). As we and others reported previously (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gorner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2004</xref>), the steady-state level of L166P mutant DJ-1 was substantially lower compared with wild-type DJ-1. Inhibition of proteasome function by MG132 selectively increased the steady-state level of the L166P mutant, but not wild-type DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Contrary to our expectation, we found that overexpression of parkin did not alter the steady-state levels of L166P mutant or wild-type DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Given the recent report that parkin promotes degradation of synphilin-1 only when the expression of parkin reaches very high levels (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2005a</xref>), we examined the effects of increased levels of parkin expression on the degradation of L166P mutant DJ-1 (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1</ext-link>). Even at extremely high levels of overexpression, parkin was unable to promote degradation of L166P mutant DJ-1 (Fig. S3). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2004</xref>), pulse chase experiments indicated that L166P mutant DJ-1 was highly unstable compared with the wild-type DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Co-expression of parkin had no effect on the stability of L166P mutant DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Together these results suggest that parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of mutant DJ-1 may have a nondegradative role.</p>

        <title>Parkin associates with the heterodimeric E2 enzyme UbcH13/Uev1a to mediate K63-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded DJ-1</title>
        <p>One possibility that may account for the inability of parkin to promote the degradation of L166P mutant DJ-1 is that parkin may mediate an alternative form of polyubiquitination that is not associated with proteasomal degradation, such as K63-linked polyubiquitination. The best-characterized E2 enzyme in mediating K63-linked polyubiquitination is the UbcH13/Uev1a heterodimer, in which UbcH13 is the catalytic subunit (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). A recent in vitro study has shown that the GST-fused second RING domain of parkin can bind UbcH13 and this interaction recruits the UbcH13/Uev1a heterodimer to parkin (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Doss-Pepe et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is unknown whether full-length parkin is able to bind UbcH13 in vivo. As shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), UbcH13 readily coprecipitated with parkin, providing evidence for an interaction between these two proteins in vivo. In addition, we observed the interaction of parkin with UbcH7 and UbcH8, but not with UbcH5, consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Shimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). These data indicate that parkin binds multiple E2 enzymes in vivo and suggest that the ability of parkin to facilitate K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitination may be dependent on the selective recruitment of distinct E2 enzymes.</p>

        <p>We next performed in vitro ubiquitination assays to determine if the UbcH13/Uev1a heterodimer is the cognate E2 enzyme for parkin-mediated ubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1. We found that parkin ubiquitinated L166P mutant DJ-1 in an UbcH13/Uev1a-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To investigate the linkage of parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1, we used ubiquitin mutants Ub-K29, Ub-K48, and Ub-K63, which contain arginine substitutions of all of its lysine residues except the one at position 29, 48, and 63, respectively. The Ub-K29, Ub-K48, and Ub-K63 mutants are thus expected to only allow the formation of K29-, K48-, and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, respectively. In vitro ubiquitination analyses using these ubiquitin mutants revealed that parkin was able to facilitate the polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 in the presence of wild-type ubiquitin (Ub-WT) and Ub-K63 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In contrast, in vitro ubiquitination reactions using Ub-K29 or Ub-K48 resulted in the accumulation of monoubiquitinated L166P mutant DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In addition, low levels of higher molecular weight bands were also observed at sizes corresponding to L166P mutant DJ-1 conjugated with three or four ubiquitin molecules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), and these bands could potentially represent monoubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 at multiple lysine residues. Together these results demonstrate that parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 occurs in vitro via K63-linked ubiquitin chains.</p>
        <p>We then used Ub-K48 and Ub-K63 mutants in in vivo ubiquitination assays to determine the linkage of parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 in cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In agreement with the results of the in vitro ubiquitination analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), parkin promoted robust polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 in cells expressing Ub-WT or Ub-K63, but not in cells expressing Ub-K48 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To provide further support for the identified K63 linkage of parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1, we used another set of ubiquitin mutants, Ub-K29R, Ub-K48R, Ub-K63R, which contain a single lysine-to-arginine mutation at position 29, 48, and 63, respectively. The Ub-K29R, Ub-K48R, and Ub-K63R mutants are expected to solely disrupt the assembly of K29-, K48-, and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, respectively. As a control, we also included a polymerization-defective mutant of ubiquitin (Ub-K0), in which all lysine residues of ubiquitin were changed to arginines, and therefore is unable to form polyubiquitin chains. We found that parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 was greatly reduced by replacement of Ub-WT with Ub-K63R, but not by the replacement with Ub-K29R (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). As expected, parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 was virtually abolished by replacement of Ub-WT with Ub-K0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). The low levels of L166P mutant DJ-1 ubiquitination observed with Ub-K63R could be due to non-K63-linked ubiquitination of mutant DJ-1 by another E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase(s) in SH-SY5Y cells. Consistent with this possibility, we found that the polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 was reduced by replacement of Ub-WT with Ub-K48R mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Furthermore, we and others have previously shown that L166P mutant DJ-1 associates with the E3 ligase CHIP (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Olzmann et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo data provide strong evidence that parkin facilitates K63-linked polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 in cooperation with UbcH13/Uev1a.</p>

        <title>L166P mutant DJ-1 and parkin colocalize in aggresomes induced by proteasome impairment</title>
        <p>Our findings that parkin specifically binds and ubiquitinates L166P mutant DJ-1 prompted us to investigate the potential colocalization of these two proteins in SH-SY5Y cells by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. HA-tagged L166P mutant DJ-1 exhibited a cytoplasmic staining pattern that displayed substantial overlap with that of Myc-tagged parkin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, top). In addition, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 caused a dramatic relocation of L166P mutant DJ-1 and parkin to a single prominent, perinuclear inclusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, bottom).</p>

        <p>The morphology and localization of the L166P mutant DJ-1âcontaining inclusions appeared similar to that of aggresomes (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Mata et al., 2002</xref>). To test whether these inclusions were aggresomes, we performed additional immunofluorescence confocal microscopy experiments to further characterize these inclusions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). We found that the L166P mutant DJ-1-containing inclusions were highly enriched with ubiquitin and the chaperone protein Hsp70, and surrounded by a compacted cage of the intermediate filament protein vimentin. Lamp2-immunoreactive lysosomes did not colocalize with the inclusions, but were observed in close apposition and often tightly ringed the inclusions. This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that aggresomes may represent substrates for autophagic degradation, a process involving fusion with lysosomes (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, serial 1-Î¼m Z-sections revealed that the misfolded DJ-1 protein was present throughout the center of the aggresome, extensively colocalized with ubiquitin, and completely surrounded by vimentin (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>Given the reported role of microtubule-dependent retrograde transport in aggresome formation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 2000</xref>), we examined the effects of the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole on parkin-induced recruitment of L166P mutant DJ-1 to aggresomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole in MG132-treated cells disrupted delivery of L166P mutant DJ-1 to the aggresome, leading to accumulation of misfolded DJ-1 in widely dispersed preaggresome particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Parkin colocalized with L166P mutant DJ-1 in these preaggresome particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), demonstrating an association of these two proteins before their transport to the aggresome. Together, these data indicate that recruitment of L166P mutant DJ-1 to the aggresome is dependent on intact microtubules and that the inclusions containing L166P mutant DJ-1 are bona fide aggresomes.</p>
        <p>Accumulating evidence indicates that aggresomes found in cultured cells are substrates for eventual autophagic degradation. To determine if L166P mutant DJ-1-containing aggresomes are sites of autophagy we used the widely used marker of autophagic vacuoles monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Biederbick et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>) (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200611128/DC1</ext-link>). The specificity of MDC staining is further confirmed by our results, which show that MDC staining does not overlap with lamp2 (Fig. S5), a protein present on late endosomes and lysosomes. Our findings indicate that under control conditions MDC displays a widely distributed, punctate distribution with relatively low fluorescence levels (Fig. S5). However, MG132-induced proteasomal impairment results in an increase in MDC fluorescence levels and a redistribution of MDC immunoreactivity to a perinuclear region that colocalizes with the L166P mutant DJ-1 aggresomes (Fig. S5). Together these findings indicate that L166P mutant DJ-1 aggresomes may be sites of autophagy.</p>

        <title>Parkin selectively promotes the recruitment of L166P mutant DJ-1, but not wild-type DJ-1, to aggresomes</title>

Interestingly, coexpression of parkin resulted in a dramatic increase in the percentage of cells containing L166P mutant DJ-1âpositive aggresomes, but had no effect on the localization of wild-type DJ-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Parkin-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded DJ-1 serves as a signal for binding HDAC6</title>
        <p>The observed microtubule-dependent recruitment of L166P mutant DJ-1 to the aggresome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) suggests that the retrograde dynein motor complex may be involved in the transport of misfolded DJ-1. Recent evidence indicates that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is critically involved in aggresome formation by acting as an adaptor between polyubiquitinated proteins and the dynein motor complex (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hideshima et al., 2005</xref>).

      <p>Although it is clear that cells sequester misfolded proteins into centrosomal aggresomes, how the cell recognizes these proteins for transport to the aggresome is poorly understood. Our findings support the model depicted in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, and suggest that misfolded proteins are normally polyubiquitinated and efficiently degraded by the 26S proteasome. However, under pathogenic conditions in which proteasome function is impaired, parkin cooperates with UbcH13/Uev1a to mediate K63-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins, promotes binding of HDAC6 and couples the misfolded protein to the dynein motor complex for transport to aggresomes.</p>

<bold>Model of parkin-dependent targeting of misfolded proteins to the aggresome.</bold> Under normal conditions misfolded proteins are recognized and conjugated with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, resulting in efficient degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, under conditions of proteasomal impairment, parkin cooperates with Ubc13/Uev1a to mediate K63-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins. This K63-linked polyubiquitin chain promotes binding of the dynein adaptor protein HDAC6, which effectively âloadsâ the misfolded protein onto the dynein motor complex for retrograde transport along microtubules to aggresomes.</p>

      <p>Our results demonstrate that parkin directly binds the misfolded L166P mutant, but not wild-type DJ-1. We find that parkin selectively promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of L166P mutant DJ-1 in an UbcH13/Uev1a-dependent manner. K63-linked polyubiquitination has been proposed to play a role in the formation of inclusion bodies (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2005b</xref>), but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Our data show that parkin promotes the accumulation of misfolded DJ-1 into aggresomes. Furthermore, the ability of parkin to promote the sequestration of misfolded DJ-1 into aggresomes is dependent on K63-linked polyubiquitination, and expression of Ub-K48 or Ub-K63R results in the accumulation of small preaggresomal particles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Previous studies suggest that misfolded proteins form small aggregates within the cytoplasm, which are then transported to the forming aggresome (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Mata et al., 2002</xref>). Disruption of transport by incubation with nocodazole (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 1998</xref>), overexpression of dynamitin (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Mata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2002</xref>), siRNA-mediated depletion (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>), or chemical inhibition (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) of HDAC6 results in the accumulation of small cytoplasmic aggregates. Thus the preaggresomal particles that accumulate upon expression of Ub-K48 or Ub-K63R may represent L166P mutant DJ-1-containing small aggregates. In addition to L166P mutant DJ-1, these preaggresomal particles also contained parkin, which suggests that K63-linked polyubiquitination may be important for the transport of parkin to the aggresome. Hampe et al. reported that parkin catalyzes multi-monoubiquitination of itself (auto-ubiquitination) in vitro and a fraction of parkin is multi-monoubiquitinated in vivo under basal conditions (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hampe et al., 2006</xref>). However, under conditions of proteasomal impairment, they found that parkin is mostly polyubiquitinated in vivo (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hampe et al., 2006</xref>), which might be mediated by another E3 ligase or by parkin in cooperation with additional factor(s) such as E4 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Imai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Richly et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, Lim et al. reported that parkin is modified by K63-linked polyubiquitination in vivo, which was suggested to be mediated by parkin itself (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2005a</xref>). K63-linked polyubiquitination of parkin under conditions of proteasomal impairment would promote the transport of parkin to aggresomes, and this could explain the reduced formation of parkin-positive aggresomes when K63-linked polyubiquitination was inhibited.</p>
      <p>One possibility is that K63-linked polyubiquitination may block K48-linked polyubiquitination, resulting in decreased proteasomal degradation and increased substrate accumulation. However, this does not address how these proteins are recognized and targeted to the aggresome. Our results indicate that K63-linked polyubiquitination plays an active signaling role, and that under conditions of proteasomal impairment facilitates an interaction between L166P mutant DJ-1 and the dynein adaptor protein HDAC6. HDAC6 links polyubiquitinated proteins, to the molecular motor dynein by simultaneously binding ubiquitin via a zinc-finger ubiquitin binding domain and dynein via a distinct dynein motor binding domain (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, HDAC6 has been found to localize to Lewy bodies in sporadic PD patients, suggesting that HDAC6 may also play a similar role in the biogenesis of these hallmark PD inclusions. Our results further demonstrate that HDAC6 preferentially binds K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins in vivo, suggesting that K63-linked polyubiquitination may act as a novel signal for the dynein-mediated transport and sequestration of misfolded proteins in the aggresome.</p>
      <p>Based on the localization of parkin in aggresomes/inclusions, it has been proposed that parkin is first recruited to aggresomes in response to proteasome inhibition and then ubiquitinates misfolded proteins in these inclusion bodies (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2005a</xref>). In this case, one would expect that targeting of misfolded proteins to aggresomes in <italic>Parkin</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs would be unaffected, but that there would be a decrease in the ubiquitination of the inclusions. However, we observed that the percentage of cells containing L166P mutant DJ-1 aggresomes was dramatically reduced in <italic>Parkin</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs. These findings support a role for parkin in the transport of misfolded DJ-1 to aggresomes rather than in the ubiquitination of the misfolded proteins in aggresomes. In addition, when transport of misfolded proteins to the aggresome was disrupted with nocodazole we observed that parkin colocalized with misfolded DJ-1 in ubiquitin-positive, preaggresomal particles, suggesting that parkin associates with and polyubiquitinates misfolded proteins before their transport to aggresomes.</p>
      <p>Whether protein inclusions are cytoprotective or cytotoxic is highly controversial. Studies indicate that several intermediates are generated during the process of protein aggregation, and suggest that the small-intermediate oligomers may be the principle toxic species (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Caughey and Lansbury, 2003</xref>). Accumulation of aggregated proteins can cause global impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bence et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>) and aggregated proteins also directly interfere with proteasomal function, possibly due to an inability to properly enter or exit the proteasome (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Holmberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Venkatraman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Kristiansen et al., 2007</xref>). Sequestration into inclusions like aggresomes may render these oligomers inert and protect an impaired proteasomal system from further damage. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that aggresomes might also act as a staging area for disposal by autophagy (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). In support of this possibility, we find that L166P mutant DJ-1 aggresomes stained with MDC, a marker of autophagic vacuoles. Consistent with the findings of Iwata et al. (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Iwata et al., 2005</xref>), we observed that MG132-mediated inhibition of the proteasome resulted in a redistribution of lysosomes, and often lysosomes tightly encircled the aggresome. A protective role for aggresomes has been further supported by the finding that disruption of aggresome formation using small molecule inhibitors of HDAC6 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hideshima et al., 2005</xref>) or by knockdown of HDAC6 protein levels by RNA interference (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>) increases the susceptibility to apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition or misfolded protein stress.</p>
      <p>It is widely believed that loss of parkin function would lead to decreased proteasomal degradation of a cytotoxic substrate protein, resulting in selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kahle and Haass, 2004</xref>). Studies have found that Parkin promotes the proteasomal degradation of several putative substrate proteins (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kahle and Haass, 2004</xref>). However, the accumulation of these substrates in parkin knockout mouse brain and human PD brains has been conflicting (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Periquet et al., 2005</xref>). Thus the role these substrates play in the pathogenesis of PD remains to be determined. Recent reports indicate that parkin is able to mediate monoubiquitination (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hampe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda et al., 2006</xref>) and K63-linked polyubiquitination (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Doss-Pepe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), two forms of ubiquitination that are not associated with proteasomal degradation. In addition, parkin has been implicated in nonproteasomal processes, including endocytosis and signal transduction (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fallon et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings further indicate that parkin plays a regulatory role in trafficking of misfolded DJ-1 to aggresomes. Our data reveal a critical role for parkin-mediated K63 polyubiquitination in earmarking misfolded proteins for dynein-mediated transport to the aggresome and suggest that loss of parkin function may impair sequestration of toxic misfolded proteins, thereby resulting in an increased susceptibility to aggregated protein-induced cellular dysfunction.</p>
