        <p>C1q collagen-like region (CLR) engaging and activating the LAIR-1 inhibitory immunoreceptor represents a non-complement mechanism for maintaining immune quiescence. Given the binding promiscuity of C1qâs globular region (gC1q), we hypothesized that C1q concurrently associates with distinct inhibitory immunoreceptors to produce C1q-mediated modulatory networking. Like LAIR-1, CD33 inhibitory immunoreceptors are highly expressed on monocytes. Binding CD33 restricts cell activation/differentiation; however, natural ligands for CD33 remain elusive. CD33 has IgC2-like domains potentially recognized by gC1q. Thus, we asked whether C1q binds to CD33 and if C1q mediates CD33/LAIR-1 crosslinking. Our findings demonstrate that C1q and gC1q interact with CD33 to activate its inhibitory motifs, while CLR does not. Whole C1q is required to crosslink CD33 and LAIR-1 and concurrently activate CD33/LAIR-1 inhibitory motifs. While C1q binds CD33C2 domains, decreased C1q-CD33 interactions resulting from sialic acid masking of CD33C2 domains suggests a process for regulating C1q-CD33 activity. Consistent with defective self-tolerance, CD33/LAIR-1 expression is reduced in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) myelomonocytes. The anti-inflammatory cytokine M-CSF, but not DC growth factors, sustains CD33/LAIR-1 expression on both healthy and SLE cells suggesting further biological control of C1q-CD33/LAIR-1 processes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Apart from C1q binding to the Fc (constant) region of antigen (Ag) complexed IgG or IgM to activate the classical complement pathway, C1q controls innate and adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. C1q facilitates phagocytosis and regulates immune cell differentiation, survival, migration, and cytokine secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The full length molecule is assembled from 18 polypeptide chains (6A, 6B and 6C chains). Each chain contains a C-terminal globular module (gC1q) and an N-terminal collagen-like Gly-Pro-Hyp (GPO) repeat region (CLR). Assembly of the A, B, C, chains into heterotrimer subunits is followed by organization into a 460âkDa hexamer displaying a distinct globular head region and a collagen tail region. C1q is abundant in serum and is amongst the most positively charged of serum proteins. Based on the ability of C1q (especially its globular region) to interact with multiple partners, it is classified as a pattern recognition molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In addition to C1qâs role in clearing immune complexes and apoptotic bodies for preventing unwarranted inflammation and autoimmunity, an important evolving idea is that C1q-C1q receptor inhibitory action on immune cells may directly induce tolerance and inhibit autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In support of this premise, C1q suppresses the ability of freshly isolated peripheral blood (PB) monocytes to differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) and inhibits IL-12 production by monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, understanding of membrane-proximal or intracellular signaling processes involved in such C1q-mediated inhibitory signaling is limited. A growing number of cell-associated receptors for both gC1q and CLR, including CD93 (C1qRp), CD35 (CR1), gC1qR (p33), Î±2Î²1 integrin, calreticulin (cC1qR), CD91, SCARF-1 and RAGE, have been associated with C1qâs complement independent functions, particularly with its ability to facilitate uptake of extracellular material into phagocytic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Because these C1q receptors do not exhibit intracellular inhibitory signaling domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and lack direct inhibitory action like receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs), they provide little or no insight into molecular mechanisms occurring after C1q engages the cell surface to directly suppress immune cells. We recently demonstrated that C1qâs collagen-like region (CLR) directly engages the collagen immunoreceptor LAIR-1 (CD305) on monocytes to phosphorylate cytoplasmic LAIR-1 inhibitory motifs (ITIM) and restrict monocyte/monocyte-derived dendritic cell (mono-DC) differentiation and activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These studies revealed that C1q engages a plasma membrane receptor with intracellular ITIM activity and provided important insight into molecular mechanisms of C1q control over monocyte/DCs. Because of the prevalence of gC1q interactions, we surmised that globular heads of C1q might still be available to bind molecules on the plasma membrane and contribute to C1qâs control over monocyte activity.</p>
      <p>CD33 (Siglec-3), another inhibitory immunoreceptor, is a member of the sialic acid immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectin (siglec) group of proteins functionally categorized by their ability to promote sialic acid dependent cell adhesion. CD33 is described as the smallest siglec member. It features one extracellular V-like (V) domain responsible for recognition of sialic acid, one extracellular Ig C2-like (C2) domain with unknown function, and in the cytoplasm, one ITIM and one ITIM-like sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Two isoforms of CD33 exist in humans, one containing the full length protein (CD33M); the other lacking the V domain (CD33m). Both are expressed on the cell membrane, however, the biological function of CD33m remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Unlike LAIR-1 which is ubiquitously expressed on hematopoietic cells, CD33 is restricted to the myeloid cell compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Both LAIR-1 and CD33 are highly expressed on freshly isolated blood monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and activation of CD33 ITIM also restricts monocyte/mono-DC activation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of ITIM sequences on CD33âs cytoplasmic tail occurs when CD33 extracellular motifs are cross-linked with anti-CD33 Abs or chemicals, however, natural ligands remain poorly categorized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Given that gC1q binds to C2-like motifs on molecules other than Ig<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and that CD33 contains a C2-like (CD33C2) domain that may be recognized by gC1q, we hypothesized that C1q binds to CD33. Because different immunoreceptors may cooperate to promote inhibitory action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, we also hypothesized that C1q crosslinking of CD33 and LAIR-1 on the cell surface would yield activation of both CD33 and LAIR-1 ITIMs. Masking of CD33C2 domains has been described in CD33<sup>+</sup> cell lines presumably as a consequence of <italic>cis</italic> interactions between membrane associated sialic acid and sialic acid ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We therefore, considered whether masking of CD33C2 domains by cell surface sialylation would affect C1q binding.</p>
      <p>Genetic or acquired C1q deficiency in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), was instrumental in exposing C1qâs complement-independent, tolerogenic role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Nothwithstanding, much remains to be clarified regarding molecular mechanisms involving C1q in this setting. Based on the assumption that accelerated activation and differentiation of SLE monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> might be associated with flawed LAIR-1 and/or CD33 activity, we investigated patterns of LAIR-1 and CD33 expression on SLE monocytes. Finally, we studied whether CD33 and LAIR-1 expression is regulated by cytokines promoting the growth of anti-inflammatory myelomonocytes versus mono-DCs.</p>
      <p>Our studies establish that C1q is a ligand for CD33. Moreover, our findings substantiate that C1q specifically binds to CD33C2 domains and that gC1q and C1qCLR engage CD33 and LAIR-1, respectively, to yield molecular partnering. The lack of LAIR-1 and CD33 expression on SLE monocytes, along with the frequent abnormalities related to C1q in SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, suggest that C1q/CD33/LAIR-1 inhibitory networks are disrupted in SLE. Masking of CD33C2 domains by sialic acid impedes C1q binding, revealing a possible mechanism for modulating C1q-CD33 inhibitory activity. Biological control of LAIR-1 and CD33 expression was further indicated by the observation that the anti-inflammatory cytokine M-CSF, but not DC growth factors (GM-CSF/IL-4), sustained CD33/LAIR-1 expression on both healthy and SLE cells.</p>

        <title>Evidence for a C1q-CD33 interaction</title>
        <p>We tested whole C1q and C1q fragments for binding to CD33 isoforms (CD33M, CD33m) in both protein and cell based assays. In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we compared purified protein-protein interactions between whole C1q, gC1q, or C1qCLR and the CD33 M/m isoforms in slot blot assays. In support of direct C1q-CD33 interactions, whole C1q associated with CD33M in a dose dependent fashion whereas binding to a control protein (HSA) was minimal at all doses tested (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref> Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1A</xref>). While CD33M interacted with gC1q, there was no interaction of CD33M with C1qCLR, even when higher concentrations were used (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). Thus, C1q may bind CD33 through its globular head, independent of the CLR. Demonstrating C1qâs direct interaction with the CD33C2 domain, concentration dependent associations were observed between whole C1q and the splice variant CD33m expressing a C2-like domain and lacking the V-like region (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Direct binding of gC1q, but not C1qCLR to CD33M was also observed using plasmon resonance (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1B</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Evidence for domain-specific and concentration dependent associations between C1q and CD33 using purified proteins in slot blot assays.

</p>
        <p>To corroborate C1q binding to CD33 on the cell surface and the involvement of C2 domains in the C1q-CD33 interaction, HEK293T cells were transfected with cDNA encoding full length CD33M (~67âkD) or CD33m (~31âkD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Flow cytometry-assisted analysis using CD33 domain-directed antibodies (HIM3â4 mAb specific to a CD33C2 epitope; WM53 mAb specific to a CD33V epitope), along with SDS-PAGE immunoblots, confirmed expression of each protein in transfected cells only (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1C,D</xref>). As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A,B</xref>, C1q bound to CD33m and CD33M transfected HEK293T cells; binding of C1q to mock (control) cDNA transfected or untransfected cells was negligible. Furthermore, cell lysates prepared from transfected cells revealed the capacity of whole C1q to bind cell-associated CD33m and CD33M in concentration dependent fashion (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C,D</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that biologically relevant C1q-CD33 interactions may occur through C1qâs globular head, independent of the CLR and the CD33 sialic acid binding V-like region. As previously reported by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, C1q also bound LAIR-1 in a dose dependent manner (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>C1q binds to CD33M and CD33m isoforms on the cell surface.

        <title>C1q-triggered phosphorylation of CD33 and LAIR-1 ITIM involves C1q-CD33/LAIR-1 partnering in human monocytes</title>
        <p>Next, we established that C1q stimulates phosphorylation of CD33 ITIM in freshly isolated human blood monocytes (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Western blot analyses of proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-CD33 mAb demonstrated that C1q increases basal levels of phosphorylated (p) CD33 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). Whole C1q and gC1q treatment yielded increases in pCD33 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) indicating that CD33 inhibitory signaling may be accomplished via C1qâs globular heads. The higher levels of pCD33 achieved with whole C1q versus gC1q are in line with increased binding sites on the multivalent whole C1q. While CLR induces pLAIR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, it did not increase levels of pCD33 ITIM, as demonstrated in both the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) and phosphoarray (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These findings are consistent with the lack of physical interaction between CLR and CD33 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). C1q treatment increased basal levels of pCD33 (2â5 fold increases C1q versus controls, nââ¥â6) in both the western blot and phosphoarray. Thus, in addition to inducing pLAIR-1, a direct biological effect of C1q on monocyte function may be to activate CD33 inhibitory signaling.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>C1q triggers CD33 ITIM phosphorylation and CD33-LAIR-1 physical associations in human monocytes.

        <p>Indicative of CD33-LAIR-1 associated biological activity, whole C1q induced concurrent phosphorylation of CD33 and LAIR-1 ITIMs in the phospho-immunoreceptor array (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Although activation of CD33 ITIM has been shown to inhibit CD64 (FcÎ³RI) related ITAM activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, it has also been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 is not dependent on CD32a (FcÎ³RIIa) or CD64 ITAM activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In agreement with a lack of CD32a ITAM involvement in pCD33, we noted little or no change in phosphorylation of CD32 after monocytes were treated with C1q (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1E</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to further substantiate associated biological activity we studied whether C1q physically crosslinks CD33 and LAIR-1 in a proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). In this assay, the pairing of complementary DNA sequences (attached to secondary antibody) and subsequent <italic>in situ</italic> amplification of DNA occurs only when CD33 and LAIR-1 are in close proximity (&lt;40ânm). Red fluorescent dots denote co-ligation and the number of dots is strictly proportional to the number of C1q-CD33-LAIR-1 interactions. Monocytes treated with whole C1q and both anti-LAIR-1 and anti-CD33 Abs produced strong fluorescent signals. In contrast, untreated monocytes or monocytes incubated with either anti-LAIR-1 or anti-CD33 Ab alone displayed fewer red fluorescent dots. Furthermore, gC1q and CLR, used alone or in combination, failed to produce a strong fluorescent signal. These results establish that whole C1q acts as a molecular bridge between LAIR-1 and CD33 on the monocyte surface and are consistent with the concept that the globular heads of C1q bind CD33 while its collagen tail engages LAIR-1. They also suggest that simultaneous phosphorylation of CD33 and LAIR-1 ITIM (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>) may be a functional consequence of C1q-facilitated complexing of CD33 and LAIR-1 at the monocyte surface, as hypothesized in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Biological control of C1q/CD33/LAIR-1 processes</title>
        <p>While masking of siglecs, in particular the B cell associated CD22 receptor, by sialic acid has been associated with control of B cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, functional consequences of masking of CD33C2 domains are poorly understood. Detection of the CD33C2 domain, but not the CD33V2 domain, was markedly reduced on THP-1 myelomonocytic cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>). This was in marked contrast to freshly isolated monocytes from healthy individuals where both CD33C2 and CD33V2 were detected on the majority of cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). In agreement with other reports testing CD33C2 domains on U937 leukemic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we found that sialylation interferes with detection of CD33C2 domains on THP-1 cells. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>, sialidase treatment produced significantly increased detection of CD33C2, as revealed with the C2 domain specific HIM3-4 mAb (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>). Given the interaction of C1q with CD33m, we asked whether masking of CD33C2 domains on THP-1 cells would interfere with C1q binding. Whereas only a minority (~20%) of untreated THP-1 cells bound C1q in a dose dependent manner (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3A</xref>), sialidase treatment of THP-1 cells at least doubled the number of cells binding to C1q (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). As previously reported for U937 cells, no difference in detection of CD33V epitopes using WM53 mAb occurred after sialidase treatment (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>). Levels of LAIR-1 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B</xref>) or other putative gC1q receptors (p33; RAGE) were also not altered by sialidase treatment (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3BâD</xref>). Thus, the ability of C1q to bind CD33C2 domains may be specifically compromised by sialylation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Masking of CD33C2 domains impedes C1q binding on the cell surface.

        <title>Patterns of CD33 and LAIR-1 expression are similarly altered on mono-DCs and SLE blood myelomonocytes</title>
        <p>Taking into consideration that levels of membrane-associated sialic acid increase during <italic>in vitro</italic> mono-DC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the elevated sialic acid levels in SLE blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and that a strong pro-inflammatory environment exists in both settings, we investigated patterns of CD33/LAIR-1 expression on mono-DCs and SLE blood myelomonocytes. While the distribution of CD33 on SLE cells and DCs has been studied, to our knowledge, parallel studies comparing detection of CD33C2 and CD33V domains on these cells has not been performed. As previously shown by us and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, LAIR-1 expression was reduced on mono-DCs on day 6 compared to freshly isolated monocytes obtained from healthy subjects (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Nearly absent levels of CD14 signified commitment to the DC lineage (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Corresponding assessment of CD33 expression revealed that detection of CD33C2 domains, but not CD33V2 domains was significantly reduced with DC differentiation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C,D</xref>). Dual label analysis also showed that whereas CD33C2 and CD33V domains are co-detected on the majority of freshly isolated monocytes, detection of CD33C2 domains occurred on only a fraction of CD33V domain positive DCs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E,F</xref>). By day 3, mono-DC differentiation was accompanied by increased surface sialylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Thus, like THP-1 cells, masking of CD33C2 domains by sialic acid may occur on differentiating DCs. In support of this concept, our preliminary studies reveal increased detection of CD33C2 domains after sialidase treatment of immature DCs (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3E</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Maturing DCs exhibit decreases in LAIR-1 and CD14 along with a reduced ability to detect CD33C2 epitopes.

        <p>As reported by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we found circulating SLE myelomonocytes to be lacking in CD14 expression and severely altered in phenotype/morphology (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Analysis of CD33 and LAIR-1 expression on SLE myelomonocytes revealed that detection of CD33C2/V domains and LAIR-1 was reduced compared to healthy monocytes (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Despite decreases related to the CD33V domain, most (&gt;70%) of the cells were still positive (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). The CD33C2 domain was detected on fewer SLE cells and, reminiscent of immature DCs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>), the CD33C2 domain was not detected on many CD33V domain-expressing cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Also consistent with a mono-DC like phenotype we noted decreased levels of CD14 and LAIR-1 in the SLE cohort we studied (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A,B</xref>). Cells co-expressing LAIR-1 and CD33C2 domains were also lacking in SLE (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4C</xref>). Based on the similar patterns of LAIR-1 and CD33C2 domains it is tempting to speculate shared regulatory processes, which, aside from inflammatory cytokines, could be influenced by increased levels of sialic acid. Whether masking of CD33C2 domains or lack of LAIR-1 would interfere with C1qâs ability to suppress myelomonocytes/DCs remains to be demonstrated.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Altered patterns of CD33C2/V and LAIR-1 expression on freshly isolated SLE versus normal blood monocytes.

        <title>M-CSF sustains coupled LAIR-1 and CD33 expression</title>
        <p>In order to gain further insight into the biologic control of LAIR-1 and CD33, we compared in parallel, the LAIR-1/CD33 receptor profile of cells from healthy and SLE subjects cultured for 5 days under anti-inflammatory conditions with M-CSF versus pro-inflammatory conditions using DC growth cytokines (GM-CSFâ+âIL-4) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). As expected for healthy subjects, LAIR-1 expression was reduced in mono-DC cultures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A,B</xref>) versus baseline values on day 0 (~95%, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). In marked contrast, with M-CSF, detection of LAIR-1, CD33C2, and CD33V, and CD14 resembled the high baseline levels found in healthy monocytes (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Detection of CD33V domains did not differ between cells treated with M-CSF or GM-CSFâ+âIL-4. Notably, similar analyses of SLE cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C,D</xref>) also yielded increases in LAIR-1, CD33C2 and CD14 with M-CSF versus mono-DC cytokines. Levels of CD14 achieved with M-CSF resembled the high baseline values noted in healthy subjects. Suggestive of greater resistance to M-CSF effects, levels of CD33C2 in the M-CSF treated SLE cells did not reach the baseline levels observed in healthy monocytes, although they were higher than the GM-CSFâ+âIL-4 treated SLE cells. Thus, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines reduce detection of both LAIR-1 and CD33C2, M-CSF (a prototype anti-inflammatory cytokine normally present in steady state) sustains coordinate expression of LAIR-1 and CD33C2.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Myeloid cytokines distinctly control the coupled expression of CD33C2 and LAIR-1 in healthy and SLE cells.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Growing evidence establishes that C1qâs role in modulating myeloid cell activity includes its ability to prevent unwarranted activation of circulating monocytes and the development of mono-DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Previously, we outlined that the ability of C1q to directly inhibit monocyte activity and mono-DC differentiation occurs via the immunoreceptor LAIR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here, we expand on those findings and substantiate that while C1qâs collagen tail engages LAIR-1, C1qâs globular head will interact with CD33 to promote phosphorylation of CD33 ITIM and a C1q/CD33/LAIR-1 inhibitory complex. Our results are in agreement with others that crosslinking of CD33 at the cell surface triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 ITIMs in myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and to our knowledge, represent the first identification of a natural ligand triggering pCD33.The blocking effects of sialic acid on C1q binding also suggest a process for regulating monocyte activity. Biological control of LAIR-1 and CD33 expression was further indicated by the observation that the anti-inflammatory cytokine M-CSF, but not DC growth factors (GM-CSF/IL-4), sustained CD33/LAIR-1 expression on both healthy and SLE cells. Finally, the lack of LAIR-1 and CD33 expression on circulating SLE myelomonocytes, along with the frequent abnormalities related to C1q in SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, are consistent with the idea that C1q/CD33/LAIR-1 tolerogenic networks are disrupted in SLE.</p>
      <p>Beyond substantiating that C1q-CD33 binding on monocytes promotes phosphorylation of CD33 ITIM, C1qâs ability to interact with CD33m in protein assays and CD33m on the surface of transfected HEK293T cells implies a biological role for CD33C2 domains and the naturally occurring CD33m isoform. Whole C1q and gC1q, but not CLR, interacted with CD33 suggesting direct associations between gC1q and CD33C2 regions. Because CD33m lacks the V domain conferring sialic acid binding specificity, our results show that binding of CD33 to C1q may occur independently of its sialic acid binding domain. Considering that sialic acid is exclusively located in the C1q globular region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> we cannot discount the possibility that interactions between the CD33V regions with sialic acid on gC1q also occur. It is also possible that CD33V domains, by engaging negatively charged sialic acid bearing molecules will recruit the highly positively charged C1q and therefore contribute to the stability of C1q/CD33 complexes on the cell surface.</p>
      <p>Due to its multimeric nature, C1q may serve not only as a molecular bridge between LAIR-1 and CD33 on the cell surface, but also as a signal amplification molecule aimed at securing immune quiescence. Previously, we noted that even though CLR fragments interact with LAIR-1 to activate LAIR-1 ITIM, stronger interactions occur between whole C1q and LAIR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that anchoring C1qâs globular region to the cell surface via CD33 would increase the number of LAIR-1 receptors engaging the multiple collagen repeats available on CLR for enhanced cross-linking and stronger inhibitory action. Also contributing to the enhancement of inhibitory signaling would be the ability of C1qâs globular heads to engage distinct CD33C2 domains on the cell surface. Hypothetical C1q-CD33-LAIR-1 interactions are depicted in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>.</p>
      <p>Others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> studying modulation of cell activation via CD33 and CD22 have demonstrated both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> activation of these receptors. Interestingly, multivalent ligands acting in <italic>trans</italic>, and predicted to displace <italic>cis</italic> interactions involving CD22, lead to suppressed B cell activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In our studies, preliminary findings implied reduced CD14-CD33 <italic>cis</italic> interactions on monocytes after treatment with whole C1q in the PLA (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1F</xref>). Given the multivalent nature of whole C1q and that sialylated gC1q may interact with both CD33C2 and V domains, it is conceivable that binding of C1qâs globular region to CD33 in <italic>trans</italic> may lead to displacement of <italic>cis</italic> interactions between CD33 and CD14 in favor of CD33-LAIR-1 partnering. In any event, because C1q is normally present in the circulation during steady state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and C1q has been demonstrated on the surface of monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, we contemplate that some circulating C1q constitutively binds CD33 to promote steady state tolerogenic activities.</p>
      <p>Whether CD14-CD33 interactions contribute to the constitutive pCD33 activity in human monocytes noted by us (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> still needs to be addressed. It has been reported that <italic>cis</italic> interactions occurring between CD33 and sialylated CD14 prevent LPS-mediated toll- like receptor4 (TLR4) signaling, independently of CD33 ITIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, CD14-CD33 partnering may represent a distinct, complementary process for regulating inflammatory responses. Specifically, while LPS-CD14-CD33 associations would suppress CD14 dependent TLR4 signaling, C1q-CD33-LAIR-1 associations would yield ITIM related inhibition. Further work aimed at understanding these complex regulatory processes in normal and abnormal physiology would involve studying the contribution of LPS-CD14-CD33 and C1q-CD33-LAIR-1 partnering in distinct biological settings. Consideration must be given to the stage of cell differentiation and the contribution of other C1q ligands such as RAGE and CD91 in determining the level of inhibition ultimately achieved.</p>
      <p>Even though CD33 is a major marker on myeloid cells, domain specific functions of CD33 and the role of alternate splice variants of CD33 in normal and abnormal physiology remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In contrast to normal blood monocytes where both CD33C2 and CD33V domains and LAIR-1 were readily detected by antibodies, we observed less binding of CD33C2 domains, but not CD33V domains or LAIR-1, on THP-1 cells. Substantiating that the ability to detect CD33C2 domain-C1q interactions may be compromised by cell surface sialylation, removal of sialic acid on THP-1 cells exposed CD33C2 domains and increased C1q binding. Interestingly in the brain, and in agreement with our findings, C1q binding on the cell surface may be affected by the sialylated state of the cell and even when C1q is available in the extra cellular space, it may not always be engaged on the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Since CD33 is abundantly expressed on microglial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> it is conceivable that masking of CD33C2 domains in the brain influences C1q inhibitory action on microglial cells.</p>
      <p>Consistent with release from C1q inhibitory effects, the expression of LAIR-1 is reduced during the differentiation of mono-DCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We noted that a significantly reduced ability to detect CD33C2, but not CD33V domains was linked to increases in levels of sialic acid in DCs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Our preliminary studies demonstrating increased detection of CD33C2 domains after sialidase treatment of immature DCs (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3E</xref>) are in line with masking of CD33C2 domains by sialic acid. Our findings support the idea that such masking would interfere with C1qâs ability to suppress DC activity. Suggestive that engaging CD33V domains alone does not trigger CD33 ITIM immunomodulatory activity, others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> showed that crosslinking of CD33 on the cell surface using CD33V region directed mAbs (including WM53) does not to inhibit the function of mature DCs, which are highly sialylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, inhibitory TLR signaling occurring as a result of <italic>cis</italic> interactions between CD33 and CD14 do not appear to be the result of pCD33<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Based on these collective observations we advance the idea that CD33 domains on myeloid cells exhibit distinct biological activities; i.e., sialic acid dependent cell interactions via CD33V domains and sialic acid independent interactions, as illustrated by gC1q-CD33C2 binding. Our follow up studies intend to understand the control of these two important functions independently of, and in conjunction with LAIR-1, and, in the context of changes in the C1q receptor profile occurring with cell activation/differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>We anticipate that our studies will help decipher molecular mechanisms contributing to the loss of immune cell quiescence. This includes SLE, which features accelerated monocyte/DC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, along with elevated sialic acid levels and decreased C1q levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Aside from reduced expression of CD33 and LAIR-1, C1q-mediated LAIR-1/CD33 inhibitory activity may be compromised by auto-antibodies directed either to gC1q and/or CLR, both of which have been described in SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Because LAIR-1 is also abnormally distributed on B cells and plasmacytoid DCs in SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, abnormal C1q function in SLE may be linked to impaired LAIR-1 expression on these cell lineages, independent of CD33.</p>
      <p>In strong contrast to GM-CSFâ+âIL4, M-CSF sustained the expression of CD14, LAIR-1, and unmasked CD33C2 domains. Both healthy and SLE cells responded to the effects of M-CSF, indicating a degree of plasticity in the SLE cells and that achievement of a ânormalizedâ inhibitory immunoreceptor profile is possible. While our results demonstrate that coordinate control of LAIR-1 and CD33 expression is possible via M-CSF and mono-DC growth factors, further work is required to address how this may operate in distinct physiological settings.</p>

Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4â12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (Upstate bioscience Inc.) or anti-CD33 Ab. Bands were detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (LI-COR) to detect secondary Abs conjugated with Infrared 680 or 800. In the phosphoarray, isolated monocytes (4âÃâ10<sup>6</sup>) were placed in serum-free media and treated as above. For <strike>s</strike>imultaneously detecting the relative phosphorylation levels of immunoreceptors, cell lysates were incubated on human phospho-immunoreceptor array membranes as detailed by the supplier (Proteome Profiler # ARY004B; R&amp;D Systems).
