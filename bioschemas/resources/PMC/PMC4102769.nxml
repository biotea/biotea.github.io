      <abstract>
        <p>The exosome is a multi-protein complex, required for the degradation of AU-rich element (ARE) containing messenger RNAs (mRNAs). EXOSC8 is an essential protein of the exosome core, as its depletion causes a severe growth defect in yeast. Here we show that homozygous missense mutations in <italic>EXOSC8</italic> cause progressive and lethal neurological disease in 22 infants from three independent pedigrees. Affected individuals have cerebellar and corpus callosum hypoplasia, abnormal myelination of the central nervous system or spinal motor neuron disease. Experimental downregulation of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> in human oligodendroglia cells and in zebrafish induce a specific increase in ARE mRNAs encoding myelin proteins, showing that the imbalanced supply of myelin proteins causes the disruption of myelin, and explaining the clinical presentation. These findings show the central role of the exosomal pathway in neurodegenerative disease.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is an important regulatory step, which controls gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3â²-untranslated regions. Rapid degradation of ARE-containing RNAs is performed by a multi-protein complex, the exosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The versatility and specificity of the exosome regulate the activity and maintain the fidelity of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Both in yeast and humans, nine proteins organize the âexosome coreâ in a two-layered ring. The central hexamer channel is composed by six subunits (Rrp41p/EXOSC4, Rrp46p/EXOSC5, Rrp45p/PM/Scl-75/EXOSC9, Rrp42p/EXOSC7, Mtr3/EXOSC6 and Rrp43p/Oip2/EXOSC8), while the cap consists of three proteins (Rrp4/EXOSC2, Rrp40/EXOSC3 and Csl4/SOCS4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The exosome degrades RNA starting at the 3â²-end by an exoribonucleolytic function and it also has an endoribonucleolytic function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The catalytic activity of the exosome core is provided through the association with other proteins (RRP44/DIS3, RRP6/PM/Scl-100/EXOSC10 ribonucleases)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. ARE recognition requires ARE-binding proteins that interact with the exosome for recruitment, thereby promoting the rapid degradation of target RNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>The human exosome also regulates gene expression via diverse RNA processing reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Many cellular RNAs that play key roles in important cellular processes such as translation (ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs) and mRNA splicing (small nuclear RNAs) are produced as precursor molecules that are trimmed from their 3â²-ends by the human exosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This complex organization of the exosome provides the versatility needed to cope with the huge variety of RNA substrates in the cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses are technically challenging and many questions remain unresolved.</p>
    <p>Here we report that deficiency of a core component of the human exosome leads to severe infantile overlap phenotype of psychomotor deficit, cerebellar and corpus callosum hypoplasia, hypomyelination and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).</p>

        <title>Clinical presentation in 22 patients from three pedigrees</title>
        <p>First we studied a large Hungarian family of Roma ethnic origin, where 18 children presented between 2â4 months of age with failure to thrive, severe muscle weakness, spasticity and psychomotor retardation. Vision and hearing were impaired in all patients and deterioration was usually triggered by inter-current infections. All affected children died of respiratory failure before 20 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Detailed diagnostic workup excluded known metabolic, neurodegenerative and common genetic disorders. Electrophysiology was performed in one patient only (P1-V:10) and was not conclusive. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed variable abnormalities including vermis hypoplasia, immature myelination, cortical atrophy and thin corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p><italic>EXOSC8</italic> mutations were also identified in two additional patients from an independent Hungarian Roma family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>) and in two affected siblings from a consanguineous ArabâPalestinian family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The clinical presentation of the additional patients was compatible with a progressive, infantile onset neurological disease, presenting with severe muscle weakness, respiratory problems, developmental delay and early death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Vermis hypoplasia was more prominent in the third pedigree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>), while immature myelination was reported in pedigree 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Weakness in P3 was proximal more than distal with attendant tongue fasciculations. Motor neuronopathy was noted on electrophysiological examination in P3-II:1.</p>
        <p>Muscle biopsy in patient P1-V:10 at 5 months of age detected variations in fibre size and increased subsarcolemmal nuclei, but no signs of SMA. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) negative fibres were noted on histochemical staining and activities of respiratory chain complexes I and IV were moderately decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>).

        <p>Autopsy in eight patients detected profound lack of myelin in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter and in the spinal cord, predominantly affecting the descending lateral fibre tracts, while myelination was normal in the peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2aân</xref>). The lack of myelin in the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,n</xref>) was similarly severe as observed in a patient with PelizaeusâMerzbacher disease (PMD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2m</xref>).

        <p>Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix) in six affected family members of the first pedigree revealed two broad regions of homozygosity on chromosome 13 (36212278â37767059, bp, size: ~1.55âMb; and 43243791-44640995, bp, size: 1.4âMb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Exome sequencing in genomic DNA of two patients (P1-V:10, P1-V:29) identified seven shared rare (major allele frequency &lt;0.01) homozygous protein altering variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), but only one, the c.815G&gt;C, p.Ser272Thr mutation in <italic>EXOSC8</italic> (Gene ID:11340, NC_000013.10, mRNA:NM_181503.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>) was located in the larger ~1.55âMb homozygous region. This mutation affects a conserved amino acid and resulted in significantly decreased EXOSC8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3eâg</xref>), and no other variants were found in complementary DNA (cDNA) of <italic>EXOSC8</italic>. The location of the mutation implies that it may affect the opening of the RNA channel within the exosome, where funneling of RNAs takes place in single-stranded conformation by an unwinding pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). This mutation segregated with the disease in 19 individuals within the family (8 affected: homozygous; 11 unaffected: heterozygous or wild type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The same homozygous mutation was identified in two siblings with an identical clinical presentation from a second Hungarian Roma family (pedigree 2) from the same region. None of the other six homozygous mutations detected by exome sequencing of the index patients in pedigree 1 were homozygous in the patients in pedigree 2, thus excluding the possibility that these other mutations were causing the disease.</p>
        <p>To estimate the frequency of this mutation in Roma population, mutation testing was carried out in 63 anonymized Roma controls from Bulgaria, of whom 33 were homozygous for an identical 229522, bp chromosome 13q13.1 haplotype (rs582091 to rs7327020) around c.815G&gt;C, p.Ser272Thr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).

        <p>A different missense mutation, c.5C&gt;T, p.Ala2Val was identified on exome sequencing in two affected siblings of a consanguineous Palestinian family (pedigree 3) with SMA, cerebellar and corpus callosum hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Homozygosity mapping in this pedigree resulted in the identification of three disease-linked genomic regions, one of them was an 8.4âMb spanning chr13:31642481-40039652 (Hg19) (rs7996548 to rs12873765). Exome sequencing in genomic DNA of P3:II-3 identified four shared rare (minor allele frequency&lt;0.01) homozygous protein altering variants but only one of them affected an evolutionary conserved residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This variant, c.5C&gt;T, p.Ala2Val (chr13: 37574947 C&gt;T) in the <italic>EXOSC8</italic> gene segregated with the disease in the family, was not present in dbSNP138 and was also absent from the 6503 exome analyses available at the Exome Variant Server, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA, USA (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>) (accessed on 26 January 2014) and in fibroblasts of the patient, immunoblotting detected severely decreased EXOSC8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The c.5C&gt;T mutation in the second codon of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> might therefore either interfere with the Kozak consensus sequence and/or cause mRNA instability probably through interference with the 5â² mRNA capping mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

        <p><italic>RRP43</italic>, the yeast ortholog of the human <italic>EXOSC8</italic> has a low degree of conservation with the human gene, lacking the C-terminal region, where the human mutation p.Ser272Thr is located. Based on the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in patient V:10 we investigated whether a defect in the yeast ortholog of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> affects mitochondrial function. We took advantage of a promoter-shutoff <italic>tetRRP43</italic> strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Wild-type and <italic>tetRRP43</italic> cells were grown on non-fermentable carbon sources in the presence/absence of doxycycline 0.125âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup>. Treatment with doxycycline caused a strong growth reduction on glucose of <italic>tetRRP43</italic> while only a slight reduction on glycerol suggesting that <italic>RRP43</italic> downregulation does not primarily affect oxidative phosphorylation capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We speculate that in the presence of glycerol, that slows cell growth and metabolic rate, the exosome complex is able to maintain a basal RNA abundance, despite the downregulation of <italic>tetRRP43</italic>. Furthermore, the reduced <italic>RRP43</italic> gene expression caused significantly decreased respiration that was paralleled by a decreased amount of mitochondrial cytochromes compared with wild type, although their structural integrity was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). No difference in mitochondrial translation rate was observed between wildtype and <italic>tetRRP43</italic> mutant in the presence/absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) suggesting that reduced expression of <italic>RRP43/EXOSC8</italic> may have a secondary effect on mitochondrial function, possibly due to disturbed mRNA processing of mitochondrial genes containing ARE elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>

        <p>After the exclusion of a primary mitochondrial phenotype in RRP43 depleted yeast we studied the possible mRNA targets of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> in human cells. <italic>EXOSC8</italic> encodes a 3â²â5â² exoribonuclease that specifically interacts with ARE-containing mRNAs suggesting that a defect in this protein might specifically alter degradation of ARE mRNAs. Based on the clinical presentation of predominant white matter abnormalities, cerebellar and corpus callosum hypoplasia, SMA and mitochondrial dysfunction in our patients we searched the ARE Database (ARED, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED/">http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED/</ext-link> ) with keywords âmyelinâ, âataxiaâ, âspinal motor neuronâ and âmitochondrialâ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). We studied mRNA levels of 18 selected ARE-containing and 16 non-ARE-containing genes in myoblasts and fibroblasts of our patients and in human control cells and oligodendroglia cells (MO3.13) before and after small-interferring RNA (siRNA) downregulation of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). EXOSC8-deficient patient myoblasts (P1-V:10) revealed a significant 2.99-fold increase (<italic>P</italic>=0.0055) in <italic>MBP</italic> gene expression compared with control human myoblasts (average of three different control cell lines), while the expression of the other selected genes did not show a significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). <italic>EXOSC8</italic> downregulation in myoblasts significantly increased expression of two ARE-containing myelin-related genes: <italic>MBP</italic> (&gt;6.5-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0167) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (<italic>MOBP</italic> &gt;8.5-fold, <italic>P</italic>=0.0158, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). However, no significant change was detected in mRNA levels of any of the other tested AU-rich and non-AU-rich genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Based on the selective effect of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> downregulation on oligodendroglia-related genes, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis has been performed in <italic>EXOSC8</italic> downregulated human MO3.13 oligodendroglia cells (kind gift of Prof. Nalbantoglu, McGill).

        <title>Morpholino knock down of <italic>exosc8</italic> in zebrafish</title>
        <p>To study the link between reduced EXOSC8 and the human disease we established a zebrafish model for EXOSC8 deficiency. Zebrafish has previously been used to model human demyelination and pontocerebellar dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. We selected two different antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) to downregulate the zebrafish <italic>exosc8</italic> gene (Gene ID:323016, mRNA:NM_001002865, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>) in embryos from the golden strain and from the islet-1-green fluroscent protein (GFP) transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(islet-1:GFP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Confirming the efficiency of the splice-blocking <italic>exosc8</italic> MO, RT-PCR indicated the loss of wild-type <italic>exosc8</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In support of the phenotype caused by the splice-blocking <italic>exosc8</italic> MO, we detected similar changes by using the second translation-blocking <italic>exosc8</italic> MO in zebrafish. Knock down of <italic>exosc8</italic> in zebrafish embryos resulted in a set of phenotypes ranging from mildly to severely abnormal external morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,c</xref>). Swimming abilities and touch-evoked escape response at 48âh post fertilization (hpf) were impaired even in embryos with a mild phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary videos</xref>). Importantly, downregulation of <italic>exosc8</italic> led to abnormal brain development in islet-1-GFP transgenic zebrafish, which express GFP in the motor neurons of the hindbrain. The degree of brain abnormality correlated with the increased severity of morphant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>), suggesting that Exosc8 is essential for brain development in zebrafish. Although the recapitulation of an identical phenotype with translation-blocking MO is in support of a specific effect in our experiments, to exclude an off-target effect we introduced co-injection of <italic>p53</italic> MO to block off-target cell death.</p>
        <p>We performed several attempts to rescue the phenotype of MO-treated zebrafish with different doses of wild-type human <italic>EXOSC8</italic> mRNA. We observed a dose-dependent toxic reaction after addition of the wild-type <italic>EXOSC8</italic> mRNA to MO-treated zebrafish. The reason behind the toxicity may be that an imbalanced supply of the different exosomal proteins may have deleterious effect on the function of the exosome, as comparative assessment of protein abundance and localization in living cells showed, that EXOSC8 and EXOSC9 are present in a 1:1 stoichiometry within the complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
        <p>Similar to the studies performed in human cells, we analyzed AU-rich mRNAs encoding myelin proteins in <italic>exosc8</italic> morphants and control zebrafish embryos. Similar to the results in human oligodendrocytes and myoblasts, <italic>mbp</italic> mRNA increased initially (16 hpf) in <italic>exosc8</italic> morphants, but decreased at later timepoints (48 hpf), especially in morphants with severe phenotype, most likely due to the loss of neuronal structures and surrounding oligodendroglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and the ZFIN database detected expression of <italic>mbp</italic> by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization during early somitogenesis at about 11 hpf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-fxfigureview.apg&amp;OID=ZDB-FIG-050630-1515">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-fxfigureview.apg&amp;OID=ZDB-FIG-050630-1515</ext-link>), and <italic>exosc8</italic> expression at the 14â19 somite stage around 16 hpf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-fxallfigures.apg&amp;OID=ZDB-PUB-040907-1&amp;fxallfig_probe_zdb_id=ZDB-EST-080225-97">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-fxallfigures.apg&amp;OID=ZDB-PUB-040907-1&amp;fxallfig_probe_zdb_id=ZDB-EST-080225-97</ext-link>). We did not study expression of the zebrafish <italic>smn1</italic> gene, because in contrast to the human <italic>SMN1</italic> zebrafish <italic>smn1</italic> is not ARE.</p>
        <p>We also performed whole-mount immunohistochemistry in zebrafish larvae after <italic>exosc8</italic> MO injection with an antibody against the zebrafish MBP (kind gift of Prof. Talbot, Stanford). In un-injected embryos, MBP expression at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) was observed in the ventral hindbrain, spinal cord, along motor axons exiting the spinal cord and the lateral line. In <italic>exosc8</italic> morphants the MBP signal on motor axons in somites, on the posterior lateral line and in the head was missing or interrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We also performed combinatorial labelling (BrainStain Imaging Kit, Molecular Probes) including FluoroMyelin Green stain, which works via the high lipid content of myelin and provided further evidence, independent from immunostaining with MBP, that myelination is primarily impaired in <italic>exosc8</italic> MO downregulated zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). As a final proof of a defective myelination, electron microscopy (EM) on <italic>exosc8</italic> MO-treated zebrafish revealed a clear defect in myelination at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Simultaneous MO knock down of zebrafish <italic>mbpa</italic> (gene ID: 326281, NC_007130.5) and <italic>exosc8</italic> was performed to explore whether the phenotype of <italic>exosc8</italic> downregulated zebrafish embryos can be rescued by knocking down <italic>mbp</italic>, which is originally increased in <italic>exosc8</italic> downregulated zebrafish. Survival rate of MO injected zebrafish embryos was better in the simultaneous <italic>mbpa, exosc8</italic> knockdown group (73.6%) compared with embryos treated with <italic>exosc8</italic> MO only (53.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Furthermore, in embryos with severe phenotype the pattern of midbrain and hindbrain nuclei was slightly more preserved in simultaneous <italic>mbpa, exosc8</italic> MO-treated embryos compared with zebrafish treated with <italic>exosc8</italic> MO only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the neuronal defect caused by <italic>exosc8</italic> downregulation primarily impairs myelination by affecting the regulation of <italic>mbp</italic> genes. Furthermore, we show that additional knock down of <italic>mbp</italic> improved the survival rate and brain structure of <italic>exosc8</italic> MO downregulated zebrafish, suggesting that the original increase of <italic>mbp</italic> expression may trigger downstream events resulting in loss of MBP and impaired myelination in zebrafish.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The first human disease linked to an integral exosome component was EXOSC3 deficiency, which has been identified in pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) and spinal motor neuron disease (PCH1, MIM 607596)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A broader clinical spectrum was recently suggested in patients with <italic>EXOSC3</italic> mutations including isolated cerebellar hypoplasia and spinal anterior horn involvement or intellectual disability, early-onset spasticity and cerebellar atrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. A severe form of PCH1 has been reported among Czech Roma due to a founder mutation in <italic>EXOSC3</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p>
      <p>We discovered pathogenic mutations in the exosomal protein gene <italic>EXOSC8</italic> in 22 patients with profound infantile neurodegenerative disease combining features of cerebellar and corpus callosum hypoplasia, hypomyelination and SMA. The similar disease spectrum caused by the defect of a different exosome protein suggest that impaired mRNA metabolism due to exosome dysfunction is the major common pathomechanism. However, while <italic>EXOSC3</italic> mutations affect mostly spinal motor neurons and Purkinje cells, oligodendroglia cells are also targets of mutations in <italic>EXOSC8.</italic> It is possible that different exosome components affecting different ARE mRNAs, potentially based on their length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, or mRNA metabolism may have neuronal cell-type specific differences, potentially influenced by the type or localization of the exosome defect. However, both studies clearly suggest the major role of ARE mRNA metabolism in this complex neurodegenerative disease.</p>
      <p>In support of a close interaction between EXOSC8 and EXOSC3 within the exosome, reduced EXOSC3 protein levels were detected in our patients carrying <italic>EXOSC8</italic> mutations, and also in control cells after siRNA downregulation of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Both peripheral and central myelination requires an exact ratio of several myelin proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Central nervous system myelin is a multi-layered membrane sheath generated by oligodendrocytes for rapid impulse propagation. It has been recently shown that new myelin membranes are incorporated adjacent to the axon, and simultaneously, newly formed layers extend laterally, leading to the formation of a set of closely apposed paranodal loops<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. This model can explain the assembly of myelin as a multi-layered structure, where increased amount of MBP, a peripheral membrane protein, may result in premature compaction and may block myelin growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> or compaction at aberrant locations, which could also be toxic for myelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Duplication of <italic>PLP1</italic> is a frequent cause of PMD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and a similar gene dosage effect of <italic>PMP22</italic> is responsible for the demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. A link between ARE mRNA decay and demyelination is further supported by the progressive leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the AU-specific RNA binding protein (AUH)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>
      <p>We suggest that increased mRNA levels of ARE-containing myelin proteins (MBP, MOBP) resulting from <italic>EXOSC8</italic> deficiency initiate a cascade of downstream events, and the disturbed balance between ARE and non-ARE myelin components results in demyelinating disease. Ultimately, the loss of oligodendroglia cells leads to a secondary decrease of myelin proteins, as shown in exosc8 MO injected zebrafish, where an initial increase, followed by a secondary decrease of myelin proteins resulted in defective myelination.</p>
      <p>The genetic causes of isolated PCH are autosomal recessive mutations in genes involved in transfer RNA splicing and processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Splicing of the pre-mRNAs by the spliceosome depend on small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, which require Spinal Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) protein for their assembly and defect of SMN1 results in SMA, a leading cause of infantile mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The exact mechanisms behind the strict cell-type specific effect of these factors involved in RNA metabolism are still unclear; however, it is possible that some clinical presentations of <italic>EXOSC8</italic> and <italic>EXOSC3</italic> mutations, and potentially other human exosome related diseases, are due to abnormal RNA splicing.</p>
      <p>In summary, patients with <italic>EXOSC8</italic> mutations present with a characteristic spectrum of overlapping phenotypes of infantile onset hypomyelination, cerebellar hypoplasia and SMA. The clinical presentation may depend on the type and localization of mutations and provides a clue to unravel the complex molecular pathways caused by the defective exosome function.</p>
