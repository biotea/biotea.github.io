      <abstract>
        <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is characterized by degeneration of the retinal photoreceptors and is the leading cause of inherited blindness worldwide. Although few genes are known to cause autosomal recessive RP (arRP), a large proportion of disease-causing genes remain to be revealed. Here we report the identification of <italic>SLC7A14</italic>, a potential cationic transporter, as a novel gene linked to arRP. Using exome sequencing and direct screening of 248 unrelated patients with arRP, we find that mutations in the <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene account for 2% of cases of arRP. We further demonstrate that <italic>SLC7A14</italic> is specifically expressed in the photoreceptor layer of the mammalian retina and its expression increases during postnatal retinal development. In zebrafish, downregulation of <italic>slc7a14</italic> expression leads to an abnormal eye phenotype and defective light-induced locomotor response. Furthermore, targeted knockout of <italic>Slc7a14</italic> in mice results in retinal degeneration with abnormal ERG response. This suggests that SLC7A14 has an important role in retinal development and visual function.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders with a series of symptoms including night blindness and progressive tunnel vision that eventually lead to blindness. The disease invariably involves death or dysfunction of rod photoreceptors and is caused by defects in several different molecular pathways. To date, almost 3,000 mutations in more than 56 disease-causing genes are known to be associated with nonsyndromic RP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Despite the identification of an increasing number of disease-causing genes, a large proportion of patients with autosomal recessive RP (arRP) lack a genetic predisposition due to a mutation in one or more of the 36 known genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. To gain further understanding of the genetics of arRP, we focused on patients who did not carry a defined genetic mutation in any of the previously reported genes. In one such kindred, the proband from a consanguineous family had severe early-onset RP.</p>
    <p>Here we perform targeted exome-capture sequencing of known genes to reveal the underlying genetic defect, but fail to identify any pathological mutations. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identify a homozygous missense mutation in a cationic amino acid transporter gene, <italic>SLC7A14</italic>. Further, screening of this gene in 247 patients with arRP identifies an additional four unrelated patients with different mutations in the <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene. These mutations are absent from a database generated by exome sequencing of DNA from 300 in-house patients. <italic>Slc7a14</italic> expression increases over the course of retinal development and remains abundant in the mature retina. Knockdown of <italic>slc7a14</italic> in zebrafish causes a significant phenotype in the eye and an abnormal photomotor response. Furthermore, <italic>Slc7a14</italic>-knockout mice are generated, and they demonstrated structural and functional abnormalities in the retina. Our findings identify a new disease gene underlying arRP and provide insight into <italic>SLC7A14</italic> dysfunction in human retinal degeneration.</p>

        <title>Patients with early-onset RP</title>
        <p>In a first-cousin consanguineous family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), a patient with sporadic RP had night blindness and a visual field defect, both of which first appeared during childhood. Visual acuity in both eyes had progressively decreased to hand motion only by the age of 35. Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a typical intraretinal bone spicule pigmentation, large spots of retinal atrophy and overall thinning of the outer retinal layer, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Electroretinogram (ERG) responses were extinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The patientâs parents and other relatives were unaffected. The severely affected structure and function of the retina support the clinical diagnosis of arRP.</p>

        <title>Mutational screening of known RP-related genes</title>
        <p>To reveal the underlying genetic defect in this patient, we initially screened 144 genes that are known to be related to RP by using our established targeted exome-sequencing approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. No pathological mutations were found in any of these known genes.</p>
      </sec>

        <title>Exome-sequencing detects a missense variant in <italic>SLC7A14</italic></title>
        <p>Because we did not identify mutations in any known RP-related genes, we performed whole-exome sequencing with the Nimblegen solid-phase array capture system and a Solexa HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The average sequencing depth and coverage of our analysis were 60.73% and 98.5%, respectively. The percentage of genes with &gt;20 reads was 81.0%. A total of 20,652 small insertions and deletions (InDels) were identified by the GATK programme. Among them, 58 were selected through filtering with the 1k and HapMap databases. Further validation by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis led to rejection of all of these InDels as the disease-causing mutation. Using the SOAPsnp programme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, we identified 10839 nonsynonymous variants. Among them, 3161 were selected by excluding those with a MAF &gt;0.05. All SNPs were deposited in the HapMap 28 and 1000 Genomes Project databases. Computational prediction (Polyphen and SIFT) further excluded 2653 nonpathological SNPs and 508 variants were remained. As the affected probands in a consanguineous inbred family are likely to have two recessive disease alleles inherited from a common ancestor (that is, identical-by-descent), we focused on identifying homozygous mutations from our sequencing data. In this family, a total of 15 homozygous variants were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We performed the homozygosity analysis and our results demonstrated that the p.G330R change was inside a 3.1âMB homozygous region (chr3: 168802626-171969076). A total of 594 homozygous regions over 1âMb were present and only six homozygous variants were inside the homozygous regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Among them, two variants were excluded by co-segregation analysis in the family. The other three variants could also been excluded through gene expression pattern and reported diseases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). As a result, the homozygosity analysis suggested a homozygous missense variant, c.988G&gt;A (p.G330R), in exon 5 of the <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene (3q26.2) encoding the solute carrier family 7 (orphan transporter), member <italic>14</italic> as the possible genetic mutation underlying the disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The mutation, which was validated by Sanger sequencing, is located in a codon for a highly conserved amino acid residue. In addition, it co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This finding suggests that it is a candidate mutation.</p>

        <title>Mutational screening in additional arRP cohorts</title>
        <p>To examine the mutation frequency of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> in arRP, we screened a total of 247 unrelated patients with arRP. We identified four additional patients with arRP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) who had homozygous or compound heterozygous <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) co-segregated in each family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These mutations were predicted to alterations of highly conserved amino acids between different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). These patients were comprehensively screened by targeted exome sequencing of known RP-related genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and no additional mutations were identified; the absence of additional mutations supports the hypothesis that mutations in <italic>SLC7A14</italic> are the cause of RP. We also identified 12 patients with a single heterozygous variant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>), which computational analysis determined to be pathological and which were absent from an in-house whole-exome dataset that was obtained from 300 unrelated individuals. In one (W52-1) of these patients, a definitive mutation in <italic>RP1</italic> gene (c.3469_3476del8bp) was identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). Another two probands had mutations successfully identified in the <italic>EYS</italic> and <italic>BEST1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). No copy-number variation of this gene was found by real-time PCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> in these patients with a heterozygous variant, consisting with the registered results in the Database of Genomic Variants (projects.tcag.ca/variation/). We speculated that these 12 additional probands carrying single heterozygous variants are not caused by the <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutation. With the exception of c.395C&gt;T and c.1172C&gt;T, all of the identified mutations were predicted to cause alterations of amino acid residues located in the extracellular or cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Notably, two mutations, c.988G&gt;A and c.1391G&gt;T, were found in 10 and 4 cases, respectively. Thus, these may be common mutations in the Chinese population. Collectively, these results serve as further evidence that mutations in <italic>SLC7A14</italic> are pathogenic and indicate that the frequency of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations in Chinese patients with arRP is 2.0% (5 of 248 cases).</p>

        <title>Gene expression analysis</title>
        <p>The <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene contains seven coding exons (2316 nucleotides) and encodes a protein, cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system, with 771 amino acids. Its function remains largely unknown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We investigated the expression profile in mouse tissues and found a high expression of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> in both the brain and eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Furthermore, this gene is expressed as early as embryonic stage E18.5 and its expression increased during postnatal development of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). An immunohistological study of the mouse retinas detected specific Slc7a14 expression in the inner nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). This expression pattern is consistent with a potential disease-causing role of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations in RP.</p>

        <title>The G330R mutation led to Slc7a14 dislocation</title>
        <p>To examine whether the identified missense mutation, p.G330R, affects Slc7a14 localization, we constructed a plasmid with the Slc7a14 missense mutation which was expressed in 293D cells. Immunocytochemistry revealed that wild-type Slc7a14 overlapped with the lysosome marker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, LysoTracker, whereas G330R-expressing cells showed a diffuse pattern of Slc7a14 expression throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). To test the arginine transport function, we performed an arginin transporting assay. Expression plasmid of either the wild-type or mutant Slc7a14 with G418 resistance was constructed and then transfected into photoreceptor cells (661W cell line). L-[3H]arginine transport assay show that photoreceptor cells with or without the G330R mutation in the <italic>Slc7a14</italic> gene have the least concentration of transported L-[3H]arginine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) comparing with previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. A possible explanation might be that endogenous Slc7a14 remained in the G418-selected cells exert transport function. The results collectively suggested that the <italic>Slc7a14</italic> missense mutation prevented the protein from localizing to the lysosome, where it would normally be degraded, which could contribute to the pathogenicity of the G330R mutation in the <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of <italic>Slc7a14</italic> in zebrafish</title>
        <p>To test our hypothesis that disruption of the <italic>slc7a14</italic> gene can lead to visual dysfunction, we developed a zebrafish model of <italic>slc7a14</italic> knockdown. Morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) targeting the splice sites of the <italic>slc7a14</italic> gene and a fluoresceinated standard control MO (Gene-Tools, LLC, Corvallis, OR) were microinjected into embryos at the one- to two-cell stage. The fluoresceins were observed after injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) and RTâPCR verified the alteration in splicing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5b, 9</xref>). Injection of the <italic>slc7a14</italic>-MO led to abnormal phenotypes in 46.9% of fish (total number of examined fish is 130). These phenotypes included smaller eyes (39.2%) and severe malformations (body disfigurement; 7.7%), whereas a normal phenotype was observed in 95.4% of fish (<italic>n</italic>=108) injected with the control MO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). We did not observe significant retinal structural change in the 5dpf <italic>slc7a14</italic>-MO zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). This finding suggests that knockdown of <italic>slc7a14</italic> in zebrafish results in a significantly abnormal phenotype. Compared with the larvae that were injected with the control MO, larvae injected with the slc7a14-MO displayed an eye phenotype of significantly smaller eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). To determine the effect of <italic>slc7a14</italic> knockdown on visual function, we assessed the swimming response of 5dpf larvae to sudden light-to-dark transitions by using a previously established light-induced locomotor response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> in conjunction with a ZebraBox behaviour monitoring station. The behavioural testing demonstrated that zebrafish larvae with reduced levels of <italic>slc7a14</italic> exhibited an aberrant locomotor response during the light-ON phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The aberrant behaviour was significantly different from the normal behaviour (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>N</italic>=10, Dunnett test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). These findings strongly indicate that <italic>Slc7a14</italic> has an important role in photoreceptor development and function and that its dysfunction can lead to visual impairment.</p>

        <title>Generation and characterization of <italic>Slc7a14</italic>-deficient mice</title>
        <p>The TALEN-mediated gene knockout approach was performed to induce targeted <italic>Slc7a14</italic> gene disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). TALEN repeats were designed to bind the exon 2 of the <italic>Slc7a14</italic> gene. The repeats were fused with FokI restriction endonuclease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. After transfection of the TALEN constructs into the C6 cell line (No. TCR 1, SIBS Cell Bank, Shanghai, China), TALEN expression and activity were verified through western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 7a, 9</xref>) and MSDase assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 7b, 9</xref>), respectively. <italic>In vitro</italic>-transcribed mRNA was microinjected into the pronuclei of C57BL/6 mice zygotes (<italic>n</italic>=141). Among the 12 founder mice with <italic>Slc7a14</italic> mutations, three mice were selected for further characterization because they had 10âbp-deletions in both alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>), which introduced an earlier stop codon and led to Slc7a14 protein truncation. We found that the <italic>Slc7a14</italic>-deficient mice were viable, fertile and did not show noticeable physical abnormalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>).</p>
        <p>A series of examinations, including electroretinography (ERG), OCT and retinal immunohistochemistry, were performed to test the visual function and to evaluate the retinal anatomy of the mice. ERG, an objective assessment of retinal function, showed that the ERG response was abnormal in the <italic>Slc7a14</italic>-deficient mice aged 2-months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and 6-months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In addition, we use high-resolution OCT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining to investigate the retinal layer structure of the 2.5-month-old mice. The OCT results showed a trend of reduced thickness of the outer retina in the knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>), whereas the result of HE staining also indicates a slightly thinner retinal layer in the 2.5-month-old KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Collectively, these data demonstrate that the ablation of Slc7a14 protein in mice leads to retinal degeneration. This degeneration recapitulates the disease phenotype in the arRP patients with <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Pedigree-based genetic mapping has facilitated the discovery of many disease-causing genes. To date, 56 disease genes have been identified for nonsyndromic RP, including 23 for autosomal dominant RP (adRP), 36 for arRP (including six overlapping genes) and three for X-linked RP. Despite this progress, the genetic defect of more than half of the patients with arRP remains unknown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> as it has been challengeable to screen all causative genes synchronously. Next-generation sequencing technologies employing high-throughput exomic screening have proven to be powerful tools for discovering new disease-related genes for RP and allied diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our study has further demonstrated the robustness of this approach: the use of exome sequencing allowed us to determine that <italic>SLC7A14</italic> is a novel causative gene in a small RP pedigree.</p>
      <p>In this study, a homozygous mutation in the <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene (c.988G&gt;A; MAF 0.005 in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database) was identified in the proband patient and the heterozygous mutation was confirmed in the patientâs parents. By screening additional families with arRP, we identified unique homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in <italic>SLC7A14</italic> in four unrelated patients. The <italic>SLC7A14</italic> gene may contain hot spots for genetic mutation, because two mutations, c.988G&gt;A and c.1391G&gt;T, were frequently seen in the patients. Our results also demonstrate that <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations are causative for arRP in 2.0% of the Chinese patients with this disease. Such a high percentage indicates that molecular diagnosis of patients with arRP should include mutational screening of <italic>SLC7A14</italic>.</p>
      <p>The identification of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> as an RP-causing gene raises an intriguing question as to how mutations in an orphan transporter gene that is expressed in the retina and throughout the central nervous system can lead to a retina-specific phenotype. This gene encodes an orphan transporter protein that has not been reported to be related to any other disease. Our study is the first to link <italic>SLC7A14</italic> to retinal disease in humans. Previously, Jaenecke <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> determined that SLC7A14 is localized to the lysosomal membrane and hypothesized that it might mediate transport of cationic amino acids across the lysosomal membrane. SLC7A14 was also shown to inhibit the ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, which is essential for normal development of the eye<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations may lead to retinal degeneration via phosphatase-1 protein disinhibition. The exact role of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> in photoreceptor cells remains to be elucidated and this topic warrants further investigation. In the present study, we generated the <italic>Slc7a14</italic>-deficient mouse model, which would be very useful for elucidation of molecular mechanism as well as therapeutic intervention.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that recurrent <italic>SLC7A14</italic> mutations were identified in cases of arRP. Our results indicate that the mutation frequency of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> in the population of Chinese patients with arRP is 2.0% (five independent cases among 248). Our functional characterization also supports the hypothesis that <italic>SLC7A14</italic> is a new causative gene of arRP and provides new insights into the transporter-related disease mechanisms underlying RP. Therefore, mutational screening of <italic>SLC7A14</italic> should be considered for patients with arRP to ensure proper molecular diagnosis.</p>

        <p>A total of 144 RP-targeted genes were captured and enriched as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In family W60, the proband patient, his unaffected sister and his parents were recruited to submit DNA for whole-exome sequencing. The DNA was first quantified with a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermal Fisher Scientific, DE, USA). A minimum of 3âÎ¼g of DNA was used to make the indexed Illumina libraries in accordance with the manufacturerâs protocol. The whole-exome region of the library was enriched by using the Exome Enrichment V5 Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA) in accordance with the protocol that was provided with the kit. Both the targeted and the whole-exome-enriched library were sequenced by using paired-end 100âbp reads and a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina, USA).</p>

        <p>For the quality control of raw data, we filtered low-quality reads by using the Trim Galore! programme. Then, the 3â² and 5â² adapters were trimmed by using the Cutadapt programme implemented in Trim Galore!. Only reads with a sequencing quality greater than 20 and a read length greater than 80âbp were retained. The filtered reads were aligned to the reference genome sequence by using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner as a sorted binary. The Sequence Alignment/Map tools were used to remove duplications. The sequencing depth and coverage were calculated on the basis of the unique aligned reads. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and InDels were identified by GATK. Standard GATK filters were applied to eliminate SNVs with strand bias, low quality for the depth of sequencing achieved, homopolymer runs and SNVs located near indels. The effects (for example, missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations) and classifications (for example, located in an exonic, intronic or intergenic region) of the variants were annotated across the genome by ANNOVAR.</p>
