        <p id="P1">Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that infects more than 90% of the worldâs population<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. EBV predominantly infects human B cells and epithelial cells, which is initiated by fusion of the viral envelope with a host cellular membrane<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The mechanism of EBV entry into B cells has been well characterized<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism for epithelial cell entry remains elusive. Here, we show that the integrins (Î±vÎ²5, Î±vÎ²6, and Î±vÎ²8) do not function as an entry and fusion receptor for epithelial cells whereas ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2) functions well for both. EphA2 overexpression significantly increased EBV infection of HEK 293 cells. Using a virus-free cell-cell fusion assay, we found that EphA2 dramatically promoted EBV but not HSV fusion with HEK293 cells. EphA2 silencing using shRNA or knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 blocked fusion with epithelial cells. This inhibitory effect was rescued by the expression of EphA2. Antibody against EphA2 blocked epithelial cell infection. Using label-free Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding studies, we confirmed that EphA2 but not EphA4 specifically bound to EBV gHgL and this interaction is through the EphA2 extracellular domain (EphA2-ECD). The discovery of EphA2 as an EBV epithelial cell receptor has important implications for EBV pathogenesis and may uncover new potential targets that can be used for the development of novel interventional strategies.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the gammaherpesvirus family, which was discovered in 1964 and was the first human virus associated with cancer<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. EBV is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma, indicating the EBV tropism for B cells and epithelial cells. EBV infects more than 90% of the worldâs population<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>; however, there is a lack of therapies and vaccines. EBV entry into target cells is an essential step for EBV to cause disease and requires the fusion of viral and host membranes mediated by viral glycoproteins and cellular receptors<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The viral glycoproteins important for EBV entry include gp350, gHgL, gB, and gp42<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Among these glycoproteins, gp350 is important for virus attachment by binding to complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21), which is abundantly expressed on B cells and expressed on tonsilar epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. gHgL and gB are the core fusion machinery and are both required for B cell and epithelial cell fusion. However, gp42 is the tropism determinant required only for B cell fusion and inhibits epithelial cell fusion, indicating different infection mechanisms for these two cell types<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The mechanism for B cell infection is better understood than the mechanism of epithelial cell infection. The B cell receptor HLA-DR was identified to bind to gp42 by a gp42 ligand binding screen in 1996<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In 1997, it was found that HLA-DR functions as a cofactor for infection of B lymphocytes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Since that time, we have worked extensively on EBV entry determining the structures of unbound gp42, the gp42:HLA complex, the gHgL complex, and gB in the post-fusion form<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Recently, we assembled and analyzed the reconstituted B cell entry complex comprised of gHgL, gp42, and HLA class II and the crystal structure of the gHgL/gp42 complex bound to an anti-gHgL antibody (E1D1), providing an overall structural basis for Epstein-Barr virus host cell tropism<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">To characterize the EBV epithelial cell entry complex similarly to what we have done for the B cell entry complex<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, we first wanted to verify the receptor used for epithelial cell entry. We chose the AGS cell line that has been extensively used as a model of EBV epithelial cell entry and HEK293 cells, which we use in our cell based fusion assay. Previous studies had indicated that the integrins (Î±vÎ²5, Î±vÎ²6, and, Î±vÎ²8 but not Î±vÎ²3) functioned as receptors for epithelial cell entry<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. It was also found that blocking antibodies to integrins and siRNA targeting of integrin Î±v did not completely abolish epithelial cell fusion or infection<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In addition, three anti-gHgL monoclonal antibodies (CL40, CL59 and E1D1) targeting different epitopes can all inhibit epithelial cell infection, indicating that multiple regions on gHgL may participate in EBV infection<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. To determine if integrins are the primary epithelial cell receptor, we chose to knock out the integrin Î±v gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in HEK293-T14 cells. The integrins Î±vÎ²5, Î±vÎ²6, and Î±vÎ²8 are heterodimeric complexes composed of the Î±v subunit and a Î² subunit. The crystal structure of EBV gHgL with an exposed KGD motif (RGD motif mimic) within gH domain II (D-II) suggested it might bind to the Î±v subunit of the heterodimeric integrins reported to function as entry receptors<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. By knocking out Î±v, we would block the expression of the integrins previously shown to mediate EBV entry of epithelial cells. Integrin Î±v knockout clonal cell lines were readily obtained and were first analyzed by flow cytometry verifying the absence of Î±v (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We next used our cell-cell fusion assay to monitor syncytia formation. We found that cells lacking integrin Î±v still fused with CHO-K1 cells that expressed gHgL and gB (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) indicating that Î±vÎ²5, Î±vÎ²6, and Î±vÎ²8 integrins are not the primary receptor(s) in HEK293 cells.</p>
    <p id="P4">To identify essential epithelial cell receptors in HEK293 cell fusion, wecompared RNA seq data of human B cells and HEK293 cells. We chose this comparison because it had been previously shown that EBVcontaining only gB and gHgL but lacking gp42 is unable to infect B cells<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In addition, previous data had shown that CHO-K1 cells that expressgHgL and gB but not gp42 can fuse with HEK293 cells but not B cells, further indicating that B cells do not express epithelial cell receptors<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. To identify candidate epithelial cell receptors, wescreened B cell and HEK293 cell RNA seq data sets. In our analysis, we screened the data sets such that the mRNA of HEK293candidates versus the mRNA of B cell candidates was 10-fold greater andthat the HEK293 cell gene reads were over 5 FPKM (Fragment PerKilobase per Million mapped reads) threshold as the lower boundary for reliabledetection of gene expression. From this analysis, we selected 2,039genes out of 18,400 genes that were compared. We then selectedmembrane proteins and excluded genes that had B cell reads of morethan 5 FPKM. This analysis resulted in 245 genes (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To further reduce the number of potential genes, we used RNA seq data from AGS cells. AGScells are a human gastric adenocarcinoma and have been usedextensively as a model of EBV epithelial cell entry<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This cell line formslarger syncytia and are more readily infected when compared to HEK293 cells (data not shown) and gastric epithelial cells are a target of EBV infection<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Whencomparing the expression of the 245 genes (EphA2 ranked No. 14, fold difference 864, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) identified in the HEK293 cellRNA seq data and selecting only those genes that are expressed twofold greater in AGS cells, we identified 39 genes. After ranking these genes by the ratio of AGS to B cell expression from high to low, EphA2 was ranked as the No. 1 candidate (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, if we first compared AGS cells with B cells using the similar parameters (B cell expression less than 5 FPKM, AGS cell expression more than 5 FPKM, AGS cell/B cell &gt; 10, membrane protein), this resulted 278 genes, <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and EphA2 ranked No. 9 (fold difference 6798). If we select only those genes that are expressed twofold greater in AGS cells, we identified 65 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemenarty Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). If we compared the first 15 genes of membrane proteins selected out by two methods (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">3</xref>), EphA2 and PAQR5 are the only genes shared by the two methods. EphA2 is also the receptor for Kaposiâs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), another human gammaherpesvirus<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">EphA2 belongs to the Eph receptor family, which constitutes the largest family of tyrosine kinase receptors. The function of EphA2 includes cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Eph receptors are divided into two classes, A and B, based upon sequence similarity and ligand affinity<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Since we had found that EphA2 had the greatest differential expression profile among B cells, HEK293 cells, and AGS cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), we wanted to verify expression using quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry. As expected, we confirmed that Daudi B cells do not express EphA2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) and the expression level of EphA2 in AGS cells is about 10-fold more than that of HEK293 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). It has been shown that EphA2 is expressed on tongue mucosa and salivary gland<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, EphA2 has also been shown to be expressed on normal gastric mucosa and EphA2 expression is upregulated in the carcinogenesis of gastric mucosa epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">To determine whether EphA2 serves as a receptor for EBV infection of epithelial cells, we first transiently transfected control vector, EphA2 or EphA4 into HEK293 cells to see if EphA2 increased EBV infection or fusion. We used expression vectors for EphA2 or EphA4. Over-expression of EphA2 increased the cell surface expression of EphA2 by about 10-fold in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). These cells were also infected with EBfaV-GFP (recombinant EBV reporter virus expressing GFP<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>) with the resulting infection increasing the detection of green cells in control transfected HEK293 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The number of GFP-expressingcells also increased in EphA2 but not EphA4 transfected HEK293 cells(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Flow cytometry data and quantification confirmedthat EphA2 but not EphA4 increased EBV infection in HEK293 cells(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, EphA2 expression in HEK293 cellsled to significantly increased fusion with CHO-K1 cells expressing theEBV glycoproteins gB, gHgL but not HSV glycoproteins. EphA4 over-expression had no effect on fusion of either EBV or HSV (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">To further confirm that EphA2 can serve as a cellular receptor for EBV infection, we knocked out EphA2 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Following knockout, the EphA2 cell surface expression was decreased to the level of the negative control (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). Both EBV fusion and infection were dramatically decreased in EphA2 knockout cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3bâe</xref>). This marked reduction was rescued by over-expression of EphA2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3bâe</xref>) but not EphA4. HSV fusion activity was not affected in all the cells tested, indicating the specificity of EphA2 as an EBV receptor (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). We performed additional control experiments using shRNA to knock down EphA2 in HEK293-T14 and AGS cells and found similar reduction in fusion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2â3</xref>). As a further confirmation of EphA2 EBV receptor activity, we found that an antibody against EphA2 but not EphA4 can block the infection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line Detroit 562 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, murine EphA2 which shares 93% identity with human EphA2, can also increase fusion and infection with EBV (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b and 4c</xref>). When we mixed the EphA2 KO cells and WT cells at a 1:1 ratio, the infection ability of EphA2 KO cells by EBV was further decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a and b</xref>), indicating there may be another low affinity receptor that unable to compete with the EphA2 when EphA2 is present.</p>
    <p id="P8">EphA2 is also the receptor for Kaposiâs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), another human gammaherpesvirus<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Previous data showed that KSHV gHgL binds to the ligand binding domain of EphA2<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. To examine whether the function of EphA2 in EBV fusion is through the ligand binding domain, we swapped the ligand binding domain of EphA2 and EphA4 to generate EphA2A4 or EphA4A2 chimeras. We found replacing the EphA4 ligand binding domain with the EphA2 ligand binding domain (EphA2A4 chimera) increased fusion activity 3-fold, suggesting that like KSHV, EBV gHgL also binds the ligand binding domain of EphA2 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). To examine whether the EphA2 kinase activity is important for fusion, we also tested three EphA2 kinase dead mutants that were mutated in the EphA2 kinase domain and found that kinase activity of EphA2 is not important for EBV fusion (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). It has been shown that the kinase activity of EphA2 is important for KSHV infection<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Depending upon cell type, EBV can enter cells by fusion at the plasma membrane (epithelial cells) or fusion with an endocytic membrane after endocytosis (B cells)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. KSHV enters human B cells, fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells by endocytosis and EphA2 regulates clathrin mediated KSHV endocytosis<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The different route of entry may explain the differing requirements of EphA2 kinase function in EBV and KSHV infection. To explore the region of gHgL that binds EphA2, we took advantage of previous observations indicating that the gHgL domain for gp42 binding and epithelial cell binding overlaps<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. When an expression vector expressing gp42 or purified soluble gp42 is included in our fusion assay, the level of fusion is dramatically reduced (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) indicating that gp42 binding to gHgL blocks EphA2-mediated membrane fusion, in line with previous observations. To further confirm the direct binding of EphA2-ECD and EBV gHgL, we used label-free Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding studies and found that purified EBV gHgL bound to EphA2 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 5 Î¼M in three independently repeated binding kinetics experiments but EBV gHgL did not bind to EphA4 under the same conditions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The 200 nM concentration of EBV gHgL was injected in duplicates each time with randomized order of injections where the second 200 nM injection occurred after the 1.8 Î¼M EBV gHgL injection to serve as internal control. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> show that both injections of the same concentration (200 nM) overlap each other. Previous data from a flow cytometry binding assay showed that KSHV gHgL can bind tightly with EphA2 particularly but only weakly with other Ephrins including EphA4<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. This suggests that gammaherpesviruses share a common entry receptor. Taken together, we identify EphA2 as an important epithelial cell entry receptor for EBV infection. This result provides important insight into the mechanism EBV utilizes to infect epithelial cells and may provide a better understanding of the development of epithelial pathologies and cancers associated with EBV infection and strategies to lessen EBV-associated epithelial cancers. Finally, our studies using bioinformatics to implicate EphA2 as an EBV epithelial receptor highlight the benefit of using readily obtainable sequencing data to aid in the discovery of pathogen receptors.</p>
