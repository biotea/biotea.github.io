      <abstract>
        <p>Magmas, a conserved mammalian protein essential for eukaryotic development, is overexpressed in prostate carcinomas and cells exposed to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Reduced Magmas expression resulted in decreased proliferative rates in cultured cells. However, the cellular function of Magmas is still elusive. In this report, we have showed that human Magmas is an ortholog of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pam16 having similar functions and is critical for protein translocation across mitochondrial inner membrane. Human Magmas shows a complete growth complementation of Î<italic>pam16</italic> yeast cells at all temperatures. On the basis of our analysis, we report that Magmas localizes into mitochondria and is peripherally associated with inner mitochondrial membrane in yeast and humans. Magmas forms a stable subcomplex with J-protein Pam18 or DnaJC19 through its C-terminal region and is tethered to TIM23 complex of yeast and humans. Importantly, amino acid alterations in Magmas leads to reduced stability of the subcomplex with Pam18 that results in temperature sensitivity and <italic>in vivo</italic> protein translocation defects in yeast cells. These observations highlight the central role of Magmas in protein import and mitochondria biogenesis. In humans, absence of a functional DnaJC19 leads to dilated cardiac myophathic syndrome (DCM), a genetic disorder with characteristic features of cardiac myophathy and neurodegeneration. We propose that the mutations resulting in decreased stability of functional Magmas:DnaJC19 subcomplex at human TIM23 channel leads to impaired protein import and cellular respiration in DCM patients. Together, we propose a model showing how Magmas:DnaJC19 subcomplex is associated with TIM23 complex and thus regulates mitochondrial import process.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Mitochondria are essential, complex organelles of eukaryotic organisms required for a variety of metabolic processes including the generation of energy by oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C1">1</xref>). Normal mitochondrial function requires 500â2000 different types of proteins depending on the species. However, mitochondrial genome of yeast and human cells encodes only 8 and 13 proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C3">3</xref>). Thus, the vast majority of proteins that comprise mitochondria are encoded by the nuclear genome and mitochondrial function requires the import and folding of a large number of proteins synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C5">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Owing to distinct compartmentalization into an outer and inner membrane, mitochondria have evolved an efficient system for recognition and transport of precursor proteins across membranes. Import of nuclear encoded proteins into the mitochondrial membranes is a multistep process involving machinery of cytosol, mitochondrial membranes and mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C10">10</xref>). As a first step in the translocation process, the cytosolic facing receptors recognize the mitochondrial targeting sequence of a precursor protein and transfer them to the protein complex of the outer membrane, where Tom40 forms a pore and allows passage of the precursor protein through the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C10">10</xref>). After passage through TOM complex, a major portion of precursor proteins are targeted into mitochondrial matrix; and this process is mediated by presequence translocase (TIM23 complex) of the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C10">10</xref>). The TIM23 complex consists mainly two set of components: (i) channel-forming components which include integral membrane proteins Tim23 and Tim17 that comprise the translocation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C12">12</xref>) and (ii) the associated peripheral membrane protein Tim50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C13">13</xref>). The movement of the presequence through the inner membrane requires a membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C15">15</xref>), whereas import of the rest of the protein requires translocation channel associated âimport motor machineryâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C9">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>The yeast import motor consists of five essential subunits namely, mtHsp70 (Ssc1), Tim44, Pam18, Pam16, Mge1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C20">20</xref>), and two non-essential subunits, Pam17 and Tam41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C23">23</xref>). A critical core component of this machinery is the major mitochondrial 70 kDa heat shock protein (mtHsp70; Ssc1 in yeast), which binds short hydrophobic segments of incoming polypeptide chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C25">25</xref>). MtHsp70 is tethered to the import channel via its interaction with an essential peripheral membrane component of the channel, Tim44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C26">26</xref>). This interaction is destabilized upon binding a translocating precursor polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C27">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, two additional critical components of the import motor, a J-protein (Pam18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C30">30</xref>) and J-like protein (Pam16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>) have been identified. Pam18 and Pam16 proteins are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>). As expected of a J-protein, Pam18 stimulates Ssc1's ATPase activity and stabilizes the interaction with precursor proteins, thus carries out an essential function during the translocation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C30">30</xref>). Pam16 regulates Pam18's ATPase stimulating activity by forming a functional heterodimer through its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C33">33</xref>). A stable heterodimer is required for the protein translocation and viability of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C35">35</xref>). Pam18:Pam16 heterodimer is tethered to the translocon via multiple interactions with other components of the translocation channel and regulates the import motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). However, the precise mechanism of regulation of the import motor by Pam16 is not clearly understood.</p>
      <p>The proteins homologous to yeast Pam16 have been reported in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C37">37</xref>). A homologous deletion mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was found to be lethal at the first instar larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C38">38</xref>). Magmas-like proteins are found essential for the development of murine and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C40">40</xref>). In humans, mitochondria-associated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling molecule (referred as âMagmasâ, ortholog of yeast Pam16) was first reported as a protein upregulated in PGMD1 cells cultured in a GM-CSF rich medium and not in cells exposed to Interleukin-3. Reduced Magmas expression in PGMD1 cells under GM-CSF resulted in decreased proliferative rates in a dose-responsive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C41">41</xref>). During the developmental stages of animals, expression of Magmas was upregulated in muscle, testis, intestinal mucosa and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C40">40</xref>). Magmas levels were also found to be upregulated in neoplastic prostate in humans, though its expression is restricted only to a subset of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C42">42</xref>). On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that Magmas functions as a âsignaling moleculeâ and perhaps controls anaerobic metabolism, resistance to apoptosis or altered growth sensitivity in mammalian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C43">43</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although Magmas levels are upregulated in different developmental stages and various pathophysiological conditions including prostate cancer, little functional information about human Magmas is available. On the basis of a weak sequence and predicted structural fold similarity with yPam16's J-like domain, we sought to determine the function of Magmas in humans. We found that Magmas is an ortholog of yeast Pam16 and has similar functions; and it complements the growth of yeast cells deleted for Pam16. Moreover, Magmas interacts with yeast Pam18 as well as human DnaJC19 (ortholog of yeast Pam18) both in <italic>vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions to form a heterodimeric subcomplex. The residues critical for the association of Magmas with yPam18, DnaJC19 and translocation channel were identified. Our results are consistent with the existence of stable interaction between Magmas and DnaJC19 that plays a crucial role in tethering of DnaJC19 at the translocon and perhaps regulating human import motor activity. We have identified the minimal region of DnaJC19 essential for its association with Magmas. Thus, our study underlines the possible molecular mechanism for the physiological symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCM) syndrome which is associated with a truncated DnaJC19 protein.</p>

        <title>Magmas complements growth of Î<italic>pam16</italic> yeast strain</title>
        <p>The J-like protein Pam16 functions in protein translocation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and has been conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>). The sequence analyses of <italic>PAM16</italic> revealed its presence as single or multiple copies of genes in all eukaryotes, supporting the idea that the mechanism of protein translocation across mitochondrial inner membrane has been maintained throughout eukaryotic evolution. A multiple protein sequence alignment of predicted Pam16 homologs of different species showed a sequence homology at the C-terminal region across genera (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>A). In <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and primates such as <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, the Pam16 homologs (also referred as Magmas) showed a high degree of sequence conservation between them. However, the sequence conservation between mammalian Magmas and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pam16 was only restricted to the predicted helix III of C-terminal region (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>A). At the level of protein sequence, Magmas shares â¼41% identity with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pam16. Magmas-like proteins are essential in multicellular organisms in various developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C40">40</xref>), but the critical function has not been elucidated. To determine the function in mammalian system, we chose the human protein Magmas which shares weak sequence similarity with yeast Pam16. The primary structure of human Magmas contains 125 amino acid residues and possesses a three-dimensional structural fold similar to J-like domain of yeast Pam16 as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C32">32</xref>) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B). The J-like domain of Magmas consists of three helices and an exposed loop between tightly packed helix II and helix III with conserved aspartic acid, lysine, serine (DKS) motif (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Deletion of <italic>PAM16</italic> is lethal to yeast cells, indicating that Pam16 has a crucial role in maintaining cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>). Therefore, to test whether <italic>MAGMAS</italic> is a true ortholog of <italic>PAM16</italic>, we have utilized two genetic approaches for the growth complementation analysis in yeast. First, heterozygous <italic>pam16</italic> diploid of <italic>PJ53</italic> yeast cells carrying a single chromosomal disrupted copy of <italic>PAM16</italic>(ÎHIS) was transformed with <italic>MAGMAS</italic> in <italic>pRS415</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C44">44</xref>) and the cells were subjected to sporulation. Tetrads were dissected and replica plated for the selection of <italic>MAGMAS</italic> positive (HIS<sup>+</sup> LEU<sup>+</sup>) spores. The viability of more than two spores indicates that <italic>MAGMAS</italic> rescues the growth of Î<italic>pam16</italic> strain (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>C). Secondly, to further confirm the results, we have used plasmid shuffling to rescue the inviability of the Î<italic>pam16</italic> strain. A plasmid (<italic>pRS415</italic>) carrying <italic>MAGMAS</italic> was transformed into a haploid Î<italic>pam16</italic> strain carrying a wild-type copy of <italic>PAM16</italic> on a centromeric plasmid having the <italic>URA3</italic> gene. The resulting strains were plated on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which selects for cells having lost the <italic>URA3</italic>-containing plasmid carrying the <italic>PAM16</italic> gene. The viable cells were recovered, grown in rich media and subjected to drop test analysis using fermentable and non-fermentable growth media. Magmas showed complete growth complementation of Pam16 deleted yeast cells at all temperatures tested (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>D), suggesting that it is a true mammalian ortholog of yeast Pam16 carrying out identical function in humans.</p>

        <title>Magmas localizes to the mitochondria</title>
        <p>In yeast, Pam16 localizes to the mitochondria and is found associated with inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>). To characterize the biological functions of Magmas in human cells, we first set out to establish whether it displayed a similar subcellular localization. To address, we have used <italic>in vivo</italic> fluorescence imaging and <italic>in vitro</italic> subcellular fractionation analysis of mitochondria isolated from human cell lines and yeast cells. To determine whether Magmas localizes to the mitochondria in human cells, <italic>MAGMAS</italic> was cloned in the mammalian expression vector, pEGFP-N3 at the N-terminus and was expressed in HeLa cells. The cells were counter-stained with mitochondrion-specific dye, MitoTracker Red to stain the organelle. Upon confocal imaging analysis of GFP-Magmas fluorescence in HeLa cells, we observed total colocalization with MitoTracker (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F2">2</xref>A), indicating Magmas distribution in the mitochondria. Similar results were obtained in HEK293T cells (data not shown).

        <p>We next utilized subcellular fractionation to confirm our GFP fluorescence findings. Analysis of purified mitochondria from HEK293T and yeast cells, followed by immunodecoration with Magmas-specific antibody revealed the presence of a 13.7 kDa band of Magmas within the mitochondrial fraction (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F2">2</xref>B and C). As positive controls, components of the inner membrane translocon such as Tim23, Tim44, Pam18 and Tim17 proteins were probed with specific antibodies against human and yeast, respectively. To ascertain the purity of the mitochondrial preparations obtained from HEK293T cells, immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against other organelle-specific markers such as, cathepsin D as a lysosomal marker, peroxisomal marker protein catalase and superoxide dismutase as a cytosolic/nuclear marker. When compared with control, negligible amounts of these proteins were detected in mitochondrial fraction. Together, these results support our GFP fluorescence analysis and indicate that Magmas localizes to the mitochondrial compartment of human and yeast cells, respectively.</p>
        <p>Yeast Pam16 is found associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane compartment. To determine the association of Magmas with the inner mitochondrial membrane of human and yeast, we subjected the mitochondria for hypotonic swelling to generate the mitoplasts. The mitoplasts were gently sonicated in a buffer containing low or high salt followed by separation of soluble and membrane pellet fractions by ultracentrifugation. The samples were resolved on SDSâPAGE and immunodecorated with specific antibodies against respective yeast and human proteins. As expected, the Magmas was found associated with membrane pellet fraction like Tim44, Tim23, Tim17, yPam18 and DnaJC19, whereas soluble matrix protein Mge1 (in yeast) and hTid1 (in human) were released into the supernatant in both high and low salt conditions (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F2">2</xref>D and E). These results are consistent with yeast Pam16's association with the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Upon treatment of human and yeast mitochondria at alkaline pH of 11.5, a considerable amount of Magmas was extracted from yeast, whereas in the case of human mitochondria, a significant amount of Magmas was extracted in the supernatant. However, multi-spanning integral membrane proteins such as Tim23 and Tim17 remained in the membrane fraction (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F2">2</xref>D and E). As an internal control, similar results were obtained for yeast Pam16 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F2">2</xref>D). In summary, we conclude that like yeast Pam16, human Magmas is a peripheral mitochondrial inner-membrane protein that is exposed to the matrix space and lacks multi-spanning transmembrane segments in the primary structure.</p>

        <title>Amino acid substitutions in the J-like domain of Magmas affects <italic>in vivo</italic> function</title>
        <p>On the basis of preliminary genetic analysis and structural investigations, it was evident that Pam16 and yPam18 interact via their helix III to form a stable functional heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). Previously, a temperature sensitive (Ts) mutation in Pam16's J-domain L97W, which lies at the beginning of the helix III region, was isolated. The <italic>pam16</italic><sub><italic>L97W</italic></sub> mutant showed robust <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes including Ts at 34Â°C and decreased ability to form a stable heterodimer as tested by using mitochondria and in purified system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). Besides, the helix III of Pam16 homologs are significantly conserved across species including human Magmas (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>A). On the basis of this evidence, we predicted that the interaction region between Magmas and DnaJC19 or yPam18 is also conserved. As the domain structures of Magmas and Pam16 are well conserved, we created identical mutations in Magmas sequence replacing leucine 94 with either tryptophan or glycine (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B). The yeast strains expressing <italic>magmas</italic> mutants were generated via plasmid shuffling. We observed the yeast cells carrying <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>L94W</italic></sub> and <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>L94G</italic></sub> mutations (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B) were inviable and unable to grow in plates containing 5-FOA (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>C). By a less drastic amino acid substitution at 94 position into alanine, <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>L94A</italic></sub> <italic>cells</italic> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B) had no obvious growth phenotypes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>D), whereas by a glutamine substitution, <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>L94Q</italic></sub> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B) cells grew normal as wild-type upto 23Â°C, grew poorly at 30Â°C and were inviable at 34Â°C in rich and minimal media (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>A and B). Results clearly indicate that the leucine 94 of Magmas is critical for <italic>in vivo</italic> function. Similarly, we have created additional Magmas Ts mutants by replacing conserved residues at the base of the helix III region. We replaced two aromatic amino acids namely, phenylalanine (F92) and tyrosine (Y93) into glycine residues (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B). The single mutant, <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>F92G</italic></sub> cells allowed robust growth of Î<italic>pam16</italic> cells at all temperatures tested in rich media (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>A). Although <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>F92G</italic></sub> cells formed colonies at 37Â°C in minimal media, growth was slower when compared with that of wild-type (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>B). In the other single substitution mutant, <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>Y93G</italic></sub> cells grew normally upto 34Â°C and slower at 37Â°C when plated in rich media, while cells were Ts at 37Â°C in minimal media (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>A and B). When we combined both mutations together, as double mutant <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>F92Y93G</italic></sub><sub>,</sub> a drastic growth phenotype was observed, where the cells were inviable at all temperatures &gt;23Â°C in both rich and minimal media (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>A and B). To address the importance of DKS sequence in the loop connecting helix II and helix III (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B), we have created a triple mutant by replacing it with the canonical J-protein conserved histidine, proline, aspartic acid (HPD) sequence. The <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>DKS/HPD</italic></sub> robustly supported the growth of Î<italic>pam16</italic> cells at all temperatures, suggesting that these DKS amino acids are dispensable for <italic>in vivo</italic> function (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>D).</p>

        <p>To aid the identification of residues outside the helix III region of Magmas J-like domain that are important for function, we mutated a highly conserved isoleucine at position 62 into either tryptophan or alanine or glutamine residue (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F1">1</xref>B). The <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>I62W</italic></sub> and <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>I62A</italic></sub> cells showed normal growth upto 30Â°C, however no colonies were formed at temperatures &gt;34Â°C (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>A and B). Interestingly, the isoleucine to glutamine substituted mutant yeast cells showed severe growth phenotypes as they grew very slowly at 23Â°C (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>D). Together, these results highlight the importance of I62 and the contribution of amino acid residues outside helix III for Magmas <italic>in vivo</italic> function.</p>
        <p>To ascertain that the growth phenotypes of mutants are not due to the changes in expression levels, we have analyzed the mitochondria isolated from mutant strains grown at permissive temperatures. Equivalent amounts of mitochondria from the wild-type Magmas and mutants were separated on SDSâPAGE and subjected to immunodecoration with specific antibodies against Magmas and other components of the inner membrane translocon. We observed that the mutation did not alter the steady state levels of Magmas by itself, neither other members of the translocon that we tested (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>E). Results are in agreement with earlier reported Pam16's conditional mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). To further assess their ability to interact with the inner mitochondrial membrane, we have subjected the mutant mitochondria, <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>L94Q</italic></sub>, <italic>magmas</italic><sub>F92G,</sub> <italic>magmas</italic><sub>F92Y93G</sub> and <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>DKS/HPD</italic></sub> for fractionation analysis. The membrane pellet and supernatant soluble fraction were separated by ultracentrifugation, followed by SDSâPAGE and immunodecoration with translocon-specific antibodies. Magmas mutants were separated into pellet fraction similar to wild-type and internal control, wt Pam16 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F3">3</xref>F). In summary, we conclude that the residues spanning the base of helix III region (F92, Y93, L94) and I62 are critical for Magmas <italic>in vivo</italic> function.</p>

        <title>Magmas protein is essential for the import of precursor proteins into mitochondria</title>
        <p>Pam16 is essential for protein translocation across mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C45">45</xref>). To demonstrate whether Magmas has a role in mitochondrial protein import <italic>in vivo</italic>, accumulation of the non-processed precursor form of a nuclear encoded abundant mitochondrial protein, Hsp60, was monitored.

Above result confirms that Magmas completely restores Pam16's functions in yeast and efficiently interacts with the import machinery for the import of precursor proteins into the mitochondria. To further assess the role of Magmas in protein import, we have employed the Ts mutants for the precursor accumulation analysis. When the mutant cells, grown first at 23Â°C, were shifted to 37Â°C for 8 h to induce phenotype, they accumulated significant amounts of non-processed Hsp60 precursor form (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F4">4</xref>A, lanes 6, 8, 20, 22, 24); indicative of <italic>in vivo</italic> import defects associated with the Ts mutants.

        <title>Magmas interacts with yPam18 and DnaJC19 to form a stable subcomplex</title>
        <p>In yeast, previously it has been shown that Pam16 forms a stable heterodimeric subcomplex with yPam18 in the mitochondrial lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). The stability of the subcomplex is critical for the translocation process in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether Magmas forms a similar subcomplex with yPam18 in yeast mitochondrial lysates. To address, we have purified mitochondria expressing wt Magmas or mutants in Î<italic>pam16</italic> yeast strains. Mitochondrial extracts were prepared using 1% Triton X-100 to dissociate channel components, and then subjected for coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) analysis using cross-linked yPam18 antibody agarose beads. As expected, Magmas co-precipitated with yPam18 from extracts of wild-type mitochondria, indicating that Magmas can form a similar stable subcomplex (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F5">5</xref>A, lane 1). Significantly reduced co-precipitation was observed from <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>F92Y93G</italic></sub>, magmas<sub>F92G</sub> and <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>L94Q</italic></sub> extracts, highlighting the importance of these residues for the subcomplex formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F5">5</xref>A, lanes 2, 3, 5). A wild-type level of co-precipitation was observed from <italic>magmas</italic><sub><italic>DKS/HPD</italic></sub> extracts, suggesting that the DKS motif is dispensable for the subcomplex formation with yPam18 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F5">5</xref>B, lane 4). These results are consistent with their apparent lack of growth and translocation phenotypes. To demonstrate whether Magmas forms a similar subcomplex in human mitochondria, the mitochondrial lysates were prepared from HEK293T cells and subjected to CoIP analysis using specific antibodies against Magmas and DnaJC19. Regardless of the type of antibodies used, equivalent amounts of co-precipitation of Magmas with DnaJC19 (yPam18 ortholog) supports the existence of a similar subcomplex in humans (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F5">5</xref>B and C).</p>

        <p>To further confirm our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, we assessed whether Magmas is capable of forming a subcomplex with yPam18 <italic>in vitro</italic> by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down analysis using purified proteins. Consistent with results obtained in mitochondrial lysates, we found that upon mixing equimolar amounts of full-length Magmas and yPam18, &gt;90% of yPam18 was pulled down using full-length GST-Magmas. In order to investigate the molecular basis of DCM syndrome, we employed <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay and generated N-terminal truncations of DnaJC19 to determine the region essential for its interaction with Magmas. Similar truncations were also generated for yPam18 based on previous reports that Pam16 interacts with yPam18 through their C-terminal-related J-domains. Therefore, to determine the minimal region of Magmas required for the interaction with yPam18 and DnaJC19, we mixed J + T and J-domain fragments (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F6">6</xref>A) of yPam18 and DnaJC19 together with Magmas and performed GST pull-down analysis. As with full-length protein, a similar pull down was observed for these smaller fragments containing the J + T and J-domains (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F6">6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F7">7</xref>A). To determine the relative affinities of these fragments, we have incubated GST-bound Magmas (full-length, J + T and J-like domain) with increasing concentrations of full-length, J + T and J-domains of either yPam18 or DnaJC19 followed by pull-down analysis. By quantitative analysis, we observed that the fragments of Magmas interacted with yPam18 and DnaJC19 fragments with nearly similar affinities when compared with full-length proteins (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F6">6</xref>C, D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F7">7</xref>B, C).

        <title>Magmas is a part of presequence translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane</title>
        <p>The translocon of the inner mitochondrial membrane is composed of two componentsâthe TIM23 core channel and the import motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C8">8</xref>). Previously, it has been shown that yeast Pam16 is a part of import motor and precisely tethers yPam18 to the translocon so that it efficiently stimulates ATPase activity of mtHsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C45">45</xref>). To demonstrate whether Magmas forms a part of the translocon machinery and is involved in the interaction with yPam18 of TIM23 complex, mitochondria were isolated from yeast strains expressing wild-type Magmas and Ts mutants. Purified mitochondria were lysed with digitonin and the supernatant was subjected to CoIP analysis using cross-linked Tim23 antibody agarose beads. As expected from earlier studies, both yPam18 and Pam16/Magmas were equally co-precipitated from wt Magmas and internal control wt Pam16 extracts along with other components of the translocon including Tim17, Tim50 and Tim44 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F8">8</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2).

Interestingly, in all the mutants, the levels of Magmas association were roughly similar to that of wild-type mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F8">8</xref>A).

        <title>Magmas inhibits ATPase stimulatory activity of Pam18 and DnaJC19</title>
        <p>Pam18 is a J-protein and critical component of the import motor tethered at the translocon to stimulate Ssc1's ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C30">30</xref>). Pam16, a J-like protein negatively regulates the import motor activity (Ssc1's ATPase activity) by forming heterodimeric complex with yPam18 through their related J-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C34">34</xref>). However, the physiological significance of such negative regulation is not clearly understood. To test whether Magmas regulates yPam18's ATPase stimulatory activity, we have incubated preformed radioactive Ssc1âATP complex with different molar ratio of purified proteins; yPam18 alone, Magmas alone and yPam18:Magmas complex. As an internal control, Pam16 alone and Pam16:yPam18 complex were used to monitor the stimulation of Ssc1's ATPase activity under single turnover conditions. As expected, Pam16:yPam18 heterodimer was 40â50% as active as yPam18 alone in stimulating Ssc1's ATPase activity over different ratios of heterodimer concentrations (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F9">9</xref>A). Fifty to 60% ATPase stimulating activity was retained by Magmas:yPam18 complex when compared with yPam18 alone over a range of complex concentration (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ002F9">9</xref>A), consistent with the previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C33">33</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Protein transport is a highly regulated process that depends on the critical functioning of inner mitochondrial âimport motorâ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C9">9</xref>). The proteins related to the yeast import motor are conserved in mammalian mitochondria including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C46">46</xref>). Depending upon the metabolic state of the cell, the expression of human import motor components is highly regulated, thus controlling the import process. The mechanism of regulation of the import process in humans is largely unknown; however, altered regulation leads to severe mitochondrial disorders including neuromuscular diseases and malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C47">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C49">49</xref>). Mammalian Magmas proteins are ubiquitously expressed; and in humans, it was identified as GM-CSF specific signaling molecule which gets overexpressed in neoplastic prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C42">42</xref>). Although it has been assumed that Magmas proteins are predicted homologs of yeast Pam16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>), the primary function and mechanism of regulation in mammalian system was still elusive. The data presented here on human Magmas provides first experimental evidences to show that the mammalian Magmas proteins are orthologs of yeast Pam16 having similar functions and are essential part of mammalian import motor. The primary structure of human Magmas is related to yeast Pam16 and share a common domain organization. It consists of predicted N-terminal membrane association domain (TM), middle targeting region (T) and C-terminal J-like domain (J). However, it lacks C-terminal extension region of Pam16 which is functionally dispensable in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C32">32</xref>).</p>
      <p>Human Magmas is an ortholog of yeast Pam16 in several aspects and performs the similar function. Several biochemical and genetic evidences are presented here to support this idea. First, it shows a complete growth support of yeast cells deleted for essential <italic>PAM16</italic> gene at all conditions. These observations highlight a possible similar essential functional role for Magmas in humans. Second, it localizes into mitochondria when expressed in Î<italic>pam16</italic> cells as well as in human HeLa and HEK293T cells when expressed as GFP fusion proteins. These observations were further supported by enrichment of the protein levels in purified mitochondria from yeast and human cell lines, respectively. Third, in both yeast and human, Magmas is tightly associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Similar to Pam16, Magmas was fractionated into inner membrane pellet fraction and resistant to high salt extraction. However, majority of Magmas was extracted from pellet fraction at alkaline pH, indicating that it is a peripherally associated with inner mitochondrial membrane protein. Fourth, like Pam16, Magmas is associated with mitochondrial TIM23 complex in Î<italic>pam16</italic> yeast cells as well as in humans. Fifth, Magmas regulates the ATPase stimulation activity of yPam18 as well as DnaJC19 in humans by forming a stable subcomplex through their C-terminal regions, thus regulating Ssc1 and human mtHsp70 (Mortalin) activity during the import process. Sixth, like Pam16, Magmas plays an essential role in import of precursor proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. Previously, it has been shown that downregulation of Pam16 level leads to the accumulation of precursor form of Hsp60 in yeast cells suggesting its essential role in protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C17">17</xref>). Similarly, Î<italic>pam16</italic> yeast cells expressing wt Magmas did not show the accumulation of precursor form of Hsp60 when exposed to non-permissive temperature, indicating that Magmas can complement the import function of Pam16. In addition to that, Magmas also supported a wild-type level of protein import of model preprotein, Cytb2(47)-DHFR into the Î<italic>pam16</italic> mitochondria.</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that Magmas protein interacts with yPam18 and DnaJC19 via their J-like and J-domains to form a stable subcomplex. The J-like and J-domain of Magmas and yPam18/DnaJC19, respectively, are competent to form a subcomplex with similar affinities and a stable Magmas:yPam18 and Magmas:DnaJC19 subcomplex was co-immunoprecipitated in yeast and human mitochondrial lysates. Formation of a similar subcomplex between Pam16 and Pam18 was reported earlier in yeast. Hence, our findings clearly broaden the idea of evolutionary conserved existence of such subcomplex from yeast to human systems.</p>
      <p>A stable interaction between J-like domain of Magmas and J-domain of yPam18/DnaJC19 is required for <italic>in vivo</italic> function. A single amino acid alteration in helix I and helix III region of the J-like domain of Magmas compromises growth of yeast cells and is associated with an unstable Magmas/yPam18 subcomplex. The mutant proteins also showed a dramatic decrease in affinity for their interaction with yPam18 and human Pam18 ortholog DnaJC19 proteins; envisioning a similar defect in subcomplex formation in human mitochondria. The corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in organellar</italic> protein translocation defect associated with the Magmas mutants is consistent with the idea that the protein import and growth defects of cells expressing the mutant proteins are caused by instability of the subcomplex.</p>
      <p>Our findings support the hypothesis of Magmas playing a critical role in positioning of J-protein, Pam18/DnaJC19 to the translocon and perhaps regulating the import motor activity in mammalian system. In yeast, it was demonstrated that Pam16 plays a crucial role in tethering Pam18 to the translocon possibly by interacting through Tim44 with its N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). Although the Ts mutants of Pam16 showed a compromised heterodimer subcomplex formation, a significantly reduced interaction of Pam18 at the translocon was observed, but Pam16 association remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). Supporting this data, Magmas Ts mutants also showed a similar reduced co-precipitation of yPam18, but not of Magmas with the translocon when Magmas:yPam18 subcomplex formation was compromised. Owing to compromised heterodimer formation, the Magmas mutants were found to be defective in regulating ATPase activity of human import motor. This is consistent with an important role for Magmas in tethering yPam18/DnaJC19 to the translocon. On the basis of our analysis, we conclude that both Magmas and Pam16 share a common function across species and evolved precisely to alter Pam18's level at the translocon by forming subcomplex through their C-terminal regions, thus regulating the mitochondrial activity.</p>
      <p>Although we have assigned a primary function for Magmas, understanding the mechanisms of regulation of Magmas as well as DnaJC19 is of utmost importance for the mitochondrial physiology. There are numerous connections between altered Magmas levels and DnaJC19's function with mitochondrial pathophysiology: (i) Magmas levels is highly upregulated in prostate carcinoma and in response to GM-CSF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C42">42</xref>). (ii) Truncated DnaJC19 (devoid of its J-domain) protein causes a severe genetic disorder called DCM syndrome characterized by respiratory, cardiac and neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C47">47</xref>). DCM syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder prevalent in Canadian and ancestral European population and an IVS3-1GâC mutation was identified upon genotyping the disease haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C47">47</xref>). The mutation causes abnormal splicing that result in the truncation of exon 4 followed by a stop codon. Translation of the Îexon 4 transcript produces a protein having a truncated J-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C47">47</xref>). On the basis of our studies, we propose the molecular etiology underlying the disorder. As a functional J or J-like domain is essential for the formation of a stable heterodimer, we predict that the truncated protein is defective in forming a functional Magmas:DnaJC19 subcomplex and hence, the interaction of DnaJC19 with human TIM23 complex gets compromised. This leads to the deregulation of import motor activity causing improper protein import thereby, affecting mitochondria biogenesis and cellular respiration. The consequent impairment of energy metabolism in the cell especially in mitochondria-rich cardiac and neuronal tissues results in symptoms such as cardiomyopathy, peripheral neurodegeneration and ataxia. However, the relevance of upregulated Magmas levels other than protein import function is not well established, underlines the importance of future investigation.</p>

One liter cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (20 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES pH 6.8, 40 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, 0.5 <sc>m</sc> NaCl and 5% glycerol) containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitor cocktail followed by incubation at 4Â°C for 1 h. The sample was gently lysed with 0.2% DOC followed by DNase I (10 Âµg/ml, 10 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>) treatment for 15 min at 4Â°C. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 28 000<italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4Â°C. The soluble supernatant was incubated with 500 Âµl bed volume of Ni-NTA agarose for 2 h at 4Â°C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing three times with 15 ml of buffer A. The resin was washed with 15 ml of buffer B (20 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES pH 6.8, 80 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, 1 <sc>m</sc> NaCl and 5% glycerol) at 4Â°C. To remove bacterial DnaK contamination, the resin was washed with 15 ml of buffer C (20 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES pH 6.8, 80 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, 0.5 <sc>m</sc> NaCl, 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, 10 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5% glycerol) at 4Â°C. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer D (20 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES pH 6.8, 250 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, 250 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl and 5% glycerol) and dialyzed against buffer appropriate for use in particular experiments.</p>
        <p>Full-length yPam18, DnaJC19<sub>J+T</sub> and DnaJC19<sub>J</sub> proteins were purified from insoluble fraction. The pellet fraction was solubilized by incubating with 10 ml of buffer E (buffer A + 1% Triton X-100, 500 m<sc>m</sc> KCl and 3 <sc>m</sc> urea) for 2 h at 4Â°C. The soluble fraction was further clarified by centrifuging at 28 000<italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads for 2 h at 4Â°C. The protein bound beads were washed two times with 15 ml buffer E, followed by 15 ml of buffer F (buffer A + 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 m<sc>m</sc> KCl and 2 <sc>m</sc> urea) at 4Â°C. The resin was further washed with 15 ml of buffer G (buffer A + 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 m<sc>m</sc> KCl and 1 <sc>m</sc> urea) and two times with buffer H (buffer A + 0.5% Triton X-100 and 250 m<sc>m</sc> KCl). The bound proteins were eluted with buffer I (buffer A + 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 m<sc>m</sc> KCl and 300 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole) and dialyzed against buffer appropriate for use in defined experiments.</p>
        <p>A hexahistidine tag was introduced at the N-termini of wild-type yeast Pam18, Pam18<sub>J+T</sub>, Pam18<sub>J</sub> and C-terminus of the wild-type Pam16 proteins for purification from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The protein purification is done essentially according to the procedure as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C36">36</xref>). The full-length GST-Magmas, GST-Magmas<sub>J+T</sub>, GST-Magmas<sub>J</sub> and mutant proteins were purified according to the published protocols with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C50">50</xref>). The buffer components have been changed to 20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, pH 7.5 instead of phosphate buffer in GST-fusion protein purification protocols. The Ssc1<sub>His</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C24">24</xref>) and human Mortalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C53">53</xref>) were purified from yeast as described.</p>

        <p>Equimolar concentration of purified full-length GST-Magmas, GST-Magmas<sub>J+T</sub> and GST-Magmas<sub>J</sub> were incubated with 10 Âµl bed volume of glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) in 150 Âµl GST-buffer (50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris pH 7.5, 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1 m<sc>m</sc> PMSF). Unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads two times with GST buffer. The samples were blocked with 0.1% BSA for 20 min at 23Â°C followed by washing two times with GST-buffer. The beads were resuspended in 200 Âµl GST binding buffer and incubated with equimolar or increasing concentration of either full-length, J + T, J-domains of yPam18 or DnaJC19 for half an hour at 23Â°C. The GST beads were washed three times with GST-buffer and resolved on SDSâPAGE followed by Coomassie dye staining. A similar protocol has been employed for the GST pull-down analysis of purified GST-Magmas<sub>L94Q,</sub> GST-Magmas<sub>F92G</sub> and GST-Magmas<sub>F92Y93G</sub> mutants by incubating with equimolar or increasing concentrations of yPam18<sub>J+T</sub> and DnaJC19<sub>J+T</sub> proteins.</p>

        <p>Yeast mitochondria were purified according to the published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C54">54</xref>) and resuspended to 20 mg protein ml<sup>â1</sup> concentration in SEM buffer (250 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA and 10 m<sc>m</sc> MOPSâKOH, pH 7.2). The human mitochondria were isolated using Cell Mitochondria Isolation Kitâ¢ (Sigma-Aldrich) as per manufacturer's instructions. The mutant mitochondria were pre-incubated at 37Â°C prior to any kind of analysis. For expression analysis, 50 Âµg of yeast or 100 Âµg human mitochondria was subjected to SDSâPAGE, followed by immunodecoration with specific antibodies as indicated in the figures. The affinity purification of antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C24">24</xref>) and ATPase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C30">30</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> import assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C55">55</xref>) were carried out as described. For generation of anti-Magmas, anti-DnaJC19 and anti-hTim17 anti-sera rabbits were injected with cleaved GST fragments of Magmas (30â125 aa), DnaJC19 (34â116 aa) and KLH-conjugated peptide (CPKDGTPAPGYPSYQ) corresponding to the C-terminal region of hTim17, respectively (Imgenex Biotech). Anti-yTim23 and anti-yTim50 antibodies were generated by using N-terminal region of yTim23 (1â98 aa) and C-terminal region of yTim50 (133â476 aa), respectively, as antigens. For the generation of anti-DHFR antibodies, the rabbits were injected with the recombinant protein. Antibodies against yHsp60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C30">30</xref>), yTim44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C20">20</xref>), yMge1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C18">18</xref>), yPam18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>), yPam16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ002C31">31</xref>) were gifted by Prof. Elizabeth A. Craig's laboratory, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Antibodies specific to human proteins, namely hTim23, hTim44, SOD and cathepsin D were obtained from BD Biosciences. Anti-catalase antibody was obtained from Calbiochem. Immunoblot analysis was carried out by using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reagents used for the experiments were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless specified.</p>
