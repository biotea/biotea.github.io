      <abstract>
        <p>Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a common form of retinal degeneration characterized by photoreceptor degeneration and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy causing loss of visual field and acuities. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous splice site variant (c.111+1G&gt;A) in the gene encoding retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). This change segregated with early onset, progressive, and severe autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) in an eight member consanguineous pedigree of European ancestry. Additionally, one patient exhibited developmental abnormalities including patent ductus arteriosus and chorioretinal and iris colobomas. The second patient developed acne from young age and extending into the 5<sup>th</sup> decade. Both patients had undetectable levels of RBP4 in the serum suggesting that this mutation led to either mRNA or protein instability resulting in a null phenotype. In addition, the patients exhibited severe vitamin A deficiency, and diminished serum retinol levels. Circulating transthyretin levels were normal. This study identifies the RBP4 splice site change as the cause of RP in this pedigree. The presence of developmental abnormalities and severe acne in patients with retinal degeneration may indicate the involvement of genes that regulate vitamin A absorption, transport and metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Retinal dystrophies (RD) are characterized by photoreceptor degeneration and RPE atrophy causing loss of visual field and acuities <xref rid="pone.0050205-Daiger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Heckenlively1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These degenerations are inherited in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, mitochondrial and syndromic forms. More than 170 genes have been implicated in causing RD (Retinal Information Network (RetNet), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sph.uth.tmc.edu/retnet/">https://sph.uth.tmc.edu/retnet/</ext-link>). Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a common form of RD affecting 1 in 4000 individuals in the United States. The clinical features of RP are delayed dark adaptation and progressive loss of sensitivity, loss of peripheral vision at early stages progressing to tunnel vision or in severe cases, to a total loss of vision at later stages. About 60 genes involved in causing RP have been reported (RetNet), of which 35 genes exhibit a recessive mode of inheritance <xref rid="pone.0050205-denHollander1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Cremers1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These 35 genes are estimated to account for 30 to 50% of recessive RP cases <xref rid="pone.0050205-Daiger1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Identifying causative genes for RP has been challenging due to the significant overlap in disease phenotypes and the lack of sufficient information on phenotype-genotype associations.</p>
      <p>Recent advances in exome capture and next generation sequencing methodologies offer efficient strategies to identify the genetic basis of inherited conditions in pedigrees that are not suitable for linkage mapping <xref rid="pone.0050205-Bamshad1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Zelinger1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These strategies can be used for screening genes implicated in RD as well as for identifying novel genes associated with RD and other related diseases <xref rid="pone.0050205-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Lam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In this study we describe the identification of a novel splice site mutation in the retinal binding protein-4 (RBP4) gene segregating with recessive retinal degeneration in two affected siblings of a consanguineous Caucasian pedigree and the potential implications of the mutation.</p>
      <p>RBP4 is a plasma protein that binds to retinol and facilitates transport of retinol to peripheral tissues <xref rid="pone.0050205-Quadro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Raghu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In humans, the circulating RBP4-retinol complex is bound to transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric thyroid hormone transport protein. Binding of RBP4 to TTR increases its molecular mass thereby preventing its removal by glomerular filtration <xref rid="pone.0050205-Quadro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, whereas, lack of TTR increases urinary excretion of RBP4 <xref rid="pone.0050205-Quadro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-vanBennekum1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Retinol in peripheral tissues is converted to retinaldehyde, a critical component of the visual cycle <xref rid="pone.0050205-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Mice lacking retinol binding protein (RBP) were found to be viable but exhibited impaired vision, demonstrating that retinol binding protein plays an essential role in delivering retinol to the eye <xref rid="pone.0050205-Quadro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Two teenage sisters identified to be compound heterozygotes for mutations Ile41Asn (rs121918584) and Gly75Asp (rs1218585) in the <italic>RBP4</italic> gene with retinal degeneration has been reported previously by Seelinger et al <xref rid="pone.0050205-Seeliger1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. One of these siblings had severe acne while the other had iris coloboma. The siblings had no detectable serum retinol binding protein and retinol levels were found to be one sixth of normal levels. These results indicate that RBP4 is important in humans, as RBP is in mice, in delivering retinol to the eye.</p>
      <p>In the present study, exome capture and next generation sequencing were carried out to identify the causative mutation in a consanguineous pedigree with two affected members. The progression of retinal pathology was studied in both patients over a period of 17 years. The key feature of the affected siblings was the presence of rod-cone degeneration. While one sibling had ocular colobomas involving both the anterior and posterior segment, the other sibling was without evidence of coloboma. Identification of the mutation in this pedigree establishes the association of RBP4 mutations with severe RD phenotype involving ocular developmental abnormalities.</p>

An Ag/AgCl electrode was placed on the forehead as the ground. Prior to ERG recording, pupils were dilated fully with topical tropicamide (1%) and phenylephrine (2.5%), and the patient was dark-adapted for 30 min. Scotopic rod-driven responses were recorded first, followed by cone-driven photopic single flash and 30 Hz flicker stimuli.</p>

He also had evidence of conjunctival and corneal limbal neovascularization, which appeared to be secondary to exposure. The view of the posterior pole was limited due to the presence of significant nuclear sclerotic cataract. Fundus examination revealed inferior coloboma of the retina and choroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050205-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) in addition to the retinal degeneration. At age 46, his vision was hand motion OD and light perception OS. Seventeen years later at age 63 his vision was further reduced to light perception in both eyes. Because of the extent of retinal degeneration, his dark adaptation thresholds, visual fields and ERGs could not be recorded at either visit.</p>

        <p>The affected female (IV-4) was evaluated at age 38 years and again at age 55. She reported peripheral vision abnormalities beginning at age 10. Other medical problems include: hypercholesterolemia, acne beginning at a young age and extending into her 50 s, and spine surgery for osteoarthritis. Neither she nor her affected brother had signs of xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, or Bitot's spots.</p>
        <p>Her ocular exams revealed normal anterior segments without evidence of coloboma or other abnormality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050205-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Natural lenses were present in both eyes. Her acuities at age 38 years were 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS. Seventeen years later at age 55, her acuities had diminished to 20/32 OD and only hand motion OS. Fundus evaluation revealed evidence of retinal degeneration in both eyes with peripheral retinal atrophy, intraretinal âbone spiculeâ pigmentation and attenuated retinal arterioles. An island relatively intact retina remained in the central few degrees of the macula surrounding the fovea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050205-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

By age 55 her dark adapted absolute thresholds centrally were elevated 3â4 log units above rod normal thresholds and were consistent with perception by cones. There were no detectable thresholds at 10 degree and 20 degree eccentricity, consistent with total loss of field sensitivity at these locations on Goldmann perimetry. This was worse than 17 years earlier, as her central threshold then was 2 log units elevated above normal and peripheral sensitivity was detectable at 10 degrees and 20 degrees from fixation thresholds at 3â4 log units elevated over normal rod threshold.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Exome sequencing of three members of a consanguineous pedigree identified a novel homozygous <italic>RBP4</italic> mutation in two members with retinal degeneration. Analysis of RBP4, TTR and levels of retinol in serum further established the effect of c.111+1G&gt;A mutation and its association with the retinal degeneration phenotype observed in this pedigree.</p>
      <p>The novel mutation in the <italic>RBP4</italic> gene is predicted to disrupt a donor splice site and would affect the mature proteins translated from the three primary protein coding transcripts (ENST00000371464, ENST00000371469, ENST00000371467) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050205-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). The RBP4 protein (CCDS 3149) has 201 amino acids with a signal peptide (1â16 aa), retinol binding and lipocalin domains <xref rid="pone.0050205-Naylor1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The predicted mutant RPB4 protein would retain an additional 37 N-terminal amino acids after the signal peptide caused by the in frame inclusion of intron 2, resulting in a total of 238 amino acids. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis did not predict the presence of a cryptic splice site that would result in a frame-shifted and truncated protein. A 238 aa mutant RPB4 protein, if stable, would retain both lipocalin and retinol binding domain sequences and the signal peptide. Western blot analysis of the serum of patients did not reveal the presence of immunopositive band corresponding to the wild type protein, but detected a faint band in the region of a predicted RBP4 mutant protein. These results demonstrate that the <italic>RBP4</italic> mutation causes either RNA or protein instability. RBP4 is the carrier of retinol in human plasma and is involved in transport of retinol from liver to peripheral tissue including the retina <xref rid="pone.0050205-Raghu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Lack of RBP4 is expected to affect the levels of serum retinol <xref rid="pone.0050205-Quadro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Consistent with this, the levels of serum retinol were undetectable in both patients with the <italic>RBP4</italic> mutation as compared to their unaffected sister and a normal control. Increased urinary excretion of RBP-retinol complex also occurs with absence of TTR <xref rid="pone.0050205-vanBennekum1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> or by blocking the RBP-TTR interaction <xref rid="pone.0050205-Malpeli1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, leading to reduced serum retinol levels <xref rid="pone.0050205-Raghu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-vanBennekum1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Malpeli1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, the TTR levels of patients with RBP4 c.111+1 G&gt;A mutation and unaffected sibling remained similar, implying that reduced RBP4 levels in both affected siblings is not due to a lack of TTR. Presence of TTR, absence of RBP4 and significantly lowered levels of retinol in both patients with the c.111+1G&gt;A mutation indicate that this mutation causes the loss of functional RBP4 protein and, as a consequence, serum retinol deficiency.</p>
      <p>Lack of normal levels of retinol impairs the visual cycle resulting in night blindness at early stages and prolonged deficiency may lead to retinal degeneration <xref rid="pone.0050205-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Sieving1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Non-ocular symptoms of retinol deficiency may include dry skin, increased susceptibility to infection and acne <xref rid="pone.0050205-Schweigert1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050205-Stephensen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore it is well established that vitamin A plays a key role in embryonic development including optic fissure closure <xref rid="pone.0050205-See1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Patient IV-2 had prominent developmental abnormalities including patent ductus arteriosus, choroidal and iris colobomas. However, his sister IV-4 did not present signs of developmental abnormalities, but she had acne even in the 5<sup>th</sup> decade. These indicate variation in the severity of the retinal degeneration phenotype, developmental abnormalities and non-ocular abnormalities in these two siblings with the RBP4 c.111+1G&gt;A mutation. This variation could be due to either genetic modifiers or nutritional factors such as maternal or dietary vitamin A levels during fetal development and adulthood respectively. Lack of other classical symptoms of vitamin A deficiency including xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, or Bitot's spots in these patients suggest that some dietary vitamin A is being delivered to organs independent of RBP4, but RBP4 is required to deliver sufficient levels of vitamin A to prevent retinal degeneration. Therefore, measuring serum RBP4, TTR and retinol levels may be a useful way to identify RD patients with mutations in genes that affect vitamin A levels.</p>
      <p>Ocular colobomas associated with other abnormalities have been reported <xref rid="pone.0050205-GregoryEvans1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Although the retinal pathology associated with <italic>RBP4</italic> mutations is indistinguishable from the recessive RD phenotype due to mutations in other genes, the additional presence of acne or developmental abnormalities is unique to patients with <italic>RPB4</italic> associated RD <xref rid="pone.0050205-denHollander1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The retinal degeneration associated with the <italic>RBP4</italic> homozygous splice site mutation in our two siblings progressed significantly over a 17-year interval between our examinations in middle age. These patients reported that their vision loss was substantially less severe during their teenage years, but that it became quite severe in their 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> decade such that one had essentially no remaining functional vision by age 45 years. The only other individuals reported with <italic>RBP4</italic> associated RD were two siblings studied by Seelinger et al, who were 13 and 17 years old at the time of the study and had less profound phenotypic changes suggesting the progressive nature of retinal disease caused by <italic>RBP4</italic> mutations <xref rid="pone.0050205-Seeliger1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our patients (IV-2 and IV-4) reported using high dose vitamin A supplementation during the 17 years between examinations. During this time their vision loss progressed significantly but supplementation may have contributed to the lack of development of other symptoms of vitamin A deficiency including Bitot spots.</p>
      <p>The broad genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in retinal dystrophies with the involvement of well over 150 known genes underlying cases of recessive RD clearly indicate the need for employing an efficient, cost-effective genome wide mutation screening protocol. Currently, the availability of tools to sequence the exome, identify variants and determine their effect on the protein makes exome analysis the primary choice to identify causative mutations. This methodology is suitable to screen for mutations in known and novel genes even in smaller pedigrees such as the one presented in this study.</p>
      <p>In summary, exome sequencing and analysis of variants in three siblings from a consanguineous pedigree revealed that a novel homozygous <italic>RBP4</italic> splice site mutation is associated with RD. The RD phenotype associated with the <italic>RBP4</italic> mutation is progressive and results in severe vision loss by middle age. RBP4 RD was also associated with the presence of developmental abnormalities and severe acne in these patients and may be a hallmark of RBP4 associated RD. Analysis of serum vitamin A levels and serum RPB4 may serve as a cost effective initial screening method in determining the potential involvement of RBP4 in patients with retinal degeneration, specifically those with ocular colobomas.</p>
