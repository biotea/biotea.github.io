  <body>
    <p id="P1">We used whole exome sequencing of a single patient with combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) to identify mutations in <italic>ACSF3</italic>, a putative malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase (MCS). Follow-up sequencing of eight additional patients, including an individual who was diagnosed after mining an exome database as well as an affected canine, showed pathogenic mutations. <italic>ACSF3</italic> mutant alleles occur with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.0058 in ~1,000 control individuals predicting a CMAMMA population incidence ~ 1:30,000. CMAMMA is the first human disorder caused by mutations in a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, a diverse group of evolutionarily conserved proteins, and may emerge as one of the more common human metabolic disorders.</p>
    <p id="P2">Methylmalonic acidemias (MMAemias) are heterogeneous disorders that exhibit elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) in body fluids. Deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) or the enzymes (MMAA, MMAB, MMADHC) that synthesize 5â²-adenosylcobalamin comprise most disease subtypes. Some patients have atypical forms of MMAemia, e.g., combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) that lack enzymatic and molecular definition. CMAMMA was first reported in a child with immunodeficiency, failure to thrive, seizures, increased urinary MMA compared to malonic acid (MA) and normal malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. A Labrador retriever with similar biochemical features and neurodegeneration has also been described<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">To determine the cause of CMAMMA, we took a multifaceted approach that included exome and candidate gene sequencing in nine patients, identification of the canine orthologue and mutation analysis in an affected dog, and a novel strategy of hypothesis-generating clinical research in an exome cohort<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. We establish <italic>ACSF3</italic> mutations as the cause of CMAMMA and describe the first disease association with a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) family, enzymes that activate fatty acids for intermediary metabolism<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Nine subjects with CMAMMA participated and six were evaluated at the NIH. The age of diagnosis and symptoms were variable (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After uneventful early decades, four patients were diagnosed in adulthood with neurological manifestations (seizures, memory problems, psychiatric disease, and/or cognitive decline) without vitamin B12 deficiency. Five subjects presented during childhood with symptoms suggestive of an intermediary metabolic disorder (coma, ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, failure to thrive, elevated transaminases, microcephaly, dystonia, axial hypotonia, and/or developmental delay).</p>
    <p id="P5">Methylmalonic and malonic aciduria with urinary MMA/MA &gt;5 was present in seven of nine affecteds (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Serum MMA was elevated but serum B12 levels, acylcarnitines, and total homocysteine were normal, as were malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, 1-C<sup>14</sup>-propionate incorporation, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (<italic>MLYCD)</italic> genetic testing, and sequencing of known MMAemia genes (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Plasma MA was measured by GC/MS in six patients and was also markedly elevated (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We conclude that these subjects all have CMAMMA, which is distinct from other forms of MMAemia.</p>
    <p id="P6">For Subject 1, we sequenced target-selected libraries in the paired-end 101 bp configuration, yielding 114,467 variant genotypes. We used genetic filters for homozygosity or compound heterozygosity. We included nonsynonymous, splice, frameshifting, and nonsense variants as potential mutations but excluded dbSNP variants. We used control exome data<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> to exclude homozygous variants or variants with &gt;10% frequency (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and Online Methods).</p>
    <p id="P7">The filtering strategy yielded 12 genes, from which we selected for further evaluation <italic>ACSF3</italic>, an orphan member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, based on its putative function and predicted mitochondrial localization. We found three <italic>ACSF3</italic> exome variants in Subject 1 (c.1385A&gt;C p.Lys462Thr, c.del1394_1411, p.Gln465_Gly470del, and c.1627C&gt;T, p.Arg558Trp) and confirmed them by Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The variants p.Lys462Thr and p.Gln465_Gly470del were <italic>in trans</italic> with p.Arg558Trp based on parental genotypes and segregated in two unaffected siblings who, like their parents, had normal serum MMA levels. We sequenced <italic>ACSF3</italic> exons in seven additional patients with CMAMMA; six had <italic>ACSF3</italic> variations (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). One patient had no damaging mutations detected.</p>
    <p id="P8">Next, we identified a putative canine <italic>ACSF3</italic> orthologue and sequenced DNA from the CMAMMA Labrador retriever, this showed a homozygous alteration (c.1288G&gt;A, p.Gly430Ser; orthologous to human p.Gly480) in a conserved residue (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This variant was absent in 40 control Labrador DNAs selected for maximum diversity based on American Kennel Club numbers. Finally, we took a novel approach to patient discovery by analyzing exome data of 401 individuals ascertained for cardiovascular phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. We identified a 66 year-old female, apparently homozygous for a c.1411C&gt;T, p.Arg471Trp <italic>ACSF3</italic> variant. She had no known metabolic disease symptoms but reported incontinence and mild memory problems. Her laboratory evaluation showed 48 Î¼M MMA and 11.3 Î¼M MA in plasma and 206 mmol/mol Cr MMA and 26.3 mmol/mol Cr MA in urine, and normal serum B12 levels and acylcarnitines. We did not find mutations in other known MMAemia genes in her exome (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">We identified nine missense, one in-frame deletion and one nonsense mutation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Four subjects were apparently homozygous for <italic>ACSF3</italic> variants. Although it is possible that unidentified deletions might play a role in this disorder, this is unlikely for these individuals (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most of the variants resided in the C-terminal half of ACSF3. Eight out of nine missense mutations and the in-frame deletion were located in conserved ACS motifs predicted to be involved in AMP binding (Motif I), conformational change and catalytic function (Motif II), substrate binding (Motifs III, IV), or catalysis (Motif V)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Western analyses using fibroblasts from Subjects 1â4 and 7 showed the presence of cross-reactive ACSF3 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Fibroblasts from Subjects 1â4 produced 2.4- to 6-fold more MMA than control cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) after chemical stimulation. Viral expression of <italic>ACSF3</italic>, but not <italic>GFP</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) restored metabolism, and provided validation of ACSF3 function in a cell culture biochemical assay.</p>
    <p id="P10">These data establish a candidate gene for CMAMMA using exome sequencing in a single affected with validation using four approaches. First, seven additional probands harbored two mutations in <italic>ACSF3</italic>. Second, an affected dog had a single, unique sequence variant in the canine <italic>ACSF3</italic> orthologue in a conserved residue that was absent in 40 diverse controls. Third, one patient with two <italic>ACSF3</italic> mutations was identified in a cohort of subjects not ascertained for metabolic disease and had biochemical features of CMAMMA. Finally, viral complementation of <italic>ACSF3</italic> in patient fibroblasts corrected the cellular metabolic defect. Based on these observations, we conclude that mutations in <italic>ACSF3</italic> cause CMAMMA.</p>
    <p id="P11">The <italic>ACSF3</italic> gene is an orphan member of the acyl-coenzyme A synthetase gene family, enzymes that thioesterify substrates into CoA derivatives, and weakly activated C24:0 fatty acid<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The biochemical abnormalities in the patients led us to reassess the possible function of ACSF3. When we compared human ACSF3 to <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic> malonyl-CoA synthetase (MCS), a well-characterized enzyme, the proteins were more identical (32%) and similar (50%) to each other than ACSF3 was to the next closest human ACS family member (ACSM3v1, 28% identity). Phylogenetic analyses rooted human ACSF3 with the MCS enzymes versus other ACSs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). To provide preliminary experimental evidence for predicted function, we examined purified, GST-tagged ACSF3 under MCS assay conditions and found that the enzyme activated malonate and methylmalonate, but not acetate, into the respective coenzyme thioesters (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The specific activity of GST-tagged ACSF3 was higher with malonate as a substrate compared to methylmalonate, similar to its prokaryotic homologues. Because the first 58 amino acids of ACSF3 are predicted to encode a mitochondrial leader sequence (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), we performed immunostaining with fibroblasts overexpressing <italic>ACSF3</italic> and a C-terminal GFP-ACSF3 fusion protein. ACSF3 staining showed a distinct mitochondrial distribution and co-localized with a mitochondrial antibody (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The comparative sequence analysis, enzymatic data, and subcellular localization lead us to propose that ACSF3 is a mitochondrial malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase (MCS), an enzyme postulated to catalyze the first step of intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P12">The assignment of ACSF3 as an MCS provides a framework to understand the consequences of the ACSF3 mutations and the metabolic perturbations of CMAMMA. MCS from <italic>R. trifolii</italic> and <italic>B. japonicum</italic> activate malonate and methylmalonate as substrates <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> as does ACSF3 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), suggesting that malfunction of this enzyme causes accretion of the proximal substrates that manifests as methylmalonic and malonic aciduria. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments with <italic>B. japonicum</italic> MCS showed that p.Glu308Gln abolishes malonate binding<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The corresponding human ACSF3 position is the residue mutated in Subject 3, p.Glu359Lys in Motif III, and predicts that this mutation is likely to effect the K<sub>m</sub> for malonate. Arg471 in motif II is nearly invariant in the ACS family<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and essential for acyl-CoA synthetase activity<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, an Arg471 alteration in ACSF3, as in Subjects 5 and 6, likely affects enzymatic function. Other missense alterations (p.Pro243Leu, p.Thr358Ile, p.Gly430Ser (dog), p.Arg558Trp) map to conserved residues in <italic>B. japonicum</italic> and <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic> MCS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) or to conserved residues in other ACSF3 family members (p.Met198Arg, p.Lys462Thr), and are likely to be deleterious.</p>
    <p id="P13">In the ClinSeqâ¢ cohort, there were an additional four participants heterozygous for <italic>ACSF3</italic> variants (p.Glu359Lys n=1, p.Arg558Trp n=3) also found in patients with CMAMMA. The 1000 genomes dataset (estimated coverage of 629 genomes) there were six individuals with ACSF3 mutations (p.Glu359Lys n=1, p.Arg558Trp n=5). Combining these data yields an overall MAF of 0.0058 (95% CI, .0033â.0106) for an estimated disease incidence of ~1/30,000 (95% CI, 1/9,000 â 1/92,000). We predict that CMAMMA is one of the most common forms of MMAemia<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and perhaps, one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Clearly, the spectrum of symptoms and natural history of this disorder are highly variable and require further delineation. The identification of an affected using exome sequencing highlights an interesting and alterative diagnostic approach because CMAMMA is not identified through routine newborn screening (via elevated propionylcarnitine [C3]). We speculate that CMAMMA and other metabolic disorders that have escaped early diagnosis could be identified using genomic techniques.</p>

Adult participants and parents of the younger subjects signed written informed consent for their participation. Patients with CMAMMA were evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center and/or outside records from referring centers were reviewed. Plasma MMA was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) stable isotope dilution analysis and urine organic acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Mayo Medical Laboratories). A GC/MS assay was developed to measure MA in patient samples (Gavrilov et al, unpublished). In brief, D<sub>3</sub> methylmalonic and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-malonic acid were added to plasma, serum or urine, adjusted with NaCl, and acidified. An ethyl acetate extraction was performed and the organic layer was concentrated under N<sub>2</sub> flow. The resulting residue was silylated with BSTFA + 1% TMCS. The samples were then analyzed by GC/MS in the selected ion monitoring mode. Plasma samples from 19 anonymous controls with normal MMA levels were used to develop the reference ranges for MA (mean 0.67 Î¼M Â± 0.14, range 0.38 to 0.89 Î¼M).</p>

        <p id="P18">The filters used in this study included a number of criteria that were implemented using the VarSifter software program for exome and whole genome data management (Teer et al., unpublished). The filters for homozygosity or compound heterozygosity in the proband were used because most metabolic diseases are autosomal recessive and those for mutation type (nonsynonymous, splice, frameshift, and nonsense) were selected because they encompass the majority of disease-causing variants. However, these filters would not detect large deletions, regulatory mutations, or non-canonical splice mutations, which can account for several percent of causative mutations. We also used an exclusion of alleles present in dbSNP, reasoning that the causative variants were uncommon and unlikely to be cataloged there. We used a MAF filter of &lt;10% from a cohort of 258 subjects who were sequenced in our center with similar methodology. We recognized that this frequency was quite liberal, but used it as a starting point, anticipating that it would be adjusted should the initial screen not have yielded a plausible candidate. We reasoned, incorrectly in retrospect, that it was appropriate to filter out variants that were homozygous in controls, as we assumed that no member of the control cohort could have this disease.</p>
