      <abstract>
        <p>Defining mechanisms that generate intratumour heterogeneity and branched evolution may inspire novel therapeutic approaches to limit tumour diversity and adaptation. <italic>SETD2</italic> (Su(var), Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax-domain containing 2) trimethylates histone-3 lysine-36 (H3K36me3) at sites of active transcription and is mutated in diverse tumour types, including clear cell renal carcinomas (ccRCCs). Distinct <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations have been identified in spatially separated regions in ccRCC, indicative of intratumour heterogeneity. In this study, we have addressed the consequences of <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function through an integrated bioinformatics and functional genomics approach. We find that bi-allelic <italic>SETD2</italic> aberrations are not associated with microsatellite instability in ccRCC. <italic>SETD2</italic> depletion in ccRCC cells revealed aberrant and reduced nucleosome compaction and chromatin association of the key replication proteins minichromosome maintenance complex component (MCM7) and DNA polymerase Î´ hindering replication fork progression, and failure to load lens epithelium-derived growth factor and the Rad51 homologous recombination repair factor at DNA breaks. Consistent with these data, we observe chromosomal breakpoint locations are biased away from H3K36me3 sites in <italic>SETD2</italic> wild-type ccRCCs relative to tumours with bi-allelic <italic>SETD2</italic> aberrations and that H3K36me3-negative ccRCCs display elevated DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data suggest a role for <italic>SETD2</italic> in maintaining genome integrity through nucleosome stabilization, suppression of replication stress and the coordination of DNA repair.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with a 5-year survival of &lt;10% for patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common histological subtype, accounting for 80â90% of RCCs.

MutSig analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> which identifies significantly recurrent mutations based on variable mutation rates across the genome, gene size and replication timing, identified 14 genes that were significantly mutated in the data set suggestive of driver status, including <italic>SETD2</italic> (<italic>Q</italic>-value=0, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Chromosomal instability at H3K36me3 sites in SETD2 mutant ccRCC</title>
        <p>Increasing evidence implicates transcriptional aberrations as one route to influence genome stability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> we hence hypothesized that reduced H3K36me3 in the context of <italic>SETD2</italic> bi-allelic aberrations may affect genomic stability in a site-specific manner. Genome-wide distributions of histone marks were obtained from publicly available ChIP-Seq data derived from two normal adult kidney samples (H3K36me3) and one fetal kidney (H3K27me3) from the ENCODE Consortium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> We then mapped genomic H3K36me3 distributions to chromosomal breakpoint regions in the 29 <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> and 210 <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> TCGA samples.</p>
        <p>Chromosomal breakpoints were identified using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data, the resolution of which only permits identification of breakpoint regions (between two genomic segments present at different copy numbers), rather than specific sites of breakage. Breakpoint regions were then defined using 16 different threshold combinations for minimum flanking segment length and maximum breakpoint region length, to take into account the occurrence of false positives in the predicted chromosomal aberrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Using this cohort, we assessed the location of breakpoint regions, with respect to H3K36me3 sites in normal adult kidney, in the 210 <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> tumours and the 29 <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). We generated 5000 random breakpoint region profiles to estimate the expected background frequency distributions of H3K36me3 sites within breakpoint regions for <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> versus <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> TCGA tumours, for each threshold combination.</p>
        <p><italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours did not harbour more breakpoints on average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) and did not show higher chromosomal complexity as measured by the weighted genome instability index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). However, breakpoint regions from <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> samples were significantly depleted of H3K36me3 marks (12/16 threshold combinations with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, such depletion was not observed when mapping the locations of breakpoint regions and H3K36me3 sites in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours. Breakpoint regions in the <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> samples were marginally enriched for H3K36me3 marks (3/16 threshold combinations with <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).

No depletion of H3K27me3, a histone mark found across the genome at similar frequencies to H3K36me3 (12.6% and 12.1%, respectively),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> could be observed in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> breakpoint regions, suggesting that the depletion of H3K36me3 from breakpoint regions in these tumours is specific. In addition to the apparent association between chromosomal breakage and H3K36me3 sites, there was a moderately higher co-occurrence of point mutations with H3K36me3 marks in the <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> samples compared with the <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.04, one-tailed Fisher's test). Taken together, these data suggest that normally H3K36me3 sites are less prone to breakage than the rest of the genome in SETD2 wild-type cells, whereas following <italic>SETD2</italic> bi-allelic mutation or deletion, this apparent site-specific protection is lost, increasing the probability of chromosome breaks at these sites to an equivalent or possibly higher level than the rest of the genome in SETD2 wild-type cells. The fact that H3K27me3 is not depleted in breakpoint regions from the <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>LOH</italic></sub> samples further suggests that this putative protection is specific to H3K36me3. These data suggested a potential role for SETD2 in the maintenance of genomic integrity, mediated through H3K36me3.</p>

        <title>Reduced H3K36me3 and SETD2 expression are associated with DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>In light of the apparent protective role for SETD2 and the selection pressure for <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation in ccRCC as an intermediate event that occurs around the time of detectable branched ccRCC evolution, we explored the relationship between <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation and genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic>. We assessed <italic>SETD2</italic> expression, H3K36me3 levels and DNA damage in a cohort of 202 samples from 100 RCC tumours, assayed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation status was not available for this cohort. However, as SETD2 is the main H3K36 trimethylase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> and the majority of mutations identified to date result in frameshifts or premature stop codons in the N-terminal half of the gene, we used a C-terminal <italic>SETD2</italic> antibody that would not detect <italic>SETD2</italic> affected by protein truncations distal to the reported mutations, the majority of which occur before the C-terminal SRI domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Therefore, SETD2 and H3K36me3 immunohistochemical staining were used as surrogate markers for <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function. A highly significant correlation was observed between SETD2 and H3K36me3 immunohistochemical staining (<italic>P</italic>=3.8e-14, Cochran-Armitage test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>), suggesting that absence of H3K36me3 staining is a good surrogate for <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> DNA damage was assessed by staining for phosphorylated histone 2 A.X (Î³H2AX), which marks ongoing DNA damage signalling and DNA double-strand breaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Both SETD2 and H3K36me3 levels were significantly anti-correlated with Î³H2AX staining (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3b and c</xref>), suggesting that <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function may contribute to DNA damage and double-strand breaks.

        <title>SETD2 is required for efficient DNA repair</title>
        <p>The transcriptional co-activator lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) contains a proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline domain, which has been shown to interact with H3K36me3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> LEDGF is required for CtIP recruitment leading to RAD51 loading and DNA repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> We first investigated the proficiency of homologous recombination (HR) following <italic>SETD2</italic> depletion in RCC cell lines by small-interfering RNA (siRNA). We used two alternative siRNA pools targeting <italic>SETD2,</italic> having excluded some sequences because of off-target effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4a and b</xref>). After 48âh both the pools and individual siRNA sequences efficiently silenced SETD2 and depleted H3K36me3 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures sS4c and e</xref>). Consistent with a defect in HR, SETD2-depleted cells displayed reduced RAD51 foci formation, used as surrogate for detecting active HR, following induction of DNA damage with ionizing irradiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5a</xref>). Using our newly developed quantitative method to assess RAD51 foci formation in large numbers of cells, we found that the proportion of RAD51-positive cells was reduced from 15.1% in control to 2.2% in SETD2-depleted cells and 2.9% in cells depleted of Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1, which was used as a positive control (both <italic>P</italic>=0.003, average from <italic>n</italic>= 3 independent experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells (<italic>SETD2</italic> wild-type) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S5b and c</xref>), and RCC-JW cells (<italic>SETD2</italic> missense mutation, H3K36me3 competent) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5d</xref>). In order to support the specificity of the RNA interference phenotype, we repeated these experiments in the RCC-FG2 line, which harbours bi-allelic aberrations in <italic>SETD2</italic> (no detectable SETD2 protein and barely detectable H3K36me3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S4c and S5e</xref>). No decrease in RAD51 foci formation after IR was observed following <italic>SETD2</italic> silencing in RCC-FG2. Consistent with a defect in HR, SETD2-depleted cells were also more sensitive to IR (<italic>P</italic>=0.035, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). As Rad51 foci formation and HR repair require CtIP-mediated double-strand break end resection, and CtIP recruitment to active-chromatin-associated double-strand breaks relies on the proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline domain-containing LEDGF,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> we speculated that chromatin loading of LEDGF may depend on <italic>SETD2</italic> function. Indeed, we observed reduced chromatin-bound LEDGF/p75 following <italic>SETD2</italic> depletion in RCC cell lines, while there was no decrease in total cellular LEDGF levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Our data therefore support the hypothesis that the defective DNA repair in the absence of <italic>SETD2</italic> could exacerbate the DNA damage observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. This conclusion is further supported by two recent studies, submitted while the manuscript was under preparation, reporting the link between <italic>SETD2</italic>, H3K36me3 and HR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p>

        <title>SETD2 mutations are not associated with mutational signatures of microsatellite instability in ccRCC tumours or cell lines</title>
        <p>A recent study has described a novel role for <italic>SETD2</italic> in mismatch repair and microsatellite instability (MSI) in a renal cancer cell line harbouring a <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> We decided to investigate the contribution of <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation-induced MSI on genomic instability <italic>in vivo</italic>. As MSI is associated with a high frequency of point mutations, we first assessed mutational load in a cohort of <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours from the TCGA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> in comparison with colon tumours with MSI. The mutational load in the <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours was substantially lower than that observed in MSI colon tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). We next assessed MSI in an extended cohort of <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours, in comparison with colon tumours with MSI. We took advantage of a recently defined mutational signature associated with mismatch repair deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Using the same data set as Alexandrov <italic>et al.</italic> (which included 281 of the 293 TCGA samples described above, as well as additional samples from other sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup>), we investigated whether there was a relationship between <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation status and the mismatch repair deficiency signature. Thirty-five out of 324 samples (10.8%) bore a <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation. Only 2 of the 324 samples presented a clear mismatch repair deficiency signature, with one of them also bearing a <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation. However, the sample with the <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation presented LOH on the whole 3p arm, which also encodes the mismatch repair gene MLH1. This tumour also had a MLH1 frameshift insertion on the other allele, leading to the loss of both copies of MLH1. Therefore, it is likely that the MSI signature in this tumour is explained by loss of MLH1 function. In total, 30 samples harboured a <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation in addition to SETD2<sub>LOH</sub>, of which 29 showed no evidence of mismatch repair deficiency according to mutational signatures. To extend our findings and to investigate the relationship between <italic>SETD2</italic> mutational status and MSI in tumours, we assessed MSI in 21 tumours for which we had obtained multiple biopsies from each tumour and for which <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation and chromosome 3p status were known for each biopsy (<italic>n</italic>=140; 23 regions with <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> We examined five markers (D2S123, D5S346, D17S250, BAT25 and D11S904), including four established markers from the Bethesda panel for identification of MSI in colorectal cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> As a positive control, we included five MSI positive colorectal cell lines. We observed no evidence of MSI across the five different markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) including BAT25 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S7i and iv</xref>). Finally, we did not observe MSI over five markers in six ccRCC cell lines, <italic>SETD2</italic>-wild-type (RCC4, RCC-JW and UOK121) and SETD2 mutant (A498, RCC-FG2 and UOK143 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7v</xref>).

        <p>SETD2 has been implicated in regulating the splicing machinery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> and also in the suppression of cryptic transcription initiation within coding exons by coordinating nucleosome assembly following RNA Pol II elongation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> We hypothesized that global transcriptional defects because of loss of SETD2-dependent trimethylation may contribute to the elevated DNA damage and genomic instability observed in the tumour samples. To assess this in ccRCC models, we first performed ChIP-Seq for H3K36me3 following SETD2 depletion to identify genes that were significantly dependent on SETD2 for trimethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Having identified 2513 genes (false discovery rate (FDR)â©½0.05, logFCâ©½â1.5 and logCPMâ¥1) as being dependent on SETD2 for H3K36me3, we then performed ChIP-Seq for RNA Pol II and gene body profiling for the distribution of RNA Pol II across these genes. We observed no global changes in RNA Pol II distribution following SETD2 depletion in RCC4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the absence of global changes in RNA Pol II occupancy, we directly assessed the effect of SETD2 depletion on gene expression, by performing RNA-Seq in RCC4 cells. Surprisingly, only 326 genes (FDRâ©½0.05) showed a significant differential expression between SETD2 siRNA-depleted versus non-depleted samples across the three experiments. The most significant upregulated and downregulated genes were validated by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8a</xref>). A significant overlap was found (Fisher's exact test, <italic>P</italic>-value=0.001211) between these genes and those determined to exhibit differential expression in the TCGA ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> data set (<italic>n</italic>=392) for <italic>SETD2</italic>mut (<italic>n</italic>=49) and <italic>SETD2</italic>wt (<italic>n</italic>=343) cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8b</xref>).</p>

        <title>SETD2 depletion results in altered nucleosome dynamics and DNA replication stress</title>
        <p>Previous studies have suggested impaired loading of the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex as well as changes in chromatin compaction following SETD2 depletion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> In order to study if chromatin architecture was changed following SETD2 depletion in RCC cells, we next investigated chromatin organization by micrococcal nuclease sensitivity assays. Quantitative PCR was performed over regions identified by ChIP-Seq as the most dependent on SETD2 for H3K36me3 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The relative amount of micrococcal nuclease-resistant DNA was calculated relative to a region that was not trimethylated in control cells. These data revealed that in the absence of SETD2, normally trimethylated regions had reduced nucleosome compaction.</p>
        <p>Histone dynamics have an important role in DNA replication, where the stability of the replication complex is dependent on the reassembly of nucleosomes behind the advancing fork.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> In line with this, the FACT complex has been demonstrated to recruit the MCM complex to chromatin during replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> In order to specifically study the role of <italic>SETD2</italic> during S phase, SETD2- and control siRNA-treated cells were studied after release from a double thymidine block. SETD2-depleted cells exited the block and entered into S phase with similar dynamics as control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). We observed reduced chromatin association of MCM7, DNA polymerase Î´ and histone H3, whereas overall protein levels of the replisome components were unaffected in RCC4, RCC-FG2, UOK121 and U2OS cell lines by SETD2 depletion, indicating that impaired nucleosome assembly may affect replication dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 8d</xref>). In support of this, RCC-FG2 cells, possessing <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function and absent H3K36me3, also exhibited reduced loading of replisome components onto chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 8e</xref>). Nucleosome integrity has been demonstrated to have a key role in replisome stability during replication fork progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Given the aberrant nucleosome occupancy and reduced chromatin association of several DNA replication factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c and e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 8d and e</xref>), we wished to directly assess any impact of SETD2 status on replication fork progression using DNA fibre assays.

Consistent with slower replication rates, we noted an accumulation of cells in S phase after SETD2 depletion (50% cells versus 36% in control cells, <italic>P</italic>=0.048, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test,) and an extended S phase duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S10a and c</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we provide several novel insights into the impact of <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function on nucleosome structure, replisome occupancy, replication fork progression and DNA repair by homologous recombination. These are all important cellular functions whose deregulation collectively could contribute to enhanced genomic instability, heterogeneity and adaptability of ccRCCs, thereby conceivably potentiating branched evolution in this disease.</p>
      <p>First, in terms of DNA damage and repair, we have shown that tumours harbouring <italic>SETD2</italic> bi-allelic aberrations display an altered distribution of both chromosomal breakpoints and mutations around H3K36me3 sites compared with tumours with at least one wild-type <italic>SETD2</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). RNA interference experiments revealed a role for SETD2-dependent H3K36me3 in DNA repair by homologous recombination, mechanistically reflecting the requirement for H3K36me3-mediated recruitment of the LEDGF/CtIP complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> critical for double-strand break end resection and thereby eventually for Rad51 loading and HR. These results complement other recent studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> collectively providing evidence for a function of <italic>SETD2</italic>-mediated H3K36 trimethylation in coordinating homologous recombination repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in contrast to a recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> we do not find an association between <italic>SETD2</italic> loss-of-function and MSI in ccRCC in either the publicly available TCGA data set, in patient-derived tumour material or in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> ccRCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). The mutational load in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours was substantially lower than that observed in MSI colon cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>) and we therefore conclude that there is no tangible evidence for an association between <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations and MSI in ccRCC. It is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic>, in contrast to the reported <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, there is rapid adaptation to prevent MSI following <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation. Another possibility is that MSI following <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation is confined to genomic loci normally marked by H3K36me3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Although no association was found with MSI, levels of H3K36me3 were inversely correlated with DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and we observed a shift in the distribution of chromosome breakpoints in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although in wild-type tumours, H3K36me3 sites were significantly depleted of chromosome breakpoints, this depletion was not observed in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours, suggesting that loss-of-function of <italic>SETD2</italic> may unmask sites that are normally protected by H3K36me3. However, we did not observe an overall increase in the number of breakpoints in <italic>SETD2</italic><sub><italic>mut</italic></sub> tumours, as determined by SNP array analysis. This may be explained by relative confinement of the instability to H3K36me3 sites, and the fact that copy number changes identified by SNP array represent only those aberrations that are compatible with clonal expansion. Furthermore, along with others, we have previously found evidence for an optimal degree of genomic instability in tumours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> suggesting that excessive genomic instability can be deleterious and result in autonomous cell lethality and that tumours may align to a âjust-right threshold' of genomic aberrations sufficient to adapt to environmental pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Whereas SETD2 has been implicated in RNA processing defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> we were unable to find any global transcriptional defects in the absence of SETD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8c</xref>). A possible explanation for the difference could be the systems used; a cell line derived from cervical cancer (HeLa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> versus RCC4 cells derived from renal clear cell carcinoma, which harbours 3pLOH. Interestingly, no significant overlap was observed between genes that had lost H3K36 trimethylation and those exhibiting altered expression levels following <italic>SETD2</italic> depletion, suggesting that SETD2-dependent trimethylation does not have a significant role in permitting transcription of genes neighbouring H3K36me3 sites in ccRCC cells. In contrast, there was a significant overlap between the genes deregulated following SETD2 siRNA in RCC4 cells and genes with differential expression in SETD2 mutant tumours versus non-mutant tumours in the TCGA ccRCC set, supporting the use of this approach to investigate the consequences of exclusive SETD2 loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8b</xref>). In conclusion, our data does not support a global transcriptional role for SETD2 in the system studied.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we find that in the absence of SETD2, chromatin compaction is impaired, nucleosome occupancy is aberrantly low and replication fork progression is slowed the latter phenomenon being shared by various conditions that evoke replication stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> The increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease in SETD2-depleted cells over normally trimethylated regions, and reduced chromatin association of histone H3 indicates that replication fork stability may be reduced by altered nucleosome reassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> SPT16, a component of the FACT complex, previously demonstrated to interact directly with H3K36me3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> has also been implicated in the recruitment of the MCM complex to chromatin during replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> DT40 cells with a conditional deletion of the FACT component SSRP1 exhibited S phase defects and impeded replication fork progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> In line with this, we observed that SETD2 depletion resulted in reduced chromatin levels of MCM7 and DNA polymerase Î´ as well as reduced replication fork progression and a prolonged S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), providing a potential explanation for the increased replication stress and DNA damage observed in tumours with reduced H3K36me3 levels.</p>
      <p>Oncogene-induced replication stress is thought to occur widely across human malignancies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> and replication stress has also been observed with the loss of tumour suppressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> As there are few described oncogenic mutations in renal cancer, loss of tumour suppressors may be particularly important in this tumour type. These studies suggest there may be a broader role for replication stress in the initiation of intratumour genetic heterogeneity, mediated through somatic events in distinct genes across different tumour types.</p>
      <p>Our findings may have broader relevance to genetic heterogeneity across different malignancies, as <italic>SETD2</italic> is recurrently mutated in 9% of non-small cell lung carcinomas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> 1 paediatric high-grade gliomas and 8% of adult high-grade gliomas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> albeit usually in the absence of 3p LOH. In addition, the distribution of H3K36me3 is affected by the mutation of glycine-34 (G34V) on the histone variant H3.3, occurring in 60% of paediatric high-grade gliomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Previously, we described that all recurrent somatic copy number aberrations in ccRCC other than 3pLOH are subclonal, present in some cells but not others in the branches of the tumour phylogenetic tree. We also found that <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations often occur following the 3pLOH truncal event in the early branches of the tumour phylogenetic trees, coincident with the onset of tumour diversification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Consistent with the hypothesis that SETD2 loss-of-function contributes to branched evolution, in this study we find that H3K36me3 sites are enriched around breakpoint regions in SETD2 mutant tumours and SETD2 inactivation results in dysfunctional DNA replication and repair, fuelling subclonal diversification.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study suggests that <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations are not associated with MSI in renal cancer, and has revealed a relationship between nucleosome reassembly, replication stress, DNA repair by HR, chromosomal breakpoints and H3K36 trimethylation in ccRCC. This integrative approach may provide useful insights into the contribution of chromatin regulation to genomic instability more generally, by revealing how an altered histone mark unmasks fragile regions within the genome and, as a consequence, find order within chaotic cancer genomes.</p>
