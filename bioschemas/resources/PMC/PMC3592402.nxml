      <abstract>
        <p>TRIM-NHL proteins are conserved regulators of development and differentiation but their molecular function has remained largely elusive. Here, we report an as yet unrecognized activity for the mammalian TRIM-NHL protein TRIM71 as a repressor of mRNAs. We show that TRIM71 is associated with mRNAs and that it promotes translational repression and mRNA decay. We have identified <italic>Rbl1</italic> and <italic>Rbl2</italic>, two transcription factors whose down-regulation is important for stem cell function, as TRIM71 targets in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, one of the defining features of TRIM-NHL proteins, the NHL domain, is necessary and sufficient to target TRIM71 to RNA, while the RING domain that confers ubiquitin ligase activity is dispensable for repression. Our results reveal strong similarities between TRIM71 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> BRAT, the best-studied TRIM-NHL protein and a well-documented translational repressor, suggesting that BRAT and TRIM71 are part of a family of mRNA repressors regulating proliferation and differentiation.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The family of TRIM-NHL ubiquitin ligases is characterized by an N-terminal <underline>tri</underline>partite <underline>m</underline>otif [TRIM; consisting of a RING domain, B-box and coiled-coil (CC) regions] and a C-terminal NHL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B1">1</xref>). TRIM is also found associated with other C-terminal domains and defines a superfamily of TRIM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B2">2</xref>), many of which are functional ubiquitin ligases. TRIM-NHL proteins are conserved among metazoa and are key regulators of development and differentiation. Mammals express four such proteins: TRIM2, TRIM3, TRIM32 and TRIM71. However, apart from <italic>Drosophila</italic> BRAT, which acts as a translational repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B3 gks1032-B4 gks1032-B5">3â5</xref>), the molecular functions of TRIM-NHL proteins are not well-defined.</p><p>Several TRIM-NHL proteins have been identified recently as modulators of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated repression in mammals, flies and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B6 gks1032-B7 gks1032-B8 gks1032-B9">6â9</xref>). miRNAs, in association with Argonautes (AGO) and other proteins of miRNA-protein particles (miRNPs), repress translation of mRNAs and accelerate their decay by base-pairing with mRNA 3â²-untranslated regions (3â²-UTRs). Interaction of several TRIM-NHL proteins with AGOs and other miRNP components has been demonstrated but the functional consequences vary: while mammalian TRIM32 and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> NHL-2 are enhancers of miRNA-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B9">9</xref>), mammalian TRIM71 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mei-P26 act as negative pathway regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B8">8</xref>).</p><p>TRIM-NHL proteins themselves are targets of miRNA repression and <italic>C. elegans</italic> LIN-41 was the first known target of let-7 miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B10">10</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, LIN-41 and let-7 both regulate developmental timing events, LIN-41 preventing premature differentiation of epidermal skin cells and let-7 promoting their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B10">10</xref>). The regulatory relationship of let-7 with LIN-41 orthologs, TRIM71 in vertebrates and Dappled in flies, is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B11 gks1032-B12 gks1032-B13 gks1032-B14 gks1032-B15">11â15</xref>). However, while the molecular function of let-7 as a key regulator driving differentiation in development and disease is well-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B16">16</xref>), little is known about the function of LIN-41/TRIM71.</p><p>TRIM71 is highly expressed in undifferentiated cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, but becomes rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation, when let-7 levels rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B8">8</xref>). Like other proteins that sustain stemness and pluripotency (e.g. MYC, LIN-28 or SALL4), expression of TRIM71 is not only negatively regulated by let-7 but also indirectly up-regulated by ES-cell-specific miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B17">17</xref>). This suggests a role for TRIM71 in the maintenance of stem cell identity or inhibition of premature differentiation. Although gene targeting in mice revealed that TRIM71 is essential for embryonic viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B18">18</xref>), its molecular function remains unknown.</p><p>Here we report that the association of mammalian TRIM71 with mRNAs results in translational repression and mRNA degradation. The NHL domain and the central part of the protein mediate RNA interaction and translational repression, respectively. We have identified targets in human HEK293 and mouse ES (mES) cells that indicate a role for TRIM71 in ES cell maintenance. TRIM71 shares many targets with miRNAs and full repression of these targets requires expression of both TRIM71 and miRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, RNA interference and generation of stable cell lines</title><p>Human HEK293 and HEK293 Flp-In (Invitrogen) cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% heat inactivated FCS. mES cells (E14TG2a.4) were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B19">19</xref>). For time course experiments cells were treated with 5 Âµg/ml Actinomycin D (Sigma), 10 Âµg/ml Cycloheximide (Sigma) or 10 ÂµM MG132 (Calbiochem). Transfections were performed using nanofectin (PAA Laboratories), nanofectin siRNA (PAA Laboratories) or attractene (Qiagen) transfection reagents according to manufacturerâs instructions. siRNAs were ordered from Microsynth and sequences are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1032/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>. To generate HEK293 Flp-In stable cell lines, parental cells were transfected with 5.4 Âµg pOG44, 0.6 Âµg of the respective pCDN5/FRT plasmid and 19.2 Âµl nanofectin per 10 cm dish. Cells were split 48 h post-transfection and selection started 72â96 h post-transfection. Selection of HEK293 Flp-In stable cell lines was carried out using 100 Âµg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) and for the maintenance of HEK293 Flp-In stable cell lines 50 Âµg/ml hygromycin B was added to the culture medium. Knock-down of <italic>Trim71</italic> in mES cells was performed in 6-well plates using a mixture of 3 different siRNAs specific to <italic>Trim71</italic> or allstar negative control siRNA (Qiagen) (at 25 nM final) and 4 Âµl dharmafect1 (Dharmacon) according to manufacturerâs instructions. Medium was changed 4 h and 24 h post-transfection and cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Tethering reporter plasmid pRL-5BoxB and the control plasmid pGL-FL, as well as plasmids encoding NHA- or HA-AGO2 and NHA-LacZ have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B21">21</xref>). Constructs expressing NHA-or HA-TRIM-NHL proteins or mutants thereof were generated by PCR amplification of respective ORFs or fragments thereof and subsequent cloning into pCIneo vectors that contain NHA or HA-tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B20">20</xref>) using SalI and NotI sites, except for full-length TRIM71 which is described below. For the generation of NHA- or HA-TRIM71-NHL<sub>32</sub> and TRIM32-NHL<sub>71</sub> respective fragments were PCR amplified using PCR primer that introduced SalI/XbaI and XbaI/NotI sites. Reporter plasmids pMIR-HMGA2, containing the 3â²UTR of <italic>HMGA2</italic> with either wt or mutated (mut) let-7 sites, and pMIR-KRAS, containing the 3â²UTR of <italic>KRAS</italic>, have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B22">22</xref>). All other 3â²UTR reporters were generated from these vectors by exchange of the respective 3â²UTRs using SacI/NaeI sites. Respective 3â²UTRs were PCR amplified from cDNA of HEK293 or mES cells using primers listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1032/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>.</p><p>pEGFPC1-TRIM71 was generated by releasing the EcoRI-EcoRI and EcoRI-KpnI fragments from Image clone AA 169781 (geneservice), and cloning into the pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech). pCDNA5/FRT-FHA-TRIM71 was generated in three steps: first, a HindIII/KpnI fragment from pEGFPC1-TRIM71 was cloned into pCDNA5/FRT (Invitogen); second, annealed oligonucleotides coding for the FLAG-HA-tag and containing a 3â² end proximal SalI site was inserted via the HindIII site thereby destroying the 5â² HindIII site but leaving the 3â² HindIII site intact; third, the HindIII-HindIII fragment remaining from the HindIII/KpnI cleavage of pEGFPC1-TRIM71 was inserted. All other full-length TRIM71 constructs were generated by releasing TRIM71 from this construct using SalI/NotI sites. pIRESneoFHA-AGO2 and pIRESneoFHA-TRIM32 have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B23">23</xref>). To obtain pGFPC1- and pHIS-MYC-TRIM32, the ORF of TRIM32 was PCR amplified and cloned into the respective vectors via EcoRI/BamHI or SalI/NotI sites, respectively. To construct pCDNA5/FRT-FHA-TRIM32, the ORF of TRIM32 including FLAG-HA-tag were released from pIRESneo-FHA-TRIM32 and inserted into the pCDNA5/FRT vector using KpnI/BamHI sites. For generation of pCDNA5/FRT-FHA-TRIM71 deletion mutants TRIM32 was released from pCDNA5/FRT-FHA-TRIM32 using SalI/NotI sites, leaving the FLAG-HA-tag, and fragments of TRIM71 were PCR amplified and inserted into the vector. Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B24">24</xref>). In case of TRIM71, point mutations were first introduced in TRIM71-NHLonly constructs; SmaI/NotI fragments were then released and introduced into full-length TRIM71. All constructs were verified by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase assays</title><p>Transfections were performed in 12 - or 24-well formats and done in triplicate. For tethering reporter experiments transfection mixtures contained 500 ng pGL-FL, 10 ng RL-5BoxB, 20 ng NHA- or HA-fusion-protein expressing plasmids and 1.6 Âµl nanofectin per 3 wells of a 12-well plate. For 3â²UTR reporter experiments transfection mixtures contained 500 ng pMIR-3â²UTR-reporter constructs, 20 ng protein expressing plasmids and 1.6 Âµl nanofectin per 3 wells of a 12-well plate. Transfection mixtures for reporter gene experiments with simultaneous knock-down of AGO or Pumilio (PUM) proteins contained 2 Âµg pMIR-3â²UTR reporter, 50 ng protein coding plasmids, siRNAs directed against <italic>AGO1</italic>, <italic>AGO2</italic>, <italic>PUM1</italic> or <italic>PUM2</italic> or allstar negative control siRNA (at 100 nM final) and 8 Âµl nanofectin siRNA reagent per 3 wells of a 12-well plate. Transfection mixtures for miR-302 co-transfection experiments contained 1.2 Âµg pMIR-E2F7 reporter, 20 ng protein expressing plasmids, miR-302 b mimic (Dharmacon) or allstar negative control siRNA (at 10 nM final) and 4.5 Âµl attractene per 3 wells of a 24-well plate. Transfections of reporter gene assays in mES cells were done with attractene. Transfection mixtures contained 2 Âµg pGL-FL, 400 ng RL-5BoxB, 200 ng NHA- or HA-expressing plasmids and 9 Âµl of attractene per 3 wells of a 12-well plate or 1.2 Âµg pMIR 3â²UTR-reporter, siRNAs directed against <italic>Trim71</italic> or allstar negative control siRNA (100 nM final) and 4.5 Âµl attractene per 3 wells of a 24-well plate. Cells were lysed 48 h or, in case of knock-down experiments, 72 h post-transfection using passive lysis buffer (Promega) and firefly (FL) and renilla luciferase (RL) activities were measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For all luciferase assays, values represent means of two to five independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, and error bars show standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and western blotting</title><p>Transient-transfected HEK293 cells or HEK293 Flp-In cells constitutively expressing FLAG-HA-tagged proteins were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in whole cell extraction buffer (WCE) [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10% Glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Glycerophosphat, 1 mM NaVanadate, 2 mM DTT and Complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche)] for 30 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 13 000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4Â°C.

Notably, one point mutant (YA) but not others, still pulled down most of the RNA-dependent interacting partners, suggesting that the properties of the four point mutants are not identical although they are all affected in the ability to repress target genes.

TRIM71 associates with mRNAs, resulting in translational repression and mRNA degradation. We have identified several TRIM71 targets and shown that TRIM71 acts via their 3â²UTR. This novel role of TRIM71 as a repressor of mRNA function is reminiscent of the documented role of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM-NHL protein BRAT, which inhibits translation of several mRNAs in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B5">5</xref>), the female germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B32">32</xref>), and the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B4">4</xref>). Strikingly, the similarities between TRIM71 and BRAT extend to the fact that mutations of individual conserved residues within the NHL domain, known to abrogate BRAT function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B27">27</xref>), also abolish the ability of TRIM71 to repress its targets.</p><p>The role of TRIM71 as a repressor of mRNAs is consistent with the proposed role of LIN-41, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRIM71 ortholog, to negatively and post-transcriptionally regulate expression of the Zn-finger transcription factor <italic>lin-29</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B10">10</xref>). Very recently, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRIM-NHL protein Mei-P26 was shown to repress mRNAs in ovarian germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B33">33</xref>). Given the structural similarities of TRIM-NHL proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B2">2</xref>), it is conceivable that other family members also repress mRNAs. Our results indicate that at least mammalian TRIM32 has the potential to do so when tethered to RNA. The activity of TRIM-NHL proteins in repressing mRNAs is further supported by the observation that several TRIM-NHL proteins, including mammalian TRIM32 and TRIM71, <italic>Drosophila</italic> BRAT, Mei-P26 and Dappled, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> NHL-2, interact directly or indirectly with AGO proteins and other miRNA pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B6 gks1032-B7 gks1032-B8 gks1032-B9">6â9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological role of TRIM71</title><p>LIN-41 prevents premature differentiation of epidermal stem cells by negatively regulating the differentiation-promoting transcription factor <italic>lin-29</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B10">10</xref>). The high expression of mammalian TRIM71 in undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B8">8</xref>), its negative regulation by let-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B18">18</xref>), and its indirect up-regulation by ES-cell-specific miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B17">17</xref>) suggest that the activity of TRIM71/LIN-41 to maintain an undifferentiated state is conserved; and indeed recently, mouse TRIM71 was shown to promote self-renewal and proliferation of embryonic neuronal progenitor cells and to prevent their premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B34">34</xref>). Consistent with this role, we have identified <italic>Rbl1</italic> and <italic>Rbl2</italic> as TRIM71 targets in mES cells. RBL1 and RBL2 are transcription factors that negatively regulate the expression of cell cycle-dependent genes and their down-regulation by the action of ES-cell-specific miRNAs was shown previously to be important for stem cell maintenance and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B36">36</xref>).</p><p>We also detected moderate repression of <italic>Ccnd2</italic> by TRIM71 in both HEK293 and mES cells. Although an involvement of CCND2 down-regulation in mES cell regulation has not been reported, <italic>CCND2</italic> was shown previously to be targeted by an ES-cell-specific miRNA in human ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B37">37</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Ccnd2</italic> mRNA levels are strongly up-regulated upon neuronal differentiation of mES cells (J. Krol and W.F., unpublished results). Thus, keeping CCND2 levels low might contribute to stem cell maintenance or inhibition of premature differentiation. It remains to be determined whether the TRIM71 targets identified in HEK293 cells, particularly CCNE2, are physiologically relevant. Interestingly, â¼15% of transcripts down-regulated by TRIM71 in HEK293 cells are Zn-finger transcription factors (compared with 2% of up-regulated genes; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1032/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). These include <italic>Znf362</italic>, the closest mammalian homolog of <italic>Lin-29</italic>, which represents the only proposed target of LIN-41. <italic>Znf362</italic> mRNA was also enriched in TRIM71 IPs and its 3â²UTR was repressed 1.5-fold by TRIM71, suggesting that some TRIM71/LIN-41 targets are evolutionary conserved.</p><p>Notably, although TRIM71 and BRAT (and possibly other TRIM-NHL proteins) appear very similar at the molecular level, their target repertoires and thus their physiological activities differ. TRIM71 and LIN-41 are highly expressed in undifferentiated cells and repress targets like <italic>Rbl1/2</italic> and possibly <italic>lin-29</italic>, respectively, thereby maintaining the undifferentiated state. The opposite is true for BRAT, which is absent in undifferentiated cells and up-regulated upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B39">39</xref>).

Thus, knowing what determines the specificity of TRIM-NHL proteins for mRNA targets will be important for understanding their physiological roles.</p></sec><sec><title>The NHL domain</title><p>We have identified the NHL domain, the defining feature of TRIM-NHL proteins, as necessary and sufficient to target TRIM71 to RNA. Domain-swap experiments between TRIM71 and TRIM32 indicated that the NHL domain provides specificity to target repression. Interestingly, five out of seven alleles identified in the initial screen recognizing <italic>lin-41</italic> as a heterochronic gene have single amino acid substitutions within the NHL domain, emphasizing its importance for protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B10">10</xref>). Also in the case of BRAT, most mutations abrogating its activity have been mapped to NHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, mutation of the NHL residues conserved between TRIM71 and BRAT that are important for BRATâ PUM interaction and BRAT activity also abolished the ability of TRIM71 to repress its targets. Moreover, NHL of TRIM71 was found to interact in an RNA-dependent manner with the two mammalian PUM homologs PUM1 and PUM2. Despite these apparent similarities, two lines of evidence make it unlikely that mammalian PUM1/2 mediate association of TRIM71 with RNA: the PUM consensus motif is not enriched in the 3â²-UTRs of identified TRIM71 targets, and simultaneous knock-down of both PUM1/2 does not abolish TRIM71-mediated repression. Therefore, we favor the possibility that the TRIM71 and PUM1/2 interaction is mediated by RNA and that TRIM71 and PUM1/2 share many mRNA targets. In support of this hypothesis, some TRIM71 targets we identified (<italic>CCNE2</italic>, <italic>HOXA5</italic>, <italic>E2F7</italic>, <italic>MYB</italic> and <italic>CCND2</italic>) have been found associated with PUM2 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B29">29</xref>). Consistently, repression of several tested TRIM71 targets was partially relieved upon PUM1/2 knock-down in the absence of TRIM71 in HEK293 cells.</p><p>It is conceivable that TRIM71 interacts directly with RNA. The NHL domain forms a Ã-propeller structure that resembles structures of WD-40 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B27">27</xref>). Lau <italic>et al.</italic> found that the WD-40 domain of Gemin5 contacts RNA directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B41">41</xref>) and more recently the WD-40 motif has also been identified as putative new RNA-binding platform by Castello <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B42">42</xref>). Hence, it is possible that the NHL domain mediates association of TRIM-NHL proteins with mRNAs by directly contacting RNA. Interestingly, all identified mutations that abrogate BRAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B27">27</xref>), TRIM71 (our work) and Lin-41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B10">10</xref>) activity lie at the electropositive âtopâ surface of the NHL Ã-propeller structure. We attempted to identify the RNA motif that is responsible for TRIM71 association with mRNA. However, neither the dissection of the 3â²UTR of the TRIM71 target <italic>CCNE2</italic> nor a bioinformatic motif enrichment analysis of TRIM71-associated mRNAs revealed a candidate sequence motif (data not shown), possibly indicating that association of TRIM71 involves some structural RNA features.</p></sec><sec><title>TRIM71 and miRNA-mediated repression</title><p>Individual mRNAs are regulated by the interplay of a multitude of different RBPs and miRNAs that control mRNA function. Moreover, single RBPs or miRNAs can target hundreds of mRNAs, forming complex regulatory networks that fine-tune gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B43">43</xref>). Not surprisingly, we found that many TRIM71 targets are also subject to miRNA repression: their expression increased upon knock-down of AGO1/2 in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, many of them have been shown previously to be associated with AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B31">31</xref>), indicating that TRIM71 and the miRNA pathway share common targets. Consistent with this, the TRIM71 targets we identified in mES cells are either predicted (<italic>Rbl1</italic>) or confirmed (<italic>Rbl2</italic> and <italic>CCND2</italic>) targets of ES-cell-specific miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B37">37</xref>). As exemplified by <italic>E2F7</italic>, full repression of these targets requires expression of both miRNA and TRIM71.</p><p>Our model that full repression of some miRNA targets requires expression of TRIM71 resembles observations made for mouse TRIM32 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> NHL-2, which were shown to enhance miRNA-mediated repression by an as yet unknown mechanism without affecting miRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B9">9</xref>). While these reports suggested a role for TRIM-NHL proteins as co-factors or modulators of miRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B6">6</xref>), our results indicate that TRIM71 (and possibly other TRIM-NHL proteins) repress mRNAs independent of the miRNA pathway. Consistent with TRIM-NHL proteins being independent repressors sharing some targets with miRNAs is a recent report identifying Mei-P26 as a repressor of <italic>brat</italic> and <italic>orb</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B33">33</xref>). While repression of <italic>orb</italic> required both AGO1 and Mei-P26, repression of <italic>brat</italic> by Mei-P26 was miRNA-independent. A common mechanism for TRIM-NHL proteins is also inferred from observations that the NHL domain, which is necessary for TRIM71 and BRAT association with RNA, is likewise required for TRIM32 enhancement of miRNA-mediated repression, but the RING/E3-ligase domain, which is dispensable for TRIM71 function (and absent in BRAT), is also dispensable for the enhancement of miRNA-mediated repression by TRIM32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B9">9</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the examples of TRIM-NHL proteins augmenting the effects of miRNAs, there are also reports of Mei-P26 and TRIM71 as negative miRNA-pathway regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B8">8</xref>). Notably, TRIM71 was shown to ubiquitinate AGO2, targeting it for proteasomal degradation and thereby antagonizing miRNA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B8">8</xref>). This effect is not consistent with the repressive activity of TRIM-NHL proteins identified by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B33">33</xref>) and accordingly a more recent report found no evidence for an effect of TRIM71 on AGO2 stability or ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B34">34</xref>). Although we found that both TRIM71 and TRIM32 can facilitate AGO2 ubiquitination, we also did not detect negative effects of TRIM71 or TRIM32 expression on AGO2 stability, either endogenous or when overexpressed. We mapped several ubiquitination sites in AGO2 but have been unable so far to identify their significance (unpublished results). Ubiquitination of endogenous AGO proteins by a global approach has also been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B44">44</xref>). AGO protein ubiquitination is certainly not required for the activity of TRIM71 as a repressor of mRNAs, given that its RING domain, and thus ubiquitin ligase activity, is dispensable for TRIM71-mediated repression. This property is shared with BRAT, an incomplete TRIM protein lacking the RING domain.</p><p>When our article was ready for submission, Chang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1032-B45">45</xref>) reported that <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA is co-repressed by TRIM71 and miR-302 in mES cells. Similar to our results, they also found that TRIM71 does not cause destabilization of AGO2.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1032/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1â3, Supplementary Figures 1â8, Supplementary Materials and Methods, Supplementary Results and Supplementary References [46â50].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>I.L. was the recipient of a DFG fellowship.
