<italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of eukaryotic cellular proteins has been recognized as a modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic proteins. In this study, we examined the membrane localization, membrane integration, and intracellular localization of four recently identified human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins with predicted transmembrane domains. As a result, it was found that protein Lunapark, the human ortholog of yeast protein Lnp1p that has recently been found to be involved in network formation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated polytopic integral membrane protein. Analysis of tumor necrosis factor-fusion proteins with each of the two putative transmembrane domains and their flanking regions of protein Lunapark revealed that transmembrane domain 1 and 2 functioned as type II signal anchor sequence and stop transfer sequence, respectively, and together generated a double-spanning integral membrane protein with an N-/C-terminal cytoplasmic orientation. Immunofluorescence staining of HEK293T cells transfected with a cDNA encoding protein Lunapark tagged with FLAG-tag at its C-terminus revealed that overexpressed protein Lunapark localized mainly to the peripheral ER and induced the formation of large polygonal tubular structures. Morphological changes in the ER induced by overexpressed protein Lunapark were significantly inhibited by the inhibition of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation by means of replacing Gly2 with Ala. These results indicated that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation plays a critical role in the ER morphological change induced by overexpression of protein Lunapark.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is the attachment of myristic acid, a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, to the N-terminal Gly of proteins <xref rid="pone.0078235-Resh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0078235-Resh2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This modification is a well-recognized form of lipid modification that occurs on eukaryotic and viral proteins. In general, myristic acid is cotranslationally attached to the N-terminal Gly residue after removal of the initiating Met. In addition to the cotranslational protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation, it is now established that posttranslational <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation can also occur on many caspase-cleavage products in apoptotic cells <xref rid="pone.0078235-Zha1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0078235-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Both cotranslational and posttranslational <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation are catalyzed by <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferase (NMT), a member of the GCN5-related <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase superfamily of proteins <xref rid="pone.0078235-Dyda1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Many <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins play key roles in regulating cellular structure and function. They include proteins involved in a wide variety of cellular signal transduction pathways, such as protein kinases, phosphatases, guanine nucleotide binding proteins, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins, and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins. In addition to the proteins involved in cellular signal transduction pathways, recent studies have revealed that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation occurs on many disease-related proteins <xref rid="pone.0078235-Cordeddu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0078235-Burnaevskiy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In many cases, the functions of these <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins are regulated by reversible membrane binding mediated by protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation. Thus, protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation has been recognized as a protein modification that occurs mainly on cytoplasmic proteins, and only very few integral membrane proteins have been demonstrated to be <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated so far.</p>
      <p>In viral proteins, however, protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation has been found to occur on integral membrane proteins. It has been demonstrated that the large L envelope protein of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a polytopic membrane protein, is <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated and this modification is involved in the intracellular retention of this protein and is essential for viral infectivity <xref rid="pone.0078235-Persing1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0078235-Gripon1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This protein has the exceptional capacity to form two transmembrane topologies via an uncharacterized process of partial post-translational translocation of its pre-S domain across membranes <xref rid="pone.0078235-Ostapchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0078235-Le1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. HBV L protein with an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated N-terminal pre-S domain plays critical roles in the viral life cycle by mediating receptor binding during host cell attachment. Thus, protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of HBV L protein plays vital roles in the expression of the specific functions of this protein.</p>
      <p>In eukaryotic cellular proteins, only very few integral membrane proteins have been demonstrated to be <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated. One example of an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated integral membrane protein in eukaryotes is mammalian NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase (b5R), which is a single-spanning membrane protein with N-exo/C-cyto orientation and is dually targeted to the ER and mitochondrial outer membranes <xref rid="pone.0078235-Ozols1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Borgese1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In b5R, protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is required for the targeting to the mitochondria, because a non-myristoylated mutant is exclusively localized to the ER <xref rid="pone.0078235-Borgese2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It was further revealed that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation interferes with interaction of the nascent chain with the signal recognition particle, so that a portion of the nascent chains escape from cotranslational integration into the ER and can be post-translationally targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane <xref rid="pone.0078235-Colombo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another mammalian integral membrane protein that has been shown to be <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated is dihydroceramide Î4-desaturase 1 (DES1) <xref rid="pone.0078235-Beauchamp1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. As is the case with b5R, DES1 is dually targeted to the ER and mitochondria, and it was shown that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation favors to localization to the mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0078235-Beauchamp2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, it was also demonstrated that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation positively affected the enzymatic activity of DES1 <xref rid="pone.0078235-Beauchamp1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Ezanno1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we searched for novel human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated transmembrane proteins using four recently identified human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins with predicted transmembrane domains. As a result, it was found that protein Lunapark, the human ortholog of yeast protein Lnp1p that has recently been found to be involved in the network formation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, is an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated polytopic transmembrane protein. Protein Lunapark belongs to the Lunapark family of proteins. It has been reported that this protein might be involved in the development of limbs and the central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0078235-Spitz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, a recent report revealed that Lnp1p, the yeast ortholog of protein Lunapark, is a membrane protein of the ER and is involved in network formation of the ER <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Despite the physiological importance of the protein, biochemical characterization of the membrane integration and membrane topology of protein Lunapark has not been performed. In this study, we first characterized the role of two putative transmembrane domains of protein Lunapark in the membrane translocation and memberane topology formation of this protein. Then, we studied the role of protein N-myristoylation occurs on protein Lunapark on the membrane translocation, membrane topology formation, intracellular localization, and physiological function of this protein. As a result, it was revealed that transmembrane domain 1 and 2 functioned as type II signal anchor sequence and stop transfer sequence, respectively, and together generated a double-spanning integral membrane protein with an N-/C-terminal cytoplasmic orientation. It was also found that protein N-myristoylation did not affect membrane translocation, membrane topology formation, and intracellular localization of protein Lunapark. Interestingly however, immunofluorescence staining of HEK293T cells transfected with cDNA encoding protein Lunapark tagged with FLAG-tag at its C-terminus revealed that overexpressed protein Lunapark localized to the peripheral ER and induced the formation of large polygonal tubular structures, and this phenomenon was significantly inhibited by the inhibition of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation by the replacement of Gly2 with Ala. These results indicated that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation plays critical roles in ER morphological changes induced by overexpression of protein Lunapark. To our knowledge, this is the first report clarifying the role of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation in membrane translocation, membrane topology formation, intracellular targeting, and the function of a human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated polytopic membrane protein.</p>

        <title>Protein Lunapark, an integral membrane protein, is <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated</title>
        <p>We first searched for novel human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated transmembrane proteins using four recently identified human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins with predicted transmembrane domains. In the previous study, we identified 18 novel human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins out of approximately 2,000 KOP human cDNA clones by metabolic labeling and mass spectrometric analyses of proteins expressed using an insect cell-free protein synthesis system <xref rid="pone.0078235-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Bioinformatic analysis of these proteins using SOSUI, a prediction system for membrane proteins <xref rid="pone.0078235-Hirokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suggested that four out of the 18 novel <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins are integral membrane proteins. Therefore, in this study, the membrane localization and membrane integration of these proteins was examined. The cDNA clones encoding the four <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins (serine incorporator 1 (SERINC1), KIAA1609, protein Lunapark (Lunapark), and ZZEF1) analyzed in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0078235-t001">Table 1</xref>. To confirm that these proteins are <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated, metabolic labeling experiments in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system were performed using mRNAs encoding these proteins with FLAG-tags at their C-termini. In this experiment, FLAG-tagged ARF1 protein was used as positive control. As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, all the proteins were expressed, as determined by the incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine. In this case, the relative mobility in the SDS-PAGE gel of <italic>in vitro</italic> translation products of SERINC1 was very low probably because it contains many transmembrane domains. The results of [<sup>3</sup>H]myristic acid incorporation revealed that all the products were efficiently <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated, as shown in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. When these cDNAs were transfected to COS-1 cells and metabolic labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]myristic acid was performed, only two proteins (KIAA1609 and protein Lunapark) were expressed efficiently, as determined by the Western blotting analysis of total cell lysates of the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, left panel). The results of [<sup>3</sup>H]myristic acid incorporation revealed that both of the expressed proteins were efficiently <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated, as shown in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. To determine the intracellular localization of these two proteins, subcellular fractionation experiments using COS-1 cells expressing these two proteins were performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, protein Lunapark was fractionated exclusively in membrane/organelle fraction as was the case with PDI, a membrane/organelle marker protein. In contrast, KIAA1609 fractionated in to both cytosolic and membrane/organelle fractions. These results suggested that KIAA1609 is not an integral transmembrane protein. Therefore, further analyses were performed using protein Lunapark. Protein Lunapark belongs to the Lunapark family of proteins. It has been reported that this protein might be involved in the development of limbs and the central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0078235-Spitz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, a recent report revealed that Lnp1p, the yeast ortholog of protein Lunapark, is a membrane protein of the ER and is involved in network formation of the ER <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Protein Lunapark has orthologous counterparts in plants, fungi, and animals such as in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Drosophila, and vertebrates. Interspecies alignments revealed that the N-terminal <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation motif, two putative transmembrane domains, and C-terminal zinc finger motif were highly conserved among the members of this protein family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Analysis of membrane integration and membrane topology of protein Lunapark</title>
        <p>Since biochemical characterization of membrane integration and membrane topology of protein Lunapark has not been performed, the role of the two putative transmembrane domains and their flanking regions of protein Lunapark on membrane translocation and membrane topology formation was evaluated using TNF-fusion proteins with each of these domains. When pro-GLC-TNF, a model <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated type II transmembrane protein (single spanning membrane protein with N-cyto/C-exo topology) with an <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site in the mature domain of TNF, was expressed in COS-1 cells, a protein band with a molecular mass of 30 kDa was detected in the total cell lysates, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 2. Glycopeptidase F (GPF) treatment of this protein gave rise to a protein band with an approximately 4 kDa smaller molecular mass (26 kDa), indicating that pro-GLC-TNF is <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated when expressed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 3). In this case, 20 kDa TNF was detected in the cell culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 1), suggesting that pro-GLC-TNF was cleaved at the cell surface to generate the secreted form of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated TNF. When the same experiment was performed using Lunapark-TM1-GLC-TNF, in which the mature domain of pro-GLC-TNF was fused to the C-terminus of the N-terminal 73 residues of protein Lunapark, including putative TM1 and its flanking regions, a similar reduction in the molecular weight of the protein was observed after GPF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). The absence of a protein band in the cell culture supernatant indicated that cleavage of Lunapark-TM1-GLC-TNF at the cell surface did not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 4). These results clearly indicated that TM1 and its flanking regions of protein Lunapark functioned as a type II signal anchor sequence and generated single spanning membrane protein with type II (N-cyto/C-exo) topology. When COS-1 cells transfected with Lunapark-TM1-GLC-TNF cDNA were labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]myristic acid and then the same experiment was performed, protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation was observed both on <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated and de-glycosylated protein bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, upper panels), indicating that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation did occur on the integral transmembrane protein.</p>

        <p>To evaluate the role of TM2 and its flanking regions on the membrane topology formation of protein Lunapark, the same experiment was performed using Lunapark-TM1/2-GLC-TNF in which the mature domain of pro-GLC-TNF was fused to the C-terminus of the N-terminal 109 residues of protein Lunapark including putative TM1 and TM2 and its flanking regions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, lanes 3 and 4, GPF treatment did not affect the molecular weight of the protein, indicating that TM2 and its flanking region functioned as a stop-transfer sequence and blocked the membrane translocation of the mature domain of pro-GLC-TNF. When the mature domain of pro-GLC-TNF was fused to the C-terminus of the full-length of protein Lunapark, a similar pattern of protein bands as with that of Lunapark-TM1/2-GLC-TNF was observed after GPF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). These results suggested that membrane translocation and topology formation of protein Lunapark was mediated by the two transmembrane domains, TM1 and TM2 and their flanking regions, and no other regions were involved in the membrane translocation of this protein.</p>
        <p>To confirm the function of TM2 and its flanking regions of protein Lunapark as a stop-transfer sequence, the ability to block membrane translocation was evaluated by testing the ability of this region to block the secretion of a secretory protein. For this purpose, H14-TNF-Lunapark-TM2, in which TM2 and its flanking regions of protein Lunapark were fused to the C-terminus of H14-TNF, a model secretory protein, was generated. When the H14-TNF cDNA was transfected to COS-1 cells, mature secretory TNF was detected in the cell-culture supernatant, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078235.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, lane 1. In the case of H14-TNF-Lunapark-TM2, the secretion of mature TNF was completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078235.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, lane 3). When TM2 and its C-terminal flanking region (Ala74-Glu107) was deleted from this construct, efficient secretion of mature TNF was observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078235.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, lane 5. These results clearly indicated that TM2 of protein Lunapark functioned as a stop-transfer sequence and blocked the secretion of mature TNF from the cells.</p>

        <p>To determine whether protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is required for the membrane translocation of protein Lunapark mediated by TM1 and its flanking regions, membrane translocation of Lunapark-TM1-G2A-GLC-TNF, in which the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation motif is disrupted by replacing Gly2 with Ala, was evaluated.

        <title>ER morphological changes induced by overexpression of protein Lunapark and its dependency on protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation</title>
        <p>In order to determine the role of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of protein Lunapark in the intracellular localization of this protein, cDNAs encoding protein Lunapark C-terminally tagged with FLAG tag and its G2A mutant were generated, and their intracellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence analysis of HEK293 T cells transfected with these cDNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, [<sup>3</sup>H]myristic acid labeling revealed that Lunapark-FLAG was efficiently <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated, whereas incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]myristic acid was not observed on Lunapark-G2A-FLAG. Immunofluorescence analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with cDNA encoding Lunapark-FLAG revealed that overexpressed Lunapark-FLAG showed a characteristic distribution pattern with large polygonal tubular structures, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g005">Figure 5B, a</xref>. In contrast, in the case of Lunapark-G2A-FLAG, the characteristic distribution pattern with a large polygonal tubular structure was not observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g005">Figure 5B, b</xref>. Because a reticular network structure was observed on the ER, it was speculated from these observations that protein Lunapark specifically localized to the ER and induced tubular ER formation in an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation-dependent manner. In order to prove this, effect of overexpression of protein Lunapark on the distribution of ER localized protein was evaluated. For this experiment, EGFP-Sec61Î² was used as general ER marker protein that distributes throughout the ER <xref rid="pone.0078235-Shibata1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In HEK293T cells expressing EGFP-Sec61Î², perinuclear localization of EGFP-Sec61Î² was observed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g006">Figure 6A, b</xref>. In this case, peripheral tubular structure was not observed even in the overexposed black-and-white image (bâ²). When HEK293T cells expressing EGFP-Sec61Î² were stained with ER-Tracker Red, EGFP-fluorescence of EGFP-Sec61Î² completely merged with fluorescence of ER-Tracker Red as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g006">Figure 6B, j,k,l</xref>. These results clearly demonstrated the specific localization of EGFP-Sec61Î² to the ER. When EGFP-Sec61Î² was coexpressed with Lunapark-FLAG, large polygonal structure around the perinuclear sheet was observed with EGFP-Sec61Î² (e,eâ²). This peripheral tubular structure detected with EGFP-Sec61Î² was well merged with the peripheral tubular structure observed with Lunapark-Flag (dâ²,eâ²,fâ²). In contrast, when EGFP-Sec61Î² was coexpressed with non-myristoylated Lunapark-G2A-FLAG, the characteristic distribution pattern with a large polygonal tubular structure was not observed with EGFP-Sec61Î², as is the case with the distribution pattern of Lunapark-G2A-FLAG, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g006">Figure 6A, g,gâ²,h,hâ²</xref>.

In order to further confirm this, quantitative analysis of the morphological change of the ER in cells expressing both EGFP-Sec61Î² and protein Lunapark (EGFP-positive/immunofluorescence-positive cells) was performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078235.s002">Figure S2A and B, </xref>significant difference in the induction of the ER morphological change was observed between Lunapark-FLAG and Lunapark-G2A-FLAG, and highly tubular ER was observed only on cells expressing wild-type Lunapark-FLAG.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation occurs mainly on cytoplasmic proteins in eukaryotic cellular proteins and only very few integral membrane proteins have been demonstrated to be <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated so far. In the present study, we searched for human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated transmembrane proteins and studied the role of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation on membrane translocation, membrane topology formation, intracellular targeting, and physiological function of the proteins. Recently, we have established a strategy for the comprehensive identification of human <italic>N-</italic>myristoylated proteins from human cDNA clones in human cDNA resources by metabolic labeling and mass spectrometric analyses of proteins expressed using an insect cell-free protein synthesis system <xref rid="pone.0078235-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Sakurai2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Using this strategy we have identified 27 <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins out of approximately 2,000 Kazusa ORFeome project (KOP) human cDNA clones. Database searches with these 27 cDNA clones revealed that 18 encoded novel <italic>N-</italic>myristoylated proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of these proteins using SOSUI, a prediction system for membrane proteins <xref rid="pone.0078235-Hirokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suggested that four out of the 18 novel <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins are integral membrane proteins. Therefore, in the present study, membrane localization and membrane integration of these four proteins were studied. As a result, it was found that protein Lunapark, the human homologue of yeast protein Lnp1p <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which has recently been found to be involved in network formation of the ER, is an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated double-spanning integral membrane protein of ER with an N-/C-terminal cytoplasmic orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g001">Fig. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">4</xref>). As previously described, it has been reported that both of two mammalian <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated transmembrane proteins so far discovered (b5R and DES1) are dually targeted to the ER and mitochondria, and protein N-myristoylation favors to localization of these two proteins to the mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0078235-Borgese2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Beauchamp2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These observations might indicate that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal in mammalian integral transmembrane proteins. However, the present study clearly demonstrated that <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated protein Lunapark localizes exclusively to the ER. Thus, protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation does not necessarily function as a mitochondrial targeting signal of mammalian integral transmembrane proteins. The <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation occurring on protein Lunapark is not required for membrane translocation or topology formation of protein Lunapark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Instead, it was revealed that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation plays critical role in the ER morphological change induced by overexpression of protein Lunapark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g007">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>The ER plays a critical role in many cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, protein modification and the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0078235-Baumann1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It consists of an extended polygonal network of tubules connecting to ER sheets and the nuclear envelope. The ER network extends throughout the cell by a dynamic process of tubule extension and tubule fusion <xref rid="pone.0078235-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Several protein families are involved in the generation and maintenance of the distinctive architecture of ER. The reticulons and DP1/Yop1p play central roles in the generation and maintenance of the reticular structure of ER <xref rid="pone.0078235-Goyal1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Voeltz1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Atlastin, a dynamin-like GTPase, promotes ER tubule fusion, which leads to the formation of new three-way junctions within the polygonal network <xref rid="pone.0078235-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Orso1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In addition to these proteins, it was reported recently that a yeast protein Lnp1p, a member of the Lunapark family of proteins, is required for ER network formation <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Lnp1p was found to interact with the reticulons, Yop1p, and Sey1p (yeast ortholog of atlastin) and localize to the ER tubule junctions in both yeast and mammalian cells. It was also found that the interaction of Lnp1p with reticulon and the localization of Lnp1p to ER junctions are regulated by Sey1p. From these results, it was proposed that Lnp1p and Sey1p act antagonistically to balance polygonal network formation.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we showed that protein Lunapark, the human ortholog of Lnp1p, is <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated and localized mainly to the peripheral ER and induced the formation of large polygonal tubular structures when overexpressed in human cells. The morphological change in the ER induced by protein Lunapark was significantly inhibited by the inhibition of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation by the replacement of Gly2 with Ala, suggesting that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation plays a critical role in the ER morphological change induced by overexpression of protein Lunapark. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g007">7A</xref>, the N-terminal <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation motif, two transmembrane domains, and the C-terminal zinc finger domain were highly conserved among the Lunapark family of proteins. Interestingly, however, the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation motif was not found in yeast Lnp1p. In addition, the amino acid sequences of N-terminal region, two transmembrane domains, and the C-terminal zinc finger domain of yeast Lnp1p are significantly different from those of other Lunapark family members. In fact, the peptide LNPARK, which is present near the C-terminus of the zinc finger domain of most of the Lunapark family of proteins and is the origin of the name Lunapark <xref rid="pone.0078235-Spitz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, is not present in Lnp1p. Thus, the amino acid sequence, the susceptibility to protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation, and the intracellular localization of human protein Lunapark were different from those of yeast protein Lnp1p. From these observations, it is speculated that the structure and the physiological function of yeast Lnp1p might be different from those of other Lunapark family members. The molecular mechanism by which protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation strongly affects the ER morphological change induced by protein Lunapark is not clear. In general, the functions of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins are regulated by reversible membrane binding mediated by protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation <xref rid="pone.0078235-Resh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Resh2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Escriba1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Because protein Lunapark is an integral membrane protein, it is unlikely that protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of protein Lunapark functions as a membrane anchor. In fact, we have shown in this study that neither the ER membrane translocation nor the specific localization to ER membrane required protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation. In some <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins, such as CAP-23/NAP-22, specific proteinâprotein interactions mediated by protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation play critical roles in the expression of protein function <xref rid="pone.0078235-Matsubara1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation dependent proteinâprotein interaction might be involved in the function of protein Lunapark. The fact that the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated Lunapark-CtoA-FLAG, in which the four conserved cysteine residues in the zinc finger motif were mutated to alanine, could not induce the characteristic tubular ER formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078235-g007">Fig. 7C, e, f</xref>), suggested that <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation by itself is not sufficient to induce the ER morphological change. Zinc finger motifs are relatively small protein motifs that fold around one or more zinc ions and are widely found in eukaryotes. Many zinc finger proteins are DNA-binding proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0078235-Bitar1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In addition to their role as a DNA-binding motif, zinc finger motifs have been shown to mediate proteinâprotein or proteinâlipid interactions <xref rid="pone.0078235-Brayer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078235-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, it is probable that specific proteinâprotein or proteinâlipid interactions mediated by the zinc finger motif of protein Lunapark plays a critical role in the induction of the ER morphological change. Because yeast Lnp1p was found to interact with the reticulons, Yop1p, and Sey1p <xref rid="pone.0078235-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, human protein Lunapark might also interact with reticulons, DP1, and atlastin. In order to clarify the molecular mechanism of the ER morphological change induced by protein Lunapark, it is necessary to study the interaction of protein Lunapark with these proteins and the role of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation and the zinc finger domain of protein Lunapark on these interactions. Thus, further studies will be required to elucidate the roles of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation on the functions of protein Lunapark or other members of the Lunapark protein family.</p>
      <p>In this study, we showed that protein Lunapark, a double-spanning integral membrane protein of the ER, is <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated, and the <italic>N-</italic>myristoylation of protein Lunapark strongly affected the ER morphological change induced by this protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report clarifying the role of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation on the membrane translocation, membrane topology formation, intracellular targeting, and function of a human <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated polytopic membrane protein. The number of human proteins with an N-terminal Met-Gly sequence in all the human proteins listed in the Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase (â¼20,000 proteins) is approximately 1,600. Bioinformatic prediction of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation coupled with a prediction system for membrane proteins predicted that more than 50 proteins with an N-terminal Met-Gly sequence are <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated integral transmembrane proteins. We are currently studying the susceptibility to protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation, membrane integration, and physiological role of protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of these candidate proteins.</p>

<bold>Quantitative analysis of the ER morphological change in HEK293T cells induced by Lunapark-FLAG (WT) and Lunapark-G2A-FLAG (G2A).</bold> HEK293T cells were cotransfected with EGFP-Sec61Î² and Lunapark-FLAG (or Lunapark-G2A-FLAG), and quantitative analysis of the ER morphological change was performed by fluorescence microscopic observation of 100 cells expressing both EGFP-Sec61Î² and protein Lunapark (EGFP-positive/immunofluorescence-positive cells). A. Left panels (a, d) show merged image of EGFP fluorescence, immunofluorescence, and Hoechst staining. Right panels (b, c, e, f) show a close-up and over-exposed image of the area surrounded by a white box in the left panels (a, d). B. The extent of ER morphological changes is expressed as a percentage of the number of cells having highly tubular, partially tubular, and non-tubular image of EGFP-Sec61Î² against the total number of EGFP-positive/immunofluorescence-positive cells. Data are expressed as mean Â± SD for four independent experiments. **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 vs. WT.</p>
