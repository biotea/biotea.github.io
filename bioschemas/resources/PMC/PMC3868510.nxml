      <abstract>
        <p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) - and herpesviruses in general - encode for a multipartite entry/fusion apparatus. In HSV it consists of the HSV-specific glycoprotein D (gD), and three additional glycoproteins, gH/gL and gB, conserved across the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family and responsible for the execution of fusion. According to the current model, upon receptor binding, gD propagates the activation to gH/gL and to gB in a cascade fashion. Questions remain about how the cascade of activation is controlled and how it is synchronized with virion endocytosis, to avoid premature activation and exhaustion of the glycoproteins. We considered the possibility that such control might be carried out by as yet unknown receptors. Indeed, receptors for HSV gB, but not for gH/gL, have been described. In other members of the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family, such as Epstein-Barr virus, integrin receptors bind gH/gL and trigger conformational changes in the glycoproteins. We report that Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins serve as receptors for HSV entry into experimental models of keratinocytes and other epithelial and neuronal cells. Evidence rests on loss of function experiments, in which integrins were blocked by antibodies or silenced, and gain of function experiments in which Î±vÎ²6-integrin was expressed in integrin-negative cells. Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins acted independently and are thus interchangeable. Both bind gH/gL with high affinity. The interaction profoundly affects the route of HSV entry and directs the virus to acidic endosomes. In the case of Î±vÎ²8, but not Î±vÎ²6-integrin, the portal of entry is located at lipid microdomains and requires dynamin 2. Thus, a major role of Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin in HSV infection appears to be to function as gH/gL receptors and to promote virus endocytosis. We propose that placing the gH/gL activation under the integrin trigger point enables HSV to synchronize virion endocytosis with the cascade of glycoprotein activation that culminates in execution of fusion.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In order to infect their hosts and cause disease, viruses must enter their host cells. The human pathogen herpes simplex virus (HSV) - and herpesviruses in general - are equipped with a complex, multipartite entry apparatus, made of four glycoproteins â gD, gH/gL, gB. These glycoproteins must be activated in a timely, coordinated manner. According to the current model, the flux of activation goes from receptor-bound gD, to gH/gL and gB. The premature activation, and hence exhaustion of the glycoproteins must also be prevented. We report on a checkpoint at the gH/gL level. Specifically, Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins serve as receptors for HSV entry into keratinocytes and other epithelial and neuronal cells. Both bind gH/gL with high affinity. The interaction profoundly affects the pathway of HSV entry, promoting HSV endocytosis into acidic endosomes. For Î±vÎ²8-integrin, the portal of entry is at lipid microdomains and requires dynamin 2. We propose that, by placing the activation of gH/gL under control of an integrin trigger point, HSV can synchronize virion endocytosis with the cascade of activation that culminates in the execution of fusion between the virion envelope and cellular membranes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The glycoproteins of enveloped virions fulfill three major functions to enable virus entry into target cells; the attachment of virions to cells, a step that partly determines the type of cells that the virus targets, hence the viral tropism; the triggering of fusion, i.e. the activation of the fusion machinery, and the execution of fusion. For a number of viruses, a fourth event occurs between these steps, virion internalization by endocytosis, or macropinocytosis. The domains responsible for all these activities are often localized in one or two glycoproteins; this is the case for example for ortho-, paramyxo- and retroviruses. Virion glycoproteins can be considered ready-to-use machines that need to undergo a transition in conformation from the metastable fusion-inactive to the fusion-active form, in order to induce the merging of the two membranes - that of the virion and that of cell - so that lipids are mixed and fusion is executed <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A fundamental aspect of the process is that the steps are sequentially ordered and coordinated, to ensure that the glycoprotein transition takes place only after the virus has attached to the cells. Indeed, a premature activation would irreversibly exhaust the fusogenic potential of the virion glycoproteins, and lead to failure to infect. A key question is therefore how the timing of glycoprotein transition and activation is controlled. Essentially, there are two strategies. Either the glycoprotein transition is dependent on the glycoprotein encounter with the cognate cellular receptor, or on the low pH of the endosomal compartment. These levels of control guarantee that the virion fusion machinery is only active after the virus has attached to cells, or, for those viruses which undergo internalization, after they have been endocytosed and the endosomal pH has been lowered. According to this view, two major functions of cellular receptors are determination of viral tropism and triggering of fusion.</p>
      <p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpesviruses in general, exhibit a high level of complexity since they encode a multipartite entry/fusion machinery <xref rid="ppat.1003806-CampadelliFiume1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Connolly1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Some of the herpesvirus glycoproteins are species-specific; they play a role in the initial steps of virus entry and interact with receptors that belong to variety of molecular families. A prototypic example is HSV glycoprotein D (gD) that binds alternatively two major receptors, nectin1 and herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Geraghty1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Montgomery1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It functions as a determinant of HSV tropism and as the trigger of fusion capable to activate the downstream glycoproteins gH/gL and gB <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Cocchi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Atanasiu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Conformational modification of gD following receptor binding was inferred by structural, biochemical and molecular biology approaches <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Cocchi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Fusco1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Carfi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-DiGiovine1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. gD encodes a specific domain â the profusion domain - that interacts with, or at least propagates the activation to gH/gL, and thereafter or simultaneously activates gB in a cascade fashion <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Avitabile1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Atanasiu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-CampadelliFiume2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Species-specific glycoproteins among human herpesiviruses include Epstein Barr virus (EBV) gp42, which binds major histocompatibility complex II to enable virus entry into lymphocytic cells <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Mullen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoproteins of the 128â131 locus <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which confer endothelial and epithelial tropism; the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) gQ1-gQ2 that enable gH/gL interaction with CD134 <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the species-specific glycoproteins, three glycoproteins - the heterodimer gH/gL and gB - constitute the conserved core fusion apparatus across the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family. gB has structural features typical of fusion glycoproteins. In contrast, gH/gL does not resemble any known structure. A number of approaches support the view that gH/gL acts as an intermediate in the activation cascade of HSV entry/fusion glycoproteins. Remarkably, for some herpesviruses, gH/gL or gB serve as major receptor-binding glycoproteins and therefore their activation may be under the direct control of encounter with the receptor. Thus, members of the integrin family serve as receptors for EBV and HCMV gH/gL <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chesnokova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Boehme1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and for HHV-8 gB <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chandran1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. EphrinA2 receptor serves as a receptor for HHV-8 gH/gL <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chakraborty1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Hahn2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Receptors for HSV gB and varicella zoster virus (VZV) gB include paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha (PILRÎ±), myelin associated glycoprotein, and non-muscle myosin IIA <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Arii1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Suenaga1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>; their role in virus entry remains to be fully elucidated.</p>
      <p>We have recently discovered two additional functions of cellular receptors for HSV, namely that they serve as routing factors to define the pathway of entry and that they serve as viral sensors capable of initiating the innate response of the cell, and thus coupling virus entry to the innate response. Specifically, HSV enters different cells by different pathways. Î±vÎ²3-integrin is a determinant in the choice of the HSV pathway of entry which routes the HSV receptor nectin1, and consequently HSV, to lipid microdomains <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In this way, Î±vÎ²3-integrin enables entry of HSV through a pathway dependent on lipid microdomains, dynamin 2 and acidic endosomes. Î±vÎ²3-integrin interacts at low affinity with HSV gH/gL <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Parry1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, Î±vÎ²3-integrin also binds Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which, in turn, binds gH/gL<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Leoni1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this way Î±vÎ²3-integrin senses HSV and cooperates with and reinforces the TLR2âdependent response <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A signaling cascade is initiated that leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB, and to production of intereferon (IFN) Î± and Î², the major innate defenses of the cell against HSV <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we investigated whether integrins other than Î±vÎ²3 play a role in HSV entry. We investigated the Î±v group of integrins, which are preferentially expressed in epithelial cells, and bind their ligands through the RGD domain. Î±vÎ²6-integrin is upregulated in epithelial malignancies. We report that Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins serve as interchangeable HSV receptors for entry into keratinocytes, other epithelial and neuronal cells. Each integrin acted independently of the other. Both bind gH/gL at high affinity. This interaction profoundly affects the pathway of HSV entry, which takes the way of acidic endosomes. In the case of Î±vÎ²8-integrin, the portal of entry is located at lipid microdomains and requires dynamin 2. In the case of Î±vÎ²6-integrin, the portal of entry is located outside the lipid microdomains and does not need dynamin 2. We propose that the major role of Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins as gH/gL receptors is to promote HSV endocytosis, and thereby to synchronize virion internalization with the cascade of glycoprotein activation.</p>

        <title>A soluble form of HSV gH/gL binds Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins at high affinity</title>
        <p>The interaction between HSV gH/gL and integrins was explored using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy of soluble integrins and soluble gH/gL. A kinetic analysis of integrin binding to increasing concentrations of soluble gH/gL indicated that gH/gL interacted with both Î±vÎ²6-integrin and with Î±vÎ²8-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). To obtain rate constants of gH/gL binding and to calculate a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), k<sub>obs</sub> was plotted against the concentration of gH/gL. The dependence of k<sub>obs</sub> on gH/gL concentration was described by a linear function suggesting that the interaction has a single step. The intersection point with the Y-axes corresponds to a dissociation rate constant k<sub>off</sub>, and the slope to an associate rate constant k<sub>on</sub>. The rate constants and the resulting K<sub>D</sub> values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003806-t001">Table 1</xref>) are indicative of a high affinity interaction. In contrast, no interaction between integrin Î±vÎ²5 and gH/gL was detected.</p>

By qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) Î²8-integrin was expressed at higher levels than Î²6-integrin in 293T, HeLa and SK-N-SH cells, and to comparably high levels in SW480 and HaCaT cells. The epithelial cell lines were analyzed also by flow cytometry; they exhibited the highest fluorescence intensity with the antibody to Î±vÎ²6-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g002">Fig. 2 B</xref>). A direct comparison between Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrin extent of expression in a same cell line can not be performed by flow cytometry, since reactivity in this assay is strongly influenced by the properties of the antibody being used.</p>

        <title>MAbs to Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin or silencing of Î²6- or Î²8-integrin inhibit HSV-1 infection</title>
        <p>To define if Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrin play a role in HSV infection, we tested the effect of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to Î±vÎ²6-integrin (MAb 2077Z), or Î±vÎ²8-integrin (MAb 37E1), on HSV-1 infection. The neutralizing R1.302 MAb to nectin1 was used as a positive control. Cells were preincubated with increasing amounts of MAbs, and infected in the presence of MAbs with the recombinant R8102 which carries a Lac-Z reporter gene. A large body of evidence indicates that the extent of Î²-galactosidase (Î²-gal) expression directly reflects the extent of infection <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Geraghty1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Cocchi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g003">Fig. 3AâE</xref> shows that MAbs to Î±vÎ²6 or to Î±vÎ²8-integrin inhibited R8102 infection in a dose-dependent manner in all cells. The only exception was MAb to Î±vÎ²8-integrin which failed to inhibit infection in 293T cells, even though these cells exhibited cell surface expression of this integrin. Thus, both Î±vÎ²6 and Î±vÎ²8-integrins play a critical role in HSV infection of epithelial, keratynocytic and neuronal cells.</p>

        <p>Because all cell lines tested contained both Î±vÎ²6-integrin and Î±vÎ²8-integrin, we asked whether each one of the two integrins is required independently one of the other, or whether they play an interchangeable role. In the latter case, the expectation is that in cells silenced for a single integrin, the extent of inhibition of infection is smaller than the extent of silencing. By contrast, in cells simultaneously silenced for both integrins, the inhibition of infection is expected to be higher than that achieved in cells silenced for a single integrin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g004">Fig. 4BâD</xref> shows the extent of silencing as percentage of positive cells; their mean fluorescence intensities is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g002">Fig. 2 E, H</xref>. Indeed, in 293T cells silenced for either or the other integrin, infection was reduced to a lower extent than expression. When the two integrins were simultaneously silenced, infection dropped to about 10%. In a replicate experiment, R8102 infection in singly or doubly silenced cells was quantified by means of Î²-gal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g004">Fig. 4 E</xref> shows that infection was inhibited by about 75% in double-silenced cells, and by about 50% in singly silenced cells. The results indicate that Î±vÎ²6-integrin and Î±vÎ²8-integrin play each a critical role in HSV infection, each independently of the other. Thus, they appear to act in an interchangeable fashion.</p>

To authenticate the results, infection was carried in the presence or absence of MAb 2077Z to Î±vÎ²6-integrin, MAb L230 to Î±v-subunit, or polyclonal antibody (PAb) R140 to HVEM as a control.

Extent of infection in Î±vÎ²6-integrin<sup>+</sup> K562 cells was strongly inhibited when infection took place in the presence of MAb 2077Z to Î±vÎ²6-integrin (3.12%), or MAb L230 to Î±v-subunit (5.2%), or in the presence of anti-HVEM PAb R140 (1.98%). Although the percentage of infected cells is rather low, in agreement with well-known resistance to HSV infection exhibited by this type of cells <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Mastino1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the results clearly indicate that expression of Î±vÎ²6-integrin enhances HSV infection of K562 cells; furthermore, the single Î±vÎ²6-integrin â in the absence of Î±vÎ²8-integrin - was sufficient to induce the increase in infection. The latter finding reinforces the conclusion drawn from the previous series of experiments that each of the two integrins is sufficient to promote HSV infection.</p>

        <p>The next series of experiments was designed to shed light on the role played by Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin in HSV infection. First, we defined the step(s) in the HSV entry process in which they participate. Cells were exposed to anti-integrin antibodies prior, during and post virus absorption to cells, prior and during virus absorption, or only after virus absorption to cells. The extent of inhibition of infection was then quantified. These experiments could not be performed in 293T cells, as in these cells the anti- Î±vÎ²8-integrin MAb fails to inhibit infection (see, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g006">Fig. 6 A and B</xref>, the highest extent of inhibition was seen when MAbs were present prior, -during and post virus absorption to cells. The decrease seen when Abs were present prior and during, but not post virus absorption was somewhat lower. The presence of Abs after virus absorption decreased infection by about 20%. The results are consistent with the view that blocking Î±vÎ²6 or Î±vÎ²8-integrins with antibodies inhibits virus infection at different steps in the virus entry process, and suggest a role for integrins at attachment and post-attachment steps.</p>

        <p>To verify a role for Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrin in HSV attachment, we measured the effect of integrin silencing on HSV absorption to cells at 4Â°C. Virus absorption was quantified as a decrease in infectious virions present in the inoculum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g006">Fig. 6 CâE</xref> shows that virus absorption was inhibited by about 50% in Î²6- or Î²8-integrin silenced 293T, HeLa, and SW480 cells, indicating that Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins contribute to virus absorption to cells. This contribution is small relative to that exerted by heparan sulphate. In cells where heparan sulphate is removed by treatment with heparitinase, in mutants defective in heparan sulphate biosynthesis, or in cells in which infection is competitively blocked by heparin, the decrease in infection is about hundred fold <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Spear1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>

        <title>Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins do not substitute for nectin1, yet they greatly increase extent of infection in cells that express nectin1 at low levels</title>
        <p>For some herpesviruses, e.g. EBV, integrins suffice as receptors for infection of epithelial cells. Here, we asked whether either Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8- integrin suffices as an HSV receptor for entry, or whether their roles are in addition to that of the gD receptors. We made use of the J cells, which are negative for both gD receptors, hence cannot be infected by HSV unless a receptor is transgenically expressed <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Cocchi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. J cells express endogenous hamster integrins, likely at low levels, hence they are not suitable to test the effect of integrin silencing, or of antibodies to integrins, since the siRNAs and the antibodies were directed to the human orthologs. They were transfected with plasmids encoding for nectin1, or Î±vÎ²6-integrin, or Î±vÎ²8-integrin (300 ng DNA/well for each plasmid), and then infected with increasing amounts of R8102. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g007">Fig. 7 A</xref> shows that J cells expressing Î±vÎ²6-integrin alone or Î±vÎ²8-integrin alone, in the absence of nectin1, did not enable HSV infection, in contrast to cells expressing nectin1 alone. Thus, neither of the two integrins suffices as HSV receptor in cells negative for gD receptors. Parenthetically, in this assay, in the absence of gD receptors, the candidate gB receptor PILR Î± <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> did not enable infection.</p>

            <p>(A) The receptor-negative J cells were transfected with nectin1 alone, Î±vÎ²6-integrin alone, or Î±vÎ²8-integrin alone. (B) J cells were transfected with low amount (75 ng DNA/24 well) of nectin1 alone, or with the same amount of nectin1 plus Î±vÎ²6-integrin (300 ng DNA/24 well), or plus Î±vÎ²8âintegrin (300 ng DNA/24 well). 48 h after transfection, cells were infected with R8102, at increasing MOI (2.5â30 pfu/cell) and harvested at 16â18 h after infection.

        <title>Î±vÎ²6-integrin and Î±vÎ²8-integrin enable specific endocytic pathways of HSV entry</title>
        <p>HSV enters different cells by different pathways. Î±vÎ²3 integrin was identified in our laboratory as a cellular determinant in the choice of the pathway of entry, capable of routing HSV to a pathway dependent on lipid microdomains and dynamin 2, and proceeding to acidic endosomes <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Whether integrins other than Î±vÎ²3 are determinants in the choice of HSV entry pathways, and whether different integrins route HSV to different pathways is not known. To address these questions, we analyzed the effects of well known entry inhibitors on HSV infection of J cells expressing nectin1 alone, or nectin1 plus Î±vÎ²6-, Î±vÎ²8-, or Î±vÎ²3-integrins. J cells are suitable to address this question, since, when transfected with a gD receptor they enable a pathway of entry independent of lipid rafts and acidic endosome <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni6" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The significant inhibitors were bafilomycin A (BFLA), a specific inhibitor of the Na-H pump, hence of endosomal acidification, filipin III, an inhibitor of the lipid microdomain platforms, dynasore, an inhibitor of the dynamin 2 GTPase required to seal the endosomal invaginations and generate endosomes, and wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The results were as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Infection of J cells expressing nectin1 alone was not sensitive to BFLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9 A</xref>), as reported <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni6" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, and occurs by fusion at plasma membrane or at a neutral pH compartment. Anyone of the three integrins - Î±vÎ²6, Î±vÎ²8 and Î±vÎ²3 â rendered the entry pathway sensitive to BFLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9 A</xref>). The wortmannin sensitivity closely mirrored that of BFLA, implying an involvement of PI3K when HSV entry occurs through acidic endosomes, but not at the plasma membrane or in a neutral compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Filipin III did not inhibit infection in J cells expressing nectin1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9 C</xref>), but did inhibit infection in J cells expressing nectin1 plus Î±vÎ²8-, or Î±vÎ²3-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9 C</xref>). Remarkably, filipin III failed to inhibit infection of J cells expressing nectin1 plus Î±vÎ²6-integrin. The effect of dynasore closely overlapped that of filipin III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g009">Fig. 9 D</xref>). The filipin III and dynasore sensitivity upon Î±vÎ²3-integrin expression was in agreement with our previous findings <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Cumulatively, the results indicate that both Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrin greatly impact on the HSV entry pathway. Both switch HSV to acidic endosome entry. Î±vÎ²8-, like Î±vÎ²3-integrin, routes HSV to a pathway dependent on lipid microdomain and dynamin2; in contrast, Î±vÎ²6-integrin routes HSV to a pathway independent of lipid microdomain and dynamin 2.</p>

          <p>Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins play a critical role in HSV entry into cell lines which are models of epithelial, including keratynocytic, and neuronal cells. Each of the two integrins acts to promote HSV entry independently of the other. The two serve in an interchangeable manner. This conclusion rests on loss-of-function experiments, in which infection was inhibited by function-blocking MAbs or by integrin silencing through siRNAs, and on gain-of-function experiments, in which infection increased following expression of Î±vÎ²6 in integrin-negative K562 cells. The finding that the simultaneous silencing of Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins reduced infection by about 90% emphasizes their critical role in HSV infection.</p>

          <p>Both Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins bind gH/gL at high affinity. The binding is highly selective as Î±vÎ²5-integrin does not bind gH/gL at all. The binding sites of Î±vÎ²6- and of Î±vÎ²8-integrins in gH/gL differ; it is the RGD motif for Î±vÎ²6-integrin, but not for Î±vÎ²8-integrin. Consistent with the high affinity binding, both the Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrin contributed to attachment of virions to cells, a step which so far was ascribed to gC and gB binding to HS, and to gD binding to one its receptors. The contribution of Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin to HSV attachment was much lower than that of heparan sulphate, whose absence reduces infection by about 100 fold <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Spear1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>
<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gruenheid1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Together, the requirement for Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin for infection and the high affinity binding are criteria to define Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins as HSV receptors. Importantly, as shown also here, Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins are preferentially expressed in epithelial cells, and Î²8-integrin is expressed at high levels in the central nervous system <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Moyle1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Nishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

          <p>Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin did not substitute for the gD receptor nectin1. The role of integrins is therefore additional - and not alternative - to that of gD receptors. Altogether, HSV entry into cells requires both the interaction of gD with one of its receptors, and the gH/gL interaction with Î±vÎ²6- or Î±vÎ²8-integrin, a view which impacts on the current model of HSV entry, as detailed below</p>

        <list-item>
          <p>The most dramatic effects exerted by Î±vÎ²6- and Î±vÎ²8-integrins were modifications of the pathway of HSV entry. Both integrins routed HSV from a plasma-membrane (or neutral pH compartment) portal of entry to acidic endosomes, and, concomitantly, to PI3K-dependency. Interestingly, the two integrins differed in the specific endocytic pathway they enabled. Î±vÎ²8-integrin enabled an entry pathway dependent on lipid microdomains and dynamin 2. Î±vÎ²6-integrin enabled a pathway of entry independent of lipid microdomains and dynamin 2.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Cumulatively, the novel features to emerge from this study are that HSV entry into epithelial cells requires the gH/gL interaction with one of the two interchangeable receptors, Î±vÎ²6-integrin or Î±vÎ²8-integrin. This interaction profoundly affects the pathway of entry, which takes the way of acidic endosomes. In the case of involvement of Î±vÎ²8-integrin, the portal of entry is located at lipid microdomains and necessitates dynamin 2. In the case of involvement of Î±vÎ²6-integrin, the portal of entry is located outside the lipid microdomains and does not necessitate dynamin 2.</p>
      <p>Two questions arise. <italic>Why did HSV evolved to employ gH/gL receptors in addition to the gD receptors? And, why did HSV choose integrins as gH/gL receptors?</italic> Two characteristics of the entry of HSV, and of herpesviruses in general, are the multipartite nature of the entry apparatus, and the possibility to enter cells through a variety of pathways. The currently accepted model on how the HSV multipartite entry/fusion apparatus mediates fusion of the virion envelope with the cell membranes envisions sequential activation steps in a cascade fashion <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Cocchi2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Fusco1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Carfi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-CampadelliFiume2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Even though the details of the interactions are still being defined, there is consensus that, upon gD binding to one of its receptors, conformational changes to gD ensue <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Carfi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Krummenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, such that gD interacts with, or anyway propagates the activation to gH/gL, and thereafter or simultaneously to gB <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Avitabile1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Atanasiu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Current results introduce the intervention of the integrin receptors in this process. We propose that, in addition to promoting endocytosis, the interaction of gH/gL with the integrin receptor contributes to induce conformational changes and activation of gH/gL, as seen in EBV <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chesnokova2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). Consequently, integrins would act as a trigger point in the activation cascade of the HSV fusion glycoproteins. Indeed, by placing the step of gH/gL activation under the double control of receptor-activated gD and of the integrin trigger point, the virus would ensure that the premature activation of gB is prevented, and, importantly, that virion endocytosis is synchronized with the activation of the fusion apparatus. In particular, when entry occurs at the plasma membranes, the receptor-mediated gD activation propagates to gH/gL and gB, possibly in a very brief timescale, perhaps in a matter of fraction of seconds. In the case of HSV entry by endocytosis, there must be a pause in the activation cascade, or a checkpoint that prevents the premature activation of gH/gL and gB, before endocytosis has taken place. An activating receptor for gH â in this case integrins, which are machines specialized in promoting endocytosis <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Caswell1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> â is ideally suited to fulfill this synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003806-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). The entry pathways exploited by HSV include low pH or neutral pH endosomes, as well as the plasma membrane, which is also a neutral pH compartment. As a consequence, HSV had to evolve a strategy for control of activation of the fusion glycoproteins independent of acidic pH. The integrin trigger point on gH/gL results in a control on fusion independent of acidic pH, and thus confers to the virus the flexibility to use alternative pathways in different cells, and expands the range of cells that HSV infects.</p>

      <p>Up to now, among herpesviruses, integrins are known to serve as receptors for EBV and HCMV, which engage with integrins through gH/gL, and for HHV-8, which engages with integrins through gB <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chesnokova1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chandran1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In EBV, the integrin-gH/gL interaction triggers conformational changes to the glycoproteins, likely activating them <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Chesnokova2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Whether all human herpesviruses need integrins in some way to enter certain cell types is an attractive open possibility. All herpesviruses encode a multipartite fusion apparatus, and enter a number of cells by endocytosis. Importantly, for EBV, HCMV and HHV8, placing the activation of gH/gL (EBV, HCMV) or gB (HHV-8) under an integrin trigger point may well result in a synchronization of the final steps of activation of the glycoproteins responsible for fusion execution.

Their usage of integrins thus intrinsically differs from that of HSV, as entry is less dependent on checkpoints to control an activation cascade.</p>
      <p>We recently found that Î±vÎ²3integrin - which functions as a routing factor and drives HSV entry to a pathway dependent on lipid microdomains, dynamin 2 and acidic endosomes <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> - serves as a sensor of the virus. In cooperation with TLR2, it elicits a branch of the innate response that contributes to NF-ÎºB activation and production of a specific set of cytokines, mainly IFNÎ± and Î² <xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gianni4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The question naturally arises as to whether the engagement of Î±vÎ²6 or Î±vÎ²8-integrin as receptors initiates a similar inimical response to the virus. In turn, this raises the question of what selective advantage is provided to HSV by use of an integrin to control fusion. As noted in earlier studies, HSV has evolved to evade the innate response soon after the onset of viral protein synthesis; in particular, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) and ICP27 provide the first line of evasion <xref rid="ppat.1003806-SandriGoldin1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003806-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. We conclude that, as highlighted in this work, HSV takes advantage of integrins to enable its endocytic entry and to exert a checkpoint on the cascade of glycoprotein activation. It subsequently counteracts the innate response, when virus entry is completed, by aid of the immediate early proteins.</p>

Antibodies were immobilized on a research-grade CM-5 sensor chip by amino coupling with 1,200 relative units (RU) as a target for immobilization and used to capture soluble integrins. The first flow cell (FC1) was always used as a reference (no antibody immobilized), and the signal from FC1 was automatically subtracted by Biacore software from data obtained from the other three flow cells. Measurements were made at 25Â°C. Integrins were injected at a flow rate of 10 to 20 Âµl/min; gH/gL was injected immediately after integrin capture by using the low-dispersal injection setting (kinject) at a flow rate of 50 Âµl/min. After each run, the sensor chip surface was regenerated by injection of 6 M guanidine chloride in 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2 (50 Âµl at a flow rate of 100 Âµl/min), followed by additional washing. The baseline remained stable during 30 to 40 runs.
