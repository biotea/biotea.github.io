        <p>This paper identifies the N-acetylglucosamine transferase OGT as binding partner for TET2/3 proteins. Their genome-wide chromatin binding and the characterization of the Set1/COMPASS complex as OGT target implies coordinated gene regulation.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>TET proteins convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, an emerging dynamic epigenetic state of DNA that can influence transcription. Evidence has linked TET1 function to epigenetic repression complexes, yet mechanistic information, especially for the TET2 and TET3 proteins, remains limited. Here, we show a direct interaction of TET2 and TET3 with <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). OGT does not appear to influence hmC activity, rather TET2 and TET3 promote OGT activity. TET2/3âOGT co-localize on chromatin at active promoters enriched for H3K4me3 and reduction of either TET2/3 or OGT activity results in a direct decrease in H3K4me3 and concomitant decreased transcription. Further, we show that Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF1), a component of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET1/COMPASS complex, is a specific GlcNAcylation target of TET2/3âOGT, and modification of HCF1 is important for the integrity of SET1/COMPASS. Additionally, we find both TET proteins and OGT activity promote binding of the SET1/COMPASS H3K4 methyltransferase, SETD1A, to chromatin. Finally, studies in Tet2 knockout mouse bone marrow tissue extend and support the data as decreases are observed of global GlcNAcylation and also of H3K4me3, notably at several key regulators of haematopoiesis. Together, our results unveil a step-wise model, involving TETâOGT interactions, promotion of GlcNAcylation, and influence on H3K4me3 via SET1/COMPASS, highlighting a novel means by which TETs may induce transcriptional activation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epigenetic marking of the genome and regulation of chromatin are central to establishing tissue-specific gene expression programs, and hence to several biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bonasio et al, 2010</xref>). Until recently, the only known epigenetic mark on DNA was 5-methylcytosine (mC), established and propagated by DNA methyltransferases, and generally associated with gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Suzuki and Bird, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cedar and Bergman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Ndlovu et al, 2011</xref>). The discovery of cystosine 5-hydroxymethylation (hmC), and of the <underline>T</underline>en-<underline>E</underline>leven <underline>T</underline>ranslocation family of enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3) that catalyse the conversion of mC to hmC has sparked great interest in uncovering the roles played by this mark and these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Tahiliani et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ito et al, 2010</xref>). Genome-wide profiling of the distribution of Tet1 and hmC in mouse ES cells has shown that both are important in regulation of pluripotency and cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Ficz et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Pastor et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Williams et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Wu et al, 2011</xref>). Other data have linked TET1 to epigenetic repression complexes, notably SIN3A and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Williams et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Wu et al, 2011</xref>). Regarding TET2 and TET3, mouse Tet2 has been implicated in haematopoiesis and human TET2 mutations have been found in various leukaemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Langemeijer et al, 2009</xref>), while studies in mouse germ cells have shown the importance of Tet3 in epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gu et al, 2011</xref>). However the mode of action, particularly of the TET2 and TET3 family members, is still poorly understood.</p>

        <title>TET2 and TET3 associate with the O-GlcNAc transferase OGT</title>
        <p>To aid in this understanding and further explore binding partners of these proteins, we performed an unbiased proteomic approach using HaloTag technology as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Los et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Daniels et al, 2012</xref>). To this end, we expressed the full-length TET1, TET2, and TET3 proteins as HaloTag (HT) fusions in HEK293T cells, covalently captured them on an HT affinity resin, eluted the interacting proteins, and purified these for mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and spectral counting analysis (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the silver stain gel for each complex isolation and the enrichment of numerous bands for each as compared to the HT alone control. Mass spectrometry of each revealed notably several transcriptional and epigenetic interacting proteins identified in biological replicates and enriched over the HT alone control, including the known TET1âSIN3A interaction and the absence of this with TET2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Williams et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). All TET proteins showed interaction with <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase, OGT, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>), though TET2 and TET3 showed demonstrably higher enrichment. Given this, we focused all following experiments with the TET2 and TET3 family members. Two approaches were used to confirm the interaction between TET2 or TET3 and OGT: (i) western blotting with anti-OGT antibody, applied to samples of eluate from the above-mentioned HT-pulldown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), and (ii) co-immunoprecipitations (Co-IPs) showing capture of both TET2 and TET3 from extracts of untransfected cells upon immunoprecipitation with an anti-OGT antibody, confirming the interaction of endogenous TET2 and TET3 with OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Input loading controls of OGT are shown for each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1C and D</xref>). A variant of TET2 lacking the catalytic domain (TET2ÎCD) did not show interaction with OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the catalytic domain is important for the OGT interaction and demonstrating the specificity of the HT pulldown and mass spectrometry analysis. Supporting this, FLAG Co-IP experiments performed with FLAG-TET2 and -TET3 CD alone showed interaction with transfected or endogenous OGT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, to evaluate whether the interaction is direct, an <italic>in vitro</italic> protein isolation was performed using <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed and purified full-length OGT incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> expressed HT-TET2CD or HT alone control covalently bound to resin. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, OGT was specifically enriched on resin containing the TET2CD as compared to the control. Together, these data demonstrate that TET2 and TET3 interact directly with the OGT glycosyltransferase.</p>

        <title>TET2 and TET3 promote OGT-mediated GlcNAcylation</title>
        <p>OGT places <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications on numerous proteins, including transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and also histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hart et al, 2007</xref>). GlcNAcylation can activate or inhibit protein activity and serve as a mark to recruit other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Slawson and Hart, 2011</xref>). As several proteins that interact with OGT are also regulated by GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hart et al, 2007</xref>), we analysed TET2 and TET3 by mass spectrometry for the presence of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications. Despite high levels of spectral counts (â¼400) for both proteins, GlcNAcylation could not be detected for either protein (data not shown). Based upon these results, we predict if TET proteins are GlcNAcylated, they would be at low levels. As TET and OGT are both enzymes, we next sought to determine if their respective activities are altered by each other. To evaluate if the enzymatic activity of OGT might influence hydroxymethylation by the TET enzymes, we measured the overall abundance of the hmC mark in dot blot assay using a specific hmC antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) in the absence or presence of either Alloxan, an OGT inhibitor, or PUGNAc, which prevents removal of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification by inhibiting the enzyme <italic>O</italic>-linked N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Capotosti et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Fujiki et al, 2009</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>, no changes in overall hmC level were observed with these respective treatments (upper panel), while a western blot of lysates revealed the expected impact on global levels of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc for each (lower panel). Similarly, overexpression of HT-OGT did not increase levels of hmC, while overexpression of a TET2CD alone control did (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Hence, cytosine hydroxylation does not appear to require the GlcNAcylating activity of OGT. We then investigated if GlcNAcylation might depend on TET2 and/or TET3. To answer this question, we measured overall OGT activity in lysates of cells where RNAi was used to knock down TET2 or TET3 (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref> for RNAi efficiency and controls). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref> (left panel), we observed lower GlcNAcylation activity in TET2 or TET3 RNAi than in the control cells. Following with this, in a TET2 and TET3 double RNAi kd (referred to as TET2/3 kd) a discernable decrease in <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modified proteins is seen as revealed by western blot analysis using an anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). To demonstrate that decreased OGT activity was not due to change in levels of OGT, analysis of lysates from mock RNAi and TET2/3 kd cells revealed that protein levels of OGT were unchanged after depletion of TET2 and TET3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 5 and 6</xref>). These combined data suggest that TET2/3 positively impacts the activity of OGT.</p>

        <title>TET2, TET3, and OGT co-localize with and influence H3K4 trimethylation at active promoters in human cells</title>
        <p>The clustering of TET2/3âOGT primarily at TSSs and HCP promoters (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2a">Figure 2A</xref>) led us next to examine the genomic overlap at promoters with H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), an expected mark at these sites which is also correlated with transcriptional activity. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figures 2C and D</xref>, ChIP-Seq with an antibody against H3K4me3 confirmed an expected high overlap (98%) of TET2/3âOGT targets with the H3K4me3 mark. We then wondered whether TET proteins might be involved in regulating H3K4me3, and therefore repeated ChIP-Seq experiment in cells containing a TET2 RNAi kd. We observed a significant reduction of H3K4me3 at over 78% of the TET2/3âOGT genomic targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2E</xref>). A similar impact on global reduction of H3K4me3 is observed in western blot analysis of TET2/3 knockdown cellular lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2F</xref>). As reduction in H3K4me3 could occur through a variety of mechanisms, we then sought to determine if there was a connection to OGT activity. Supporting this hypothesis and similar to the above data with TET2/3 kd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2F</xref>), cells treated with the OGT inhibitor, Alloxan, show also a decrease in global H3K4me3 as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, TET2/3âOGT targets are enriched for H3K4me3, which is regulated by both the TET proteins and OGT activity.</p>
        <p>To correlate these data to gene activity, we found by ChIP-Seq a marked co-occupancy of TET2/3âOGTâH3K4me3 targets with RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and by RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses a significant and positive correlation with high expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). To determine if there are effects on transcriptional levels after loss of TET and/or OGT, we then analysed by RTâqPCR a subset of TET2/3âOGT targets specifically decreased in H3K4me3 after TET kd, as identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2E</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2H</xref>, moderate, but reproducible and specific decreases in expression of targets after TET2/3 kd match patterns to those observed in OGT RNAi kd. Together, these data suggest that TET2/3âOGTâH3K4me3 targets are highly transcribed regions and for the subset studied, show concomitant transcriptional activation by both TET proteins and OGT.</p>

        <title>TET2 and TET3 associate with HCF1, an OGT-modified target and component of the H3K4 methyltransferase complex SET1/COMPASS</title>
        <p>We next wished to extend our observed TET2/3âOGT interaction and identify potential specific downstream protein targets that may connect to H3K4me3 regulation. With this in mind, we noticed in our initial proteomic analysis for TET2 and TET3 that besides OGT (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>), Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF1) was also identified and similarly to OGT, was decreased in the TET2ÎCD isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). HCF1 was of interest as not only is it a known GlcNAcylation target of OGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Capotosti et al, 2011</xref>), but also a component of the histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex, SET1/COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Wysocka et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Lee et al, 2010</xref>). ChIP-Seq experiments for endogenous HCF1 showed overlap of HCF1 target genes with those of Halo-TET2, TET3, OGT, and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 11A</xref>). We then desired to further the mechanistic understanding of the TET2- or TET3-OGTâHCF1 interactions with relationship to H3K4me3, and therefore examined the interactions of OGT using a similar HT proteomics approach including mass spectrometry analysis. Interacting partners of HT-OGT included the previously identified HCF1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Capotosti et al, 2011</xref>), the TET2 and TET3 proteins (confirming the TETâOGT interaction), and interestingly, all components of SET1/COMPASS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine if the interactions were dependent on OGT activity, we repeated the above experiments in the presence of the OGT inhibitor Alloxan. Such treatment resulted not only in the expected decrease in OGTâHCF1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Capotosti et al, 2011</xref>), but also in significant loss of capture of the SET1/COMPASS components, including the H3K4 methyltransferase SETD1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAFs) showed the same trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 11B</xref>), therefore validating the direct comparison of respective loss of spectral counts for each protein within the samples. Mass spectrometry analysis of HCF1 peptides from HT-OGT protein isolations with or without Alloxan treatment showed high levels of GlcNAcylation in untreated cells and reduction after Alloxan treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 12A</xref>), matching previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Capotosti et al, 2011</xref>).</p>

        <p>As these data suggested that GlcNAcylation of HCF1 might be important for its interaction with SET1/COMPASS, we then performed an HT-SETD1A pulldown to study the SET1/COMPASS complex. Mass spectrometry analysis of the interacting proteins revealed all the known members of the complex, as well as OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additional analysis of the HCF1 peptides from this experiment revealed extensive <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications, indicating that HCF1 is heavily modified when associated with SETD1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>, left panel âRNAi Ctrl'). We next examined whether the TET proteins might influence SET1/COMPASS complex formation and/or specific GlcNAcylation of HCF1. In order to do this, we performed HT-SETD1A isolations in cells harbouring the TET2/3 double kd, which were shown to decrease global H3K4me3 (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2F</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref> (and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 11B</xref> as NSAF values with the same trends), we observed a significant loss of SET1/COMPASS components and OGT in the TET2/3 RNAi kd cells, coinciding with a significant decrease in GlcNAcylation of HCF1 as determined by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). To show further the direct effect of TET proteins specifically on SET1/COMPASS complex formation, proteomics experiments were additionally performed with HT-WDR82, the only other specific component of SET1/COMPASS besides SETD1A. These data revealed the same disruption of capture of SET1/COMPASS components in cells harbouring a TET2/3 knockdown as compared to mock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 12B</xref>). These results indicate that TET2/3 proteins, and OGT GlcNAcylation of HCF1 are important for the integrity of the SET1/COMPASS complex, suggesting a means by which H3K4me3 may be regulated. To further this understanding, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments were carried out in living cells to monitor the interaction of SETD1A with chromatin. In short, SETD1A was designed as an energy donor, expressed as a fusion to NanoLuc luciferase, and Histone H3.3 as an energy acceptor, expressed and fluorescently labelled as a fusion to HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>, treatment of cells with an OGT inhibitor, Alloxan, (left panel) or analysis in TET2/3 RNAi knockdown cells (right panel) result in specific reduction of BRET signal, indicating decrease in interaction between SETD1A and Histone H3.3 after these respective treatments. Together, these data support that TET2/3 proteins and OGT activity are important not only for the integrity of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET1/COMPASS complex, but also binding of the methyltransferase component, SETD1A, to chromatin.</p>

        <title>Tet2 knockout mouse tissue shows that Tet2 is needed for global GlcNAcylation and H3K4me3 at target promoters</title>
        <p>We then endeavoured to extend our findings to mouse bone marrow tissue, a model where Tet2 has been implicated in haematopoiesis and Tet2 mutations have been identified and linked to myeloid neoplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Langemeijer et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moran-Crusio et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Quivoron et al, 2011</xref>). For this, we started by performing ChIP-Seq for Tet2, H3K4me3, and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc. First, ChIP-Seq analysis with an anti-Tet2 antibody in bone marrow tissue revealed genome-wide binding profile of endogenous Tet2 mostly at CpG-rich regions and TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). This binding profile is similar to the genomic distribution observed for HT-TET2 in HEK293T cell lines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 9B and 14</xref>). Next, we examined the genome-wide overlap between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and H3K4me3 with Tet2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, a significant degree of overlap was observed between Tet2 and both <italic>O</italic>-GlcNac and H3K4me3 modifications, again predominately at CpG-rich promoters. Further, ChIP-Seq for RNA Pol II as well as RNA-Seq in mouse bone marrow indicated that the Tet2/<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc/H3K4me3 co-bound targets were enriched at many active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). To determine the specific dependency of GlcNAcylation and H3K4me3 upon the Tet proteins in mouse bone marrow, experiments were then performed in a Tet2 knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moran-Crusio et al, 2011</xref>). Supporting the data that loss of human TET2/3 results in decreased OGT activity and global GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>), we observe in the Tet2 knockout mouse, a correlating decrease in global levels of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) as determined by a western blot using an anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody. ChIP-Seq for H3K4me3 in the Tet2 knockout mouse bone marrow tissue, reveals a significant reduction in H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>) (mirroring also the decrease observed in TET2 knockdown HEK293T cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2b">Figure 2E</xref>). Strikingly, it is noteworthy that among targets which showed decrease in H3K4me3 in a Tet2 knockout mouse, we found several key regulators of haematopoiesis, including the <italic>Cebpa</italic>, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Runx1</italic>, and several <italic>Mll</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we present data showing an unrecognized link between DNA modifying enzymes, TETs, a master cellular sensor protein, OGT, and a histone modifying complex, SET1/COMPASS. These new findings combined with our initial goal to further understanding of TET2 and TET3 proteins, have allowed us to propose a cohesive and hierarchical model of interactions and to determine the cascade of their respective activities leading to H3K4me3 and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The first sequence of events is the formation of TET2 or TET3âOGT interaction, which promotes GlcNAcylation by OGT on numerous proteins, including HCF1. HCF1 has been shown to be required for recruitment of SET1/COMPASS and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Narayanan et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Tyagi and Herr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Liu et al, 2010</xref>) and our data further elucidate its role as we show a GlcNAcylated HCF1 is important for the integrity of the SET1/COMPASS complex. Lastly, both TET proteins and OGT activity favour binding of SETD1A to chromatin, an event necessary for histone H3K4me3 and subsequent transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>As TET proteins have the potential to control DNA methylation fidelity by removing spurious or undesirable DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Liu et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Williams et al, 2011</xref>), the above model is likely not the only means these proteins utilize to influence H3K4me3. We hypothesize that TET proteins, in general, function as active guardians in promotion of transcriptional activation, which is supported by our data and previously published data of TET1 genomic localization primarily at regions high in H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Williams et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Wu et al, 2011</xref>). In addition to their ability to reduce DNA methylation, the TET proteins might serve as scaffolding proteins beyond interaction with OGT as evidenced by the finding of several other interactors, and then recruit proteins required to establish a high-H3K4me3 chromatin environment. The TETâOGT interaction for example may be more broadly utilized to direct several epigenetic complexes to target sites or promote active transcription by GlcNAcylating not only HCF1, but also local histones or transcription factors at specific genomic localizations. Furthermore, similar to the dual function of TET1 in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Williams et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Wu et al, 2011</xref>) our data suggest that TET3 might also provide a platform for repressive epigenetic complexes as it was shown also to interact with SIN3A. The TET proteins are thus more versatile and multifaceted than initially anticipated, performing important non-catalytic functions in addition to their known role of hydroxymethylation.</p>
      <p>In addition to suggesting a broader role for the TET proteins, our study revealing a direct physical link between OGT and TET2/3 proteins provides new insight into the regulation and function of OGT in the cell. Although its connection with epigenetic regulatory events is by no means clear, new data are quickly emerging. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for example, OGT is reported to play a role in Polycomb function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gambetta et al, 2009</xref>), and in human cells, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification on histone H2B is required for subsequent K120 monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fujiki et al, 2011</xref>). The interaction evidenced here between TET2/3 and OGT may shed light on the link between the OGT glycosyltransferase and epigenetics and may add to the role of OGT observed in the regulation of MLL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Fujiki et al, 2009</xref>). Our study reveals an unforeseen genome-wide crosstalk between OGT and TET2/3 and a novel mode of regulation of OGT-directed <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation. The precise mechanism of how TET impacts OGT activity is unclear and several possibilities exist (e.g., by other proteins associated with TETâOGT or by post-translational modifications). Our data allow however for a model wherein TET2 and TET3 might function as fine-tuning GlcNAcylation effectors, not only on epigenetic complexes such as SET1/COMPASS, but also other transcriptional regulation targets whose function is modulated by this modification.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results reveal a relationship between TET2/3 and OGT with their direct interaction and influence on the H3K4 SET1/COMPASS complex shedding new light on the modes of action of TET proteins, impact upon chromatin biology, regulation of OGT activity, and the epigenetic mechanisms in which they participate.</p>

        <p>Model connecting DNA modifying enzymes, TETs, a master cellular sensor protein, OGT, and a histone modifying complex, SET1/COMPASS. Based on our findings, a hierarchical model of the involved proteins, with the cascade of their respective activities, can be envisaged as followed: (1) The first sequence of events in the cascade is the formation of TET2/3âOGT interaction, which promotes OGT GlcNAcylation on numerous proteins, including HCF1; (2) In a TET-dependent manner, a GlcNAcylated HCF1 is important for the formation of the SET1/COMPASS; (3) In the last step, both TET proteins and OGT activity favour binding of SETD1A to chromatin, an event necessary for histone H3K4me3 and subsequent transcriptional activation.</p>
