      <abstract>
        <p>Despite the global impact of macrophage activation in vascular disease, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we show, with global proteomic analysis of macrophage cell lines treated with either IFNÎ³ or IL-4, that PARP9 and PARP14 regulate macrophage activation. In primary macrophages, PARP9 and PARP14 have opposing roles in macrophage activation. PARP14 silencing induces pro-inflammatory genes and STAT1 phosphorylation in M(IFNÎ³) cells, whereas it suppresses anti-inflammatory gene expression and STAT6 phosphorylation in M(IL-4) cells. PARP9 silencing suppresses pro-inflammatory genes and STAT1 phosphorylation in M(IFNÎ³) cells. PARP14 induces ADP-ribosylation of STAT1, which is suppressed by PARP9. Mutations at these ADP-ribosylation sites lead to increased phosphorylation. Network analysis links PARP9âPARP14 with human coronary artery disease. PARP14 deficiency in haematopoietic cells accelerates the development and inflammatory burden of acute and chronic arterial lesions in mice. These findings suggest that PARP9 and PARP14 cross-regulate macrophage activation.</p>

    <p>Despite medical advances, the global burden of ischaemic heart disease is increasing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Pro-inflammatory macrophage activation plays key roles in the pathogenesis of many disorders, including arterial disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Some pathways associated with macrophage activation may contribute to the shared mechanisms of inflammatory diseases, as demonstrated previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Despite potent therapies such as cholesterol-lowering by statins, substantial residual cardiovascular risk remains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, which drives the active search for novel solutions against pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Dissecting complex and intertwined mechanisms for macrophage activation requires well-defined mechanistic models. The evidence suggests that distinct types of macrophage activation are functionally different in disease pathogenesis, a classification that has helped to assess the heterogeneity of macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. For instance, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes can oppose one another, develop in response to distinct cytokines, differ in the activating stimuli and produce different cytokines. A recently proposed nomenclature suggests that each macrophage subpopulation can be called based on a specific stimulator, for example, M(IFNÎ³), M(LPS), M(IL-4), M(IL-10)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This established paradigm demonstrates clear relationships between classical stimuli and their respective responsesâinterferon gamma (IFNÎ³) for pro-inflammatory activation in settings such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and interleukin (IL)-4 for activation that can counter that of M(IFNÎ³) or M(LPS) macrophages. Hence, we used this paradigm as a starting point to explore novel regulators through global proteomics.</p>
    <p>Proteomics screening and bioinformatics in mouse and human data sets found that poly ADP-ribose polymerase 14 (PARP14), also known as ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like 8 (ARTD8), and PARP9/ARTD9 both increased in M(IFNÎ³) and decreased in M(IL-4) cells. The network analysis associated these PARP family members with human arterial disease. Sequence similarity to the PARP catalytic domain, which transfers ADP-ribose moieties from NAD to protein acceptors, characterizes the PARP family proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The best-characterized member, PARP1/ARTD1, represents poly-ADP-ribosylation enzymes, which processively catalyse long and branching polymers of ADP-ribose additions starting from an initial post-translational modification, commonly of glutamate. Recent evidence also validates proteins that execute mono-ADP-ribosylation as having various functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. PARP14/ARTD8 is an intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase. Previous reports indicated that PARP14 enhances IL-4-induced gene expression by interacting with the cytokine-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in B and T cells, thereby functioning as a transcriptional co-activator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> that may mediate this effect. A recent study reported that PARP14 regulates the stability of tissue factor mRNA in M(LPS) in mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Less information exists regarding the molecular function of PARP9/ARTD9. Although PARP9 appears to lack catalytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, it increases IFNÎ³-STAT1 signalling in B-cell lymphoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p>
    <p>This study employed a multidisciplinary approach, including proteomics, systems biology and cell and molecular biology to explore new mechanisms for modulating the functional profile elicited after macrophage activation. Mouse and human cell lines as well as primary macrophages were used for complementary analyses of PARP14-deficient mouse and human tissues. Ultimately, the analyses led to evidence that expression of PARP14 in haematopoietic cells restrains vascular inflammation in mouse models, which are not solely regulated by either IFNÎ³ or IL-4. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for regulating the balance of macrophage phenotypes in vascular disease, and potentially other disorders in which macrophage activation has an impact on outcomes.</p>

        <title>Proteomics screening for regulators of macrophage activation</title>
        <p>We used the tandem mass tagging (TMT) quantitative proteomics to identify regulators of pro-inflammatory and non/anti-inflammatory activation in mouse RAW264.7 and human THP-1 macrophage cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâc</xref>). In this paradigm of macrophage heterogeneity, IFNÎ³ and IL-4 promote distinctive subpopulations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. A pilot TMT proteomic study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1d and 2</xref>) analysed the changes in the proteomes at 0, 12 and 24âh, and observed the expected increase and decrease in STAT1 in M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4) cells, respectively, as determined by hierarchical cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Within this pilot study, we first noted that PARP14 co-clustered with STAT1 in the M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4) data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). To ascertain whether any changes in the M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4) proteomes were not because of cell culture conditions, we performed a second, more in-depth study that included an unstimulated macrophage control for both RAW264.7 and THP-1 experiments, and extended the stimulation period to up to 72âh, sampling six time points for a more detailed time-resolved proteomic study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p>In this latter proteomic study, we quantified 5,137 and 5,635 proteins in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, respectively, across the three conditions: unstimulated control, IFNÎ³-stimulated macrophages and IL-4-stimulated macrophagesâM(-), M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). An overview of the protein intensities across the three conditions revealed that the magnitude of protein abundance levels for each of the IFNÎ³ and IL-4-stimulated RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells were generally higher than those of unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), indicating that each stimulation promoted changes in protein abundance beyond those due to cell culture conditions alone.</p>
        <p>To pursue one class of potential upstream regulators based on protein abundances, we used the following criteria: proteins exhibited (1) an early increase in M(IFNÎ³) (within 24âh) followed by sustained levels until the later time points (up to 72âh), (2) a decrease in abundance in M(IL-4) and (3) no significant change in M(-). We employed two distinct informatics methods to explore proteins with such behaviours: data filtering (Method 1) and model-based clustering (Method 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In Method 1, the M(-) data set permitted a subtraction of the background signal at all time points and thus facilitated data filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> upper panels and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Three proteins in the data set from mouse RAW264.7 cells and 12 proteins in human THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> lower panels) met the three criteria above. PARP14 emerged from both data sets, and PARP9 appeared in the THP-1 data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> lower panels). In parallel, Method 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>) produced 15 and 20 clusters for the RAW264.7 and THP-1 data sets, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Clusters mined for proteins whose abundances increased in M(IFNÎ³) but decreased in M(IL-4) with respect to M(-) revealed 490 proteins in the RAW264.7 data set and 414 proteins in THP-1 fulfilling these criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</xref>). The proteins were short-listed to those with similar time-resolved changes in both in human and mouse data sets, resulting in 38 candidate proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Both RAW264.7 and THP-1 data sets identified PARP9 and PARP14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Collectively, while Method 2 identified PARP9 and PARP14 in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, PARP14 was the only common protein that both Methods 1 and 2 identified among over 5,000 proteins in mouse and human data sets.</p>

        <title>The PARP9 and PARP14 network and coronary artery disease</title>
        <p>To understand the influence of PARP9 and PARP14 in a global interaction network (âinteractome') and predict their potential clinical impact in disease mechanisms, we applied a network-based analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that disease genes are not distributed randomly on the interactome but work together in similar biological modules or pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Moreover, gene products (for example, proteins) linked to the same phenotype likely interact with each other and cluster in the same network neighbourhood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We thus postulated that, if PARP9 or PARP14 influences the network neighbourhood of a disease, its immediate neighbours should be close to a disease module compared with random expectation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Using the random-walk method, we defined a set of genes as a human disease module for each of the cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and IFNÎ³-related diseases (see Methods). We then measured the average shortest distance of the immediate neighbours of the PARP9âPARP14 network to each disease module. An interactome mainly describes a set of physical or functional associations between proteins and does not provide cell or tissue specificity. In our study, we thus examined the genes of immediate neighbours reported in macrophages in the public databases.</p>
        <p>We included IFNÎ³-related autoimmune diseases as positive controls, as we used this cytokine to promote pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. The PARP9âPARP14 network is significantly close to systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The PARP9âPARP14 network had significantly greater proximity to the human coronary artery disease gene module compared with other cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). The analysis also linked PARP9âPARP14 with osteoporosis. Moreover, we quantified the closeness of PARP9âPARP14 to autoimmune diseases, coronary artery disease and other diseases in the form of the distribution of shortest distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>) and demonstrated a clear separation between the distribution of diseases inside and outside the circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating an enrichment of shorter distances (<italic>d</italic>=1 and 2) for IFNÎ³-related autoimmune diseases (yellow) and coronary artery disease and osteoporosis (blue), compared with other cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (red; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). These results may indicate the potential impact of PARP9 and/or PARP14 on the pathogenesis of arterial disease or the onset of its clinical complications.</p>

        <p>According to the network analysis that linked PARP9 and PARP14 with arterial disease, we performed immunohistochemistry in arterial lesions. Mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, left) and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, right) atherosclerotic lesions exhibited PARP9 and PARP14 proteins, while they were less abundant in human carotid arteries with no apparent atherosclerotic changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Immunohistochemistry localized PARP9 and PARP14 expression in the majority of macrophages (CD68) of human atherosclerotic plaques, while few if any smooth muscle cells (SMÎ±-actin) and endothelial cells (CD31) stained positively for these PARPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).

        <title>Pro-inflammatory PARP9 and anti-inflammatory PARP14</title>
        <p>A series of subsequent experiments examined whether PARP9 or PARP14 plays a causal role in macrophage activation. Expression levels of gene products typical of the M(IFNÎ³) phenotype (for example, IL-1Î²) and in the M(IL-4) phenotype (for example, MRC1) gauged the downstream effects of PARP silencing using small interfering RNA (siRNA) first in macrophage-like cell lines RAW264.7 and THP-1 since the original screening was performed in these cells, and then in human and mouse primary macrophages.</p>
        <p>In mouse RAW264.7 cells, PARP14 silencing enhanced the induction of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by IFNÎ³, and suppressed the response of MRC1 to IL-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). In human THP-1 cells, PARP14 silencing also increased TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² mRNA induction in response to IFNÎ³ and decreased MRC1 induction by IL-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). Increased levels of TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² proteins in the supernatant of IFNÎ³-treated THP-1 cells with PARP14 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>) supported these data. Silencing of PARP9 suppressed the induction of TNFÎ±, IL-1Î² and CCL2/MCP-1 mRNA under IFNÎ³ stimulation in THP-1 cells, while MRC1 showed no significant change in IL-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref>).</p>
        <p>To obtain unambiguous evidence for the role of PARP9 and PARP14 in macrophage activation, we extended the <italic>in vitro</italic> validation studies to mouse and human primary macrophages. In human primary macrophages derived from CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), PARP9 silencing suppressed the expression of TNFÎ±, IL-1Î² and CCL2/MCP-1 in IFNÎ³-treated macrophages, but exerted no significant effects on MRC1 induction by IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In contrast, PARP14 silencing accelerated the induction of TNFÎ±, IL-1Î² and CCL2/MCP-1 by IFNÎ³, and suppressed MRC1 in IL-4-treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), silencing PARP9 and PARP14 exerted the effects similar to those in human primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Overall, siRNA experiments provided consistent results in macrophage-like cell lines and primary macrophages. Neither PARP14 nor PARP9 showed significant effects on viability, proliferation or apoptosis of mouse primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref>). In addition, enforced expression of PARP14 in THP-1 cells suppressed the induction of TNFÎ±, iNOS, TLR2 and TLR4 in M(IFNÎ³) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8f,g</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that PARP14 suppresses IFNÎ³-induced responses and augments IL-4-responses in macrophages. In contrast, PARP9 promotes responses to IFNÎ³.</p>

        <title>PARP9 and PARP14 regulate STAT1 and STAT6 activation</title>
        <p>Although expression patterns of PARP14 and PARP9 in M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4) were comparable, their respective siRNA experiments yielded opposing results, suggesting the involvement of distinct signalling mechanisms. IFNÎ³ signalling involves activation (phosphorylation) of pro-inflammatory STAT1, while the IL-4 pathway uses anti-inflammatory STAT6 phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated enhanced intracellular colocalization of PARP14 and STAT1 in IFNÎ³-treated THP-1 cells compared with unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, in human primary macrophages derived from CD14+ PBMCs, PARP14 silencing accelerated IFNÎ³-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and suppressed IL-4-promoted STAT6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). PARP14 may suppress pro-inflammatory macrophage activation by modulating the IFNÎ³âSTAT1 axis, and promote the anti-inflammatory IL-4-STAT6 pathway. In contrast, PARP9 silencing decreased STAT1 phosphorylation in IFNÎ³-treated human macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that PARP9 may activate IFNÎ³âSTAT1 signalling and induce pro-inflammatory activation. In addition, siRNA experiments in THP-1 cells that we used for proteomic screening produced similar results on the role of PARP9 and PARP14 on the STAT1 and STAT6 pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 10aâc</xref>). Evidence suggests the participation of STAT3 in immune responses in various contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

        <title>PARP9 and PARP14 interact with each other</title>
        <p>The results demonstrated above engendered the hypothesis of regulatory interplay between PARP9 and PARP14. Indeed, PARP14 silencing increased PARP9 mRNA expression in IFNÎ³-treated human primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), while PARP9 silencing increased PARP14 mRNA in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref>). In contrast, enforced expression of PARP14 decreased PARP9 mRNA expression in IFNÎ³-treated THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Previous reports showed that, in B lymphocytes, IL-4 promotes catalytic activity of PARP14, leading to ADP-ribosylation of HDAC2, HDAC3 and p100 (a precursor of p52 that encodes the NF-ÎºB2 protein), and activation of STAT6, thereby inducing its binding to IL-4-responsive gene promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed a PARP9/PARP14 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and immunofluorescence demonstrated the enhanced colocalization of PARP9 and PARP14 in THP-1 cells by IFNÎ³ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that these two molecules interact in macrophages. Recombinant PARP14 protein induced ADP-ribosylation of PARP14 itself, PARP9, STAT1Î± and STAT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). PARP9 did not promote ADP-ribosylation of either STAT1Î± or STAT6, which supports a previous report showing that PARP9 lacks catalytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Interestingly, PARP9 suppressed PARP14-induced ADP-ribosylation of STAT1Î± and STAT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). While the majority of other PARP family members such as PARP1 are poly-ADP-ribosylation enzymes, PARP14 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Mass spectrometric analysis determined that Glu657 and Glu705 of STAT1Î± were mono-ADP-ribosylated by PARP14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Glu657 and Glu705 neighbour Tyr701, a functionally critical phosphorylation site of STAT1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Although we could not verify the precise ADP-ribosylation site in the STAT6 peptide, the conserved Glu makes it a plausible candidate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Mass spectrometry further revealed that recombinant PARP9 inhibited PARP14-induced mono-ADP-ribosylation at Glu657 and Glu705 of STAT1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, right panels).</p>
        <p>The introduction of mutations at Glu657 and Glu705 to prevent ADP-ribosylation helped to investigate the functional relevance of these two sites within STAT1Î±. Overexpression experiments in mouse BMDMs revealed that mutations at Glu657 and Glu705 enhanced Tyr701 phosphorylation of STAT1Î± in IFNÎ³-treated cells as compared with wild-type STAT1Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Using the same mutant STAT1Î±, we have observed a similar response of STAT1Î± phosphorylation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a,b</xref>). As a functional consequence, mutant STAT1Î± in mouse BMDMs increased expression of pro-inflammatory iNOS, IL-1Î² and CCL2/MCP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that PARP14-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Glu657 and Glu705 may control Try701 phosphorylation of STAT1Î±, a potential mechanism for the interplay between ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation in macrophage activation.</p>

        <p>Our network analysis closely linked the PARP9âPARP14 module with coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). To first examine whether PARP14 indeed plays a role in arterial diseases, we used two different models: (1) acute mechanical injury in femoral arteries of <italic>PARP14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice and (2) acute injury in mice that underwent bone marrow transplantation from <italic>PARP14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice.

Laser capture microdissection (LCM) of the intima of injured femoral arteries followed by real-time PCR demonstrated that PARP14 deficiency increased the levels of TNFÎ± and iNOS mRNA and decreased Arg1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). The spleen is a reservoir of monocytes/macrophages that releases these cells in response to an event in remote organs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

        <title>Single-cell analysis of primary human macrophages</title>
        <p>The diversity in expression patterns of PARP9 and PARP14 in human plaques necessitated the additional assessment of macrophage subpopulations using single-cell gene expression profiling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> of PBMC-derived human CD14-positive macrophages. Examined cell numbers were 86 in M(-) and 84 in M(IFNÎ³) of Donor 1, 93 in M(-) and 86 in M(IFNÎ³) of Donor 2 and 90 in M(-) and 81 in M(IFNÎ³) of Donor3, respectively. Our examination investigated whether responses of human primary macrophages towards IFNÎ³ stimulation are heterogeneous. Comparing average levels of readouts (for example, inflammation-related factors) in the entire group of cells by qPCR cannot address this question. A workflow of single-cell gene profiling is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15a</xref>.</p>
        <p>The expression patterns of 91 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) in M(-) (<italic>n</italic>=268) and M(IFNÎ³) (<italic>n</italic>=252; <italic>n</italic>=520 in total) derived from the three different donors. All cells were evaluated against each other based on their gene expression dissimilarity (Manhattan distance, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nist.gov/dads/">http://www.nist.gov/dads/</ext-link>). We present the distance matrix as a distance-based graph. By combining the two conditionsâM(-) and M(IFNÎ³)âacross three donors (six conditions in total), M(-) cells (green) and M(IFNÎ³) (red) are clearly segregated, forming distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). However, there are âtrails' of M(IFNÎ³) that appear in the M(-) cluster, suggesting potential heterogeneity. Although this may be attributable to donor-to-donor variations, similar patterns were observed within individual donors as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15b</xref>). As we are particularly interested in the expression profiles of PARP9 and PARP14, we examined variations/correlations in their expression levels in M(-) and M(IFNÎ³) human primary macrophages. In both phenotypes, PARP9 and PARP14 were correlated. However, M(-) cells showed lower levels of variation for PARP9 and PARP14 mRNA expression than did M(IFNÎ³) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15c</xref>). These findings suggest that the âIFNÎ³-polarized' human primary macrophages are heterogeneous.</p>
        <p>It is possible to subdivide the cells into subpopulations based on expression profile similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>). Using Ward's linkage, we observed the following three subpopulations: M(IFNÎ³) (Cluster 1), M(-) (Cluster 2) and Mixed (Cluster 3). It is important to note that these populations are not homogeneous and can be further divided into at least two subgroups (Groups 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>) in human primary M(IFNÎ³) (Cluster 1). Both PARP9 and PARP14 were significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group1. Considering the possible importance of PARP9 and PARP14 in the macrophage phenotype, we subsequently examined the genes related to macrophage functions in these two Groups 1 and 2. The potent matrix-degrading enzyme MMP-9 and the pattern recognition receptors CD36, TLR2 and TLR4 were higher in Group2, indicating that this subpopulation, which is associated with increased PARP9 and PARP14 expression, may possess a more pro-inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>). In our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, RNA silencing or genetic deletion of PARP14 enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in IFNÎ³-stimulated macrophages. In the single-cell analysis, average levels of MMP-9 and TLR4 mRNA expression were also higher in IFNÎ³-stimulated macrophages treated with PARP14 siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15d</xref>). However, their responses to PARP14 were heterogeneous.</p>
        <p>The gene expression correlation matrix of genes across all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>) demonstrates that both PARP9 and PARP14 are closely associated with genes known to participate in IFNÎ³ signalling (for example, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT6, IRF1 and IRF5). This correlation is highly specific to these genes, and does not extend to other genes that we tested in this assay. Genes that are not correlated with PARP9 and PARP14, among all 91 genes tested, include JAK3, a mediator of IL-4 signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study provides new evidence that PARP9 and PARP14 regulate macrophage activation. The specific novel findings demonstrated in this report include the following: (1) PARP9 promotes IFNÎ³-induced responses in mouse and human macrophages; (2) PARP14 suppresses IFNÎ³ responses in mouse and human macrophages; (3) PARP14 induces IL-4-triggered responses in mouse and human macrophages; (4) PARP9 and PARP14 appear to have physical and functional interactions; (5) PARP9 and PARP14 closely interact with components of IFNÎ³ signalling in macrophages; (6) PARP14-induced mono-ADP-ribosylation of STAT1 inhibits its phosphorylation; (7) the PARP9 and PARP14 interactomes have significant proximity to the coronary artery disease module; (8) PARP14 deficiency indeed accelerates macrophage activation and lesion development in mouse models of acute and chronic arterial diseases; (9) PARP14 in the haematopoietic lineage exerts protective effects against arterial diseases; and (10) single-cell analysis revealed that IFNÎ³-stimulated human primary macrophages derived from CD14+ PBMC contain subpopulations, in which PARP9 and PARP14 are closely associated with genes of IFNÎ³ signalling. Our findings provide insight into new mechanisms for macrophage activation that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arterial diseases, a global health burden.</p>
      <p>We aimed to establish the unambiguous evidence for the role of PARP9 and PARP14 in macrophage activation using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. In this study, M(IFN) and M(IL-4) as two multidimensional models of macrophage heterogeneity were used in an unbiased proteomics approach. We then validated our key results on the functionality of PARP9 and PARP14 in mouse and human primary macrophages. Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell gene profiling in human primary macrophages revealed close links among PARP9, PARP14 and IFNÎ³ pathway-related molecules (for example, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1 and STAT6), suggesting that these PARP family members contribute critically to the process of M(IFNÎ³) activation.</p>
      <p>We took advantage of the availability of a well-characterized paradigm of macrophage heterogeneity. The balance of diverse macrophage phenotypes (for example, pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory subsets) may regulate normal homeostasis and disease mechanisms. Effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapies may require the fine-tuning of the imbalance of diverse macrophage phenotypes (for example, suppressing excessively activated pro-inflammatory macrophages without compromising protective functions or with enhancing anti-inflammatory activation). Our major goal was to identify molecules or pathways that may regulate the delicate balance of macrophage heterogeneity using global proteomics of M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4). We thus used stringent criteria to choose proteins that increased during M(IFNÎ³) activation and decreased in M(IL-4). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments indicate that the interplay between PARP9 and PARP14 may indeed regulate the M(IFNÎ³)/M(IL-4) balance. We further validated the <italic>in vitro</italic> results in human arterial lesions and mouse models of arterial disorders, neither of which is solely regulated by IFNÎ³ or IL-4, to provide clinically translatable evidence. Human and mouse atherosclerotic plaque macrophages express PARP9 and PARP14. We identified four macrophage subpopulations in human lesions: PARP9+/PARP14+; PARP9+/PARP14â; PARP9-/PARP14+; and PARP9â/PARP14â. Single-cell gene expression analysis further revealed that IFNÎ³-stimulated human primary macrophagesâM(IFNÎ³)âare heterogeneous, which may support an emerging concept of the multidimensional model of macrophage activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In addition, subpopulations within these IFNÎ³-stimulated cells may have different functions, as shown by associations with MMP-9, CD36, TLR2 and TLR4. Future studies addressing the functional significance of the heterogeneity in human primary macrophages may lead to the development of personalized medical solutions.</p>
      <p>To explore the evidence for the anti-atherogenic role of PARP14 beyond <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we used <italic>PARP14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice. Genetic deletion of PARP14 indeed promoted macrophage activation and accumulation in the intima of mechanically injured arteries, offering <italic>in vivo</italic> proof of concept. Moreover, significant acceleration of acute arterial lesion formation and chronic atherosclerosis was observed in the mice reconstituted with <italic>PARP14</italic><sup>â/â</sup> bone marrow. These findings suggest that haematopoietic PARP14 plays a central role in arterial disease.</p>
      <p>Our study further revealed the new biology for understudied members of the PARP familyâPARP9 and PARP14. ADP-ribosylation assays demonstrated that PARP14 has the ability to mono-ADP-ribosylate STAT1 and mass spectrometric analysis identified two ADP-ribosylation sites proximal to its key phosphorylation site. Interestingly, PARP9 suppresses PARP14-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation of STAT1. Furthermore, mutations of STAT1Î± ribosylation sites for PARP14 enhanced its phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. The interplay of PARP9 and PARP14 in STAT1Î± ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation may in part explain why PARP9 and PARP14 exert opposing effects on IFNÎ³- and IL-4-induced macrophage activation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref> demonstrates an overview of regulatory mechanisms for the IFNÎ³-STAT1 and IL-4-STAT6 pathways by PARP9 and PARP14.</p>
      <p>In this study, unbiased global proteomics and bioinformatics of IFNÎ³- and IL-4-treated macrophages implicated PARP9 and PARP14 in novel mechanisms of macrophage activation. The subsequent network-based prediction of the close relationship between the macrophage PARP14âPARP9 module and human coronary artery disease genes supported the premise that our proteomics screen would effectively identify regulators of macrophage activation in the context of cardiovascular diseases. The approach was then followed by a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses on mouse and human cells/tissues that demonstrated the novel concept that PARP9 promotes and PARP14 suppresses IFNÎ³-induced activation of macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). The present study also represents our strategy of target discovery research assisted by global proteomics screening and subsequent validation studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). Collectively, our discoveries indicate that inhibition of PARP9 and/or activation of PARP14 may attenuate macrophage-mediated vascular diseases, and also provide new insight into the development of effective therapies for other inflammatory disorders.</p>

        <p>In this study, we used mouse and human IFNÎ³ 10ângâml<sup>âl</sup> and IL-4 10ângâml<sup>â1</sup> (R&amp;D systems) as stimuli for macrophage activation, respectively. The murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, TIB-71, Rockville, MD) and maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) containing DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (Corning) at 37âÂ°C in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Before stimuli (IFNÎ³ 10ângâml<sup>â1</sup> and IL-4 10ângâml<sup>â1</sup>), cells were starved for 24âh with 0.1% FBS-containing media. THP-1 was also purchased from ATCC (TIB-202) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium in 10% FBS with penicillin and streptomycin at 37âÂ°C in humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The macrophage-like state was obtained by treating the THP-1 monocytes for 48âh with PMA (200ângâml<sup>â1</sup>, Sigma). Mycoplasma contamination test was routinely performed (once a month).</p>
        <p>Each cell culture experiment, unstimulated, INFÎ³ and IL-4, was prepared for isobaric labelling using the 6-plex TMT strategy (Pierce). For sample preparation the cells were lysed and proteolysed (Lys-C, Wako Chemicals) using the in-solution urea+ RapiGest (Waters) strategy detailed previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Tryptic peptides were labelled with TMT 6-plex reagent (Pierce), combined and desalted using Oasis Hlb 1cc (10âmg) columns (Waters). The peptides were then fractionated into 24 fractions based on their isoelectric focusing point (pH range of 3â10) using the OFF-gel system (Agilent; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The fractions were dried using a tabletop speed vacuum (Fisher Scientific), cleaned with the Oasis columns and resuspended in 40âÎ¼l of 5% acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific) and 5% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).</p>

        <p>The high-resolution/accuracy LTQ-Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Scientific) analysed TMT peptide samples, and the Q Exactive (Thermo Scientific) and Elite analysed <italic>in vitro</italic> ribosylated peptides. Both mass spectrometers are fronted with a Nanospray FLEX ion source, and coupled to an Easy-nLC1000 HPLC pump (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were subjected to a dual column set-up: an Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 trap column, 75âÎ¼m Ã 20âcm (50âÎ¼m Ã 15âcm on the Q Exactive), and an Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column 75âÎ¼m Ã 250âmm (Thermo Scientific). For TMT analysis the analytical gradient was run at 250ânlâmin<sup>â1</sup> from 10 to 30% Solvent B (acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) for 90âmin, followed by 5âmin of 95% Solvent B. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid. For ribosylated peptides the gradient was run at 250ânlâmin<sup>â1</sup> from 5 to 28% Solvent B for 10 or 30âmin, followed by 5âmin of 95% Solvent B. All reagents were HPLC-grade. For TMT analysis, LTQ-Orbitrap was set to 120âK resolution and the top 20 precursor ions (within a scan range of 380â2,000â<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) were subjected to higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD, collision energy 40%, isolation width 3â<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, dynamic exclusion-enabled, starting <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> fixed at 120â<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and resolution set to 30âK) for peptide sequencing (MS/MS). The Q Exactive was set to 140âK resolution with a top 10 precursor selection method (scan range of 380â1,500â<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>). HCD was set to a stepped normalized collision energy of 25Â±10%, isolation width of 1.6â<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, dynamic exclusion-enabled and resolution set to 17.5âK for MS/MS. Ribosylated peptide candidates were screened in the MS/MS scan by the m6 peak of 348.1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Unmodified forms were calculated by subtracting the mass of the ADP-ribose (541.06âDa) from the observed precursor. Modified and unmodified <italic>m/z</italic> values and corresponding retention time windows were submitted to an inclusion list and analysed in using the data-independent acquisition module of the Q Exactive (<italic>R</italic>=35âK).</p>
        <p>The MS/MS data were queried against the mouse or human UniProt database (downloaded on 27 March 2012) using the SEQUEST search algorithm via the Proteome Discoverer (PD) Package (version 1.3, Thermo Scientific)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, using a 10âp.p.m. tolerance window in the MS1 search space and a 0.02âDa fragment tolerance window for HCD. Methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and 6-plex TMT tags (Thermo Scientific) were set as fixed modifications. The peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Percolator provided by PD: the FDR was determined based on the number of MS/MS spectral hits when searched against the reverse, decoy mouse or human database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Peptides were filtered based on a 1% FDR. Peptides assigned to a given protein group, and not present in any other protein group, were considered as unique. Consequently, each protein group is represented by a single master protein (PD Grouping feature). Master proteins with two or more unique peptides were used for TMT reporter ratio quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> contains a summary of peptides and peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) for PARP9 and PARP14).

        <title>Proteomics normalization and filtering strategy</title>
        <p>For each PSM the TMT ion channel intensities were normalized to the time-zero channel (reference normalization, for example, <inline-formula id="d33e1142"><inline-graphic id="d33e1143" xlink:href="ncomms12849-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula> where <italic>i</italic>=1, 2, â¦, 6 and <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> is the time-zero abundance). The protein's abundance was then calculated by taking the median of its corresponding PSM ratios<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. To extract the proteins that increase in IFNÎ³-stimulated (M(IFNÎ³)) but decrease in IL-4-stimulated condition (M(IL-4)), we applied a simple filtering logic that exploited the available unstimulated control data set. In this study, unstimulated control, M(-), serves as a control for the biological signal owing to the cell culture condition; that is, protein traces M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4) that exceed the edges of the baseline are more likely to be bona fide IFNÎ³- and IL-4-specific responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Protein profiles whose abundances surpassed the baseline, which was defined as maximum relative abundance at 8âh of M(-) (+0.13, log10 of relative abundance), after supplement of INFÎ³ established the general threshold for the entire time M(IFNÎ³) data set. This cutoff value was the same that was used for both RAW264.7 and THP-1 M(IFNÎ³) data sets. Moreover, the proteins extracted from the IFNÎ³-stimulated filtering step were cross-referenced not only to M(-) but also to M(IL-4) data sets where proteins were expected to possess opposite profiles with respect to M(IFNÎ³) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Therefore, the final list of candidate proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) had profiles whose abundances increased in M(IFNÎ³) and decreased in M(IL-4), respectively, beyond their baseline controls.</p>

        <title>Proteomics data clustering</title>
        <p>Clustering was performed using the model-based algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> in R, which is based on finite mixture models; as such, it can successfully be applied to time series data analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> such as those acquired for M(IFNÎ³) and M(IL-4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). In this approach, each time series (protein profile) y<italic>i</italic>, <italic>i</italic>=1, 2, â¦, <italic>N</italic> (where <italic>N</italic> is the number of TMT channels) is considered to be a single entity connected by a line. Clustering is achieved for a traditional finite mixture model by assigning each time series, y<italic>i</italic>, to a cluster. The non-supervised model-based clustering uses the Expectation Maximization algorithm to assign the profile to a specific cluster. MCLUST has the advantage of using the Bayesian Information Criteria to determine the number of clusters that best partition the data set by maximizing the intradata set variability. Finally, stronger covariance (and thus also dependencies) between sets of two time points is enabled by sum normalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. After clustering was performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>) we focused on proteins shared in all three data sets (unstimulated control, IFNÎ³-stimulated and IL-4-stimulated) for both RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, with the purpose of identifying proteins whose profiles increased in IFNÎ³-stimulated condition and decreased in IL-4-stimulated, but maintained at basal levels in unstimulated control condition. We inspected all clusters looking for an increase in the relative abundance of proteins with respect to time zero at any time point in IFNÎ³-stimulated, and subsequently cross-referenced the IL-4-stimulated and unstimulated control clusters for proteins whose profiles decreased and remained within the baseline, respectively. The proteins that fulfilled these three criteria are shown in the heat maps for RAW264.7 and THP-1 cell data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Finally, to further narrow the list of proteins of interest, we prioritized those that were common to both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), as determined by identical Uniprot protein IDs. Heat maps were used only with the aim of ordering the protein expression levels according to the row obtained <italic>Z</italic>-score (that is, <italic>z</italic>=(<italic>x</italic>-mean)/s.d.). The proteins were clustered in the horizontal direction hierarchically using Euclidean distance and average linkage methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). In these data matrices, each column represents the TMT time point analysis 0, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72âh, and each row corresponds to a protein gene ID.</p>

        <title>PARP14âPARP9 network analysis</title>
        <p>As a parallel approach to further investigate the candidacy of PARP9 and PARP14 as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, we turned to <italic>in silico</italic> or network-based prediction methods under the premise that a potential PARP14âPARP9 interactome would be close in vicinity to its pertinent vascular disease network/module.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the impact of PARP14âPARP9 neighbours, we used the HumanNet interaction database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. We then used the random-walk methodology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> to construct the disease modules from the functional database using geneâdisease associations extracted from genome-wide association studies and from the OMIM ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</ext-link>) and the MalaCards ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.malacards.org">http://www.malacards.org</ext-link>) databases for: Cardiomyopathy, Coronary Heart disease, Heart Failure, Hypercholestermia, Hypertension, Metabolic Traits, Osteoporosis, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Sudden Cardiac Arrest, Systemic lupus erythematosus, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The PARP9âPARP14 module was determined by first neighbours in the functional database. Further, we restricted the first neighbours to those that are expressed in macrophages based on gene expression. The motivation of this network analysis is based on two recent studies of ours that investigated the localization of disease in the network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and measure the separation of disease modules in the network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, both of which have proved instrumental in identifying disease modules. These network topology-based methods have been rigorously validated in both of these peer-reviewed publications by means of biological enrichment as well as compared with other network-based methodologies. On the basis of this selection, we considered 55 first neighbours for PARP9 and 149 for PARP14 that we annotated collectively as the PARP9âPARP14 module. Further, we measured the closeness of the first neighbours using the shortest-path topology measure with the disease modules above. For each disease module, we calculated the shortest-path distances to the PARP9âPARP14 module and compared these distances to the random distance distribution with the same module size (Wilcoxon test and BenjaminiâHochberg correction for multiple testing). Finally, we verified that the module size does not affect the significance of the <italic>P</italic> values for the Coronary Heart Disease and Osteoporosis modules by recalculating the random distances by reducing the module size to the top 35 genes from random walk.</p>

        <p>Transluminal arterial injury was induced for 10-week-old mice by inserting spring wire (0.38âmm in diameter, C-SF-15-15, Cook) into the femoral artery under microscopic observation (leica M80)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Right common femoral artery, superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery (DFA) were first exposed. After looping SFA with 9-0 nylon suture, a small hole in the DFA was made and a wire was inserted through the hole and advanced to the iliac artery (10âmm). DFA was ligated with 9-0 nylon suture when the wire was removed at the closer point to DFA and common femoral artery bifurcation than the hole.</p>

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the BioMark 96.96 Dynamic Array platform (Fluidgm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. After isolation of CD14+ PBMCs from buffy coat, cells were cultured for 10 days. Cells in unstimulated control condition were harvested on day10 and IFNÎ³-stimulated cells were harvested on day 11 after 24âh incubation with IFNÎ³ 10ângâml<sup>â1</sup>. The cell capture rate by the C1 chip was 89.6% (86/96) in unstimulated control and 83.3% (84/96) in IFNÎ³-stimulated of donor 1, 96.9% (93/96) in unstimulated control and 89.6% (86/96) in IFNÎ³-stimulated of donor 2, and 92.7% (89/96) in unstimulated control and 85.4% (82/96) in IFNÎ³-stimulated of donor3.</p>
        <p>The raw real-time PCR reads for each array were transformed into <italic>n</italic> Ã m matrices using Python's Pandas libraries ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">http://pandas.pydata.org/</ext-link>; where <italic>n</italic>=cell index and m=gene). Each data matrix was then processed and analysed using an in-house developed platform.</p>
        <p>We first run a check for each column (genes) to see whether there are undetected values (CT=999) interspersed among positive reads (CT&lt;25). If less than 10% of the reads are positive, we substitute those values with 999, and consider the entire gene undetectable for this array. On the other hand, if more than 10% of the genes are positive, their corresponding reads with undetected values are substituted with the average value of the positive reads. Granted, more sophisticated missing-value imputation (MVI) techniques exist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>; however, we may not have enough features (96 features) to fully benefit from MVI nor is it clear whether this necessarily leads to improvement in signal. Moreover, genes requiring missing-value estimation tend to fall near the limit of detection, and are unlikely to benefit fully from MVI. For the purpose of having a fully populated matrix with no missing values, the averaged value therefore should suffice. The final missing-value adjusted reads are converted into log2exp via the following equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq2">equation 1</xref>), where LOD stands for the limit of detection and set at recommended default value of 24.</p>

        <p>Although we do not normalize using housekeeping genes (see below for normalization method), they can be good indicators of the overall read quality for a given cell. Cells without the housekeeping gene expression (that is, <italic>GAPDH</italic>) were removed from analysis. Next, we calculate the mean expression value of the <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene (average log2exp of all cells for <italic>GAPDH</italic>). Cells with outlier <italic>GAPDH</italic> expression (more than 3 s.d.'s from the mean) were also excluded from the analysis.</p>
        <p>Individual cells may exhibit extreme reads because of transcriptional burst, or because of high-instrument sensitivity [5]. Such extreme values need to be contained. Trimming methods (removal of extreme outliers based on the 5% quantile on either side of the read distribution) are unsuitable, as they would alter the dimensions of the matrix as well as lead to the loss of data. For example, given 100 genes with 100 observations each. If there is a 5% chance for every gene that at least one observation would contain an extreme outlier, then via the process of trimming, only 95 of the observations could be used for analysis since the outliers, and hence the entire column (containing useful information as well) would be discarded. To circumvent this, and maintain the overall integrity of the matrix, we performed Winsorization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>, where we set boundaries of the extreme values to the values of the 5 and 95%th quartiles, respectively.</p>
        <p>To compare the chips, individual genes are converted into <italic>z</italic>-scores by subtracting the mean from the log2exp, and division by the s.d.</p>
        <p>Arrays are compared on a per-donor basis (Donor_i unstimulated control, IFNÎ³-stimulated, where <italic>i</italic>=1,2,3). For each pair, the arrays are merged into a combined matrix.
