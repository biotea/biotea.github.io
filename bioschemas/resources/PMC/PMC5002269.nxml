        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Methionine-1 (M1)-linked ubiquitin chains regulate the activity of NF-ÎºB, immune homeostasis, and responses to infection. The importance of negative regulators of M1-linked chains inÂ vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the M1-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN is essential for preventing TNF-associated systemic inflammation in humans and mice. A homozygous hypomorphic mutation in human <italic>OTULIN</italic> causes a potentially fatal autoinflammatory condition termed OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS). Four independent OTULIN mouse models reveal that OTULIN deficiency in immune cells results in cell-type-specific effects, ranging from over-production of inflammatory cytokines and autoimmunity due to accumulation of M1-linked polyubiquitin and spontaneous NF-ÎºB activation in myeloid cells to downregulation of M1-polyubiquitin signaling by degradation of LUBAC in B and TÂ cells. Remarkably, treatment with anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies ameliorates inflammation in ORAS patients and rescues mouse phenotypes. Hence, OTULIN is critical for restrainingÂ life-threatening spontaneous inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein ubiquitination regulates virtually every aspect of cellular homeostasis, in large part through structurally and functionally distinct polyubiquitin (polyUb) signals (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). PolyUb chains can be linked via one of seven Ub Lys (K) residues (e.g., K63-linked chains) or via Ub Met1 (M1), forming M1-linked (also known as linear) chains. The latter have important roles in regulating the immune system, in which they contribute to regulating nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) transcription factors that orchestrate immune responses (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bonizzi and Karin, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Ub chains regulate canonical NF-ÎºB activation by mediating timed degradation of the inhibitor of ÎºB (IÎºB) proteins but also serve as a scaffolding, recruitment, and activation platform in receptor signaling complexes. Non-degradative K63- and M1-linked chains mediate the key upstream event of recruiting the TGFÎ²-activated kinase (TAK1) and the IÎºB kinase (IKK) complexes, respectively (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jiang and Chen, 2012</xref>). K63 and M1 linkages occur in the same Ub polymers (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Emmerich etÂ al., 2013</xref>), facilitating TAK1 and IKK co-localization and cross-activation.</p>
      <p>M1-linked chains are generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) consisting of HOIP, HOIL-1, and SHARPIN (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fiil and Gyrd-Hansen, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Iwai etÂ al., 2014</xref>). LUBAC is recruited to many immune receptors, including TNF-R1, IL-1R, CD40, TLRs, and NOD2, in a Ub-dependent manner. At the receptors, LUBAC ubiquitinates a host of targets, including RIPK1, RIPK2, MyD88, IRAKs, and NEMO, directly or on pre-existing Ub chains (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fiil and Gyrd-Hansen, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Iwai etÂ al., 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Genetic loss of LUBAC components leads to immunodeficiency (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">MacDuff etÂ al., 2015</xref>) and inflammatory phenotypes in mice (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>), which can be rescued by co-deletion of TNF-R1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kumari etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Peltzer etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rickard etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Mutations in LUBAC components also cause inflammatory conditions in humans (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boisson etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Boisson etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Hence, loss of M1-linked chains imbalances immune signaling.</p>
      <p>Several deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including A20, CYLD, and Cezanne, act as negative regulators of NF-ÎºB signaling and are essential for resolving inflammation and the return to homeostasis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harhaj and Dixit, 2012</xref>). OTULIN (also known as FAM105B or Gumby) is the only DUB known to specifically cleave M1 linkages (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keusekotten etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>). OTULIN directly binds the LUBAC component HOIP, and knockdown of OTULIN in human cell lines increases M1-linked chains on LUBAC and its substrates (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elliott etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fiil etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keusekotten etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Schaeffer etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, while LUBAC translocates to receptor signaling complexes (RSCs), OTULIN is not stably associated with TNF or NOD2 RSCs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Draber etÂ al., 2015</xref>), and how it regulates signaling complexes, e.g., TNF signaling, is unclear (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the physiological role of OTULIN in the immune system has remained unstudied, since OTULIN loss-of-function mutations lead to early embryonic lethality (E12.5âE14) in mice due to defective Wnt signaling and angiogenesis (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we describe that a homozygous hypomorphic OTULIN mutation in a consanguineous family causes a potentially fatal autoinflammatory disorder termed OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS), which can be managed by Infliximab (anti-TNF neutralizing antibody). We recapitulate key features of ORAS in mouse models of OTULIN deficiency. In an acute model, induced loss of OTULIN in immune cells leads to multi-organ inflammation and deterioration of animals within a few days; this can be ameliorated by anti-TNF, but not by neutralization of other upregulated cytokines. In addition, loss of OTULIN in myeloid cells generates a chronic model in which mice display increased serum levels of inflammation-associated cytokines and chemokines and develop splenomegaly and autoimmunity. In bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), loss of OTULIN leads to overproduction of M1-linked Ub chains and dysregulated NF-ÎºB activation and cytokine secretion. Strikingly, while mice lacking OTULIN in B or TÂ cells do not display overt inflammatory phenotypes, further analysis indicates that these OTULIN-deficient cells have downregulated LUBAC components HOIP and SHARPIN, but not HOIL-1.</p>
      <p>Together, the data from mouse models and human patients clearly establish OTULIN and M1-linked polyUb chains as key regulators of immune homeostasis, inflammation, and autoimmunity and reveal cell-type-specific effects of OTULIN in immune cells.</p>

        <title>Hypomorphic OTULIN Germline Mutation in Patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Disease</title>
        <p>From the late 1990s, three premature newborns (born at week 34, week 36, and week 28+6, respectively) from a consanguineous family (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) displayed severe idiopathic inflammatory symptoms. Within days to weeks after birth, they had repeated episodes of systemic inflammation with diarrhea and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B) and white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil count (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C) without evidence of infection. All three eventually developed relapsing nodular panniculitis with neutrophil infiltrate and recurrent fevers. The patients showed reduced growth parameters and also exhibited painful swollen joints as well as elevated immunoglobulin levels and autoantibodies in serum (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> and <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Experimental Models and Subject Details</xref>). Genetic testing excluded Mediterranean fever, chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular syndrome, tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated periodic syndrome, and hyper IgD syndrome as the cause of the symptoms (<xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Experimental Models and Subject Details</xref>).</p>
        <p>SNP array analysis of the three affected individuals identified three regions of extended homozygosity at chromosomes 5 andÂ 15 shared by all three individuals (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S2</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). The largest region of shared homozygosity was atÂ chromosome 5p15 from 13,802,063 to 16,722,976Â bp between rs795541 and rs4702171. Genotyping of all available family members with microsatellite markers D5S817, D5S1991, D5S1992, D5S1963, and D5S416 confirmed linkage to this candidate region. Within the â¼3 Mb candidate region of chromosome 5p15, sequencing of <italic>FAM105A</italic>, <italic>FBXL7</italic>, <italic>MARCH11</italic>, <italic>ZNF622</italic>, and <italic>FAM34B</italic> revealed no candidate pathogenic variants. However, we detected a homozygous missense substitution in <italic>OTULIN/FAM105B</italic> in all affected individuals (<italic>c.815T&gt;C</italic>; <italic>p.Leu272Pro</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). The parents of patient V:2 (IV:1 and IV:2) were both heterozygous for the substitution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D), and none of the healthy siblings were homozygous for the <italic>c.815T&gt;C</italic> variant (data not shown). Moreover, the variant wasÂ not present in the â¼12,000 and â¼120,000 alleles represented in the Exome Variant Server and EXaC datasets, respectively, either. Consistently, whole-exome sequencing ofÂ patient V:2 revealed no other homozygous or previously annotated pathogenic variants likely to cause the disease phenotype (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S2</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). Thus, we termed the described syndrome OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E).</p>
        <p>Leu272 is located in a helix of the catalytic OTU domain that forms part of the binding pocket for M1-linked diUb, and mutation to Pro would be predicted to disrupt OTULIN Ub binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F). Recombinant OTULIN<sup>L272P</sup> displayed small differences in overall fold and reduced thermal stability (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>B and S1C), and expression of OTULIN<sup>L272P</sup> in HEK293 cells consistently led to significantly reduced levels of OTULIN<sup>L272P</sup> as compared to wild-type protein (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>D). OTULIN<sup>L272P</sup>, although less stable, maintained its interaction with HOIP (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>In addition to reduced stability, OTULIN<sup>L272P</sup> was 1,000â10,000 times less active toward M1-linked di- and tetraUb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>G and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>E). M1-diUb binding to catalytically inactive OTULIN<sup>C129A/L272P</sup> was significantly diminished yet not completely abrogated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>F). OTULIN<sup>L272P</sup> was still M1-linkage specific (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>G), as the affected Ub binding site does not dictate OTULIN specificity (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keusekotten etÂ al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p>Reduced stability and activity of OTULIN suggested an impact on M1-linked polyUb in ORAS patients. Patient blood samples confirmed the presence of OTULIN, albeit at slightly reduced levels as compared to control samples, as well as the presence of SHARPIN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>H). Strikingly, while samples from age-matched controls showed barely detectable levels of M1-linked chains, this chain type was strongly increased in the ORAS patient sample.</p>
        <p>We conclude that loss of OTULIN function and increased levels of M1-linked polyUb in human cells may indeed lead to the severe inflammation and autoimmunity observed in ORAS.</p>

        <title>Neutralization of TNF Ameliorates Systemic Inflammation in ORAS</title>
        <p>Importantly, ORAS can be managed by treatment with the anti-TNF antibody Infliximab. Treatment of affected patients with prednisolone (general corticosteroidal immunosuppressant), azathioprine, and methotrexate (anti-proliferative immunosuppressive drugs), as well as Anakinra (recombinant IL-1R-antagonist), had little or no effect on the symptoms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E and <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Experimental Models and Subject Details</xref>). Patient IV:3 died at 16Â months of age of pneumococcal septicemia, and patient IV:4 died from an episode of systemic inflammation leading to acute renal failure and pulmonary edema at age 5. Of note, neither patient IV:3 nor IV:4 were treated with Infliximab. By contrast, patient V:2 responded well to treatment with Infliximab (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C) and is currently alive (age 11) with well-controlled disease. Infliximab treatment drastically reduced the symptoms, and serum levels of CRP as well as WBC and neutrophil counts in blood, returned to normal ranges after treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B, 1C), suggesting a TNF-mediated pathogenesis in the patients.</p>

        <title>Deletion of <italic>Otulin</italic> in Mouse Immune Cells Drives Acute Systemic Inflammation</title>
        <p>To understand how OTULIN deficiency caused autoinflammation and autoimmunity, we attempted to recapitulate ORAS in mouse models. Due to embryonic lethality (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>), heterozygous <italic>Otulin</italic><sup>+/<italic>Lac</italic>Z</sup> mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>A and S2B) were bred with appropriate inducible and/or tissue-specific Cre expressing mouse strains. OTULIN was expressed in several tissues in <italic>Otulin</italic><sup>+/<italic>Lac</italic>Z</sup> embryos and adult wild-type mice, including spleen and thymus (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>C and S2D). In immune cells, OTULIN was expressed in TÂ cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and prominently in dendritic cells and macrophages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>We generated CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice, in which <italic>Otulin</italic> can be ablated in all cells with tamoxifen administration. Tamoxifen administration led to mice becoming moribund within a day (data not shown), suggesting strong phenotypes also in adult mice in addition to reported developmental defects (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>). This prevented further study, and to investigate the role of OTULIN in the immune system, we generated CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>flox</sup> mixed bone marrow chimeras (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B), which were healthy (data not shown) and showed similar levels of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells inÂ vivo (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>E).</p>
        <p>Six to eight weeks after reconstitution, chimeric mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce <italic>Otulin</italic> ablation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>F). Strikingly, this resulted in rapid weight loss in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras as compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>G). Weight loss was accompanied by a pronounced increase in the number of circulating neutrophils in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D), while the number of lymphocytes and monocytes and the overall number of blood cells or splenocytes did not change (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D, S2E, and S2H). We also observed a marked increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6, the neutrophil cytokines G-CSF and KC, and the monocyte/macrophage chemokine MCP-1 in serum of CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras compared with CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>+/flox</sup> chimeras and vehicle-treated controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E and 2F and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). These cellular and molecular mediators are indicative of an inappropriate and damaging inflammatory response mediated by OTULIN-deficient myeloid cells. As expected in the short timeframe, cytokines associated with adaptive immunity were not elevated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Necropsy of the chimeras did not reveal any gross anatomical changes, but flow cytometry analysis showed substantial infiltration of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in the peritoneal lavage (PL), spleen, and liver and, to some extent, lung and kidney in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras compared with CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>+/flox</sup> or vehicle-treated controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G, 2H, and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>IâS2L). Histological analysis confirmed immune cell infiltration in the livers of CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras with inflammatory foci scattered in the parenchyma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>I, arrowheads). With the exception of PL, where neutrophils were recovered in lower numbers after tamoxifen treatment, tissue-infiltrating neutrophils consisted of overall similar numbers of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> wild-type cells and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> OTULIN-deficient cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>M). This suggests that loss of OTULIN does not cause aberrant cell death in immune cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>E) and that the high levels of cytokines and chemokines present activate the entire immune cell population.</p>
        <p>Collectively, this shows that deletion of <italic>Otulin</italic> in immune cells leads to spontaneous and severe acute systemic inflammation characterized by rapid weight loss, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (in particular, TNF, G-CSF, and IL-6) in serum, neutrophilia with all the hallmarks of emergency granulopoiesis (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>AâS3C), and infiltration of neutrophils intoÂ multiple tissues. This highly pro-inflammatory phenotype of the OTULIN-deficient adult mice is unlikely to arise from defects in Wnt signaling during development (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>) but indeed shows several of the cardinal symptoms of ORAS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E).</p>

        <title>Rescue of Systemic Inflammation in OTULIN-DeficientÂ Mice</title>
        <p>We next tested whether the strong ORAS-like phenotype can be reversed by antibody treatments, as observed in the human disease. It was unclear whether any of the upregulated cytokines were independently regulated by OTULIN/M1-linked chains. Hence, we tested whether neutralization of TNF, G-CSF, or IL-6 impacted on the weight loss and emergency granulopoiesis observed in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeric mice.</p>
        <p>In accordance with the effective treatment of ORAS patients with Infliximab, we found that anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies, administered in parallel with tamoxifen-induced <italic>Otulin</italic> deletion, completely ameliorated weight loss (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). While the numbers of blood neutrophils were still elevated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B), infiltrating neutrophils in spleen and PL of CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> were reduced to a level comparable to isotype-treated CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>+</italic>/flox</sup> controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). In contrast, anti-G-CSF or anti-IL-6 were unable to rescue the phenotype fully. WhileÂ anti-G-CSF treatment strongly reduced blood neutrophil countÂ and infiltration, it failed to rescue weight loss and mice remained cachexic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>Dâ3F). Anti-IL-6 treatment had no impact on neutrophilia, but weight loss was partially rescued (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>Gâ3I). This differential amelioration extended to neutrophil production in the bone marrow, where anti-G-CSF, but not anti-IL-6, reduced the number of uncommitted blood cells (âLSKâ cells, for Lin<sup>â</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells) and immature neutrophils to levels observed in isotype-treated controls (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>DâS3F). This confirms that G-CSF drives emergency granulopoiesis in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras and may contribute to the neutrophilia observed in ORAS patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). Strikingly, anti-TNF treatment of CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras resulted in a global reduction of cytokines, including G-CSF, KC, and TNF itself. IL-6 was reduced to background levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>G). Anti-G-CSF did not affect TNF or IL-6 levels and, in fact, caused elevated production of KC and G-CSF itself (although its functional blockade ameliorated neutrophilia) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>H). Anti-IL-6 increased MCP-1 levels, possibly indicating a pathway for compensation in the absence of IL-6 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>I).</p>
        <p>Together, these data implicate TNF as the pre-eminent factor in driving inflammation in OTULIN-deficient mice, although other cytokines and chemokines clearly contribute to the composite phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>K). This finding correlates with the fact that anti-TNF treatment reverses the inflammatory symptoms in the ORAS patient and therefore suggests that OTULIN-deficient mice provide a good model to understand the mechanisms underlying ORAS.</p>

        <title>Differential Effects of OTULIN Deletion in Cells of the Immune System</title>
        <p>To dissect immune mechanisms contributing to the strong OTULIN deficiency phenotype, we employed mouse models in which <italic>Otulin</italic> can be constitutively ablated in specific immune cell lineages, namely TÂ cells (âCD4Creâ mice, expressing Cre recombinase under control of the <italic>Cd4</italic> promoter), B cells (âMB1Creâ mice, expressing Cre under control of the <italic>Mb1</italic> promoter), and myeloid cells (âLysMCreâ mice, expressing Cre under control of the <italic>LysM</italic> promoter, leading to knockout in macrophages, neutrophils, and some dendritic cells).</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, loss of OTULIN in TÂ cells or B cells generated healthy mice with no overt inflammatory phenotypes, as assessed by phenotypic, blood cell, cytokine, and serum IgG analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>AâS4C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S5</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>).

        <p>In stark contrast, deletion of OTULIN in myeloid cells resulted in a strong inflammatory phenotype. LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice were born at Mendelian ratios, appeared healthy at weaning, and showed similar survival as compared to controls but were slightly smaller in terms of body weight (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>D and S4E). Indeed, closer inspection of 3- to 9-month-old LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice revealed a marked increase in the size of lymphoid organs and liver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>F) and prominent leukocytosis with increased numbers of circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F) as compared to controls.</p>

        <title>Deletion of <italic>Otulin</italic> in Myeloid Cells Leads to Chronic Inflammation and Autoimmunity</title>
        <p>Strikingly, serum analysis showed that 16 out of 25 tested cytokines and chemokines were markedly elevated in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G and 4H and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>), including the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-1Î²; the neutrophil and monocyte attractants/activators MCP-1 and MIP-1Î±; and G-CSF. Interestingly, cytokines associated with TÂ cell activation and adaptive immunity, such as IL-2, IL-4, IFNÎ³, and RANTES, were also elevated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G and 4H and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>), as were serum IgG levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>I). Collectively, these findings indicate ongoing, systemic inflammation in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice involving both innate and adaptive immune cells.</p>
        <p>Histological analysis revealed substantial immune cell infiltration in livers of LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice, particularly around veins but also in the parenchyma, and a distorted splenic architecture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). Collagen deposits in liver (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A, right) and spleen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B, right) were visible and consistent with chronic inflammation. Moreover, germinal center activation was evident in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> spleens (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B, left), suggesting B cell hyperactivation and potential for immunoglobulin-mediated pathology. Flow cytometric analysis showed that LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice had greater numbers of both CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> neutrophils and CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>â</sup> macrophages in PL, spleen, liver, lungs, and kidney compared with LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>+</italic>/flox</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C, 5D, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>A, and S5B). LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice also had increased numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> TÂ cells in liver and kidney (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>D, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>C, and S5D), consistent with systemic chronic inflammation and involvement of the adaptive immune system. The number of CD4<sup>+</sup> TÂ cells remained normal (data not shown).</p>
        <p>High-serum IgG and the appearance of active germinal centers in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice suggested B cell hyperactivation, leading to higher levels of antibodies in the serum, a hallmark of autoimmunity. Indeed, the amounts of serum immunoglobulin isotypes IgG1, IgG2a and b, IgA, and IgM were elevated in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> serum, while IgG3 levels were unchanged when compared to LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>flox</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E). This indicated polyclonal B cell activation and suggestedÂ that LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice could be autoimmune. Consistent with this, ELISA analysis revealed higher antibodyÂ reactivity against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and Smith antigen in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> serum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>F). B cell activating factor (BAFF) is the primary cytokine that governs peripheral B cell tolerance, and increased BAFF levels can lead to T-cell-independent BÂ cell activation and immunoglobulin production (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Groom etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, we found that LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice had elevated levels of BAFF in serum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>G), suggesting that secretion of BAFF resulting from OTULIN deficiency leads to breakdown of peripheral tolerance and activation of autoreactive B cells.</p>
        <p>Collectively, these results show that OTULIN is essential in myeloid cells to prevent unwarranted secretion of cytokines leading to inflammation, as well as autoimmunity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>K).</p>

      <sec id="sec2.7">
        <title>OTULIN Deficiency Leads to Sterile Autoactivation of Inflammatory Pathways</title>
        <p>We next investigated the molecular mechanisms resulting in the strong inflammatory phenotypes, using BMDMs from LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>+</italic>/flox</sup>, LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup>, or LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>del/flox</sup> mice, which were cultured and studied for pathway activation by western blotting in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. Interestingly, in agreement with the patient samples, the levels of M1-linked Ub chains were markedly increased (â¼8-fold on average) in OTULIN-deficient BMDMs, in particular in the high-molecular-weight range, while K63-linked, K48-linked, or total Ub levels were unchanged (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). Strikingly, this resulted in NF-ÎºB activation evidenced by degradation of IÎºBÎ± and increased phosphorylation of p65/RelA in the absence of exogenous stimuli (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B). Cycloheximide chase experiments confirmed the increased turnover of IÎºBÎ± (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C), a hallmark of NF-ÎºB pathway activation. This correlated with increased transcription of NF-ÎºB target genes such as <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Nfkbia (IÎºBÎ±)</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>Tnfaip3 (A20)</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D) and concomitant secretion of TNF and IL-6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E). Also, LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>+</italic>/flox</sup> and LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> BMDMs were similarly viable when left untreated or when treated with LPS, TNF, or Staurosporine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F), suggesting no apparent sensitization to cell death in these cells.</p>
        <p>Importantly, while SHARPIN levels were slightly reduced, theÂ levels of HOIP and HOIL-1 were unchanged in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> BMDMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>G), consistent with strong production of M1-linked polyUb in these cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). Protein levels of NEMO/IKKÎ³, A20, and CYLD were similar to controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>G). LUBAC signaling may impact alternative inflammatory pathways, yet in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>del/flox</sup> BMDMs, NF-ÎºB-inducing kinase (NIK) was not stabilized (indicating no activation of non-canonical NF-ÎºB), and IRF-3 or p38 phosphorylation was not increased (suggesting that IRF or MAPK signaling pathways were not active) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>H).</p>
        <p>Finally, we examined the response of BMDMs to TNF. Since these cells secrete TNF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E), the observed cellular response may, in part, originate from autocrine signaling. Indeed, when MEFs were treated with anti-TNF antibodies, exogenous TNF was unable to induce IÎºBÎ± degradation and p65 phosphorylation (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S6</xref>A). Importantly, when TNF was neutralized in the culture medium of untreated BMDMs, IÎºBÎ± levels decreased with similar kinetics as compared to isotype-treated BMDMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C, quantified in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>I). This provided further strong evidence for a cell-autonomous activation of NF-ÎºB in OTULIN-deficient BMDMs.</p>
        <p>Autocrine signaling would be further enhanced in a positive feedback mechanism if loss of OTULIN would strengthen the response to TNF. Indeed, stimulation of BMDMs with TNF led to stronger transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Tnf</italic> in cells from LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>del/flox</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>J), consistent with a role of OTULIN as a negative regulator in this pathway.</p>
        <p>Together, this shows that OTULIN-deficient macrophages are unable to control LUBAC-mediated production of M1-linked polyUb chains and that this signal leads to stimulus-independent basal NF-ÎºB activation and âsterileâ inflammatory signaling, possibly enhanced by autocrine feedback. The idea of sterile inflammation is further supported in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras that have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics toÂ reduce the microbial load; these mice display an identical inflammatory phenotype as compared to untreated CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6</xref>BâS6G, compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cell-Type-Specific Differences in Response to OTULIN Deficiency</title>
        <p>While loss of OTULIN from myeloid cells and the concomitant dysregulation of M1-linked polyUb resulted in a profound inflammatory phenotype, this was not evident in mice lacking OTULIN in B or TÂ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>). This is surprising since M1 signaling has recently been implicated in TÂ cell signaling (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Park etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Redecke etÂ al., 2016</xref>) and B cell signaling (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Satpathy etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Yang etÂ al., 2016</xref>). The DUB-regulating M1-linked polyUb in B and TÂ cells has not been elucidated.</p>
        <p>To understand this, the M1-Ub signaling cascade was characterized in purified T and B cells from respective knockout mice. To our great surprise, this revealed an almost complete loss of LUBAC components HOIP and SHARPIN, but not HOIL-1, in either of the two independent models (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and 7B). As discussed above, LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> BMDMs showed mildly reduced SHARPIN levels but no difference in HOIP levels. Further evaluation of myeloid cells purified from various tissues likewise showed no loss of HOIP or HOIL-1 and only marginally reduced SHARPIN levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). Such tissue- and subunit-specific regulation of LUBAC components has not been observed previously.</p>
        <p>We next investigated the mechanism of OTULIN-dependent LUBAC regulation. Transcription of HOIP (<italic>Rnf31</italic>), SHARPIN (<italic>Sharpin</italic>), and HOIL-1 (<italic>Rbck1</italic>) genes was unaltered in CD4Cre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup>del/flox</sup> TÂ cells and MB1Cre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> B cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>D and 7E). In contrast, SHARPIN (but not HOIP) levels were partially rescued in purified T and B cells after MG132 treatment, indicating that loss of SHARPIN is due to proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>F and 7G). This reveals a role for OTULIN in the stabilization of LUBAC components that warrants further investigation.</p>

      <p>We provide genetic evidence that OTULIN is a crucial inÂ vivo regulator of inflammation in mice and humans, identify TNF as a key driver of the phenotypes caused by OTULIN deficiency, and show that OTULIN deficiency and ORAS can be treated with anti-TNF/Infliximab in mice and humans.</p>
      <p>The discovery of an OTULIN mutation in human patients with a severe inflammatory syndrome, ORAS, highlights how deregulation of a single Ub chain signal, M1-linked polyUb, causes human disease. Mutations of LUBAC components are also associated with inflammatory syndromes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Boisson etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boisson etÂ al., 2015</xref>), yet these constitute loss-of-function mutations with regards to M1-polyUb signaling. In contrast, loss of function of OTULIN leads to an amplification of the M1-polyUb signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>H). Strikingly, the net result, inflammation, is the same, highlighting how the essential M1-polyUb signal is delicately balanced to determine a cellular output.</p>
      <p>Many DUBs have been identified to play key roles in regulating signaling pathways; however, we are unaware of another enzyme that, when removed from cells, has such global effects on a single chain type. The marked upregulation of M1-linked chains in OTULIN-deficient BMDMs and ORAS patient samples suggests that there is little redundancy for regulation of this chain type. Two recent reports implicate CYLD in the regulation of M1-polyUb signaling at receptor complexes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Draber etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka etÂ al., 2016</xref>). Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis showed that OTULIN is not present at TNF and NOD2 RSCs, but while one group suggests that OTULINâs role is restricted to LUBAC homeostasis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Draber etÂ al., 2015</xref>), our work suggests that, while OTULIN might not stably associate with the receptor complexes, it plays active roles in receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka etÂ al., 2016</xref>) (see above, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>J).</p>
      <p>Physiologically, our data support a model whereby the unrestricted accumulation of M1-linked Ub chains leads to sterile inflammation due to stimulation-independent activation of NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>H). Importantly, the role of OTULIN in NF-ÎºB inhibition is conceptually distinct from other NF-ÎºB-induced negative feedback regulators, such as A20 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harhaj and Dixit, 2012</xref>). OTULIN is not under transcriptional control by NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fiil etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keusekotten etÂ al., 2013</xref>) but appears to constitutively and efficiently remove M1-linked polyUb signals. In the absence of OTULIN, LUBAC activity is unrestricted, and such signals accumulate in a deregulated fashion to initiate uncoordinated NF-ÎºB activation and sterile inflammation. The downstream effects of this include secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, immune cell activation, and infiltration, culminating in severe inflammatory phenotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>K and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>H).</p>
      <p>Strikingly, this is not always the case. Mice with OTULIN deficiency in B or TÂ cells do not show overt phenotypes, and this is due to downregulation of LUBAC components HOIP and SHARPIN, but not HOIL-1, at the protein level, in OTULIN-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A, 7B, 7H). Genetic loss of SHARPIN in <italic>cpdm</italic> mice destabilizes both HOIP and HOIL-1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda etÂ al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2011</xref>), contrasting the stability of HOIL-1 in our models. This may point to differentiated use of LUBAC components in immune cells. Second, OTULIN only cleaves non-degradative M1-linked polyUb. Knockdown of OTULIN leads to M1 polyubiquitination of all three LUBAC components (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fiil etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hrdinka etÂ al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that these chains, at least on HOIP and SHARPIN, are extended or edited in T and B cells by an unidentified E3 ligase to turn a non-degradative into a degradative signal. The mechanism of OTULIN-regulated LUBAC degradation requires further study, but the findings clearly suggest that whole-body OTULIN deficiency generates a complex composite phenotype, signified by cell-type-specific regulation of M1 signaling.</p>
      <p>There are also subtle but important differences in the observed inflammatory phenotypes comparing CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras and LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice, which present differently in terms of severity of symptoms of disease, e.g., cachexia/weight loss. The nearly identical absolute levels of serum TNF, the key mediator of the inflammatory phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> andÂ <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) indicates that myeloid cells are responsible for TNF production, but this does not explain the phenotypic difference. Rescue experiments suggest that G-CSF regulates emergency granulopoiesis, but not cachexia. Instead, we uncover a prominent role of IL-6, a key mediator of TNF- and inflammation-induced cachexia (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Morley etÂ al., 2006</xref>). This cytokine is higher in CreERT2-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> chimeras as compared to LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H), explaining, in part, the difference in the severity of phenotypes. Further differences include the temporal profile, with the chimera model being an induced, acute model and the myeloid-specific knockout being a constitutive, lifetime model. Finally, the numerous other upregulated cytokines in LysMCre-<italic>Otulin</italic><sup><italic>Lac</italic>Z/flox</sup> mice, which includes anti-inflammatory IL-10, will generate a delicate balance of responses, enabling these mice to deal with inflammation induced by loss of OTULIN.</p>
      <p>We show that excess M1-linked polyUb in cells of the immune system is harmful, but it most likely also affects other cell types and organs. For example, ORAS patients suffer from panniculitis, and it will be informative to study the role of OTULIN in skin homeostasis and inflammation. Moreover, the roles of OTULIN in embryonic development, potentially due to effects in the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rivkin etÂ al., 2013</xref>), require further investigation. Our immune-specific mouse models are not suitable to investigate this in detail. Significantly, the fact that the here-described OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome/ORAS can be treated with TNF-neutralizing antibodies suggests a potential therapeutic strategy to treat conditions caused by excessive M1-linked polyUb signaling.</p>

            <title>Patient IV:3</title>
            <p>The consultand is the first child born to consanguineous parents (III:3 and III:4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) at 34Â weeks gestation via normal vaginal delivery and was small for gestational age. She presented at 3Â weeks of age with protracted diarrhea and failure to thrive. She required total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and later nasogastric tube feeds. During her lengthy admission she was noted to have recurrent episodes of a widespread nodular erythematous rash associated with fever, elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B-D), and an exacerbation of her diarrhea. An initial skin biopsy, taken as the rash was resolving, showed non-specific changes. Duodenal biopsies showed microvillous dystrophy. She also had mild hepatomegaly. A liver biopsy showed TPN-associated liver disease with micronodular cirrhosis and macrovisicular steatosis. Liver function later returned to normal, although hepatomegaly and the permanent damage from cirrhosis persisted. There are no records of splenomegaly in this patient. Echocardiogram identified an atrial septal defect.</p>
            <p>The patient was extensively investigated to identify the cause of her protracted diarrhea and episodic skin rash including a number of immunological investigations. Of note she had normal alpha 1 anti-trypsin level, normal functional antibodies, normal lymphocyte subsets although with a modest increase in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells (2120 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; normal 500-1500), normal lymphocyte function tests, neutrophil function test, and normal NBT tests. She did have elevated IgG, IgM, and IgA levels (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), raised CRP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C), elevated C1q (171Â mg/L; normal 80-150Â mg/L) and C3 (2.75 g/L; normal 0.75-1.75 g/L), and she was positive for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), both 1:100 titers. When she was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, her fever, diarrhea, and rash would resolve, but these clinical features would return when attempts were made to change to oral prednisolone. Azathioprine and methotrexate were also trialed. In a course of 3Â months she had three cases of severe bilateral pneumonia progressing to sepsis and renal tubular necrosis, hematuria, proteinuria, and raised urea and creatinine requiring admittance to the pediatric intensive care unit. She survived two episodes, but sadly died at 16Â months during the third episode of pneumococcal septicemia, which led to respiratory collapse.</p>

            <title>Patient IV:4</title>
            <p>The consultand is the second child born to consanguineous parents (III:3 and III:4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) at 36Â weeks gestation via normal vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 2Â kg. She was diagnosed with relapsing nodular panniculitis at 3Â days of age. A skin biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. This rash, similarly to her sister (patient IV:3) and cousin (patient V:2), was episodic and associated with diarrhea (bloody at presentation), vomiting, fever, and painful swollen joints and difficulty sleeping. She had elevated white bloodÂ cell counts with pronounced neutrophilia as well as raised CRP levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B-D), as well as elevated C3 (2.77 g/L; normal 0.75-1.75 g/L), but was negative for ANCA autoantibodies (she was not tested for other autoantibodies). She had normal lymphocyte subsets. There are no records of hepatosplenomegaly in this patient. She required nasogastric tube feeds for failure to thrive. All growth parameters were below the 0.4th centile. She also had bilateral cataracts diagnosed at the age of 5Â months and developmental delay. The cataracts were not present in the neonatal period on formal ophthalmological examination and were not secondary to steroid use.</p>
            <p>She was treated with prednisolone from the age of 1Â month, and with azathioprine and Anakinra (recombinant IL-1R-antagonist) unsuccessfully. She had recurrent urinary tract infections and viral illnesses, which coincided with immunosuppressive therapy. During a severe episode of inflammation at the age of five she demonstrated features consistent with a high cell turnover including elevated potassium, phosphate, uric acid, LDH, elevated white blood cell count and a metabolic acidosis. She was admitted to pediatric intensive care with acute renal failure, pulmonary edema and an ileus, but sadly passed away just before turning 5 years old. Treatment had included intubation and ventilation, intravenous methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and methotrexate. In this patient, Familial Mediterranean Fever, Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous Articular syndrome, Tumor necrosis factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome, and Hyper IgD syndrome had all been excluded by genetic analysis.</p>

            <title>Patient V:2</title>
            <p>The consultand is the second child born prematurely at 28+6Â weeks gestation to consanguineous parents (IV:1 and IV:2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) with a birth weight of 1.23Â kg. He developed relapsing nodular panniculitis at 8Â weeks of age while he was in the neonatal intensive care unit. Prior to the appearance of his skin rash, he had repeated episodes of possible infection with raised CRP levels and elevated white blood cell count and neutrophilia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B-D), but no focus of infection could be identified. The rash was biopsied and this confirmed inflammation in the dermis extending into the subcutaneous layer with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. No granulomas or vasculitis was seen. He has had frequent flare-ups involving widespread painful lumps in the skin lasting 2Â days to 2Â weeks. During these episodes he was systemically unwell with fever, vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), inflamed painful joints, swollen feet, and weight loss associated with elevated CRP levels and white blood cell count (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D), with a neutrophilia showing toxic granulation and a left shift. He would lose his appetite, lose weight, and become dehydrated, which required admission to the high dependency unit on some occasions. These episodes appeared to resolve with an increase in the dose of prednisolone. In addition, he seemed susceptible to frequent infections especially viral illnesses including varicella zoster virus (VZV), influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), although these coincided with immunosuppressive therapy. He had poor weight gain, slow linear growth, developmental delay, mild learning difficulties, congenital hydroceles, dental caries, a pathological osteoporotic tibial fracture and he developed juvenile cortical cataracts at 2-3 years of age, which were treated with a bilateral lensectomy and vitrectomy. There are no records of hepatosplenomegaly in this patient.</p>
            <p>On examination, his growth parameters were all less than the 0.4th centile. He had a prominent nodular rash in keeping with a flare of panniculitis. He had coarse hair with bushy eyebrows, slight hyper-telorism, broad nasal bridge, prominent nose, protruding normally formed ears and a prominent chin.</p>
            <p>He had comprehensive immunological investigations which were normal including lymphocyte subset panel and proliferation analysis, a normal neutrophil oxidative burst, and normal expression of CD11a,b,c, CD18, CD55, CD95, MHCI, MHCII, and CD25. He had increased IgA and IgM levels (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) in serum and a single strongly positive anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA; 1:320 titer), but no other autoantibodies. He does not have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or pancreatitis. The most recent skin biopsy demonstrated inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes and neutrophils within the subcutis, associated with foci of fat necrosis where neutrophils are particularly prominent. The inflammation seemed predominantly septal, but with extension into the lobules. Some of the septal blood vessels showed edema of their walls, but no frank vasculitis was identified. The features were very similar to those seen in the biopsy from his cousin (patient IV:4) and suggested a neutrophil-rich panniculitis with fat necrosis favoring septal distribution.</p>
            <p>He has been treated both with systemic steroids and Anakinra (recombinant IL-1R-antagonist). Neither medication successfully prevented the exacerbations or additional symptoms. Infliximab (TNF neutralizing antibody) was introduced eight years ago (at age â¼3) and has successfully controlled the disease. He has had a couple of minor exacerbations when the frequency of the Infliximab treatments was decreased, or the dose per kg fell to nearly 5Â mg/kg. In addition to this, he takes prophylactic methotrexate, azithromycin, and aciclovir.</p>

          <p>Blood genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy kit (QIAGEN). A genome-wide linkage scan was carried out using the Affymetrix 250K SNP microarray with DNA from the three affected patients (V:2, IV:3 and IV:4). Homozygous regions were identified in affected patients using the program HomozygosityMapper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.homozygositymapper.org/" id="intref0400">http://www.homozygositymapper.org/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Seelow etÂ al., 2009</xref>) and further analyzed to confirm or refute linkage by typing microsatellite markers in all family members from whom DNA was available. Direct sequencing of the genes within the identified region was prioritised according to putative function and position. The genomic DNA sequence of candidate genes was taken from Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html" id="intref0405">http://www.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>) and primer pairs for the translated exons were designed using ExonPrimer software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/ExonPrimer.html" id="intref0410">https://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/ExonPrimer.html</ext-link>). Individual exons and flanking sequences were amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (primer details and conditions on request). PCR products were directly sequenced by the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and run on an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystem). Sanger sequencing was repeated on at least two independent PCR products to confirm sequence variants. DNA sequences were analyzed using the Chromas software (Technelysium). Whole Exome Sequencing was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Clark etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Exon capture was performed with the SureSelect All Exon 50Mb Target Enrichment System (Agilent) and massively parallel DNA sequencing was undertaken on an Illumina AnalyserIIx with 76bp paired end reads. Single nucleotide substitutions and small insertion deletions were detected and quality filtered within the SamTools software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/" id="intref0415">http://samtools.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li etÂ al., 2009</xref>) and in-house software tools.

Data were analyzed using the two-sided nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test of the null hypothesis of continuous data unless otherwise indicated in figure legends or method details. Data analysis was not blinded. Differences in means were considered statistically significant at pÂ &lt; 0.05. Significance levels are: <sup>â</sup> pÂ &lt; 0.05; <sup>ââ</sup> pÂ &lt; 0.01; <sup>âââ</sup> pÂ &lt; 0.001; <sup>ââââ</sup> pÂ &lt; 0.0001; n.s., non-significant. Analyses were performed using the Graphpad Prism 6.0 software.</p>
