      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>EphA2, a member of the Eph receptor family, is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including breast cancers, and promotes cancer cell motility and invasion independently of its ligand ephrin stimulation. In this study, we identify Ephexin4 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoG that interacts with EphA2 in breast cancer cells, and knockdown and rescue experiments show that Ephexin4 acts downstream of EphA2 to promote ligand-independent breast cancer cell migration and invasion toward epidermal growth factor through activation of RhoG. The activation of RhoG recruits its effector ELMO2 and a Rac GEF Dock4 to form a complex with EphA2 at the tips of cortactin-rich protrusions in migrating breast cancer cells. In addition, the Dock4-mediated Rac activation is required for breast cancer cell migration. Our findings reveal a novel link between EphA2 and Rac activation that contributes to the cell motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>EphA2, a member of Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merlos-SuÃ¡rez and Batlle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). Overexpression of EphA2 is associated with an aggressive and metastatic cellular phenotype in breast cancers, and recent studies have revealed that EphA2 acts as a downstream effector of EGF receptors to promote cancer cell motility and invasion, independently of the ligand ephrin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zelinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Macrae et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brantley-Sieders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, stimulation of EphA2 with its ligand ephrinA1 in cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2009</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic effects of EphA2 remain poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Rho family small GTPases play pivotal roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration and also contribute to many steps in cancer initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sahai and Marshall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vega and Ridley, 2008</xref>). Among Rho GTPases, Rac is activated at the leading edge of motile cells and induces the formation of actin-rich lamellipodia protrusions, which serves as a major driving force of cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>). Rac also plays a key role in the cancer cell movement and formation of protrusions in invading cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurisu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamazaki et al., 2009</xref>). The major downstream proteins for Rac that mediate actin polymerization in lamellipodia protrusions are the WAVE family proteins, the activators of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurisu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>). Activated Arp2/3 complex induces rapid polymerization of actin and the formation of the branched actin filaments present in lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Activation of Rho family GTPases requires GDPâGTP exchange catalyzed by various guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The major class of GEFs is the Dbl family GEFs that contain the Dbl homology (DH)âpleckstrin homology (PH; DH-PH) tandem domain and mediate the GDPâGTP exchange through the DH domain. The second class of GEFs for Rho family GTPases is the Dock family GEFs that have no DH-PH tandem domain. Instead, they contain a new conserved domain that directly interacts with Rho GTPase and mediates its GDPâGTP exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brugnera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CÃ´tÃ© and Vuori, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meller et al., 2002</xref>). Presently, 11 mammalian Dock family members have been identified and are classified into four subfamilies, the Dock180 subfamily (Dock180, Dock2, and Dock5), Dock4 subfamily (Dock3/MOCA and Dock4), Dock9 subfamily (Dock9/Zizimin1, Dock10/Zizimin3, and Dock11/Zizimin2), and Dock7 subfamily (Dock6, Dock7, and Dock8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CÃ´tÃ© and Vuori, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meller et al., 2005</xref>). They activate specific members of Rho GTPases; the Dock180 and Dock4 subfamilies specifically activate Rac, whereas the Zizimin subfamily activates Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiyokawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishihara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Namekata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, Dock7 subfamily members activate both Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamauchi et al., 2008</xref>). Dock family members play key roles in a variety of important cellular functions, including cell migration, phagocytosis, and neuronal axon and dendrite morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CÃ´tÃ© and Vuori, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyamoto and Yamauchi, 2010</xref>). In addition, several recent studies have identified their roles in cancer cell migration and invasion. Dock180 promotes glioma cell invasion, whereas Dock3 and Dock10 mediate different modes of cell movement and invasion in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jarzynka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gadea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The small GTPase RhoG is a key upstream regulator of Rac in migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elfenbein et al., 2009</xref>). RhoG activates Rac through its effector ELMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>). ELMO forms a complex with Dock180 or Dock4, and they serve as a functional GEF for Rac in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gumienny et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brugnera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>). The interaction of RhoG with ELMO induces translocation of the ELMOâDock180 or ELMOâDock4 complex from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and activates Rac1 to promote lamellipodium formation and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>). However, the upstream regulators of RhoG activity in the regulation of cell migration still remain obscure.</p>
      <p>Ephexin is a subfamily of Dbl family GEFs that interacts directly with EphA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahin et al., 2005</xref>). At least five members of the Ephexin subfamily (Ephexin1â5) have been reported, and Ephexin1 (ARHGEF27/NGEF), Ephexin2 (ARHGEF19/WGEF), Ephexin3 (ARHGEF5/TIM1), and Ephexin5 (ARHGEF15/VsmâRho GEF) activate RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2005</xref>). The function of Ephexin1 is well characterized, and it has been reported that Ephexin1 regulates axon guidance and spine morphogenesis through the interaction with EphA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the functions and biochemical properties of Ephexin4 (ARHGEF16/neuroblastoma) still remain unknown. In this study, we identified Ephexin4 as a GEF for RhoG. Ephexin4 interacts with EphA2 and mediates ligand-independent promotion of cell migration and invasion through the activation of RhoG in breast cancer cells. In addition, the ELMO2âDock4 complex is involved in the downstream signaling pathway of RhoG. Our findings provide a novel signal transduction pathway that contributes to increased migration and invasion of breast cancers and thus may provide information useful for developing new therapeutic strategies that delay or prevent the process of breast cancer cell invasion.</p>

      <p>The DH domain of Ephexin4 shares high amino acid sequence homology with that of SGEF (60%), which is known as a RhoG GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ellerbroek et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we first examined the interaction of Ephexin4 with RhoG and other well-characterized Rho family GTPases by pull-down assays with GST-fused Rho GTPases. Flag-tagged Ephexin4 expressed in HEK293T cells bound to the nucleotide-free forms of RhoG and Rac1 but not to those of RhoA and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To identify RhoG, Rac1, or both as a substrate for Ephexin4, purified GST-fused DH-PH domain of Ephexin4 was incubated with purified RhoG or Rac1 in vitro, and nucleotide exchange activity was measured using an <italic>N</italic>-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP fluorescence-based assay. Although the DH-PH domain of Ephexin4 did not exchange nucleotide on Rac1, it possessed GEF activity of RhoG in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We next examined whether Ephexin4 activates RhoG in cells by using the ability of purified GST-fused N-terminal RhoG-binding region of ELMO to specifically interact with GTP-bound active RhoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>). Expression of Ephexin4 in HEK293T cells increased the amount of active exogenously expressed Myc-tagged RhoG about sixfold over the basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). However, we could observe no obvious increase in the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 in HEK293T cells by expression of Ephexin4 in pull-down assays with GST-fused Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding (CRIB) domain of Pak to precipitate GTP-bound active Rac1 or Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; Dock180 and Zizimin1 were used as positive controls for activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively). Other Ephexin subfamily members activate RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2005</xref>), but we could not detect the increase in RhoA activity in cells expressing Ephexin4, as measured by pull-down assays with GST-fused Rho-binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>; Ephexin1 was used as a positive control for RhoA activation). To confirm the activation of RhoG by Ephexin4, we used HeLa cells, which express a high amount of endogenous RhoG, and expression of Flag-Ephexin4 in HeLa cells enhanced endogenous RhoG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). In addition, HeLa cells expressing Flag-Ephexin4 or Myc-tagged constitutively active RhoG (MycâRhoG-V12) showed extensive membrane ruffling at dorsal surfaces (â¼80% of the transfected cells), which is a typical morphology of RhoG activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blangy et al., 2000</xref>). However, many untransfected parental HeLa cells formed stress fibers but did not form dorsal ruffling. These results indicate that Ephexin4 activates RhoG in cells.</p>

      <p>We raised an antibody against Ephexin4 and found that Ephexin4 was expressed in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). It has been well noticed that EphA2 is highly expressed in invasive human breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zelinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Macrae et al., 2005</xref>). To address the possibility that the interaction between endogenous Ephexin4 and EphA2 occurred in breast cancer cells, we performed immunoprecipitation from MDA-MB-231 cell lysates with anti-EphA2 antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates demonstrates the specific interaction between Ephexin4 and EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We also observed the interaction between Flag-tagged Ephexin4 and Myc-tagged EphA2 expressed in HEK293T cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To identify the region responsible for the interaction between EphA2 and Ephexin4, we constructed deletion mutants of EphA2 and Ephexin4. The cytoplasmic region of Eph receptors contains a protein tyrosine kinase domain and a sterile Î± motif (SAM) domain, and the interaction between Ephexin1 and EphA4 is mediated through the DH-PH motif of Ephexin1 and the kinase domain of EphA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with Flag-tagged Ephexin4 and Myc-tagged wild-type (WT) or deletion mutants of EphA2 (EphA2-ÎKD, lacking the kinase domain; EphA2-ÎSAM, lacking the SAM domain), and EphA2 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with recombinant ephrinA1-Fc chimera. Ephexin4 was coimmunoprecipitated with WT EphA2 (EphA2-WT). However, deletion of the kinase domain reduced the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In contrast, the interaction between Ephexin4 and EphA2 was enhanced by deletion of the SAM domain, suggesting a possible inhibitory role of the SAM domain in their interaction. Deletion of the DH domain of Ephexin4 (Ephexin4-ÎDH) also reduced the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The interaction between the kinase domain of EphA2 and the DH domain of Ephexin4 was confirmed by a pull-down assay with Flag-tagged kinase domain of EphA2 and GST-fused DH domain of Ephexin4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In contrast, the interaction between Ephexin4 and EphA2 was independent of the ligand ephrinA1 stimulation (unpublished data), which is a result similar to that observed in the interaction between Ephexin1 and EphA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

      <p>EphA2 is overexpressed in many cancer cell lines and promotes cell migration in a ligand-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zelinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Macrae et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brantley-Sieders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate the roles of Ephexin4 and RhoG in the promotion of cancer cell migration mediated by EphA2, we performed RNAi-mediated knockdown of Ephexin4, RhoG, and EphA2 in MDA-MB-231 cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors, which effectively reduced the amounts of the endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We evaluated the effect of knockdown of these proteins on the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in Transwell migration assays by using EGF as a chemoattractant because MDA-MB-231 cells show enhanced cell migration and invasion in response to EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hynes and Lane, 2005</xref>). Knockdown of EphA2 by shEphA2-1 or shEphA2-2, targeting different sequences of human EphA2 mRNA, significantly impaired the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to migrate toward EGF-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), suggesting that EphA2 mediates a ligand-independent promotion of chemotactic migration in MDA-MB-231 cells in response to EGF stimulation. We next investigated the effect of Ephexin4 or RhoG knockdown on the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells toward EGF-containing medium and found that knockdown of Ephexin4 by shEphexin4-1 or shEphexin4-2, targeting different regions of human Ephexin4 mRNA, or knockdown of RhoG by RhoG-specific shRNA (shRhoG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katoh et al., 2006</xref>) also significantly blocked the migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Expression of control Luciferase shRNA (shControl) had no effect on the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with untransfected cells (unpublished data). Because the shEphexin4-1 targets Ephexin4 mRNA 3â² untranslated region, we could perform rescue experiments by cotransfection with the plasmid expressing Flag-tagged Ephexin4, which contains only the coding region of Ephexin4. Cotransfection with Flag-Ephexin4 (+Ephexin4-WT) or constitutively active RhoG (+RhoG-V12) completely rescued the defect in cell migration caused by shEphexin4-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). However, FlagâEphexin4-ÎDH, which did not activate RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>), failed to rescue the defect by knockdown of Ephexin4 and also suppressed migration of the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), suggesting that Ephexin4 promotes migration of MDA-MB-231 cells through activation of RhoG. In contrast, expression of Myc-tagged EphA2 (+EphA2), which could rescue the cell migration defect caused by shEphA2-2 (shEphA2-2 targets the 3â² untranslated region of EphA2 mRNA), had little effect on cell migration in Ephexin4 or RhoG knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and F</xref>). In addition, the cell migration defect caused by shEphA2-2 was rescued by expression of RhoG-V12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that Ephexin4 and RhoG act downstream of EphA2 in the promotion of cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. Simultaneous knockdown of EphA2 and Ephexin4 by shEphA2-2 and shEphexin4-1 had no additive inhibitory effect on cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>). This result also supports the idea that EphA2 and Ephexin4 act in the same pathway. Because MDA-MB-231 cells are well known as highly invasive cells, we used Matrigel invasion assays to examine whether EphA2, Ephexin4, and RhoG also contribute to the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and found that knockdown of EphA2, Ephexin4, and RhoG markedly suppressed the EGF-induced Matrigel invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 I</xref>).</p>

      <p>To verify the involvement of Ephexin4 in the EphA2-mediated promotion of cell migration, we used the noninvasive breast cancer cell line MCF7, which expresses a moderate level of endogenous EphA2 compared with that in MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In addition, Ephexin4 is expressed in MCF7 cells, and the interaction with EphA2 was also detected by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Ectopic expression of Myc-tagged EphA2 in MCF7 cells promoted cell migration in the absence of ephrin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). However, knockdown of Ephexin4 by shEphexin4-1 reduced migration of MCF7 cells and completely suppressed the EphA2-induced promotion of cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). Similar results were obtained in cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, which also endogenously express EphA2 and Ephexin4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005141/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).

      <p>RhoG activates Rac1 and promotes cell migration through its effector ELMO and the ELMO-binding protein Dock4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>). In a coimmunoprecipitation experiment with anti-EphA2 antibody, we found that EphA2 formed a complex with ELMO2 and Dock4 in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). To confirm the interaction of EphA2 with ELMO2 and Dock4, Myc-EphA2 was coexpressed with HA-ELMO2, Flag-Dock4, or both in HEK293T cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The interaction between Myc-EphA2 and Flag-Dock4 without HA-ELMO2 expression was very weak, but it was clearly detected in the presence of HA-ELMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). The interaction between EphA2 and ELMO2âDock4 was also observed by immunoprecipitation with ephrinA1-Fc in HEK293T cells cotransfected with HA-ELMO2, Flag-Dock4, and Myc-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that EphA2 forms a ternary complex with ELMO2 and Dock4. The weak interaction between EphA2 and Dock4 without ELMO2 expression may be caused by an endogenous ELMO2-mediated interaction. However, our results cannot rule out the possibility that EphA2 can bind to Dock4 without ELMO2. Immunoprecipitation analysis with deletion mutants of EphA2 showed that the kinase domain of EphA2 was important for the interaction with ELMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Interestingly, the interaction between EphA2 and ELMO2 was enhanced by coexpression with MycâRhoG-V12 but not by coexpression with MycâRhoG-V12A37, a mutant of RhoG-V12 which fails to interact with ELMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh and Negishi, 2003</xref>). These results suggest that activated RhoG binds to ELMO2 and recruits ELMO2 and Dock4 to form a complex with EphA2. An immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-EphA2 antibody shows that interaction of endogenous EphA2 with ELMO2âDock4 was reduced by knockdown of RhoG in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>). This result also supports the conclusion that RhoG regulates the interaction of ELMO2 with EphA2.

In our immunoprecipitation experiments using Fc-fused ephrinA1, the bands of HA-ELMO2 were weakly detected in the absence of overexpressed EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, CâE</xref>, first lanes).

      <p>To investigate the role of Dock4 and ELMO2 in migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, we constructed two shRNAs targeting different sequences of human Dock4 (shDock4-1 and -2) and an shRNA targeting human ELMO2 (shELMO2), which effectively reduced the endogenous protein levels in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Expression of shDock4-1 or shDock4-2 significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells toward EGF-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>). Knockdown of ELMO2 also suppressed the EGF-induced migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, D and E</xref>). Thus, Dock4 and ELMO2 are involved in the EGF-induced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. We next performed rescue experiments by cotransfection with mouse Dock4 WT (mDock4-WT), which was resistant to the human Dock4 shRNA shDock4-2. Expression of mDock4-WT completely rescued the impaired cell migration caused by shDock4-2. However, cotransfection with a mutant of mouse Dock4 (mDock4-AAA), which contains mutations in the Rac GEF domain and has no ability to activate Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>), had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). These results suggest that Dock4 mediates the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through the activation of Rac. However, expression of RhoG-V12, which could rescue the cell migration defect caused by knockdown of EphA2 or Ephexin4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and G</xref>), did not rescue in Dock4 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 G</xref>), supporting a model in which RhoG acts upstream of Dock4.

      <p>Dock family members localize mainly in the cytoplasm, and the translocation to the plasma membrane is essential for their signaling and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">CÃ´tÃ© et al., 2005</xref>). We previously showed that interaction of active RhoG with ELMO2 recruits the ELMO2âDock4 complex to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, to examine whether ELMO2 and Dock4 function downstream of the EphA2âEphexin4âRhoG signaling pathway, we prepared membrane and cytosol fractions from cellular homogenates of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing shRNA for the control Luciferase, EphA2, RhoG, or Ephexin4 in the absence and presence of chemotactic stimulus EGF and analyzed the distributions of ELMO2 and Dock4 by immunoblotting with anti-Dock4 and anti-ELMO2 antibodies. In the control cells, EGF stimulation enhanced the levels of ELMO2 and Dock4 in the membrane fractions. However, knockdown of EphA2, RhoG, or Ephexin4 suppressed the EGF-induced membrane recruitment of ELMO2 and Dock4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). The efficiency of cell fractionation was shown by immunoblotting with anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; cytosol protein) and anti-EphA2 (membrane protein) antibodies, and EGF stimulation had no effect on their distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Collectively, our results suggest that EphA2- and Ephexin4-mediated RhoG activation recruits the ELMO2âDock4 complex to the plasma membrane in response to EGF stimulation in MDA-MB-231 cells. There is Dock4 but not ELMO2 in the membrane fraction under RhoG knockdown conditions. It is possible that Dock4 is involved in other cellular functions independent of RhoG activation, for example the regulation of cellâcell adhesion and receptor endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yajnik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Upadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawada et al., 2009</xref>). Next, to examine whether Rac was indeed activated upon EGF stimulation and that knockdown of EphA2 prevented it, we measured Rac activity in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the control Luciferase or EphA2 shRNA in the absence and presence of EGF by pull-down assays with GST-fused CRIB domain of Pak. In the control cells, stimulation with EGF induced a rapid increase in the amount of active Rac1. However, knockdown of EphA2 significantly suppressed the Rac1 activation by EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Thus, EphA2 mediates Rac activation in response to EGF stimulation.</p>

Therefore, we examined whether Rac1 was activated after overexpression of Ephexin4 in HeLa cells, which express a high amount of endogenous RhoG. In HeLa cells, expression of Flag-Ephexin4 significantly increased Rac1 activity, which was suppressed by knockdown of RhoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). These results support a model in which Rac1 is activated downstream of Ephexin4 and RhoG.</p>
      <p>To determine whether EphA2 cooperates with Dock4 in migrating cells, we investigated the subcellular localization of EphA2 and Dock4 in MDA-MB-231 cells migrating toward EGF-containing medium through the Transwell filters. Cortactin is well known as a critical component of actin-rich protrusions in migrating and invading cancer cells and has a crucial role in promoting cell motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weaver, 2008</xref>). EphA2 was colocalized with cortactin at the tip of protrusion in migrating MDA-MB-231 cells through the pore of the Transwell filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining with anti-Dock4 antibody revealed that Dock4 was colocalized with EphA2 and cortactin at the tip of cell protrusion into the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, B and C</xref>). We could not obtain clear images of the localization of Ephexin4, probably because our Ephexin4 antibody was not suitable for immunofluorescence staining of endogenous Ephexin4 (unpublished data). Instead, RhoG was also colocalized with EphA2 and cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, D and E</xref>). Because knockdown of EphA2 suppresses the formation of protrusions and migration of the cells, we examined the effect of EphA2 knockdown on colocalization of Dock4 and RhoG with cortactin in MDA-MB-231 cells on glass coverslips. In the control cells expressing Luciferase shRNA, Dock4 and RhoG were colocalized with cortactin at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, F and G</xref>). In contrast, diffuse Dock4 and RhoG staining was observed in EphA2 knockdown cells, and they were not colocalized with cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, H and I</xref>). The specificity of Dock4 or RhoG staining with anti-Dock4 or anti-RhoG antibody was verified with Dock4 or RhoG knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005141/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Thus, these findings suggest that EphA2 cooperates with RhoG and Dock4 at the tips of cortactin-rich protrusions to promote cell migration.</p>

      <p>EphA2 is a member of Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases that is strongly expressed in highly invasive breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merlos-SuÃ¡rez and Batlle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). EphA2 acts as a downstream effector of EGF receptors to promote cancer cell motility and invasion, independently of the ligand ephrin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zelinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Macrae et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brantley-Sieders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we show that Ephexin4 is a novel binding partner for EphA2 that mediates ligand-independent promotion of cell migration and invasion in breast cancer cells overexpressing EphA2. EphA2 and Ephexin4 mediate the activation of RhoG in response to EGF stimulation, and activated RhoG binds to ELMO2 and recruits ELMO2 and its binding partner Dock4 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane to promote the formation of a complex with EphA2 and induce Dock4-mediated activation of Rac. We also found that EphA2 and Dock4 are colocalized with cortactin at the tips of protrusions in migrating breast cancer cells. Cortactin is overexpressed in cancer cells and promotes cancer cell motility and invasion by the formation of actin-rich protrusions associated with degradation of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothschild et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DesMarais et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, Rac plays a key role in the cancer cell movement and the formation of protrusions in invading cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurisu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vega and Ridley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamazaki et al., 2009</xref>), and the intracellular localization of cortactin is regulated by the activation of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weed et al., 1998</xref>). Collectively, these findings support a model in which recruitment of the ELMO2âDock4 complex to EphA2 receptor through Ephexin4-mediated RhoG activation triggers a local activation of Rac by Dock4, which can cause the formation of cortactin-rich protrusions, leading to the promotion of cell polarization and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). Our findings also suggest that EphA2 functions as a scaffold downstream of EGF receptor to promote the formation of a signaling complex that enhances the cell motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells.</p>

      <p>Ephexin1 interacts with EphA4 and regulates EphA4-mediated axon guidance and dendritic spine morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2007</xref>). Ephexin1 interacts with the kinase domain of EphA4 through the DH-PH motif of Ephexin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shamah et al., 2001</xref>). The interaction between Ephexin4 and EphA2 also requires the DH domain of Ephexin4 and the kinase domain of EphA2, suggesting that Ephexin1 and Ephexin4 interact with EphA receptors through a similar manner, although it is unknown whether there are binding specificities between Ephexin subfamily GEFs and EphA receptors. Our results also demonstrate that the interaction between Ephexin4 and EphA2 is enhanced by the deletion of the SAM domain of EphA2, suggesting that the SAM domain negatively regulates their interaction. In a recent study, several growth factors, including EGF, stimulate phosphorylation of EphA2 at a residue of serine 897 through Akt, and this phosphorylation is required for the EphA2-mediated ligand-independent promotion of cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2009</xref>). Because serine 897 of EphA2 is located in a linker region between the kinase and SAM domains, phosphorylation of EphA2 at serine 897 by EGF-induced Akt activation may trigger a conformational change within the cytoplasmic region of EphA2 to promote the interaction with Ephexin4 and the Ephexin4-dependent RhoG activation. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ephexin1 or Ephexin5/VsmâRho GEF by EphA4 enhances the GEF activity toward RhoA in response to ephrinA1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sahin et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, although Ephexin family members bind to EphA receptors through a similar region, they appear to differ in the regulation of the GEF activity. In contrast to the ligand-independent signaling by EphA2, stimulation of EphA2 with its ligand ephrinA1 in cancer cells induces EphA2 receptor internalization and degradation, which is also mediated through the activation of Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walker-Daniels et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2007</xref>). The Vav family of Rac-specific GEFs plays an important role in the regulation of ephrin-Eph endocytosis, and ephrinA1 stimulation causes tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 in the juxtamembrane domain and recruits Vav family GEFs to the phosphorylated EphA2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunter et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it is possible that EphA2 couples different GEFs in ligand-dependent and -independent signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Dock4 belongs to the Dock family of GEFs for Rho family small GTPases and positively regulates cell migration by specifically activating Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CÃ´tÃ© and Vuori, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Upadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawada et al., 2009</xref>). We show that Dock4 is expressed in breast cancer cells and is required for EGF-stimulated cell migration and invasion. Dock family members, including Dock4, localize mainly in the cytoplasm, and the translocation to the plasma membrane is critical for the activation of Rho family GTPases in cells and their cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">CÃ´tÃ© et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuramoto et al., 2009</xref>). We previously reported that RhoG regulates Dock4 through the interaction with ELMO2 and recruitment of the ELMO2âDock4 complex from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiramoto et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, knockdown of EphA2 or Ephexin4 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells suppresses the activation of RhoG and RhoG-dependent translocation of ELMO2 and Dock4 to the plasma membrane induced by EGF stimulation. Thus, EphA2 and Ephexin4 are key upstream regulators for the RhoGâELMO2âDock4 signaling pathway to control cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Dock3 and Dock4 belong to the same subfamily within the Dock family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CÃ´tÃ© and Vuori, 2002</xref>). Dock3 is expressed in melanoma cells and also positively regulates cell migration and invasion through activation of Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>). The Dock3-mediated regulation of cell movement in melanoma cells requires NEDD9, a member of the p130Cas, and a Rac downstream effector WAVE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting in future studies to investigate whether NEDD9 and WAVE family proteins are involved in the Dock4-mediated signaling in breast cancer cells.</p>
      <p>Our results show that activation of RhoG contributes to increased migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition to its role in cell migration, RhoG plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murga et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujimoto et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the EphA2-mediated RhoG activation may also contribute to other malignant cellular behaviors in cancer cells overexpressing EphA2.</p>

The cultured medium (for MCF7 cells) or the medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich; for MDA-MB-231 cells) was added to the lower chamber. At 4â6 (for MDA-MB-231 cells) or 6â24 h (for MCF7 cells) after plating, cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. Nonmigrated cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. In parallel, cells were separately plated to culture wells without the Transwell filters for estimating the total number of attached cells. Relative cell migration was determined by the number of the GFP- or YFP-positive migrated cells normalized to the total number of the GFP- or YFP-positive cells adhering to the plate. For each experiment, the number of cells in 20 random fields on the underside of the filter was counted, and three or four independent filters were analyzed.</p>

        <p>MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with YFP alone or together with the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24â72 h. The cells were detached with PBS containing EDTA and then resuspended in serum-free DME. The cells were then replated at a density of 3 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells onto the upper chamber of a Matrigel invasion filter (BD; 8-Âµm pore size). The medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF was added to the lower chamber. At 24 h after plating, cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. Nonmigrated cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. In parallel, cells were also separately plated to culture wells without the Matrigel filters for estimating the total number of attached cells. Relative cell invasion was determined by the number of the YFP-positive invaded cells normalized to the total number of the YFP-positive cells adhering to the plate. For each experiment, the number of cells in 20 random fields on the underside of the filter was counted, and three independent filters were analyzed.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
        <p>Cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed with PBS five times. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Then cells were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS or Can Get Signal Immunostain Immunoreaction Enhancer SolutionA (TOYOBO) for 24 h. After wash with PBS at once, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 in PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS for 30 min, and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). For F-actin staining in HeLa cells, cells were incubated with Alexa Flour 594âconjugated phalloidin in PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS for 30 min, and mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% <italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. Images were captured at RT using IM50 software (Leica) and a microscope (Eclipse E800; Nikon) with a 40Ã NA 0.75 objective (Nikon) and a digital camera (DC350F; Leica).</p>
        <p>For immunofluorescence staining of migrating cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were replated at a density of 3 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> cells onto the upper chamber of the Transwell filter. The medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml EGF was added to the lower chamber. At 2 h after plating, cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min and washed with PBS. The membrane of Transwell filter was cut off with a scalpel and kept floated in the following methods. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% FBS in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Then cells were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS or Can Get Signal Immunostain Immunoreaction Enhancer SolutionA for 24 h. After wash with PBS at once, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 in PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS for 30 min, and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent. To obtain a z-plane image, optical sections of images were captured through the cell in 0.50-Âµm steps at RT using a C1 laser-scanning confocal imaging system (EZ-C1 version 3.20 software; Nikon) and a microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U; Nikon) with a 60Ã NA 1.40 oil objective (Nikon) and a digital camera (DXM1200C; Nikon). All images were prepared with Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe).</p>

        <title>Separation of membrane and cytosol fractions</title>
        <p>MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 1 min and then suspended in ice-cold buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mM PMSF). After rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in a water bath, cells were centrifuged at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was removed and used as a cytosol fraction. After washing the pellet with buffer A, it was lysed with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was removed and used as a membrane fraction. Both cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>
