        <p>Protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is a ubiquitous co- and post-translational modification that has been implicated in the development and progression of a range of human diseases. Here, we report the global <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteome in human cells determined using quantitative chemical proteomics combined with potent and specific human <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferase (NMT) inhibition. Global quantification of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation during normal growth or apoptosis allowed the identification of &gt;100 <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins, &gt;95% of which are identified for the first time at endogenous levels. Furthermore, quantitative dose response for inhibition of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is determined for &gt;70 substrates simultaneously across the proteome. Small-molecule inhibition through a conserved substrate-binding pocket is also demonstrated by solving the crystal structures of inhibitor-bound NMT1 and NMT2. The presented data substantially expand the known repertoire of co- and post-translational <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation in addition to validating tools for the pharmacological inhibition of NMT in living cells.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is a co- and post-translational modification in eukaryotes catalysed by the enzyme <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferase (NMT), which transfers myristate from myristoyl coenzyme A (Myr-CoA) to the N-terminal glycine of a wide range of substrate proteins. Both human NMT isozymes, NMT1 and NMT2, are expressed in most tissues and have been implicated in the development and progression of diseases including cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, epilepsy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, Alzheimerâs disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, Noonan-like syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and viral and bacterial infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is necessarily preceded by proteolysis to reveal an N-terminal glycine, the only completely conserved motif across all known NMT substrates. This may occur either co-translationally when methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) acts on an N-terminal âMGâ motif at the ribosome, or post-translationally at an internal site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Well-characterized substrates include oncogene products, such as the tyrosine kinases pp60c-src and pp60c-yes, and BID, a key mediator of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The potential scope of NMT substrates is substantial; N-terminal âMGâ is present in ca. 7% of all gene products and is an excellent substrate for MetAP, while site-specific proteolysis is ubiquitous in cells, an example being caspase activity during apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>Despite its importance in health and disease, direct identification of the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteome in cells has been limited to non-native low-throughput systems (for example, overexpression of artificial protein constructs), and the vast majority of potential co- and post-translational NMT substrates have not been characterized in a native cellular context. We describe here a chemistry-based approach to profile selectively the co- and post-translationally <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteome in human cells during normal cell function and during apoptosis, which combines quantitative chemical proteomics with a potent and specific human NMT inhibitor. We present X-ray crystal structures of human NMT1 and NMT2 providing structural evidence for a highly conserved protein substrate-binding pocket, and demonstrate selective target engagement and pharmacological knockdown of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation by an NMT inhibitor in live cells. We also introduce a novel reagent that facilitates analysis of the N-terminally modified peptide across a wide range of substrates, including direct identification of sites of post-translational myristoylation. Global analysis of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation results in the identification of &gt;100 <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated human proteins, the majority of which are identified for the first time in a native cellular context. This global experimental strategy to define the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteome greatly expands the known repertoire of co- and post-translational <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation (PTMyr), and provides an approach to quantify inhibition of NMT across dozens of substrate proteins simultaneously in human cells.</p>

        <title>The targets of myristate analogue YnMyr in human cells</title>
        <p>Lipids tagged with an alkyne or azide moiety have emerged as powerful tools to study protein lipidation in cells by virtue of their capacity for metabolic incorporation and selective ligation to a range of reporter labels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. One such example is YnMyr (tetradec-13-ynoic acid), a tagged myristate analogue that has been shown to label a variety of proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and that was recently used to profile the myristoylated proteome in a protozoan parasite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. While these studies demonstrate the potential of YnMyr as a probe, it has yet to be applied to comprehensive identification of substrates and non-substrates in the complex proteome of human cells. To address this challenge, we sought to develop robust quantitative methods that can provide objective measures to identify NMT substrates across the proteome in living cells.</p>
        <p>Initial studies using a fluorogenic assay for NMT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> showed that YnMyr in its CoA-ester form (YnMyr-CoA, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> for synthetic details) is transferred <italic>in vitro</italic> by both NMT1 and NMT2 to the N-terminal glycine of a model substrate peptide with comparable efficiency to the natural lipid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Optimal metabolic incorporation of YnMyr into proteins in a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) was achieved after 24âh incubation at 20âÎ¼M YnMyr, as judged by in-gel fluorescence analysis following labelling of the alkyne through copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with azido-TAMRA-PEG-Biotin (AzTB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). There was no adverse effect on cell viability up to 3 days with 100âÎ¼M YnMyr, and incorporation was effectively outcompeted by myristate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Selective enrichment of labelled proteins including known NMT substrates (for example, PSMC1 (ref. 16)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, PRKACA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) could be achieved through pull-down on streptavidin beads, exploiting the biotin label on AzTB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Quantitative proteomic analysis (label-free quantification (LFQ), <italic>n</italic>=4, false-discovery rate (FDR)=0.001) revealed that out of &gt;250 proteins enriched more than fourfold with YnMyr (relative to a myristate control), 60% did not carry an N-terminal MG motif; some of these proteins are <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylated or carry a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which may account for enrichment of these proteins in a manner unrelated to <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation by NMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Proteins (108) carried an annotated N-terminal âMGâ motif, but these correlated only moderately with NMT substrates predicted by bioinformatic tools (the Myristoylator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, Myr Predictor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Given the significant limitations of this simple enrichment approach, we envisaged that knockdown of human NMT activity in cells in combination with quantitative chemical proteomics would provide a robust and novel method for proteome-wide experimental determination of the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteome in human cells.</p>

        <title>A selective inhibitor of human NMT activity in cells</title>
        <p>Co-translationally <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins are generated continuously through <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), and NMT is known to make direct interactions with the ribosome and several other proteins, in addition to its cognate substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. We considered that prompt and specific inhibition of the catalytic activity of both NMT isozymes would provide a precise and minimally disruptive tool to assist direct analysis through quantitative chemical proteomics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. While genetic approaches (RNA interference, gene knockout) can offer specificity, they present some drawbacks as tools to assist global quantitative chemical proteomic analysis of NMT substrates. These include loss of non-catalytic protein interactions of NMT, lethality of NMT knockouts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and slow and incomplete induction of knockdown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, leading to lack of control over degree and timeframe of inhibition, and limited applicability to myristoylation events occurring on short timescales (for example, post-translational myristoylation during apoptosis). These considerations prompted us to seek a reagent for selective pharmacological knockdown of NMT activity.</p>
        <p>An ideal reagent for this purpose would be a dual NMT inhibitor that acts selectively in mammalian cells, with minimal disruption to normal cell function over the period of YnMyr labelling. Compound <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> is a potent dual NMT1/NMT2 inhibitor (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>)=17 and 22ânM, respectively)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and inhibits myristoylation of an overexpressed protein construct in-cell-based microscopy assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; we previously validated <bold>1</bold> as a highly selective tool for knockdown of NMT activity in protozoan parasites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To validate this chemotype as a pharmacological tool in human cells, we determined the binding mode of <bold>1</bold> in a human NMT1/myristoyl-CoA complex through X-ray crystallography to 2.1âÃ resolution, and compared this structure with those of binary complexes of NMT1 and NMT2 solved to 1.7 and 2.3âÃ resolution, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, PDB 4C2Z, 4C2Y, 4C2X). These structures provide comparative atomic resolution insight into the human NMT enzymes, showing the very similar arrangement of residues in the human NMT1 and NMT2 active sites. <bold>1</bold> binds at the protein substrate-binding pocket in the presence of Myr-CoA, and interacts with minimal disturbance of side-chain geometry, suggesting that it binds tightly to a pocket pre-organized by binding of myristoyl-CoA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and confirming its conserved mode of action as a dual NMT1/2 inhibitor. <bold>1</bold> had no effect on HeLa cell viability, as measured by the metabolic activity assay (MTS), after 24âh incubation at concentrations up to 10âÎ¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This notable lack of acute toxicity suggests that <bold>1</bold> is a non-disruptive tool to assist analysis of NMT substrates in cells and is consistent with selective NMT inhibition, since the pre-existing pool of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins would be expected to maintain cell viability until depleted. In line with this hypothesis, a gradual and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability occurred over time in the presence of <bold>1</bold>. A plateau of metabolic activity was observed up to 10âÎ¼M <bold>1</bold>, and the level of this plateau diminished with extended duration of inhibition, with a consistent effector concentration for half-maximum response (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 210Â±15ânM. We hypothesize that this time-dependent response is characteristic of on-target, selective NMT inhibition in mammalian cells.</p>
        <p>Treatment of HeLa cells with YnMyr (20âÎ¼M) and <bold>1</bold> (0â5âÎ¼M) for 24âh resulted in a robust dose-dependent decrease in labelling intensity for the major TAMRA-labelled bands, with maximal inhibition occurring by 5âÎ¼M <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Direct quantification of fluorescence intensity revealed an apparent in-cell âtagging IC<sub>50</sub>â (hereafter referred to as TC<sub>50</sub>) of 170Â±31ânM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting good uptake of this inhibitor in mammalian cells. Furthermore, enrichment and western blotting (WB) of YnMyr-tagged proteins revealed potent dose-dependent inhibition of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation for several known NMT substrates, including c-Src tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The TC<sub>50</sub> value is closely similar to the EC<sub>50</sub> noted above, and the plateau effect observed in the viability assay corresponds to inhibitor concentrations above which NMT is fully inhibited, providing additional evidence for on-target mode of action in cells. NMT-catalysed myristoylation generally occurs co-translationally during normal cell function, and so we further confirmed that <bold>1</bold> did not significantly affect protein synthesis in cells, which could in principle lead to an observed reduction in levels of myristoylated proteins. Protein labelling by azidohomoalanine, an established probe for protein synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, was quantitatively blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, but was unaffected by 24âh treatment with <bold>1</bold> at a concentration &gt;30-fold higher than TC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Finally, quantitative whole-proteome analysis of a total of 1,069 proteins following 24âh treatment with <bold>1</bold> confirmed that &gt;96% show no significant (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) change in abundance, and &gt;99.9% remained within twofold of the untreated control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that <bold>1</bold> is a potent, protein substrate-competitive, dual NMT1/NMT2 inhibitor, and a highly selective pharmacological tool for inhibition of NMT activity in cells.</p>

        <title>Co-translational substrates and non-substrates of NMT</title>
        <p>So-called âspike-inâ SILAC (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) quantitative proteomics has recently emerged as a straightforward method to incorporate heavy isotope-labelled standards in a quantitative proteomics workflow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and we considered that a combination of spike-in SILAC with YnMyr tagging and chemical NMT inhibition would provide a powerful platform for comprehensive analysis of NMT substrates in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This approach normalizes all samples across all sample-handling steps (CuAAC ligation, pull-down, sample preparation and nanoliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS), and does not require heavy isotope labelling of experimental samples, thus eliminating any potential disruption to the system under study. Accordingly, protein lysate from HeLa cells labelled with <sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub><sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-arginine and <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub><sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-lysine (âR10K8â) and tagged with YnMyr was used as an internal spike-in SILAC standard for proteins labelled in HeLa cells cultured in normal media in the presence of YnMyr (20âÎ¼M) and an increasing concentration of compound <bold>1</bold> (0â5âÎ¼M). Pull-down and on-bead tryptic digestion enabled quantification of proteome-wide changes in <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation in response to inhibition, determined in fivefold replicate experiments for each of six concentrations of <bold>1</bold> on a nanoLC-MS/MS platform (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details of proteomic analyses).</p>
        <p>More than 400 proteins without an N-terminal MG motif identified in these experiments showed no response to inhibition, as expected for non-substrates of NMT. For 169 enriched proteins carrying an N-terminal MG motif, 17,401 unique protein-derived peptide sequences were identified and quantified with high (&gt;99.9%) confidence, resulting in 20,084 spike-in SILAC ratios for which the response to inhibition was analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). These proteins partitioned into distinct populations of responding and non-responding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Seventy proteins showed a robust response to inhibition and could thus be assigned with high confidence as substrates of NMT in cells, while a further 27 substrate proteins were assigned with lower confidence since analysis was based on a smaller set of unique peptides, due to the lower abundance of these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). Enrichment of substrate proteins exhibited a sigmoidal response to NMT inhibition (shown for three known NMT substrates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) enabling an in-cell IC<sub>50</sub> to be calculated per substrate, whereas that of non-substrates remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The enrichment of 56 proteins bearing an N-terminal MG did not respond to NMT inhibition up to the highest concentration tested, and these proteins were therefore classified as non-substrates. The mean in-cell IC<sub>50</sub> across NMT substrates was found to be 168Â±38ânM, closely comparable to the TC<sub>50</sub> value from in-gel fluorescence, with an excellent fit to a standard dose-response curve for the large majority of substrates (mean slope factor=1.21Â±0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The dose response for three examples of newly discovered substrates (HCCS, FLOT2 and MARC2) was probed by WB following pull-down, and all were found to follow the same trend determined by quantitative proteomic analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The inhibitor sensitivity of myristoylation of the large majority of substrates lies within 10-fold of the average in-cell IC<sub>50</sub>, with an overall range of sensitivity to inhibition of about 100-fold. We hypothesize that numerous factors may contribute to this interesting and subtle variation in substrate sensitivity observed in a cellular system, including subcellular localization, dynamic rate of synthesis in the cell, affinity for the enzyme-binding pocket, rate of leader Met removal by MetAP and complex interactions with the ribosome and potentially other proteins.</p>
        <p>To provide further cross-validation of NMT substrates identified through this novel quantitative approach, we undertook profiling of the N-terminally modified peptides identified during chemical proteomic analysis using multifunctional reagents for capture of YnMyr-tagged proteins. Here we applied our previously reported reagent AzKTB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and a novel reagent <xref ref-type="chem-struct" rid="coAzRTB">AzRTB</xref>, each of which incorporates a trypsin-cleavable site that enables release of the modified peptide with a hydrophilic Lys or Arg tag during protein digest for subsequent proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Applying these tools to the HeLa system above, we directly identified a total of 38 N-terminally YnMyr-modified peptides by MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The majority of peptides (27) were common to both reagents, with <xref ref-type="chem-struct" rid="coAzRTB">AzRTB</xref> providing identification of an additional 9 substrates over AzKTB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>); the improved performance of <xref ref-type="chem-struct" rid="coAzRTB">AzRTB</xref> may arise from enhanced on-bead proteolytic digestion, or superior chromatographic and mass spectral properties. Incomplete coverage of the tagged proteome through this approach is expected due to low detectability of certain modified peptides, for example, from sequence homology in the N-terminal tryptic peptide, the presence of multiple Lys or Arg residues proximal to the modification site, poor chromatographic or ionization profiles or abundance below the detection limit. Nevertheless, over 50% of substrates identified through quantitative proteomics (above) were directly validated by MS/MS sequencing of the N-terminally tagged peptide. Importantly, all 38 tagged sequences correspond to the N-terminal peptide of NMT substrates identified here, and there was no evidence for peptide modification within the non-substrate set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), providing self-consistent validation of the approach.</p>
        <p>Of the substrates of NMT identified here, &lt;25% have previously been reported in experiments with chemically tagged myristate analogues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We attribute this marked improvement to our new approach incorporating quantitative proteomics and selective inhibition, coupled to high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. Only five of the substrates identified here have previously been shown to be N-terminally myristoylated at an endogenous expression level in mammalian cells, for example, by immunoprecipitation (IP) of a substrate coupled to metabolic radiolabelling or mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Considering only the highest confidence assignments, 65 NMT substrates were identified here for the first time at endogenous abundance in live cells (that is, without overexpression of protein constructs), 39 for the first time in a cell-based context and 26 for the first time by any experimental approach. Very few bioinformatic predictions have been validated experimentally at native protein abundance in cells, and the two publicly available predictors disagree or conflict with prior evidence for <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation in several cases, particularly for lower confidence predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Classifying our NMT substrates into groups by prediction confidence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>), we found that the majority of substrate and non-substrate predictions were supported by experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). As expected, there was excellent (96%) accuracy for âhighâ confidence predicted substrates, and the accuracy of predictions fell in line with confidence, with 17% âmediumâ and 33% âlowâ confidence predictions showing no response to NMT inhibition. A handful of âhighâ confidence predictions were contradicted by evidence in cells (for example, GOLIM4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), and 10% of non-substrate predictions were found to be inaccurate (for example, MARC2, FLOT2). These data offer the first comprehensive assessment of the <italic>in vivo</italic> accuracy of <italic>in silico</italic> NMT substrate predictions, and provide strong support for the accuracy of the confidence heuristics built into the most commonly used prediction tools. Previously determined estimates for the total number of distinct protein sequences expressed at a detectable level in HeLa cells (10,255)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and the proportion of the human proteome predicted to be myristoylated (0.8%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> suggest that about 80 proteins may be myristoylated in HeLa cells. This prediction is in good agreement with the total of 70 (at high confidence) to 97 (including lower confidence) substrates found here.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data provide the first proteome-wide determination of the substrates of NMT in a living system, and greatly expand the range of NMT substrates validated <italic>in vivo</italic>. A survey of functions by gene ontology annotation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> revealed distribution across a wide range of pathways in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), and an expected strong bias towards organelle and membrane localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

        <title>Profiling PTMyr during apoptosis</title>
        <p><italic>N</italic>-myristoylation occurs mainly co-translationally during basal cell function; however, during apoptosis the protein BID (which mediates release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria) has been shown to be post-translationally cleaved and <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated at endogenous expression levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. There is also evidence for a small number of additional proteins under conditions of overexpression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The extent of PTMyr during apoptosis has not been systematically determined to date, and no reliable bioinformatic tool exists to predict PTMyr. Interestingly, NMT1 and NMT2 are also cleaved during apoptosis to generate new catalytically active species, which may also induce a change in substrate profile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. To determine the potential of our approach for profiling PTMyr during apoptosis, we first demonstrated apoptosis-dependent labelling of new <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins in cells treated with staurosporine (STS), a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor that is a potent inducer of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Co-translational myristoylation was strongly downregulated on treatment with STS as judged by gel-based imaging, consistent with rapid inhibition of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. Furthermore, a new band pattern was observed that was readily inhibited by <bold>1</bold> without affecting robust induction of cleavage of markers of apoptosis (PARP, BID and NMT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). SILAC-based quantification of YnMyr-tagged proteins further confirmed that labelling of most co-translationally <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated substrates is substantially reduced on STS treatment, while a subset of proteins that do not carry an N-terminal MG motif in the full-length protein are enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). Combining our methodology for quantitative determination of sensitivity to NMT inhibition with STS-dependent enrichment, we identified 35 high-confidence and 5 low-confidence PTMyr proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>), including BID, four other proteins with prior evidence supporting PTMyr (Gelsolin, MACF1, PAK2 and YTHDF2) and 35 novel substrates. Using the optimized multifunctional reagent <xref ref-type="chem-struct" rid="coAzRTB">AzRTB</xref>, a total of 12 YnMyr-tagged peptides were identified from whole-proteome analysis and sequenced by MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). All 12 modified peptides were found to contain an N-terminal YnMyr-glycine motif, and were derived from proteins in the high-confidence PTMyr data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), including numerous novel substrates. For each of these proteins, the site of cleavage and PTMyr was mapped to a specific glycine residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Interestingly, all 12 modified sites are preceded by aspartate, suggesting apoptosis-induced cleavage by caspases, and the majority of the resulting new N termini are predicted as NMT substrates with medium or high confidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). BID<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and novel substrate cytoplasmic dynein 1 intermediate chain 2 (Dync1i2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> were probed by WB following pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), confirming inhibitor-sensitive enrichment of an intact PTMyr substrate at native abundance. PTMyr was also confirmed in HeLa cells for another novel substrate, Culin 4B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, using a C-terminal FLAG-tagged construct (Cul4B[1-590]-FLAG) and an IP/on-resin ligation protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. YnMyr tagging was followed by IP with anti-FLAG, and CuAAC ligation to azido-TAMRA enabled inhibitor-sensitive fluorescence imaging of the cleaved product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
        <p>This first proteome-wide analysis of PTMyr in the context of apoptosis reveals a remarkable range of functions for novel PTMyr proteins, including ubiquitination, cytoskeleton remodelling and regulation of cell survival; more than half are localized to the nucleus or cytoskeleton prior to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have found that simple chemical proteomic analysis based on metabolic labelling with tagged lipids has limited specificity, and results in identification of a large number of non-myristoylated proteins that may be due to a combination of metabolism, the lipid substrate promiscuity of protein <italic>S</italic>-acylation and incorporation into GPI anchors. However, we have shown that augmenting this analysis with sensitive quantitation of the impact of a selective NMT inhibitor allows robust differentiation of substrate and non-substrate proteins. Our data emphasize the importance of experimental determination of co- and post-translational myristoylation, and suggest that bioinformatic predictors of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation may benefit from further refinement. The capacity to determine inhibition sensitivity of dozens of substrates simultaneously will be of particular interest in future drug discovery efforts aimed at targeting NMT for therapeutic benefit, for example, in cancer, and in assessing potential mechanism-based host toxicity of NMT inhibitors as drugs for infectious disease. The data obtained here suggest that the interplay between NMT inhibition and cell fate is likely to be complex, arising from potential loss of function in dozens of specific NMT substrate proteins, and changes in the function of many more PTMyr proteins on induction of apoptosis. However, our approach provides the first method to analyse and understand this complexity by enabling direct, multiplexed quantification of inhibitor response in live cells. Our studies reveal a range of sensitivity to NMT inhibition between substrates; as noted above, there are multiple possible explanations for this finding. It may be supposed that under normal circumstances NMT activity is not limiting, but on inhibition there may be increased competition between substrates for a substantially reduced pool of active NMT. However, we also note that the situation <italic>in vivo</italic> is complex and dynamic, and thus it is important to consider substrate sensitivity in living cells rather than in a simple enzymeâsubstrate complex formed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Previous studies suggest that NMT1 and NMT2 possess both distinct and overlapping biological roles. Comparison of the first crystal structure of NMT2 with that of NMT1 reveals a highly conserved active site, consistent with similar kinetic parameters in simple recombinant enzyme assays. We therefore hypothesize that any potential differences in substrate selectivity are driven by NMTâribosome interactions, subcellular localization and other factors that can only be recapitulated in native, intact human cells. Future studies to identify NMT1- and NMT2-specific substrates could exploit our approach in combination with isozyme-specific knockdown.</p>
      <p>Numerous important pathways involve proteins that are shown here for the first time to be co- or post-translationally <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated at their endogenous abundance in cells. A few notable co-translational examples in mitochondria include ligation of haem to cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (HCCS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, activation of hydroxylated prodrugs and regulation of nitric oxide synthesis (mARC1, mARC2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and NADH dehydrogenation (NDUFAF4, NDUFB7)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Among numerous novel targets involved in essential trafficking pathways, we discovered <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of LAMTOR1 (ref. 44)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, which anchors the scaffolding complex of the mTORC1 and MAPK pathways, and Battenin/CLN3 (ref. 45)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, mutations of which can result in Batten disease, a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder. Novel substrates also include proteins that mediate nuclear processes; for example, nucleolar protein 3 (NOL3/ARC), which acts to inhibit apoptosis, has attracted much recent attention for its role in promoting tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance in a variety of cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, and as a mediator of pulmonary hypertension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. PTMyr substrates are equally diverse in function. They include components of the ubiquitination machinery such as STAMBPL1, a metalloprotease that cleaves Lys-63 polyubiquitin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, E2 ligase UBE2O<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> and Cullin 4B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, a core member of E3 ligase complexes involved in cell cycle regulation and the response to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. MACF1 (ref. 50)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> facilitates actinâmicrotubule interactions, while Dync1i2 (ref. 38)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and CLASP2 (ref. 51)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> regulate microtubule dynamics during cell division. Among several regulators of cell survival, we identified death inducer-obliterator 1 (DIDO1), which is upregulated during apoptosis and implicated in melanoma progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, and Nestin, an intermediate filament protein and putative cancer stem cell marker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Taken together, these data indicate many potential novel roles for myristoylation that merit future investigation in both basal cell function and apoptosis, with significant implications for basic biology, and for drug development targeting NMT.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated here that a combination of sensitive, quantitative chemical proteomic analyses with a well-characterized, highly selective pharmacological tool can profile the substrates of co- and post-translational modification across the proteome, at native abundance in living cells. Furthermore, we have shown that this toolbox can be expanded using another chemical tool (STS) to profile post-translational modification events during apoptosis. Selective and cell-active chemical inhibitors and proteomic tools are available for an increasing range of enzymes and chemical modifications. Where these tools have been sufficiently well validated, we anticipate that our method will have wide future applicability for understanding modification profiles in living cells under native conditions.</p>

The lower-resolution maps are reflected in the poorer distribution of the modelled protein residues in a Ramachandran plot, with 92.9% in the preferred regions, a further 5.2% in the allowed region and seven residues calculated as outliers.</p>

        <p>CuAAC reaction was carried out with 2âmgâml<sup>â1</sup> of proteins (CoTMyr) and 0.6âmgâml<sup>â1</sup> (PTMyr). The spike-in standard was mixed with the lysates treated with increasing amount of inhibitor and YnMyr in a 1:2 (CoTMyr) or 1:3 (PTMyr) ratio of lysate to spike-in standard, before the CuAAC reaction. The same spike-in standard was used for all the samples belonging to a specific set (CoTMyr or PTMyr) to allow the comparison between samples within this set. Proteins were captured by adding a mixture of the capture reagent AzTB (final concentration 0.1âmM), CuSO<sub>4</sub> (final concentration 1âmM), TCEP (final concentration 1âmM) and TBTA (final concentration 0.1âmM). The samples were vortex-mixed for 1âh before the addition of EDTA (final concentration 10âmM), methanol (4 volumes), chloroform (1 volume) and water (3 volumes). The samples were vortex-mixed briefly and centrifuged at 10,000â<italic>g</italic> for 5âmin, and the resulting pellets were washed twice with methanol (4 volumes) and dried. After protein precipitation, the pellet was resuspended in 2% SDS in PBS, 10âmM EDTA (10âmgâml<sup>â1</sup> of proteins). Once the pellet was completely dissolved, PBS was added to dilute the sample (final concentration 1âmgâml<sup>â1</sup>, 0.2% SDS).

The replicates were grouped together. The YnMyr protein group was filtered to obtain at least three valid values across the four replicates and in addition at least two peptides (unique and razor) per valid value. Label-free intensities were logarithmized (base 2) and empty values were imputed with random numbers from a normal distribution, whose mean and s.d. were chosen to best simulate low abundance values close to noise level (impute criteria: width 0.1 and down shift 1.8). A modified <italic>t</italic>âtest with permutation-based FDR statistics was applied (250 permutations; FDR=0.001; S0=1).

        <title>MTS assay</title>
        <p>HeLa cells were seeded in a 96-well plate 24âh before treatment. Cell suspensions were prepared in the appropriate growth media using the following concentrations: 100,000 cellsâml<sup>â1</sup> for 24âh treatment, 50,000 cellsâml<sup>â1</sup> for 48âh treatment, 32,000 cellsâml<sup>â1</sup> for 72âh or 10,000 cellsâml<sup>â1</sup> for 1 week treatment. Fifty microlitre of cell suspension was transferred to wells BâG in columns 2â11 of a 96-well plate. Growth media (100âÎ¼l) was added to the outer wells. Twenty-four hours after seeding, 50âÎ¼l of growth media containing DMSO (positive control; maximum amount of DMSO used for the inhibitor dilutions, 0.04%) or puromycin (negative control; 4âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup>, 50âÎ¼l, final concentration in the plate 2âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup>) or different concentrations of inhibitor were prepared (same final percentage of DMSO; dilution factor=2; typically triple dilutions starting from 20âÎ¼M; final concentration in the plate starting from 10âÎ¼M) were added to the cells. Twenty-four, 48, 72 or 164âh later, MTS reagent (Promega) was added according to the supplierâs protocol. Absorbance was measured at 490ânm after 2âh. The average of absorbance values of the negative control was subtracted from every value. The metabolic activity was calculated as a percentage relative to the positive control. EC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by fitting the data to the IC<sub>50</sub> function using GraFit 7.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd).</p>

        <title>Overexpression and analysis of Cul4B[1-590]-FLAG</title>
        <p>HeLa cells (4 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) were reverse transfected with plasmid encoding for Cul4B (aa 1â590) utilizing TurboFect transfection reagent (17âh) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Next, the media was changed followed by treatment with STS (1âÎ¼M), NMT inhibitor <bold>1</bold> (1âÎ¼M) or vehicle (DMSO). After 1âh incubation, the cells were treated with YnC12 (20âÎ¼M, 6âh) and then lysed (PBS, 1% Triton, protein inhibitor). Total proteins (50âÎ¼g) was applied onto the washed Anti-FLAG affinity resin (40âÎ¼l of 50% slurry) and incubated on a rotation wheel at 4âÂ°C for 2âh. Following the IP step, the supernatant was removed and beads washed (3 Ã , lysis buffer). Next, click reaction with N<sub>3</sub>-TAMRA was performed on beads utilizing the standard conditions (as above) and excess fluorophore was removed by washing (as above). The beads were then boiled in 2% SDS/PBS (25âÎ¼l) at 95âÂ°C for 10âmin. The supernatant was removed and 15âÎ¼l was loaded on a gel. Pull-downed proteins were visualized by in-gel fluorescence followed by WB (Î±-FLAG). The supernatant from the IP step was utilized as loading control for WB. Proteins were precipitated (MeOH/CHCl<sub>3</sub>) and resuspended in 2% SDS/PBS (50âÎ¼l, 1âmgâml<sup>â1</sup>). Total proteins (10âÎ¼g) were loaded on a gel and analysed by Î±-actin WB.</p>
