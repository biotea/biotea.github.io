      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">53BP1 (TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains enigmatic since its relocalization involves recognition of H4 Lys20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mono-nucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitylated on Lys15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a C-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitylation-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone âcodeâ produced by DSB signaling.</p>

    <p id="P2">DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) elicit a cascade of protein recruitment on the chromatin surrounding DNA lesions that regulates DNA damage repair and signaling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. 53BP1 is an important effector of this DSB response, as it promotes repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> by opposing DNA end resection<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, the initiating step in homologous recombination (HR). In mice, 53BP1 is necessary for immunoglobulin class switching<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and dysfunctional telomere fusions<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, two processes that rely on NHEJ. Furthermore, 53BP1 deficiency in mice leads to a near complete reversal of the phenotypes associated with loss of BRCA1, including tumorigenesis<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. 53BP1 must accumulate on the chromatin surrounding DSBs to accomplish its functions<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, 53BP1 acts as a recruitment platform for RIF1, its effector protein during DSB repair by NHEJ<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. 53BP1 accumulation at DSB sites, as monitored by formation of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced subnuclear foci, requires the recognition of histone methylation, in particular H4K20me2<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, by its tandem Tudor domain<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, the formation of 53BP1 foci also requires the RNF168 E3 ligase<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> raising the question of how a ubiquitin ligase promotes the accumulation of a methylated-histone binding protein at sites of DNA damage. The current models of 53BP1 recruitment to DSB sites propose that H4K20 methylation is either induced or becomes available for 53BP1 binding after DNA damage<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. For example, it has been proposed that JMJD2A and L3MBTL1, which bind to H4K20me2, are removed in a ubiquitylation-dependent manner from the chromatin surrounding DSB sites, to allow 53BP1 binding<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In aggregate, these models imply that increased accessibility of H4K20me2 at DSB sites might be sufficient to trigger 53BP1 recruitment.</p>
    <sec id="S1">
      <title>Identification of the 53BP1 UDR</title>
      <p id="P3">We reasoned that if the above model was strictly correct, the 53BP1 ortholog from fission yeast, Crb2, should also form IR-induced foci in human cells. Indeed, Crb2 contains a tandem Tudor domain that binds to H4K20me2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Crb2 accumulates at DSB sites in an H4K20me2-binding dependent manner<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, but fission yeast does not have a recognizable RNF168 homolog, as it arose later during evolution. When expressed in human cells as a GFP fusion, Crb2 failed to form IR-induced foci whereas 53BP1 formed foci that colocalized with Î³-H2AX (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). As expected, the accumulation of 53BP1 at DSB sites was dependent on H4K20me2 recognition since the 53BP1 D1521R mutation, which disrupts this activity of the Tudor domain, impaired the ability of 53BP1 to form IR-induced foci (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The inability of Crb2 to accumulate at DSB sites in human cells was not due to a failure of Crb2 to interact with human H4K20me2 since it associated with human chromatin in a Tudor-dependent manner, as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2aâd</xref>) and cellular subfractionation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). These experiments suggested that 53BP1 recruitment to break sites might be largely independent of an increased accessibility of H4K20me2 in damaged chromatin.</p>
      <p id="P4">These observations provided an opportunity to map the region that endows 53BP1 with the ability to accumulate at DSB sites in an RNF168-dependent manner. We refer to this putative region as the ubiquitylation-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif. We thus prepared various chimeras between Crb2 and the minimal focus-forming region (FFR) of 53BP1, which consists of the Tudor domain flanked by an N-terminal oligomerization region and a C-terminal extension<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (i.e. 53BP1 residues 1220-1711; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We separated the 53BP1<sup>FFR</sup> and Crb2 into 3 regions that were swapped between the two proteins, in various combinations. The chimeras prepared are illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and, to facilitate the identification of the chimeras, segments were labeled â5â if derived from 53BP1 and âCâ if derived from Crb2. Since 53BP1 can oligomerize<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, all experiments were carried out in cells depleted of endogenous 53BP1.</p>
      <p id="P5">The domain swapping experiments first confirmed that the Crb2 Tudor can recognize H4K20me2 in human chromatin since the Crb2 Tudor domain inserted into the 53BP1<sup>FFR</sup>, supported localization to break sites (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1cd</xref>). Secondly, introduction of the sequence immediately C-terminal of the 53BP1 Tudor domain into Crb2 (CC5 chimera) produced a protein that accumulated into IR-induced foci that colocalized with Î³-H2AX (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1cd</xref>). Importantly, the accumulation of the CC5 chimera at DSB sites was dependent on RNF168 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3ab</xref>), strongly suggesting that sequences C-terminal of the 53BP1 Tudor compose the UDR. We further narrowed down the UDR to the region between residues 1604 and 1631 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3câe</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P6">Next, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the UDR, in the context of 53BP1<sup>1220-1631</sup>, to identify residues that participate in the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA damage sites. These studies identified 5 residues: I1617, L1619, N1621, L1622 and R1627, whose mutation to alanine disrupts 53BP1 recruitment to DSB sites, with the I1617A and L1619A mutations having the strongest impact (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The importance of L1619 and L1622 in 53BP1 recruitment to break sites was observed previously<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Introduction of these five mutations in the context of full-length 53BP1 also impaired IR-induced focus formation, confirming their importance for accumulation at DSB sites (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The 5 residues important for the activity of the UDR are clustered in a 12-amino acid residue segment that is highly conserved amongst 53BP1 orthologs in organisms that have a recognizable RNF8 pathway (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S2">
      <title>The UDR is required for 53BP1 function</title>
      <p id="P7">RIF1 is the 53BP1 effector during DSB repair<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. We therefore examined the contribution of the UDR in promoting RIF1 IR-induced focus formation. We tested 8 UDR mutations introduced in an siRNA-resistant 53BP1 vector: the 5 mutations that affect 53BP1 recruitment and 3 others (K1613A, D1616A and E1624A) that do not. We also included in these assays 53BP1 and 53BP1<sup>D1521R</sup>, our positive and negative controls, respectively. We observed that the mutations that impaired 53BP1 accumulation at DSB sites also abrogated RIF1 foci after IR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These results suggested that the UDR is critical for the function of 53BP1 in the DSB response. In further support of this observation, reconstitution of <italic>53bp1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> murine B cells with either the D1521R or L1619A mutants, failed to restore class switch recombination (CSR) from IgM to IgG1, whereas reintroduction of wild type 53BP1 restored CSR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Furthermore, the UDR-defective L1619A mutant was unable to restore either resistance to IR-induced DSBs in DT40 <italic>53bp1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells, or to restrict HR in BRCA1 and 53BP1 co-depleted cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the UDR is necessary for the biological functions of 53BP1.</p>

    <sec id="S3">
      <title>53BP1 binds to ubiquitylated nucleosomes</title>
      <p id="P8">Next, we sought to determine the mechanism by which the UDR promotes 53BP1 recruitment to DSB sites. We first considered that the UDR might increase the affinity of 53BP1 for H4K20me2 due to its location, i.e. apposed to the Tudor domain. We expressed GST-53BP1 fusion proteins consisting of the tandem Tudor domain with (Tudor-UDR) or without (Tudor) the UDR region and examined binding to a H4K20me2-derived peptide in pulldown assays. We observed that both proteins interacted equally well with H4K20me2 in a manner that required the D1521 residue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The L1619A mutation, which abolishes UDR activity, had no effect on H4K20me2 binding (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating that the UDR does not impact recognition of H4K20me2, at least in the context of a peptide.</p>
      <p id="P9">An alternative function of the UDR might be that it promotes the interaction of 53BP1 with chromatin. To test this possibility, we prepared polynucleosome-enriched extracts obtained from micrococcal nuclease digestion of human chromatin. Since RNF168 overexpression can trigger 53BP1 accumulation on chromatin<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, even in the absence of RNF8<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, we prepared a set of extracts from cells that either overexpress RNF168<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, or that were transfected with an empty vector. RNF168 was recently shown to catalyze a new histone mark, H2AK13/K15 mono-ubiquitylation (H2AK13/K15ub)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and thus we sought to test whether 53BP1 could potentially bind to nucleosomes containing RNF168-ubiquitylated H2A. Immunoblotting of H2A showed that the global levels of H2A ubiquitylation (uH2A) did not greatly change following RNF168 overexpression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) because H2AK119ub, which is catalyzed by E3s such as BMI1-RING1B<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> is much more abundant than H2AK13ub or K15ub. These extracts were then subjected to GST pulldown assays using either the 53BP1 Tudor domain or the extended Tudor-UDR module. In the absence of exogenous RNF168 expression, we observed a UDR-dependent interaction between 53BP1 and histone H2A, H3 and H4 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, in the presence of RNF168, we observed a striking increase in the retrieval of mono- and di-ubiquitylated H2A by the Tudor-UDR protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Together, these results suggested that the UDR may stimulate two modes of interaction between 53BP1 and nucleosomes: one mode that is independent of histone ubiquitylation, and which may reflect the constitutive interaction of 53BP1 with chromatin; and a second mode of interaction that is dependent on H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168, and which may represent the interaction that leads to 53BP1 accumulation at DSB sites.</p>

      <title>53BP1 recognizes H2AK15ub</title>
      <p id="P10">Since the above experiments were carried out with polynucleosomes, the interactions observed could be the product of avidity between the dimeric 53BP1 fusion protein and the multimeric nucleosomal arrays. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect binding between 53BP1 and fully recombinant monomeric nucleosome core particles (NCPs) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). We used an N-terminal fragment of RNF168 in ubiquitylation reactions with UbcH5, which recapitulated H2AK13/K15 ubiquitylation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8bâd</xref>). To generate H2AK119ub, we used a recombinant BMI1-RING1B complex as the E3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8bc</xref>). For histone methylation, we produced methyl-lysine analog versions of H4K20me2 (H4K<sub>C</sub>20me2) and H3K9me2 (H3K<sub>C</sub>9me2)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> prior to octamer and nucleosome assembly.</p>
      <p id="P11">We first assembled H4K<sub>C</sub>20me2-containing NCPs and subjected them to ubiquitylation reactions in the presence of RNF168 to produce H2AK13/K15ub (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). As control, we also carried out reactions without E1 and, as expected, no H2A ubiquitylation was detected (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The products of these two reactions were used in GST-pulldown assays with various fusion proteins derived from 53BP1. We observed a striking, ubiquitylation-dependent interaction between the 53BP1 Tudor-UDR fusion and NCPs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) that was not seen with the GST protein alone, the 53BP1 Tudor domain alone, the D1521R mutant or, finally, the L1619A mutant that disrupts UDR function. Together, these data indicate that the 53BP1 Tudor-UDR module promotes binding to methylated and ubiquitylated mono-nucleosomes in a manner that involves the same residues that are necessary for 53BP1 accumulation at DSB sites.</p>
      <p id="P12">Next, we examined whether the binding of 53BP1 to NCPs was specific to H4K20me2 and H2AK13/K15ub. We assembled a series of NCPs that contained H4K<sub>C</sub>20me2, H3K<sub>C</sub>9me2 or their unmodified lysine counterparts. These NCPs were then used in ubiquitylation reactions with RNF168 to produce H2AK13/K15ub-containing NCPs. When these NCPs were interrogated for binding to the 53BP1 Tudor-UDR module, we observed a specific interaction between 53BP1 and the NCPs containing H4K<sub>C</sub>20me2 (and H2AK13/K15ub) but not those containing H3K<sub>C</sub>9me2 or the unmodified H4K20 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). Next, we employed H4K<sub>C</sub>20me2-containing NCPs and used them as substrates in ubiquitylation reactions with RNF168 or BMI1-RING1B. Both reactions produced similar levels of mono-ubiquitylated H2A (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) but when they were used in GST pulldown assays with the 53BP1 Tudor-UDR module, we only observed an interaction with the RNF168-ubiquitylated NCPs. Importantly, we excluded the possibility that the binding was due to the presence of di-ubiquitylated H2A in the RNF168 sample (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). From these results, we conclude that the interaction between 53BP1 and nucleosomes requires the presence of both H4K20me2 and H2AK13/K15ub.</p>
      <p id="P13">While RNF168 can ubiquitylate H2A K13 or K15 in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, we tested whether 53BP1 displayed selectivity towards K13ub or K15ub. To do so, we assembled H4K<sub>C</sub>20me2-containing NCPs with either H2AK13R or H2AK15R substitutions to leave K15 or K13, respectively, as the only residue ubiquitylated by RNF168 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). To our surprise, when these ubiquitylated NCPs were used in pulldown assays, we found that the 53BP1 Tudor-UDR protein interacted specifically with NCPs containing H2AK15ub (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). This result indicates that 53BP1 has the striking ability to discriminate between two closely positioned ubiquitylated lysine residues on H2A.</p>

      <title>Molecular basis of H2AK15ub selectivity</title>
      <p id="P14">One possible cause for the 53BP1 selectivity towards H2K15ub could be the presence of sequence elements in the H2A N-terminal tail that are recognized by 53BP1. We noted that 3 mutations (K9R, A14S and R17S) were sufficient to convert the sequence surrounding K13 in the H2AK15R mutant into the sequence that normally surrounds H2AK15 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We found that the resulting mutant (H2AK15Rm3), when ubiquitylated, bound robustly to the 53BP1 Tudor-UDR module (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We conclude that additional residues in the H2A N-terminus contribute to the binding of 53BP1 to H2AK15ub-containing nucleosomes.</p>
      <p id="P15">We next investigated whether ubiquitin recognition contributed to the 53BP1-NCP interaction. Ubiquitin contains a hydrophobic patch centered on its I44 residue that contributes to most ubiquitin-dependent interactions<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and therefore we sought to test whether the ubiquitin I44 residue was important for 53BP1 recognition of H2AK15ub-NCPs. We used chemical ubiquitylation by disulfide exchange<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> to prepare NCPs that contain H2A chemically ubiquitylated on H2AK13 (H2AK<sub>C</sub>13ub), H2AK15 (H2AK<sub>C</sub>15ub) and H2AK15 ubiquitylated with Ub-I44A (H2AK<sub>C</sub>15ub-I44A; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Those NCPs were then used in pulldown assays with the Tudor-UDR module. As expected, we found that the interaction was selective for H2AK<sub>C</sub>15ub (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, H2AK<sub>C</sub>15ub-I44A containing NCPs were unable to be retrieved by 53BP1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that ubiquitin recognition participates in the interaction of 53BP1 with H2AK15ub.</p>
      <p id="P16">In aggregate, our results support a model where the Tudor-UDR module comprises two histone modification-binding domains: the Tudor domain that binds H4K20me2 and the UDR, which may interact directly with H2AK15ub. In support of this model, the transfer of the 53BP1 UDR onto the Crb2 Tudor domain endowed it with the ability to robustly bind to RNF168-ubiquitylated and H4K20me2-containing NCPs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10aâd</xref>). This observation prompted us to produce the isolated UDR, as a GST fusion protein, and to assess its binding properties. As expected, the isolated UDR did not bind to H4K20me2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10e</xref>). However, when H2AK13/K15ub-containing NCPs were incubated with increasing amounts of the isolated UDR, we observed a dose-dependent retrieval of NCPs in a manner that required the critical L1619 residue (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). This weak binding of the UDR to NCPs was specific to RNF168-dependent ubiquitylation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>) and, as expected, was independent of H4K20me2 given the absence of the Tudor domain (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). Interestingly, we failed to detect either an interaction between the UDR and free ubiquitin by nuclear magnetic resonance or an interaction between the UDR and a ubiquitylated H2A peptide in a pulldown experiment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11bc</xref>). These results indicate that the UDR recognizes H2AK15ub specifically in the context of the nucleosome.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P17">In response to DSBs, ATM signaling triggers a first wave of chromatin ubiquitylation that is dependent on RNF8<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The role of RNF8, and its E2 UBC13, is to trigger the recruitment of RNF168 to DSB sites where it catalyzes H2AK13/K15 mono-ubiquitylation. Together, our work identifies 53BP1 as a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes nucleosomes modified with H4K20me2 and the DNA damage-inducible H2AK15ub mark (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We propose that the engagement of H4K20me2 by the Tudor domain positions the UDR in the correct orientation to contact the epitope formed by H2AK15ub, a scenario supported by modeling (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). In the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data</xref> section, we also present evidence that 53BP1 recognizes nucleosomes minimally as a dimer (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 13â14</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that 53BP1 may alter nucleosomal array structure either by acting akin to a wheel-clamp if a dimer engages a mono-nucleosome (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), or by acting as a ubiquitylation-dependent nucleosome crosslinker if it can bridge adjacent nucleosomes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These plausible binding modes may be central to the function of 53BP1 as an inhibitor of end-resection.</p>
      <p id="P18">Our experiments also identify the first site-specific reader of histone ubiquitylation. 53BP1 is likely to be one of many readers that interpret the various histone ubiquitylation marks identified to date. Proteins such as ASH2L (for H2BK120ub)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, RNF168 and RNF169 (for H2AK13/K15ub)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> are prime candidates for ubiquitin mark readers. RNF169 presents an attractive case since it acts as a competitive inhibitor of 53BP1<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. These observations and the identification of 53BP1 as an H2AK15ub reader further emphasize the need to decipher the chromatin modification landscape, its regulation and its interpretation, at sites of DNA damage.</p>

        <title>Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)</title>
        <p id="P32">For FRAP experiments, cells were seeded onto 25 mm round coverslips, transferred to a Chamlide Chamber and imaged using a Quorum WaveFX Spinning Disc Confocal System (Quorum Technologies Inc., Guelph, Canada) equipped with a 63X oil objective and a temperature-controlled chamber (37 Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). All images were acquired using Volocity Software (Improvision). FRAP experiments were performed 24 h after cell transfection. Five images were acquired before photobleaching a region of interest using a Photonic Instruments Mosaic (450â515 nm Ar laser, 0.6 sec) to achieve at least 60â70% of measured fluorescence loss. Images were then acquired every 0.08 sec for 20 sec. Image processing was performed using Volocity and included photobleaching and background correction. Recovery time was obtained by fitting a single exponential equation. As the image set of each sample was acquired with nonuniform time intervals, a cubic spline interpolation technique was used to resample data on a common time base.</p>
