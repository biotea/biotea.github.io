      <abstract>
        <p>ESAT-6, an abundantly secreted protein of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) is an important virulence factor, inactivation of which leads to reduced virulence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. ESAT-6 alone, or in complex with its chaperone CFP-10 (ESAT-6:CFP-10), is known to modulate host immune responses; however, the detailed mechanisms are not well understood. The structure of ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex does not suggest presence of enzymatic or DNA-binding activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that the crucial role played by ESAT-6 in the virulence of mycobacteria could be due to its interaction with some host cellular factors. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified that ESAT-6 interacts with the host protein beta-2-microglobulin (Î²2M), which was further confirmed by other assays, like GST pull down, co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance. The C-terminal six amino acid residues (90â95) of ESAT-6 were found to be essential for this interaction. ESAT-6, in complex with CFP-10, also interacts with Î²2M. We found that ESAT-6/ESAT-6:CFP-10 can enter into the endoplasmic reticulum where it sequesters Î²2M to inhibit cell surface expression of MHC-I-Î²2M complexes, resulting in downregulation of class I-mediated antigen presentation. Interestingly, the ESAT-6:Î²2M complex could be detected in pleural biopsies of individuals suffering from pleural tuberculosis. Our data highlight a novel mechanism by which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may undermine the host adaptive immune responses to establish a successful infection. Identification of such novel interactions may help us in designing small molecule inhibitors as well as effective vaccine design against tuberculosis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>
<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is a dangerous and highly successful pathogen that has evolved several mechanisms to manipulate the host immune regulatory network. Proteins secreted by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> play important roles in virulence. One such protein is ESAT-6, which is secreted along with its chaperone CFP-10. Despite a host of studies highlighting modulation of immune responses by ESAT-6, there have not been many that identified host proteins interacting with ESAT-6. We have now found that the host protein Î²2M interacts very specifically with ESAT-6 at its C-terminal region. The soluble ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex was found to be trafficked into the endoplasmic reticulum, and treatment with recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 or the over-expression of ESAT-6 reduced cell surface expression of Î²2M and molecules which remain associated with it like HLA-I. Recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 was also found to reduce classical and cross presentation of peptide antigens by MHC-I molecules. In summary, our data indicate that interaction between ESAT-6 and Î²2M can reduce the levels of available free Î²2M that associate with HLA/MHC-I molecules. This could be an interesting mechanism by which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inhibits classical and cross presentation of peptide antigens in order to prevent or delay the onset of anti-mycobacterial adaptive immune responses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tuberculosis (TB) has remained a major cause of death worldwide despite the availability of a vaccine and several chemotherapeutic agents <xref rid="ppat.1004446-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Global emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> besides synergy with HIV <xref rid="ppat.1004446-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> warrants a better understanding of the host-<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> interaction in order to develop effective strategies for containing the disease. Successful infection of macrophages by pathogenic mycobacteria involves modulation of several immune functions, which allows them to survive and persist inside the host <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Koul1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Crucial host cell functions required for development of anti-mycobacterial immunity like phagosome-lysosome fusion, autophagy, antigen presentation, apoptosis and bactericidal innate immune responses are known to be inhibited by the pathogenic mycobacteria <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Koul1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Particularly, the proteins secreted by virulent mycobacteria are found to play important roles in modulation of host immune responses <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Ligon1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition to the classical Sec and Tat secretion pathway, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> possesses the ESX secretion system, a Type VII secretion system (T7SS) which is found to be non-essential for growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, but is required for bacterial virulence <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Mycobacteria possess at least five ESX secretion systems, namely ESX-1 through ESX-5 <xref rid="ppat.1004446-GeyVanPittius1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The first and the most characterized member of the ESX secretion system family, ESX-1 is encoded by region of difference (RD) 1 which is absent in all vaccine strains of avirulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG, but present in the virulent laboratory and clinical strains of <italic>M. bovis</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004446-GeyVanPittius1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The RD1 region is also absent in <italic>M. microti</italic> which seldom causes disease in immunocompetent individuals <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Interestingly, deletion of RD1 results in attenuation of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and it is hence implicated to play an important role in mycobacterial pathogenicity <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. RD1 complemented avirulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and <italic>M. microti</italic> strains were shown to grow better in severe combined immunodeficient mice and persist longer in organs of immunocompetent mice corroborating the fact that deletion of RD1 resulted in attenuation of these strains <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Pym1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Mutants defective for ESX-1 secretion system are found to exhibit a range of diverse phenotypes, including defects in immune modulation, tissue invasion, phagosomal trafficking and growth inside the macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the early secretory antigenic target (ESAT)-6 or Rv3875 and the culture filtrate protein (CFP)-10 or Rv3874 are abundantly produced and secreted in culture. They are also known to be the most immunogenic molecules found in the culture filtrate <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Andersen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Dillon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These proteins lack the classical Sec YEG secretory signal sequences and their secretion was found to be dependent on ESX-1 <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Pym1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 together form a tight dimer and are dependent on each other for their stability and secretion <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Renshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Along with the ESX-1 secretion system, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 have been implicated in several virulence mechanisms of mycobacteria. They are capable of modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses and inactivation of ESAT-6 results in dramatically reduced virulence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004446-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Pym1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, specific mutations in ESAT-6 that did not affect functioning of the ESX-1 secretion system caused a loss of virulence of mycobacteria <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Houben1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This implies that ESAT-6 itself is crucial in mediating the virulence functions associated with the ESX-1 secretion system. ESAT-6 was found to induce apoptosis of macrophages by activating caspase expression <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Derrick1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. ESAT-6, CFP-10 and the ESAT6:CFP-10 complex can inhibit LPS-induced NF-kappaB dependent gene expression by suppressing production of reactive oxygen species <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Ganguly1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. ESAT-6 alone or in complex with CFP-10 has also been shown to interact with host proteins like laminin on the basolateral surface of pneumocytes leading to lysis of these cells that aid in the dissemination of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the human lung <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Kinhikar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, ESAT-6 has been shown to interact directly with toll like receptor (TLR) 2 resulting in reduced interleukin (IL)-12 p40 secretion in macrophages, probably favouring a T helper 2 phenotype that helps intracellular persistence and survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004446-Pathak1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the exact mechanism of virulence of ESAT-6 is not well understood.</p>
      <p>It has been shown that at lower pH, characteristic of the acidic phagosomal environment, the secreted ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex can dissociate and once dissociated, ESAT-6 alone can destabilize and lyse the phagosomal membrane <xref rid="ppat.1004446-deJonge1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, it appears that the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex provides the bacteria or its components the tools necessary to escape from the phagosomal compartments to interact with the host cellular proteins and modulate their functions <xref rid="ppat.1004446-deJonge1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Based on the solution structure, no DNA binding or enzymatic function could be ascribed to the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Renshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> as the surface of the complex was found to be devoid of any acidic or basic patches characteristic of DNA-binding proteins and many transcription factors. Similarly, absence of significant clefts on the surface of the structure, indicative of an enzyme active site, suggests a non-catalytic role for this complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that the crucial role played by ESAT-6 in the virulence of mycobacteria could be due to its interaction with some host cellular factors, the identification of which is likely to provide better understanding of the role played by ESAT-6 in modulation of host immune responses. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to identify ESAT-6 interacting partners of host origin by employing a yeast two hybrid assay system. Here, we report that ESAT-6 can specifically interact with beta-2-microglobulin (Î²2M), a small â¼13 kDa protein found to be associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family of proteins that are involved in antigen presentation and iron regulation. We found that ESAT-6 was able to enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it interacts with Î²2M and inhibits its association with MHC-I molecules leading to reduced surface expression of MHC-I-Î²2M complex and consequently inhibits loading of antigen-derived peptides to the MHC-I complex. Data presented in this study highlight the existence of a novel mechanism by which <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ESAT-6 protein exerts its virulence by undermining the host adaptive immune responses to establish a successful infection and these findings may aid in the development of novel therapeutics against the deadly disease.</p>

        <title>ESAT-6 interacts with human Î²2M</title>
        <p>We carried out yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening to identify the probable ESAT-6 interacting proteins from the host. ESAT-6 cloned in the bait vector pGBKT7 was used to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library cloned into the prey vector pACT2. The suitability of ESAT-6 for use as bait was confirmed by measuring its expression as GAL4-ESAT-6 fusion protein and also by assessing the toxicity of the fusion protein as well as auto-activation of interaction markers. Yeast strain AH109 expressing the Gal4-ESAT-6 fusion protein had normal growth kinetics and auto-activation of the reporter genes was not observed in these transformants. For Y2H screening, Mat-a strain AH109 harboring the bait vector pGBKT7-ESAT-6 was mated with Mat-Î± strain Y187 transformed with prey library plasmid and the mating mixture was plated on QDO plates (SD/âAde/âHis/âLeu/âTrp) for high stringency of selection. The prey plasmids, rescued from the colonies that appeared on selection plates, were sequenced using 3â² AD Sequencing Primer and were identified by querying these sequences against the NCBI GenBank database using the MegaBlast program. One of these cDNA sequences in the prey plasmid was found to have very high similarity with human beta-2-microglobulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The interaction was found to be truly positive as the prey plasmid carrying the Î²2M cDNA sequence (pACT2-Î²2M) failed to grow in the presence of empty bait vector pGBKT7 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

            <title>ESAT-6 protein interacts with Î²2M.</title>
            <p>(A) Interaction between ESAT-6 and Î²2M in a yeast two-hybrid system was studied by mating yeast strain AH1109 transformed with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ESAT-6 with yeast strain Y187 transformed with a human leukocyte cDNA prey library on a synthetic dropout plate (âAde/âHis/âLeu/âTrp). Prey cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers encompassing the cDNA insert in pACT2 and sequenced and identified to be Î²2M. The AH109 yeast strain transformed with pGBKT7-ESAT-6 and pACT2-Î²2M shows Ade and His interaction reporter activation on QDO plates. AH109 transformed with pGBKT7 and pACT2-Î²2M was used as a negative control while AH109 transformed with pGBKT7-p53 and pGADT7-T was used as a positive control for the yeast two-hybrid screening. (B) Untagged Î²2M was cloned along with His-tagged ESAT-6 in the pETDuet vector system and was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells. The transformed cultures were induced with IPTG and the over-expressed proteins were purified using TALON resin. Purified proteins were separated on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Lane 1 is a molecular weight marker. (C) Î²2M with no N-terminal signal sequence (ESAT-6:Î²2M NSS) and the full length Î²2M with the N-terminal signal sequence (ESAT-6:Î²2M WSS) were cloned in pETDuet vector along with 6Ã His-tagged ESAT-6. Clones were over-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21. Protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG and over-expressed proteins were purified using metal affinity TALON resin. Purified proteins were separated on 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-Î²2M Ab to detect Î²2M and anti-His Ab to detect ESAT-6. The bands corresponding to Î²2M (upper panel) and ESAT-6 (lower panel) were visualized by chemiluminescence. (D) GST pre-cleared THP-1 macrophage extract was mixed and incubated with Glutathione-agarose bead bound-GST or GST-ESAT-6 and washed. The bound proteins were eluted and resolved on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted for Î²2M protein using rabbit anti-human Î²2M Ab and HRP conjugated anti-rabbit Ab. Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. Whole cell extracts from THP-1 cells was used as positive control for Î²2M expression. (E) In another experiment, purified recombinant 6Ã His-tagged ESAT-6 was incubated with THP-1 macrophage lysate and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-His Ab bound to protein A/G agarose beads. Control immunoprecipitation was carried out without the addition of His-tagged ESAT-6 protein (IP control). The eluted protein mixture is resolved on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted (IB) for Î²2M protein using a rabbit anti-human Î²2M Ab and HRP conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab and the blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. Lane 1 is input control. (F) Direct interaction of Î²2M with ESAT-6 was monitored using a BIACORE 3000 Biosensor where Î²2M was immobilized on the sensor chip and recombinant ESAT-6 at different concentrations was injected in the running buffer. The changes in the refraction index at the surface due to interactions between immobilised Î²2M and fluid phase ESAT-6 were detected and recorded as RU (Resonance Units). Curves generated from the RU trace were evaluated using a curve-fitting algorithm. ESAT-6 was found to bind specifically to Î²2M and no binding was observed in a control cell which did not have any immobilized Î²2M. Results are representative of three different experiments.</p>

        <p>The physical interaction between ESAT-6 and Î²2M was confirmed by a co-purification assay. ESAT-6 was cloned into the first multiple cloning site (MCS) with an N-terminal His-tag and Î²2M cDNA from the prey plasmid was cloned into the second MCS without any tag in a dual expression vector pETDuet-1. When the over-expressed His-tagged ESAT-6 protein was purified from the transformed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using TALON affinity binding resin, Î²2M was found to be co-purified along with His-tagged ESAT-6, indicating a positive interaction between ESAT-6 and Î²2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, Lane 5). Î²2M is known to possess a 20 amino acid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization sequence at its N-terminal which is removed from the mature protein during post-translational modifications. Since the prey plasmid cDNA encoding Î²2M contained the signal peptide sequence, any interaction with ESAT-6 through this region would be most likely physiologically irrelevant. Therefore, we examined whether ESAT-6 could actually interact with the mature Î²2M devoid of the signal peptide. The N-terminal signal sequence (20 amino acids) of Î²2M was therefore truncated and co-expressed along with His-tagged ESAT-6. It was found that the mature Î²2M could be co-purified along with His-tagged ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) indicating that the N-terminal signal peptide of Î²2M is not involved in the interaction with ESAT-6 protein.</p>
        <p>We also examined whether ESAT-6 could interact with the Î²2M naturally present within mammalian cells. For this, GST-tagged ESAT-6 was used to pull down Î²2M from the whole cell extract prepared from PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. It was found that the GST-ESAT-6 fusion protein was able to pull down Î²2M while GST alone failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) indicating that ESAT-6 can physically interact with mature Î²2M naturally expressed in macrophages. To further confirm this observation, a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was carried out where recombinant His-tagged ESAT-6 protein was incubated with THP-1 whole cell lysate and then anti-His antibody (Ab) coupled to protein A/G beads was added to the mixture to immunoprecipitate the interacting complex. The immunoprecipitated complex was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-human Î²2M Ab. A Î²2M specific band was detectable in the His-tagged ESAT-6-immunoprecipitated complex indicating that ESAT-6 interacts with Î²2M present in the THP-1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Physical interaction of ESAT-6 and Î²2M was further confirmed by using surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). The Kd value of the ESAT-6:Î²2M complex as determined from the surface plasmon resonance data was 1.03Ã10<sup>â6</sup> M.</p>

        <title>Î²2M interacts with the C-terminal extreme of ESAT-6</title>
        <p>The extreme C-terminus of ESAT-6 is a floppy, structurally ill defined region, away from the helical core and is not known to be involved in the interaction with CFP-10 <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Renshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Mutant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> expressing a truncated ESAT-6 having residues deleted from the C-terminal end was found to be attenuated.

Therefore, we speculated that the free C-terminus of ESAT-6 is probably involved in the interaction with Î²2M and such an interaction is possibly critical for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> virulence <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Once again using the yeast two hybrid assay, we observed that deletion of the last 6 amino acids (valine, threonine, glycine, methionine, phenylalanine and alanine) from the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s002">Figure S2</xref>) was sufficient to prevent the interaction of ESAT-6 and Î²2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To further validate the yeast two hybrid data, we used a C-terminally truncated ESAT-6 (ESAT-6ÎC) to carry out GST pull down assay. The GST-tagged full length ESAT-6 protein (ESAT-6-GST) as well as the GST-tagged ESAT-6ÎC (ESAT-6ÎC-GST) protein were incubated with THP-1 extract and the pulled down fractions were probed for the presence of Î²2M using anti-Î²2M Ab. It was found that only the full length ESAT-6 protein was able to interact with Î²2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To further confirm our observations, we carried out a Co-IP assay where THP-1 lysates were incubated with full length His-tagged ESAT-6 or His-tagged ESAT-6ÎC and Î²2M-complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-Î²2M Ab. The immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and probed with either anti-His Ab to detect ESAT-6/ESAT-6ÎC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, upper panel) or anti-Î²2M Ab to detect Î²2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref> clearly demonstrate that anti-Î²2M antibody can immunoprecipitate the full length ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, Lane 3), but not the mutant ESAT-6ÎC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, Lane 4), indicating that the C-terminal (90â95) residues of ESAT-6 are important for its interaction with Î²2M.

        <p>ESAT-6 is predominantly secreted by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as a tight 1â¶1 heterodimeric complex with CFP-10 through the ESX-1 secretion system <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Renshaw2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Earlier we found that the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 (amino acid residues 90â95) is involved in interaction with Î²2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2, AâC</xref>). Since the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 in the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex is essentially exposed <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Renshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s003">Figure S3</xref>), it is possible that ESAT-6 while in complex with CFP-10 can still interact with Î²2M. Therefore, the ability of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex to interact with Î²2M was examined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Affinity purified His-tagged ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 or CFP-10 alone was incubated with THP-1 macrophage lysate. Mouse anti-human Î²2M Ab was then added to these mixtures and detection of Î²2M-bound His-tagged ESAT-6 protein was carried out using rabbit anti-His Ab. We were able to detect a band corresponding to the size of His-tagged ESAT-6 in the reaction mixture containing ESAT-6:CFP-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, Lane 6), however, ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 or CFP-10 does not interact with Î²2M present in the THP-1 extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, Lanes 7 and 8). Similarly, ESAT-6:CFP-10 was also found to interact with mouse Î²2M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These results suggest that ESAT-6 alone or in complex with CFP-10 is capable of interacting with Î²2M and the C-terminal six amino acid residues (90â95) of ESAT-6 are crucial for this interaction.</p>
        <p>So far we observed that the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 was involved in interaction with Î²2M. Since Î²2M is an integral part of the functional MHC class I molecules, we next examined whether ESAT-6 can interact with HLA-bound Î²2M also. Therefore, PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophage lysate was mixed and incubated with either recombinant ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 and the interacting complexes were pulled down using mouse anti-human HLA class I and probed with anti-His as well as anti-Î²2M antibodies. It was found that Î²2M but not ESAT-6 could be immunoprecipitated along with HLA-I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These results indicate that ESAT-6 binds only to the free Î²2M, but not to that already in complex with HLA-I heavy chain.</p>

        <p>By changing the protonation state of the charged residues, the pH can significantly influence the nature of protein-protein interactions. pH can considerably dictate the strength and geometry of electrostatic interactions, conformation of the interacting proteins, as well as protein hydration which are critical in stabilization of protein-protein interactions. Therefore, the effect of pH was examined on the stability of ESAT-6:Î²2M complex. The stability of the ESAT-6:Î²2M complex at various pH was confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking of ESAT-6 and Î²2M. Covalent cross-linking of two proteins is usually considered to be a convincing evidence of their physical proximity and interaction. Glutaraldehyde was found to covalently cross-link ESAT-6 and Î²2M at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 8.0.

        <title>ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 is trafficked into the ER</title>
        <p>The functional implications of protein-protein interactions depend on the spatial and temporal localization of the interacting partners within the cell. Therefore, in order to have a pathophysiological role in the host-pathogen interaction, ESAT-6 and/or ESAT-6:CFP-10 must find its way to the cellular compartments where Î²2M is present. Î²2M is known to be present in high concentration within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is synthesized and undergoes necessary post-translational modifications and associates with the alpha chain of the MHC-I, as well as other class I like molecules like CD1 and hemochromatosis protein (HFE) that are transported to the cell surface via the golgi apparatus <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Schaible1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Shinkai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, ESAT-6 and/or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex secreted by the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacilli in the phagosome or cytoplasm can make its way out by lysing the cell membranes <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> which can be taken up by the surrounding macrophages and dendritic cells. Another possible source of soluble ESAT-6 and/or ESAT-6:CFP-10 is mycobacteria surviving in the extracellular milieu of caseating granulomas where the proteins secreted by the extracellular bacilli are available for uptake by antigen presenting cells present in these granulomas <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Ramakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, studies have indicated that soluble proteins can gain direct access to the ER lumen of dendritic cells <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Ackerman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, soluble ESAT-6 and/or ESAT-6:CFP-10 taken up by macrophages and dendritic cells may be retrotranslocated directly to the ER of these cells which would enable it to interact with Î²2M and modulate Î²2M-dependent responses. To test this, THP-1 macrophages were incubated for 2 hours with FITC-labelled ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 and their localization was tracked along with the ER-specific marker calnexin by confocal microscopy. The ESAT-6:CFP-10 was found to be present in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, FITC-labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex was also found to be present within the ER-tracker dye-positive regions in THP-1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) as well as in mouse peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, FITC-labelled ESAT-6 alone was found to be present in the ER-tracker dye-positive regions of KG-1 dendritic like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

These observations suggest that soluble ESAT-6 and ESAT-6:CFP-10 can translocate into the ER lumen from the extracellular milieu to interact with the resident Î²2M in KG-1 cells and macrophages. From the confocal microscopy data, it appears that ESAT-6:CFP-10 is able to enter the vesicles of the phagocytic pathway as well as other cellular compartments since all the FITC signal emanating from labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 did not superimpose with the signal emanating from ER-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, as is evident from the data, sufficient quantities of ESAT-6/ESAT-6:CFP-10 are able to translocate to the ER where the complex is available for possible interaction with Î²2M.</p>

        <title>ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 inhibits surface expression of Î²2M</title>
        <p>In the ER lumen, Î²2M associates with MHC class I molecules to form class I complexes which are then loaded with peptide and transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. It is possible that once translocated to the ER, ESAT-6:CFP-10 can interact and sequester Î²2M and thereby reduce the availability of free Î²2M to form complex with HLA class I molecules. In such situations, the surface levels of both MHC and Î²2M molecules are likely to be decreased. Expectedly, when THP-1 macrophages were incubated with recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 protein at two different concentrations <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Ganguly1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, surface Î²2M levels were found to be decreased in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Interestingly, no significant changes in the surface expression of Î²2M were noticed in the presence of mutant ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 complex or CFP-10 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that suppression of Î²2M surface expression was possibly due to its sequestration by the intact C-terminal region of ESAT-6. To rule out the possibility that the reduction in surface Î²2M levels was due to toxicity of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex, an MTT viability assay was performed with THP-1 macrophages treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10. We found that the viability of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 treated cells was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Another possibility is that incubation with ESAT-6:CFP-10 may have caused general trafficking defects to reduce the surface expression of Î²2M. To rule out this, we examined the surface expression of other cell surface markers like Mac-1, TLR4, MHC-II and CD14 using flow cytometry. Levels of all these molecules were found to remain unchanged in ESAT-6:CFP-10 treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s008">Figure S8</xref>). ESAT-6:CFP-10 also did not affect Î²2M expression at the protein and mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004446.s009">Figure S9</xref>). These data indicate that the reduction of surface Î²2M levels was possibly due to physical sequestration of Î²2M by ESAT-6 inside the ER. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may escape from the phagosome to the host cytoplasm of infected cells in an RD1 dependent manner and secrete ESAT-6:CFP-10 directly into the cytoplasm of infected cells <xref rid="ppat.1004446-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> which may find its way into the ER lumen to interact with the resident Î²2M. To test this hypothesis, we over-expressed FLAG- or GFP-tagged ESAT-6 in cells in an attempt to mimic physiological conditions where ESAT-6 is secreted directly into the cytosol. We transfected HEK-293 cells with pcDNA 3.1(+)-FLAG-<italic>esat-6</italic> and studied localization of ESAT-6 (stained with anti-FLAG Ab) in ER by confocal microscopy and was found to be present in the calnexin-positive ER compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) suggesting that intracellular ESAT-6 can also find its way into the ER. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in cells over-expressing full length ESAT-6 or ESAT-6ÎC cloned with an N-terminal EGFP tag in pEGFP-C1. ESAT-6 and Î²2M complexes could be pulled down from the whole cell lysates of HEK-293 cells over-expressing pEGFP-C1-<italic>esat-6</italic> but not from cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 vector alone or pEGFP-C1-<italic>esat-6ÎC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Also, we were able to pull down the ESAT-6:Î²2M complex from the enriched ER fraction of HEK-293 cells transfected with pEGFP-C1-<italic>esat-6</italic> but not from cells transfected with the vector alone, indicating that ESAT-6:Î²2M complex was present inside the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggest that intracellular ESAT-6 is not only able to enter the ER but also can interact with the ER-resident Î²2M. We next examined, whether such interaction of ESAT-6 with Î²2M in ER has any effect on the surface Î²2M levels. Therefore, THP-1 cells were nucleofected and HEK-293 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C1-<italic>esat-6</italic> or pEGFP-C1-<italic>esat-6ÎC</italic>. Nucleofection efficiency for THP-1 was found to be â¼30% and transfection efficiency for HEK-293 was found to be â¼50%. Surface Î²2M expression on GFP positive cells was measured by flow cytometry using PE conjugated anti-human Î²2M Ab. It was observed that the intracellular expression of ESAT-6 resulted in reduction of surface Î²2M levels in THP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) and HEK-293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) cells when compared to the cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-<italic>esat-6ÎC</italic>.</p>

        <title>ESAT-6:CFP-10 treatment affects expression of HLA class I molecules</title>
        <p>Beta-2-microglobulin remains associated with HLA class I, CD1 and HFE molecules on the cell surface. Any change in the levels of Î²2M would probably lead to changes in the cell surface expression of HLA class I, CD1 and HFE. As ESAT-6:CFP-10 treatment leads to reduction in surface expression of Î²2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5</xref>), we next examined whether it has any effect on HLA class I expression. For this purpose, we utilized two different types of anti-HLA antibodies: HC-10 and W6/32. HC-10 is a monoclonal Ab that can detect only the free HLA-I heavy chain molecules not complexed with Î²2M <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Stam1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Newly synthesized HLA molecules form a tri-molecular complex with Î²2M and antigenic peptide which is transported to the surface to present the peptide to its cognate T cell receptor (TCR) <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Pamer1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In contrast, it has been reported that heavy chains of MHC class I alleles can also progress to the cell surface alone without being associated with Î²2M. Such free MHC class I heavy chains are present normally on cells, especially in activated lymphocytes <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Schnabl1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, dendritic cells and macrophages and have been found to be upregulated in patients suffering from spondyloarthropathy <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Raine1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, we observed an increased binding of HC-10 Ab in THP-1 macrophages treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10 but not with ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g006">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>). Increased HC-10 staining upon addition of ESAT-6:CFP-10 was observed also by confocal microscopy where intracellular levels of the free HLA molecules can also be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These data clearly suggest that the levels of Î²2M-free HLA class I molecules were increased on the surface as well as intracellularly after treatment with ESAT-6:CFP-10. Free HLA class I molecules are not only transported to the cell surface but a portion may also undergo proteasomal degradation since addition of MG-132 (a proteasomal inhibitor) to THP-1 macrophages resulted in increased HC-10 staining which was further intensified in the presence of ESAT-6:CFP-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g006">Figures 6D and 6E</xref>). Therefore, it appears that once ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex sequesters Î²2M inside the ER, the number free HLA class I heavy chain molecules are increased due to less availability of free Î²2M molecules to associate with them. This would possibly explain the increase in HC-10 staining observed in the presence of ESAT-6:CFP-10.</p>

        <p>Most cytoplasmic antigens are processed by the proteasomal machinery and the derived restricted peptides are presented by the MHC-I molecules to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We have observed earlier that surface expression of Î²2M and MHC-I molecules is reduced in macrophages treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g007">7A and 7B</xref>). We also found that ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex is able to enter vesicles of the phagocytic system and ER network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and by interacting and sequestering Î²2M can reduce Î²2M-MHC-I complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, we expected a reduction in the amount of peptides derived from the cytoplasmic antigens to be presented on MHC-I-Î²2M complex at the cell surface leading to inefficient presentation of antigen-derived peptides to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, thioglycolate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice (H-2K<sup>b</sup>) were cytosolically loaded with native ovalbumin (OVA) and the levels of ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL peptide (OVA<sub>257â264</sub>) presented by H-2K<sup>b</sup> was examined by flow cytometry in the absence or presence of ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 complex. Our data indicate that the surface levels of SIINFEKL in complex with H-2K<sup>b</sup> were significantly reduced in cells treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10 protein when compared with ovalbumin-pulsed cells treated with either medium or ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004446-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). We also confirmed the staining experiment with an IL-2 assay as a read out for T cell function.

      <p>ESAT-6 and CFP-10 of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> are secreted by the ESX-1 system into the host and believed to contribute to mycobacterial virulence <xref rid="ppat.1004446-deJonge1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which ESAT-6 exerts its virulence effects is not well understood. Using a yeast two hybrid screening, where ESAT-6 was used as bait to screen a human leukocyte prey cDNA library, we were able to identify Î²2M as an interacting partner of ESAT-6. The yeast two-hybrid data for ESAT-6:Î²2M interaction was further confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis, co-purification, GST pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The data from all these studies point to a strong interaction between ESAT-6 and Î²2M. The ESAT-6:Î²2M interaction was found to be stable across a wide pH range and salt concentrations as high as 2M indicating interaction between these two proteins is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions.</p>
      <p>Î²2M is a â¼13 kDa polypeptide that is found in the serum as well as in tight association with MHC-I heavy chain on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Gussow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Î²2M is also associated with CD1, involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and HFE which is known to regulate intracellular iron concentration <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Association of Î²2M with the Î± chain of HLA/MHC-I, CD1 and HFE is a prerequisite for the cell-surface expression of these receptors <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Gussow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004446-Krangel1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We observed that over-expression of ESAT-6 in the cell cytoplasm or exogenous addition of ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex reduced the cell surface translocation of Î²2M in macrophages without affecting the total cellular Î²2M content. This may potentially lead to interference not only with protein and lipid antigen presentation but also with iron metabolism. Iron is essential for the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and therefore manipulation of the host iron homeostasis can be an important virulence strategy for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Interestingly, HFE knock-out as well as Î²2M knock-out mice showed an increased susceptibility to experimental infection with <italic>M. avium</italic> and during infection these animals were found to accumulate iron inside the granuloma macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-GomesPereira1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Thus, ESAT-6:CFP-10 perhaps play multiple roles in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> virulence.</p>
      <p>The dissociation constant of Î²2M and HLA-AB heavy chain is 1Ã10<sup>â8</sup> M <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and that for Î²2M and ESAT-6 is 1.03Ã10<sup>â6</sup> M, as calculated from the SPR studies. Since, the affinity of Î²2M for HLA-AB heavy chain is higher than its affinity for ESAT-6, it is most likely that ESAT-6 when present in high concentrations, binds to portion of available free Î²2M pool before it forms complex with the HLA heavy chain. This probably explains the partial inhibition observed in the surface expression of Î²2M and HLA class I and class I-restricted antigen presentation. Overall, our results suggest that ESAT-6 if present in the cell at a given point in time, as can happen during the course of infection, can potentially compromise the function of Î²2M, HLA class I molecules and interfere with antigen presentation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, UL18, a human cytomegalovirus protein is known to bind Î²2M and reduce the maturation of cellular MHC-I molecules on cell surface <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Browne1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Also, Î²2M-deficient mice are found to be more susceptible to mycobacterial infection as compared to the wild-type mice <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, suggesting that Î²2M and/or Î²2M-dependent factors are probably important for resistance against mycobacteria. Therefore, it appears logical that targeting Î²2M and cellular processes regulated by it would be beneficial for the survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
      <p>The structural core of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex consists of two similar helixâturnâhelix hairpin structures from each protein, and is stabilized by an extensive hydrophobic contact surface. The alpha helical cores lie anti-parallel to each other to form a four-helix bundle. The extreme C-terminus of ESAT-6 (residues 84â95) was found to be free and was not involved in interaction with CFP-10 <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004446-Houben1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, a recombinant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain H37Rv EsxAÎ84â95 expressing a mutant form of ESAT-6 with a C-terminal deletion of 12 amino acid residues was found to possess a functional ESX-1 system (as it was shown to secrete ESAT-6 and CFP-10 efficiently), but was attenuated in a mouse infection model <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004446-Houben1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This implies that the C-terminus of ESAT-6 does not play a significant structural role, but is required for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> virulence. Interestingly, we found that deletion of the last 6 amino acids (valine, threonine, glycine, methionine, phenylalanine and alanine) from the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 inhibited formation of the ESAT-6:Î²2M complex. The ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 complex which failed to interact with Î²2M also failed to reduce the surface Î²2M as well as HLA expression. The loss of Î²2M binding activity thus may well correlate with the attenuation of strains harbouring the mutant ESAT-6 with the last 12 amino acid deletion in the C-terminus region as reported earlier <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004446-Houben1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It appears that CFP-10 and ESAT-6 stabilizes each other through extensive hydrophobic interactions spanning their core helix-loop-helix structure, while the free flexible C-terminal end of ESAT-6 is available for interaction with Î²2M and possibly other host proteins. True to this expectation, we found that anti-Î²2M Ab could co-immunoprecipitate both the ESAT-6 and ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex but not the C-terminally truncated ESAT-6ÎC alone or in complex with CFP-10. Based on the observations made by us and others <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Brodin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that the interaction of ESAT-6 through its free C-terminal end with Î²2M and possibly other host proteins is required for its virulence properties.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, exogenously added ESAT-6 and ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex coupled with FITC was able to find its way to the ER of dendritic cells and macrophages. It is interesting to note that fluid phase proteins like human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein US6 and the <italic>Pseudomonas aureginosa</italic> derived Exotoxin A that escape proteolytic degradation can enter into the ER lumen directly <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Ackerman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Akerman1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, the exact mechanism by which ESAT-6/ESAT-6:CFP-10 is retrotransported to the ER is not understood. One of the possibilities could be leaching into the cells due to the pore forming ability of ESAT-6 <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In fact, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. leprae</italic> but not <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG are known to rely on ESAT-6:CFP-10 to escape from the phagolysosome to the cytosol in myeloid cells <xref rid="ppat.1004446-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Again, ESAT-6 but not CFP-10 was able to hemolyse RBCs by forming pores in their membranes which could be plugged by using the appropriate polethylene glycol <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These evidence suggest that ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex may gain access to the ER compartment either through pore formation or via the cytosolic detour pathway <xref rid="ppat.1004446-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Lewinsohn1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Exogenously added soluble ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex was found to reduce the amount of SIINFEKL peptide presented by hypertonically loaded cytoplasmic ovalbumin as well as cross-presented ovalbumin indicating that ESAT-6:CFP-10 can affect class I antigen presentation, possibly by sequestering Î²2M and thus decreasing available free Î²2M that can associate with MHC-I heavy chain for its surface localization. Poor loading of antigenic peptides on to the mature MHC-I-Î²2M complexes may in turn could affect the subsequent priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to undermine the anti-mycobacterial immunity.</p>
      <p>A CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is perhaps crucial for immunity in already established tuberculosis <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Woodworth1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been found to be present in granulomas and pleural exudates of TB patients sometimes more in numbers than that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Randhawa1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Moreover, adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells provides protection in BCG and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> challenged mice <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Tascon1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Feng2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Also, mice deficient in Î²2M and TAP are more susceptible to tuberculosis <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Behar1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. CD8 deficient mice are still susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection though not to the extent of <italic>Î²2m</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Sousa1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Given the importance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the class I antigen presentation pathway in immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the ability to downregulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation can be highly advantageous to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in its constant tug of war with the host immune system. Since, ESAT-6 is highly expressed especially during the initial stages of infection <xref rid="ppat.1004446-Baena1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and is a secretory protein, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> may deploy ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex to sequester Î²2M in the cell to suppress presentation of mycobacterial antigens and thereby subvert generation of crucial anti-mycobacterial adaptive immune responses. It is also possible that ESAT-6:CFP-10 from resident <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, especially macrophages can interfere with the class I antigen presentation pathway and prevent the clearance of infected cells by the cytolytic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We have carried out experiments that mimic the presence of ESAT-6 both extracellularly and intracellularly. In both the conditions, we found that the surface Î²2M levels were reduced suggesting a role of ESAT-6 in interfering with class I antigen presentation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, in addition to Î²2M alone, the ESAT-6:Î²2M complex could be detected in the pleural fluid of the patients suffering from pleural tuberculosis indicating the pathophysiological importance of ESAT6:Î²2M interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the mechanisms leading to the formation of ESAT-6:Î²2M complex in the pleural fluid are not clear at present.</p>
      <p>In summary, our data demonstrate that ESAT-6 and ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex interacts and sequesters one of the host proteins Î²2M to inhibit surface expression of Î²2M-associated molecules and consequently can suppress antigen presentation by MHC-I-Î²2M complex. The free C-terminal end of ESAT-6 is required for such interaction and possibly virulence. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which the ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP10 complex gains access to the ER resident Î²2M is yet to be understood. Results presented in our manuscript not only identify a novel interaction but also highlight a novel mechanism of suppression of MHC-I antigen presentation that might play a crucial role in subverting adaptive immune responses during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Therefore, the identification of ESAT-6 and Î²2M interaction, not only sheds new light on the host pathogen relationship, but also opens up avenues for development of small molecule inhibitors or vaccine for tuberculosis therapy.</p>

        <p>ESAT-6 ORF cloned in pET23a was used for purification of His-tagged ESAT-6 as described elsewhere <xref rid="ppat.1004446-deJonge1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In brief, protein expression was induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET23a-ESAT-6 by addition of isopropyl-Î²-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to a final concentration of 1 mM. ESAT-6 protein was purified from cell pellet under denaturing conditions using 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and the denatured protein was refolded back by sequential removal of urea. For purification of mutant ESAT-6 (ESAT-6ÎC, the last 6 amino acids were deleted from the C-terminal end of ESAT-6) and CFP-10, the corresponding ORFs were cloned in pET23a with an N-terminal His-tag. For purification of the protein complexes like ESAT-6:CFP-10 and ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10, ESAT-6 or ESAT-6ÎC ORF was cloned in frame with His-tag of first multiple cloning site (MCS) in pETDuet (Novagen EMD, Germany) while CFP-10 was cloned in the second MCS of pETDuet vector. For ESAT-6:Î²2M purification, ESAT-6 was cloned in frame with His-tag of the first MCS in pETDuet while Î²2M was cloned in the second MCS of pETDuet vector. These clones were transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) and protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG. Polyhistidine-tagged recombinant protein was purified from these cells using TALON resin (Clontech Laboratories, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation for purification of protein under native condition.

In some experiments, HLA class I molecules were pulled down from THP-1 macrophages treated for 2 hours with either ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6ÎC:CFP-10 complexes. Post-treatment with protein complexes, the cells were washed and lysed in a HEPES-containing immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche, Germany). Equal amount of lysates (100 Âµg) were incubated with W6/32 mAb (IgG2a isotype) that recognizes HLA class I complexed with Î²2M (Abcam Inc, USA) or isotype-matched control Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) overnight, followed by capturing with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) for 1 hour.

        <p>Pleural fluid samples were collected from individuals suffering from clinically diagnosed pleural TB. Patients with non-tuberculous etiology having malignant pleural effusion/parapneumonic effusion were included as controls. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (LEPRA Society-Blue Peter Research Centre, Hyderabad) and informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to sample collection. The amount of ESAT-6:Î²2M complex present in the pleural fluid was measured by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight with 1 Âµg/well of mouse anti-human Î²2M Ab, clone CBL306 (Millipore, USA). After blocking with 2% BSA (AMRESCO, USA), pleural fluid samples (50 Âµl) were added and incubated overnight at 4Â°C.
