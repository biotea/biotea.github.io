      <abstract>
        <p>MLP (muscle LIM protein)-deficient mice count among the first mouse models for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), yet the exact role of MLP in cardiac signalling processes is still enigmatic. Elevated PKCÎ± signalling activity is known to be an important contributor to heart failure. Here we show that MLP directly inhibits the activity of PKCÎ±. In end-stage DCM, PKCÎ± is concentrated at the intercalated disc of cardiomyocytes, where it is sequestered by the adaptor protein CARP in a multiprotein complex together with PLCÎ²1. In mice deficient for both MLP and CARP the chronic PKCÎ± signalling chain at the intercalated disc is broken and they remain healthy. Our results suggest that the main role of MLP in heart lies in the direct inhibition of PKCÎ± and that chronic uninhibited PKCÎ± activity at the intercalated disc in the absence of functional MLP leads to heart failure.</p>

    <p>MLP (Muscle LIM protein, encoded by the <italic>Csrp3</italic> gene) was initially discovered as a protein up-regulated in skeletal muscle following denervation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It was subsequently shown to be expressed only in the heart and in adult slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and suggested to play a role during muscle differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. MLP consists of two LIM domains, structural domains composed of two zinc fingers, which are well known for their role in proteinâprotein interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Among the many binding partners that were described for MLP are the cytoskeletal proteins actin, Î±-actinin, N-RAP, telethonin (T-cap) and spectrin as well as the skeletal muscle transcription factors MyoD, MRF4 and myogenin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Based on these interactions and the presence of a nuclear localization signal it was proposed that MLP acts as a signalling protein between the myofilaments or the cytoplasm, and the nucleus in myocytes, which is responsive to pharmacological or mechanical stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Pathological mutations in MLP can lead to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
    <p>Mice deficient for MLP (MLP knockouts) count among the first published models for DCM in a genetically manipulated animal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. They show all the anatomical and physiological hallmarks of DCM, and present with up-regulated expression levels of classical biomarkers for hypertrophy such as ANF (atrial natriuretic factor), BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and Î²-myosin heavy chain as well as stress markers such as CARP (Cardiac-specific ankyrin repeat protein, CARP1/Ankrd1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. While MLP knockout mice have been used by many laboratories as a mouse model to investigate DCM, the exact role that MLP plays in myocytes remains unclear. It was proposed that MLP could act as a mechanosensor at the Z-disc transmitting stress signals to the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. While signalling roles of MLP in the heart are well characterized, its function as a mechanosensor is less clear. Considering its molecular structure and subcellular localization, it is not obvious how a 20âkDa protein that exclusively consists of LIM domains can sense changes in mechanical force. Given that LIM domains have well-known proteinâprotein interaction interfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, it seems more likely that MLP functions in signal transmission rather than as a direct mechanosensor. Additionally, the exclusive Z-disc localization has been challenged, since several groups have reported a more widespread distribution throughout several subcellular compartments in myocytes both for endogenous and transfected MLP, including the nucleus, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton and myofibrillar localizations other than the Z-disc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>Over the years numerous rescue models were published using MLP knockout mice including double knockout mice with the SERCA-2A (Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>++</sup> ATPase) regulator phospholamban<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and overexpression of calcineurin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Other MLP knockout rescue reports involve inhibition of adrenergic signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and interference with PKCÎ± (Protein Kinase C) signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
    <p>Increased PKCÎ± expression and activity are well established in end stage heart failure models in rodents (for recent reviews see<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The phosphorylation substrates for PKCÎ± range from phospholamban to sarcomeric proteins such as troponin and titin, and phosphatases such as PP2A with ensuing effects on calcium handling and contractility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
    <p>Intrigued by recent propositions that MLP may interact directly with PKCÎ±<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and reports that MLP expression is down-regulated in failing mouse and human hearts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, we speculated that MLP may directly affect PKCÎ± activity.</p>
    <p>Our assays reveal that the presence of MLP inhibits autophosphorylation of PKCÎ± as well as phosphorylation of downstream targets such as phospholamban. We demonstrate that in failing hearts PKCÎ± is concentrated at the intercalated discs (ID) (specialized cellâcell contacts in cardiomyocytes) in a complex with the adaptor protein CARP1 and PLCÎ²1. In double knockout mice for CARP1 and MLP (CMP1), PKCÎ± is no longer detected at the ID and the DCM phenotype does not develop. This is accompanied by normalized PKCÎ± phosphorylation and expression levels. We propose a signalosome complex consisting of muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs) and PKCÎ± that is regulated by MLP and whose persistent activation may play a role in chronic stress signalling in the failing heart.</p>

        <title>MLP directly inhibits PKCÎ± activity</title>
        <p>To investigate the possibility that MLP can directly modulate the activity of PKCÎ±, we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays using recombinantly expressed protein. Autoradiography showed that increasing amounts of MLP lead to decreased PKCÎ± autophosphorylation and a decreased phosphorylation of the PKCÎ± substrate phospholamban (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, for quantification see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Furthermore, we found that MLP itself is a potential substrate of PKCÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and that gene mutations associated with human HCM result in reduced phosphorylation of MLP, while DCM-causing mutations show increased phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Intriguingly, MLP phosphorylation appears to be significantly increased in heart samples of DCM patients (IDCM) as compared to non-failing (NF) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). A similar shift in MLP phosphorylation was observed in GÎ± (q) overexpressing mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>), a mouse model for cardiac contractile failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A potential role of wild-type (WT) MLP in modulating PKCÎ± signalling and activity in long-term heart failure may explain why the lack of MLP leads to DCM, and why all strategies that interfered with PKCÎ± signalling prevented the development of a DCM phenotype in the MLP-deficient background<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>

        <title>PKCÎ± concentrates at the ID in failing hearts</title>
        <p>While an increase in PKCÎ± expression and activity is well established in the failing rodent heart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the situation in humans is less clear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Analysis of PKCÎ±/Î² expression in heart samples from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) by immunoblotting revealed a marked up-regulation of PKC phosphorylation at Thr638/641 in most patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Confocal microscopy on immunostained heart sections from DCM patients showed a remarkable concentration of PKCÎ± at the ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, quantification in 2c), which was not as evident in heart samples from NF controls. This supports published data that reported an increased signal for PKCÎ± at the ID in human heart failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. How does PKCÎ± specifically target the ID? CARP1 is a stress marker that is consistently up-regulated in heart failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and a well-known scaffold protein (for reviews see refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Immunoblot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) showed increased expression of CARP1, but not the closely related CARP2/Ankrd2 in failing human heart samples. At the cellular level CARP1 is known to localize to the sarcomere and the nucleus, with increased nuclear presence following mechanical strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. We observed no differences in nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of CARP1 in either normal or DCM hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). However, in all functionally compromised hearts that we studied (MLP knockout and human DCM samples), CARP1 translocated from the sarcomere to the ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, for quantification see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e</xref>), whereas the localization of CARP2 was less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, for quantification see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). ID association for both proteins was recently also described by Jasnic-Savovic and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Consistent with a previously reported interaction between CARP1 and phospholipase-C (PLC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, we demonstrated in pull-down assays that the coiled coil region of PLCÎ²1, the main PLC isoform in hearts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, binds to both CARP1 and CARP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Protein complementation assays revealed that all CARP family members can interact with the coiled coil region of PLCÎ²1 and that this interaction happens in an antiparallel fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). To investigate whether this complex also occurs in cardiac tissue <italic>in situ</italic>, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments on cardiac extracts from MLP knockout hearts. CARP1 is exclusively expressed in cardiomyocytes and cannot be detected in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>), therefore confirming that we specifically assayed the cardiomyocyte signalosome. Using CARP1 antibodies, we identified the presence of a signalosome complex in MLP knockout hearts containing CARP1, CARP2, PKCÎ± and PLCÎ²1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>). In contrast, these proteins were not pulled down from WT or CARP1 knockout hearts, adding support to our hypothesis that this complex only assembles in DCM/failing hearts. Using recombinant CARP1 or CARP2, we demonstrated that it is also possible to pull-down PLCÎ²1 and PKCÎ± from MLP knockout hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). In left ventricle extracts from a subset of end-stage DCM patients the entire complex could be pulled down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>
        <p>These results indicate that CARP1 and CARP2 can sequester PKCÎ± into a complex with PLCÎ²1. In the failing heart CARP1 is up-regulated and relocates from the sarcomere to the ID. This relocation and the ensuing retention of PKCÎ± at the ID appear to be the crucial step in maladaptive signalling in failing hearts.</p>

        <title>PKC activity affects CARP and MLP expression</title>
        <p>CARP1 is reportedly a target for many protein kinases including PKCÎ±<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, which we recently demonstrated through <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Since CARP1 up-regulation and subcellular relocation appear to be crucial in setting up the pathological signalosome complex together with PKCÎ± and PLC1Î² at the ID, we considered the possibility of an initial crosstalk between PKCÎ± and CARP. Addition of kinase inhibitors to cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMC) revealed that exposure to PKC inhibitors (bisindolylmaleimide (BI) or calphostin C (Ca)) not only reduced PKCÎ± phosphorylation levels at Thr638/641, but also downregulated CARP1 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). No effect was seen with a Map kinase kinase inhibitor (U0126; U0), again supporting the idea that the effect on CARP1 expression levels may be due to PKCÎ± activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The reduction in CARP1 expression following PKC inhibition could also be observed in cardiomyocytes cultured over several days as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, when MLP knockout mice were peritoneally injected with BI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>). The effect was not limited to CARP1, but also extended to CARP2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>), which was significantly down-regulated in hearts of BI treated mice. More intriguingly, however, was the effect we observed on MLP phosphorylation and expression levels. PKC inhibition by BI decreased MLP expression levels, and more importantly MLP phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These data indicate that MLP is a direct phosphorylation target of PKC, and that this phosphorylation may affect MLP activity and protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>). In immunofluorescence-stained heart sections, PKC inhibition shifted CARP1 but not CARP2 localization from a more pronounced ID association to an increased sarcomeric signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, for quantification see 3f). Label-free measurements of NMC contractility demonstrated that inhibition of PKCÎ± by BI normalized the higher beating frequencies usually observed in neonatal MLP knockout cardiomyocytes compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>).</p>
        <p>These results show that elevated PKCÎ± phosphorylation increases CARP expression levels. This is accompanied by the subcellular relocalization of both PKCÎ± and CARP1 to the ID. The assembly of a signalosome consisting of CARP, PKCÎ± and PLCÎ²1 at the ID leads to a stabilization of PKCÎ± signalling activity. Inhibition of PKCÎ± results in down-regulation of CARP expression, changes its subcellular targeting and probably leads to the disassembly of the signalosome. In addition, PKCÎ± inhibition in WT cardiomyocytes leads to a decrease in MLP phosphorylation and expression.</p>
        <p>We propose that acute signalling of this complex may be beneficial for the adaptation of the heart to stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, while its chronic or pathological activation is maladaptive.</p>

        <title>Absent DCM phenotype in MLP CARP1/CARP2 double knockout mice</title>
        <p>If CARP1 is indeed a crucial adaptor required to recruit PKCÎ± stably to the ID, and to trigger pathological signalling in failing hearts, then its removal should prevent the development of heart failure in MLP knockout mice. Genetic ablation of any of the MARP family members in mice (CARP1/Ankrd1/MARPâencoded by the <italic>Ankrd1</italic> gene; CARP2/Ankrd2/ARPP encoded by the <italic>Ankrd2</italic> gene; CARP3/Ankrd23/DARPâencoded by the <italic>Ankrd23</italic> gene) had no effect on heart function at baseline, even in the case of a triple knockout<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. To test our hypothesis, we crossed MLP knockout mice with the three MARP knockout lines and examined their cardiac phenotype. Immunoblot analysis of MLP and MARP expression revealed basal expression of CARP1, but no CARP2 in control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Hearts of MLP knockouts displayed increased expression as well as altered posttranslational modification of CARP1 and induced CARP2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2aâc</xref>). CARP3 was not expressed in control hearts, and was not induced in MLP knockout hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Histological and functional analyses revealed the previously reported phenotype of MLP knockout hearts (that is, dilation and heart failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>); in contrast double knockout mice for MLP and CARP1 (CMP1), and MLP and CARP2 (CMP2) had normal healthy hearts. Thus, the DCM phenotype does not develop in the absence of CARP1 or CARP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). The hearts of double knockout mice for MLP and CARP3 (CMP3) were dilated and exhibited heart failure similar to the single MLP knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). CMP3 hearts had elevated expression levels of CARP1 and CARP2 as well as increased PKCÎ± phosphorylation, suggesting activity of the same maladaptive signalling complex that we propose for MLP knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,f</xref>). The absence of a failing heart phenotype in the CMP1 animals was accompanied by redistribution of CARP2 to the sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, for quantification see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). Most importantly PKCÎ± no longer concentrated at the ID, while the PLCÎ²1 localization was indistinguishable between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h,i</xref>). Analysis of PKCÎ± phosphorylation levels revealed their normalization to control levels in the CMP1 heart compared to the MLP knockout heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). This suggests that it is the concentration of PKCÎ± at the ID that triggers its pathological activity. Previously we characterized pathological changes at the cellular level in murine and human DCM samples such as elevated expression levels of N-RAP at the ID and re-expression of the foetal M-band marker EH-myomesin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. These changes were no longer seen in CMP1 or CMP2, but were still evident in CMP3 hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). However, while the lack of CARP1 or CARP2 expression prevents the development of a DCM phenotype, biomarkers for hypertrophy such as ANF, BNP and skeletal actin continued to be elevated at the mRNA level in CMP1 and CMP2 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4aâc</xref>). Also, double knockout hearts still showed some evidence of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4dâf</xref>), although the amount was markedly reduced compared to MLP knockout mice.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we propose that the existence of a multiprotein complex consisting of CARP, PKCÎ± and PLCÎ²1 at the ID of failing hearts is crucial for the maintenance of pathological signalling activity of PKCÎ±. MLP can directly inhibit PKCÎ± activity, and its absence is sufficient to lead to a DCM phenotype over time. Removal of CARP leads to the dissolution of the complex, where PKCÎ± no longer concentrates at the ID, preventing the DCM phenotype in MLP knockout mice.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate here the existence of a multiprotein complex composed of PKCÎ±, PLC1Î², CARP1 and CARP2 at the ID specifically in failing hearts. The retention of PKCÎ± to this signalosome at the ID may lead to an amplification of signalling. The persistent shift in subcellular localization makes the difference between acute activation of PKCÎ± that is beneficial for the heart to cope with transient stress, and chronic activation, which leads to detrimental downstream effects on calcium handling and contractile parameters. We propose that the up-regulation in expression and relocation of CARP1 or CARP2 from a sarcomeric localization to the ID is the crucial switch between acute and chronic PKCÎ± activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). We further show that MLP can directly inhibit PKCÎ± activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, and demonstrate that removal of CARP by genetic means prevents the formation of this maladaptive signalling complex, thereby preventing the morphological, functional and molecular phenotype of DCM in MLP knockout mice.</p>
      <p>These results explain at a molecular level, why previous strategies that prevented the development of a DCM phenotype in the MLP knockout mouse were successful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Under normal circumstances MLP reduces excessive PKCÎ± signalling in the heart. In MLP knockout mice this does no longer happen and DCM develops. Direct interference with the maladaptive PKCÎ± signalling pathway by genetic or pharmacological strategies thus rescues the effect of the lack of MLP. The novel role of MLP as a PKCÎ± inhibitor could also provide an explanation why overexpression of MLP does not have drastic effects on heart function under basal conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Removal of phospholamban, which was found to rescue the MLP knockout phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, leads to a reduction of free cytosolic calcium known to be required for PKCÎ± activation.</p>
      <p>We also noted that MLP itself is a substrate for PKCÎ± activity. Indeed, DCM patient samples that show higher PKCÎ± phosphorylation levels correlated with increased MLP phosphorylation levels compared to NF controls. Moreover we observed that DCM-causing MLP mutants were hyper-phosphorylated by PKCÎ± <italic>in vitro</italic>, while MLP mutants that were associated with the development of HCM were hypo-phosphorylated. Inhibition of PKCÎ± activity <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to decreased MLP phosphorylation and expression in cardiomyocytes. The exciting finding that the MLP phosphorylation state can be modulated by PKCÎ±, correlates with different forms of cardiomyopathy and may affect its protein levels and/or activity again underlines the important role of this protein in cardiac stress signalling. At present it is unknown whether mutations in MLP or its various posttranslational modifications have an effect on oligomerization, which determines the subcellular localization and actin bundling activity of MLP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Phostag blots of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRC) indicate the presence of several distinct MLP phosphorylation sites, one of which was significantly changed upon PKC inhibition. It will be intriguing to investigate which posttranslational modifications of MLP indeed change its cell-biological properties. We propose that these posttranslational modifications of MLP are key to its biological function, and may ultimately determine where, when and how effectively it interferes with PKCÎ± signalling.</p>
      <p>CARP1 has for a long time been associated with mechanosignalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and was shown to be up-regulated in heart failure by several studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Recently its upregulated expression was shown to correlate directly with heart failure progression in IDCM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. So far most studies have proposed that nuclear signalling of CARP via ERK1/2 to molecules such as p53 and GATA4 is crucial for a hypertrophic response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. While there are conflicting results on the effect of CARP1 on ERK1/2 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, it appears to be increasingly recognized that stress sensing complexes associated with the titin I-band region, containing CARP1, or FHL1/2 and RAF/MEK/ERK may be partially responsible for mediating a hypertrophic response in hearts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Our results now show that in heart failure CARP1 seems to be involved in a different signalling cascade at a distinct subcellular localization, namely boosting maladaptive PKCÎ± signalling at the ID. Mutations in CARP1 were shown to cause both HCM and DCM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> and to display both gain of function and dominant negative effects on the contractile behaviour of engineered heart tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. We propose that whether mutant CARP1 leads to HCM or DCM may be correlated to differential effects on proteinâprotein interaction and in particular distinct activation of the two signalling pathways via ERK1/2 from the sarcomere to the nucleus (HCM) or via PKCÎ± at the ID (DCM).</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that one of the main differences between a healthy and a failing heart is the presence of PKCÎ± at the ID. The analysis of PKCÎ±/Î² expression levels in human hearts was inconclusive and it seems to be the change in subcellular targeting rather than mere expression levels that makes the crucial difference between a healthy and a failing heart. Why would active PKCÎ±/Î² at the ID be so detrimental for the heart? Cell membranes are known to be the major site of PKC function (for review see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) and the signalosome complex that we describe here appears to be similar to previously described scaffold interactions that were shown to be crucial for PKC regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Increased translocation of PKCÎ± from the cytosolic to the membranous fraction marked the transition from pressure overload induced hypertrophy to congestive heart failure in guinea pigs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In addition, constitutively active PKCÎ± at the ID may interfere with another level of regulation in the challenged heart. Î²-adrenergic receptors are known to become insensitive following PKCÎ± activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> and adrenergic signalling is well known to play a role in heart disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Adrenergic receptors were previously shown to be concentrated at the ID in cardiomyocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. A failure to respond to fine-tuning by adrenergic signalling as shown by the altered contractile behaviour that we observed in cultured cardiomyocytes from MLP knockout mice, may over time lead to a failing heart phenotype.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our results highlight novel roles for MLP and CARP in pathological signalling via their interactions with PKCÎ±. This signalosome seems to be crucial for eliciting the maximal maladaptive response in the stressed heart, and CARP may be the proposed missing link<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Modulation of this complex may offer new therapeutic options to prevent heart failure.</p>

        <p>All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California San Diego. MLP and MARP knockout mice as well as GÎ± (q) overexpressing mice were previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. All animals were in a mixed sv129/black swiss background. For physiological experiments only male mice were used, samples used for immunohistology and immunoblotting were from both genders. Unless stated otherwise, animals in the age range between 4 and 8 months were used for the experiments. Oligonucleotides used for genotyping via PCR analysis of tail DNA can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p>
        <p>The mice were fed ad libitum with a standard diet and maintained in a temperature and light-controlled room (22âÂ°C, 14âh light/10âh dark). Treatment of MLP knockout animals with PKC inhibitor was done similar to a previously described method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In short, 4-months old male MLP mice were injected subcutaneous with a single dose of either PKC inhibitor BI I-HCl (BI; sc-24004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1âÎ¼gâg<sup>â1</sup> body weight) or DMSO (vehicle). Ventricular heart tissue of mice was dissected after 24âh following the injection and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis, or processed for immunofluorescence analysis.</p>
        <p>The protocol for animal handling and treatment procedures was in accordance with the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Services at the University of California, San Diego and guidelines presented in the National Research Council's (NCR) âGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals' published by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the National Academy of Science, Bethesda, MD, 2011.</p>
        <p>For echocardiography analysis 2-, 4-, 6- and 12-month-old male control, MLP, MARP and MLP-MARP double knockout mice were analysed. For protein, mRNA, histological, immunofluorescence and morphological analysis, the left ventricular free wall of hearts from 3â9-month-old adult male and female mice were used. Investigation of gross cardiac morphology by histology used whole hearts that included ventricles and atria.</p>

        <p>The isolation of NMC and NRC was performed using collagenase/dispase digestion, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Hearts from neonatal rats and mice were initially dissected in PBS containing 20âmM BDM (2,3-butanedione monoxime; Sigma) and minced.

Alternatively, cardiomyocytes were isolated using the Neonatal Cardiomyocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Individual cells were released by trituration with a 10âml tissue culture pipette and undigested tissue pieces were removed using a cell strainer (Falcon). After centrifugation at 80âg, the pellet of isolated cells was resuspended in Plating Medium (68% DMEM, 17% Medium M199, 10% horse serum, 5% foetal calf serum, 4âmM glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, all from Sigma), plated into collagen-coated plastic dishes and incubated over night.

GAPDH was used as a loading control. Shown are representative blots and quantification of changes for PKCÎ± phosphorylation as well as CARP1 and CARP2 protein levels (<bold>c</bold>). Sample sizes for untreated controls and BI-treated animals were 4 and 3, respectively. <italic>P</italic> values are indicated in the figure. (<bold>d</bold>) BI treatment of NRC for 24âh leads to decreased MLP phosphorylation and protein level (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1j,k</xref>). SDS samples of protein extracts from vehicle treated (V) or BI-treated NRC were run on conventional SDS PAGE (middle) and on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 50âÎ¼M Phostag reagent (top) and immunoblotted for MLP. Phosphorylated MLP proteins (P1) migrate slower due to their interaction with the Phostag reagent, compared to unphosphorylated protein (P0). Phostag profile plot analysis of band intensities (right panel) revealed presence of three distinct P1 MLP phosphorylation bands (P1-a, P1-b and P1-c), which are putatively caused by several distinct phosphorylation sites in MLP. One of these phosphorylation sites (P1-c) is changed significantly upon BI treatment (red curve) compared to vehicle control (blue curve). Shown are normalized average band intensities and s.e. GAPDH was used as loading control (bottom).
