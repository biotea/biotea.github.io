          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease. Discovery of the mutated genes that cause the inherited form(s) of the disease may shed light on the mechanism(s) of oncogenesis. Previously we isolated a susceptibility locus for familial pancreatic cancer to chromosome location 4q32â34. In this study, our goal was to discover the identity of the familial pancreatic cancer gene on 4q32 and determine the function of that gene.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="st2">
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>A customized microarray of the candidate chromosomal region affecting pancreatic cancer susceptibility revealed the greatest expression change in <italic>palladin (PALLD),</italic> a gene that encodes a component of the cytoskeleton that controls cell shape and motility. A mutation causing a proline (hydrophobic) to serine (hydrophilic) amino acid change (P239S) in a highly conserved region tracked with all affected family members and was absent in the non-affected members. The mutational change is not a known single nucleotide polymorphism. <italic>Palladin</italic> RNA, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, was overexpressed in the tissues from precancerous dysplasia and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in both familial and sporadic disease. Transfection of wild-type and P239S mutant <italic>palladin</italic> gene constructs into HeLa cells revealed a clear phenotypic effect: cells expressing P239S palladin exhibited cytoskeletal changes, abnormal actin bundle assembly, and an increased ability to migrate.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>These observations suggest that the presence of an abnormal <italic>palladin</italic> gene in familial pancreatic cancer and the overexpression of palladin protein in sporadic pancreatic cancer cause cytoskeletal changes in pancreatic cancer and may be responsible for or contribute to the tumor's strong invasive and migratory abilities.</p>

        <sec id="sb1a">
          <title>Background.</title>
          <p>Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Because it causes few symptoms in its early stages, pancreatic cancer is rarely detected until it has spread (metastasized) around the body. Pancreatic tumors can occasionally be removed surgically but the usual treatment is radio- or chemotherapy, and neither of these is curative; most patients die within a year of diagnosis. As in other cancers, the cells in pancreatic tumors have acquired genetic changes (mutations) that allow them to divide uncontrollably (normal cells divide only to repair damaged tissue). Other mutations alter the shape of the cells and allow them to migrate into (invade) other areas of the body. These mutations usually arise randomlyâthe cells in the human body are bombarded by chemicals and other agents that can damage their DNAâand cause âsporadicâ pancreatic cancer. But some people inherit mutated genes that increase their susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. These people are recognizable because pancreatic cancer is more common in their families than in the general population.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1b">
          <title>Why Was This Study Done?</title>
          <p>The identification of the genes that are mutated in familial pancreatic cancer might provide insights into how both inherited and sporadic cancer develops in the pancreas. Such information could suggest ways to detect pancreatic cancers earlier than is currently possible and could identify new therapeutic targets for this deadly disease. Previous work by the researchers who did this study localized a gene responsible for inherited pancreatic cancer to a small region of Chromosome 4 in a family in which pancreatic cancer is very common (Family X). In this study, the researchers identified which of the genes in this region is likely to be responsible for the susceptibility to pancreatic cancer of Family X.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1c">
          <title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title>
          <p>The researchers made a DNA microarray (a small chip spotted with DNA sequences) of the 243 genes in the chromosomal region linked to pancreatic cancer in Family X. They used this to examine gene expression in dysplastic pancreatic tissue from a Family X member (pancreatic dysplasia is a precancerous lesion that precedes cancer), in normal pancreatic tissue, and in samples from sporadic pancreatic cancers. The most highly overexpressed (compared to normal tissue) gene in both the Family X tissue and the sporadic cancers encoded a protein called palladin. Palladin is a component of the cytoskeleton (a structure that helps to control cell shape and motility) and it organizes other cytoskeletal components. Next, the researchers quantified the expression of <italic>palladin</italic> RNA in an independent set of normal and cancerous pancreatic samples, and in precancerous pancreatic tissue taken from Family X members and from people who inherit pancreatic cancer but who were not in Family X. This analysis indicated that <italic>palladin</italic> was overexpressed early in sporadic and inherited pancreatic cancer development. Sequencing of the <italic>palladin</italic> gene then uncovered a mutation in <italic>palladin</italic> that was present in Family X members with pancreatic cancer or precancerous lesions but not in unaffected members. This specific mutation, which probably affects palladin's interaction with another cytoskeletal protein called alpha-actinin, was not found in sporadic cancers although many sporadic cancer cell lines had abnormal expression of alpha-actinin protein in addition to palladin protein. Finally, the researchers showed that the introduction of mutated palladin into a human cell line growing in the laboratory increased its migration rate and disrupted its cytoskeleton.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sb1d">
          <title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title>
          <p>These results strongly suggest that mutated <italic>palladin</italic> is involved in the development of familial pancreatic cancer. Because genes tend to be inherited in groups, there is still chance that a mutation in a nearby gene could be responsible for the increased susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in Family X. However, the data showing <italic>palladin</italic> overexpression in sporadic tumors and alterations of cell behavior in the laboratory after introduction of the mutated gene make this unlikely. To prove the involvement of <italic>palladin</italic> in pancreatic cancer, <italic>palladin</italic> mutations must now be identified in other familial cases and the overexpression of palladin in sporadic cancers must be explained. The results here nevertheless provide an intriguing glimpse into a potential new mechanism for cancer development in the pancreas and possibly other tissues, one in which abnormalities in palladin function or expression (or in the proteins with which it associates) drive some of the changes in cell migration, shape, and size that characterize cancer cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and the third leading cause in individuals aged 40â59 years [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect, resistant to treatment, and is usually discovered after it has metastasized. Nearly every person who develops pancreatic cancer will die from it, the majority within the first year of diagnosis [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The identification of high-risk individuals and elucidation of key oncogenic pathways are therefore priorities for scientists and physicians hoping to change this cancer's dismal prognosis.</p>
      <p>Familial clustering of pancreatic cancers is commonly recognized, occurring in at least 10% of all pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The risk of pancreatic cancer increases with each family member who is affected [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that some apparently sporadic pancreatic cancers are actually caused by inherited genetic susceptibility [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pancreatic cancer can also be inherited as part of a familial cancer syndrome such as that associated with <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and familial atypical mole and melanoma syndrome [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In those cases, the family pedigree shows evidence of other cancers such as breast or intestinal tumors, or melanomas, in addition to pancreatic tumors. The vast majority of familial pancreatic cancer is not accounted for by such known cancer syndromes. Discovery of a gene (or genes), that when mutated in the germline cause heritable pancreatic adenocarcinoma, could provide important insights into the biology of the pancreatic cancers, and potentially of non-pancreatic cancers as well. Such discoveries have been difficult because the rapid demise of pancreatic cancer patients hampers collection of biological samples for genotyping.</p>
      <p>We previously reported an exceptional family, Family X, in which pancreatic adenocarcinoma is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with high penetrance [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In order to identify living carrier family members prior to the onset of cancer, we developed an endoscopic surveillance program that assists in the detection of pancreatic precancerous dysplasia [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This condition, also called pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), is the precancerous lesion of both sporadic and familial pancreatic cancers. PanIN is graded from 1 to 3 with increasing neoplastic progression: hyperplasia (PanIN 1) to low-grade dysplasia (PanIN 2) to carcinoma in situ (PanIN 3). PanIN lesions of all three grades are prominent throughout the pancreatic tissue of affected Family X members prior to cancer formation [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Through our pancreatic cancer surveillance program we were able to identify the members of Family X who had impending cancer formation (histologic conformation of PanIN 2 and 3 in the pancreas).

A transwell without cells was used as a background control. To correct for the cell numbers seeded in each transwell experiment, we measured the optical density of all the original cells in the transwell (migrated and nonmigrated) for each transfected cell type sample.

        <title>Microarray Expression Analysis Selects <italic>Palladin</italic> as the Candidate Familial Pancreatic Cancer Gene</title>
        <p>Sequencing of candidate genes in the 4q32â34 region was time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful (see Candidate Gene Sequencing, below). In order to better identify the most promising candidate genes we employed a new strategy. We hypothesized that a mutated gene is best detected in very early precancerous dysplastic tissue, where the mutated gene has initiated neoplastic transformation but before the overarching genetic chaos of cancer has occurred. Theoretically, the abnormal gene expression would become apparent, from a molecular standpoint, as the pancreas began to undergo malignant degeneration. If the gene were a tumor suppressor gene, we hypothesized that expression would be lost; if it were a proto-oncogene, expression would increase. To perform the expression analysis, we narrowed the search to expressed sequence tags that were densely mapped to our region of interest. This approach would allow us to interrogate a large amount of closely spaced DNA with one assay. RNA was purified from whole tissue samples containing PanIN 1 from a Family X member, from two normal pancreas (controls), and from ten sporadic pancreatic cancers. The RNA samples were separately profiled on a custom expression microarray to identify gene expression in the 4q32â34 region. The custom microarray was created using 243 sequence-verified Unigene clones located between markers D4S2976 and D4S415, a region slightly larger than the region identified as the pancreatic cancer susceptibility locus (between markers D4S413 and D4S2991). The Unigene clones were spotted in sextuplicates (6Ã).</p>
        <p>As noted above, a total of 13 RNA samples from pancreatic tissue were profiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Comparative expression in Family X and the ten sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples were rank-ordered by their degree of over- or underexpression. Two <italic>palladin</italic> clones (Unigene [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unigene</ext-link>] accession number KIAA0992) were the most highly overexpressed Unigenes in the ten sporadic pancreatic cancers, and the same clones were also abnormally expressed in the Family X precancerous sample as well, based on a J5 analysis as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>Palladin</italic> clones were also shown to be among the most overexpressed genes when we analyzed <italic>palladin</italic> expression by N-fold analysis in Family X and sporadic pancreatic cancers compared to normal pancreas.

            <p>(A) To narrow down candidate genes we constructed custom 4q32â34 microarrays composed of 243 expressed sequence tags (IMAGE clones), each of which was spotted six times on the array. The microarrays were hybridized with RNA derived from the following target tissues: sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (<italic>n</italic> = 10), Family X pancreatic precancer (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and normal donor pancreas (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Each target tissue was hybridized separately on the arrays and compared to normal pancreas. This array image is representative of one of the sporadic cancer samples versus normal pancreas. Note the consistency of the expression of the six spotted replicates of cDNA clones. Green indicates genes that were underexpressed in cancer compared to normal pancreas; red indicates genes that were overexpressed in cancer compared to normal pancreas, and yellow indicates genes that were expressed in similar levels as normal pancreas.</p>
            <p>(B) The most overexpressed clones among ten sporadic pancreatic cancers were two different <italic>palladin</italic> clones; both of these clones were significantly overexpressed in Family X precancer.</p>
            <p>(C) RNA overexpression of <italic>palladin</italic> was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Samples tested were whole pancreatic tissues and included six new normal pancreas samples, four new precancerous tissues (PanIN 2 and 3, or low- and high-grade dysplasia, respectively) from two Family X individuals and two unique familial pancreatic cancer individuals not from Family X, nine histologically normal tissues adjacent to cancer, and 16 new pancreatic cancer tissues. In each case, <italic>palladin</italic> expression was measured relative to the endogenous standardized control, <italic>GAPDH</italic>. Error bars indicate 1 standard deviation above and below the average. <italic>Palladin</italic> RNA is overexpressed early in the process of pancreatic neoplasia, as it is overexpressed in normal-appearing tissue adjacent to sporadic cancer, as well as in precancerous pancreatic tissue.

The custom 4q32â34 microarray analysis we performed suggested that <italic>palladin</italic> is not likely to be a tumor suppressor gene (results would reveal loss of expression), but perhaps a proto-oncogene (results would likely reveal overexpression). To validate this conclusion, we determined the number of <italic>palladin</italic> alleles that were present in sorted precancerous epithelial tissue from Family X members; if <italic>palladin</italic> were a tumor suppressor gene one would anticipate allelic loss. A custom-made copy number chip (Nimblegen) was used to measure the number of alleles. The entire <italic>palladin</italic> copy number chip was interrogated using epithelial-sorted dysplastic pancreas samples from two separate Family X members. The copy number of the <italic>palladin</italic> gene was two in every instance.

<italic>Palladin</italic> and Alpha-Actinin Proteins Are Abnormally Expressed in Sporadic Pancreatic Cancer Cell Lines</title>

        <title>Expression of the Mutant Palladin Construct Results in an Abnormal Cellular Cytoskeleton</title>
        <p>To investigate if the mutant form of palladin causes abnormalities in cytoskeletal formation, we cloned the coding region for the normal human 90 kDa isoform sequence into a vector with a GFP tag upstream, designated as WT construct. We then used site-directed mutagenesis to create a C to T mutation at cDNA position 715 bp, matching the Family X mutation, designated as FX construct. These constructs were transfected into HeLa cells to study the phenotypes. Cells transfected with the wild-type <italic>palladin</italic> construct displayed well-organized filaments that colocalized with the F-actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g009">9</xref>B). When HeLa cells were transfected with the FX construct, however, the GFP-mutant palladin forms atypical cytoskeletal aggregates. Perhaps the most distinctive phenotype for the FX construct transfection was the presence of multiple small flower-like structures in the cytoplasm: the center of the flower colocalized with F-actin, while the green flower âpetalsâ of mutated palladin did not colocalize with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g009">Figure 9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g009">9</xref>D).

These changes occurred at a much higher frequency in FX than in WT controls. Cells transfected with the control GFP empty vector exhibited a green haze throughout the whole cells (unpublished data).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The data presented here identify <italic>palladin</italic> as the mutated gene in the pancreatic cancer susceptibility locus at 4q32â34, validate abnormal expression of the gene in a familial pancreatic cancer kindred, demonstrate RNA overexpression of this gene in sporadic pancreatic cancers and precancerous pancreatic tissues, characterize the functional changes induced by the mutant protein, and suggest that cytoskeletal abnormalities may be a driving force in pancreatic oncogenesis.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Palladin</italic> is named for a Renaissance architect, Palladio, because of its role as a key architectural element of the cell. The function of palladin is to provide a scaffold for cytoskeletal proteins to bind, forming the actin filament complexes necessary for cell morphology, movement, and differentiation [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Abnormalities in the proteins that arrange the cytoskeleton can result in loss of cellular polarity (as the cytoskeleton helps direct the location and size of the nucleus in the cell), changes in cell size, increased invasiveness (advancement and retraction of the lamellipodia moving the cell), and abnormal signaling within the cell (the cytoskeleton scaffold is the docking point for many protein-protein interactions).</p>
      <p>The cytoskeleton is composed of actin bundles (polymerized filaments) that form the âtent polesâ supporting the cell membrane. The tented cell is held onto the basement membrane by integrin pegs, with the cytoskeleton directly connected to the pegs. It is through this normal integrin-cytoskeleton interaction that the cell is able to distinguish down from up, providing normal polarity for the cell and a stationary position [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. During cell migration, the cross-linked network of actin filaments is dynamic, forming and dissolving through regulation by specialized actin-binding proteins; in essence these actin-binding proteins form complexes and a scaffold for the actin to polymerize. Disruption of the cytoskeleton has been directly linked to metastatic potential of cancer cells [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Specifically, highly metastatic cells, which have poor cytoskeletal architecture, can detach easily from the primary tumor mass, form transient and weak connections with surrounding connective tissue, and rapidly migrate through it [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>To make the discovery of mutated <italic>palladin</italic> as a cause of familial pancreatic cancer possible, we had to devise an endoscopic surveillance program that could detect the precancerous lesions of the pancreas. This program, to our knowledge the first of its kind, allowed the identification of affected members in Family X, a large kindred with autosomal dominant, highly penetrant pancreatic cancer. Genotyping linked the pancreatic susceptibility gene to 4q32â34. A custom microarray of the dense 4q32â34 region led to the detection of <italic>palladin</italic> overexpression in Family X precancer and in sporadic cancer as well. RNA overexpression of <italic>palladin</italic> was validated by qRT-PCR in whole tissue of four precancerous samples (two from members of Family X and two from non-Family X patients) and in 16 sporadic cancers. <italic>Palladin</italic> was also overexpressed in the apparently ânormalâ tissue adjacent to the cancer. Specific analysis of the ductal epithelium revealed an apparent dose-response of <italic>palladin</italic> levels in the pancreatic epithelial cells, with increasing RNA expression directly associated with increasing neoplastic degeneration. These findings suggest that <italic>palladin</italic> plays a very early role in pancreatic tumorigenesis in both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease and that malignant progression parallels increased expression of the gene.</p>
      <p>Once the candidate gene was identified, sequencing verified that a mutation in the cytoskeleton scaffold gene <italic>palladin</italic> causes familial pancreatic cancer in Family X. We demonstrated that the mutated allele is expressed and that the consequence of the P239S mutation is a change in amino acids at the essential alpha-actinin binding site leading to distinctive changes in the actin bundle morphology. Cells expressing the P239S mutant palladin protein were found to be significantly more mobile than those expressing wild-type palladinâtheoretically, this capability would provide an advantage for cells to invade surrounding structures (a signature feature of cancer).</p>
      <p>Palladin is a key scaffold for the cytoskeletonâit binds several proteins including alpha-actinin [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The <italic>palladin</italic> mutation in Family X leads to an amino-acid change in the highly conserved and essential binding site for alpha-actinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030516-g005">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We were able to detect protein expression abnormalities in either palladin and/or alpha-actinin in six of seven of the sporadic pancreatic cancer cell lines that we tested. This change in the palladin/alpha-actinin axis suggests that these proteins are essential for intact normal cellular behavior. Specifically, the alpha-actinin/palladin protein axis establishes a link between B-integrin subunits and filamentous actin, holding the cell (through the cytoskeleton) to the basement membrane (unpublished data) [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Through this action, normal pancreatic epithelial cells are uniform in size, oriented to the basement membrane, and immobileâexactly the cellular features that are lost in cancer. Alpha-actinin also plays a role in formation of complex/adhesion plaques; these plaques are modulated during growth and differentiation (and reduced in tumor cells) [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Mutations in the alpha-actinin binding site of palladin have not previously been recognized in human disease, although decreased levels of normal alpha-actinin in 3T3 cells cause tumorigenesis in nude mice [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>Complete loss of palladin function in knock-out mice results in embryonic lethality [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is apparent that at least some palladin protein must be present for the cell differentiation and migration events that occur during normal development. Mutation, rather than complete loss, may lead to partially intact but imperfect cytoskeleton scaffold function. In support of this hypothesis, the Family X mutated constructs revealed that actin cytoskeleton bundles can still form, although they are aberrant.</p>
      <p>It appears likely that <italic>palladin</italic> is a proto-oncogene. The protein is overexpressed in sporadic pancreatic cancer, and even in the normal-appearing tissue adjacent to the cancer. The molecular events that cause this overexpression are unknown. Copy number in the <italic>palladin</italic> region (4q32â34) has not been reported to be abnormal (either gains or losses) in previous comparative genomic hybridization analyses [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The copy number analysis that we performed in the precancerous tissue of Family X members revealed two copies of the gene in every sample tested. These findings make it less likely that palladin overexpression is achieved through amplification. Rather, palladin levels might be elevated through point mutations, such as the one in Family X, or through other mechanisms, such as promoter region changes, epigenetic changes, or regulatory factor alterations. It is also likely that palladin does not act alone. The vast majority of pancreatic cancers have activation of the <italic>K-ras</italic> oncogene, including in Family X [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The idea that <italic>palladin</italic> and <italic>K-ras</italic> may work together is an interesting conjecture. Both of the encoded proteins regulate normal cytoskeletal activity, and the joint overexpression and activation of these genes might induce inescapable failure of normal cytoskeleton function.</p>
      <p>Pancreatic cancer biology has been difficult to probe. Although genetic defects associated with pancreatic cancer have been described, a cohesive explanation of pancreatic neoplastic progression is lacking. The concept that the cytoskeleton could play a key role in pancreatic cancer formation is compelling. The critical features that underlie cancer, including nuclear atypia, loss of cellular polarity, altered cell morphology, increased mobility, and invasion into surrounding structures, are all linked to the dynamic behavior of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, altered cytoskeletal tension can distort the attached nuclear envelope, rearranging chromatin/gene positions, subjecting DNA to increased mutations, and inducing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="pmed-0030516-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our data support a key role for <italic>palladin</italic> in the formation of sporadic pancreatic cancer and precancer; moreover an inherited mutation in the <italic>palladin</italic> gene leads to a highly penetrant autosomal dominant form of familial pancreatic cancer. However, the work described is limited to one familial pancreatic cancer kindredâit will be interesting to evaluate additional familial pancreatic cancer kindreds for mutational changes in palladin. The work is also limited in terms of understanding the role of palladin in sporadic pancreatic cancer. It seems unlikely that the P239S germline mutation will be a useful tool in genetic testing for pancreatic cancer risk in individuals without a strong family history of pancreatic cancer.</p>
      <p>Many questions remain. Do somatic <italic>palladin</italic> mutations play a role in pancreatic cancer? How is the gene activated in the sporadic setting? Are other binding partners of palladin abnormally expressed or mutated in pancreatic cancer (sporadic or familial)? How does palladin interact with the products of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in known pancreatic cancer pathways? Answers to these questions are crucial to improved methods of early detection and develop new treatments for this devastating disease.</p>
