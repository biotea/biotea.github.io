      <abstract>
        <p>Primary Familial Brain Calcification (PFBC), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive pericapillary calcifications, has recently been linked to heterozygous mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> genes. Here, we functionally analyzed several of these mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>. All six analyzed <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations led to complete loss of PDGF-B function either through abolished protein synthesis or through defective binding and/or stimulation of PDGF-RÎ². The three analyzed <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations had more diverse consequences. Whereas PDGF-RÎ² autophosphorylation was almost totally abolished in the <italic>PDGFRB</italic> L658P mutation, the two sporadic <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations R987W and E1071V caused reductions in protein levels and specific changes in the intensity and kinetics of PLCÎ³ activation, respectively. Since at least some of the <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations were predicted to act through haploinsufficiency, we explored the consequences of reduced <italic>Pdgfb</italic> or <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> transcript and protein levels in mice. Heterozygous <italic>Pdgfb</italic> or <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> knockouts, as well as double <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> mice did not develop brain calcification, nor did <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup><italic>redeye/redeye</italic></sup> mice, which show a 90% reduction of PDGFRÎ² protein levels. In contrast, <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> mice, which have altered tissue distribution of PDGF-B protein due to loss of a proteoglycan binding motif, developed brain calcifications. We also determined pericyte coverage in calcification-prone and non-calcification-prone brain regions in <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> mice. Surprisingly and contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the calcification-prone brain regions in <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> mice model had a higher pericyte coverage and a more intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) compared to non-calcification-prone brain regions. While our findings provide clear evidence that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> or <italic>PDGFRB</italic> cause PFBC, they also demonstrate species differences in the threshold levels of PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling that protect against small-vessel calcification in the brain. They further implicate region-specific susceptibility factor(s) in PFBC pathogenesis that are distinct from pericyte and BBB deficiency.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The role of the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFRs) has been extensively studied in the developing organism [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Of the two prototypical PDGFRs, PDGF-RÎ± and PDGF-RÎ², the latter has been especially implicated in blood vessel formation and early hematopoiesis. PDGF-RÎ² signaling, initiated by the secretion of PDGF-B ligand by endothelial cells, is paramount for the recruitment of PDGF-RÎ² positive vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes during angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In mice, homozygous knockouts of either receptor or ligand display widespread vascular alterations leading to perinatal death [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Heterozygous knockouts, on the contrary, bear no or subtle phenotypic changes [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>In comparison, the pathogenic roles of PDGFs are still poorly understood. Regarding PDGF-B, increased PDGF-RÎ² signaling has been demonstrated in diseases like cancer, vascular inflammation, and tissue fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Focal uncontrolled PDGF-RÎ² signaling due to somatic genetic aberrations has severe consequences in humans, playing a causative role in diseases such as <italic>dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], gastric cancer and leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, infantile myofibromatosis (IMF), a disease characterized by proliferative fibrous tumors during childhood, was linked to putative gain-of-function germ-line mutations in <italic>PDGFRB</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The simultaneous discovery that mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> can also cause primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) demonstrates new functions of PDGF-RÎ² signaling that could not have been predicted based on existing knowledge about PDGF-B/ PDGF-RÎ² functions, demonstrating that there is still much to be learnt about PDGF biology [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>PFBC, previously referred to as Fahrâs disease or idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), is a neurological disease characterized by age-dependent perivascular calcifications in the brain and clinically heterogeneous symptoms ranging from Parkinsonism to cognitive impairment [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This rare disorder has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The first PFGC mutation in either <italic>PDGFB</italic> or <italic>PDGFRB</italic> to be described was the L658P (c.1973T&gt;C) missense mutation in the protein kinase catalytic domain of PDGF-RÎ², which segregated with the disease in a large family with 13 PFBC patients [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Following this finding, two additional and potentially pathogenic mutations in the C-terminal domain of <italic>PDGFRB</italic>, R987W (c.2959C&gt;T), and E1071V (c.3212A&gt;T), were found in sporadic cases [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lately, a R695C (c.2083C&gt;T) mutation was described in a single patient from an autopsy series of PFBC [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further strengthening the link between PFBC and PDGF-B/ PDGF-RÎ² signaling, six different nonsense and missense mutations in the gene encoding PDGF-B were identified in six PFBC families of different ancestry [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A seventh nonsense mutation was reported in a sporadic PFBC case [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These mutations include two missense mutations in the initiation and in the stop codons, M1? (c.3G&gt;A) and *242Yext*89 (c.726G&gt;C), the latter resulting in a 89 amino acid extension; one L9R (c.26T&gt;G) missense mutation in the signal peptide; and one missense and three nonsense mutations in the sequence coding for the growth factor domain (L119P (c.356T&gt;C); Q145* (c.433C&gt;T); Q147* (c.439C&gt;T) and R149* (c.445C&gt;T), respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recently, a heterozygous intragenic deletion in <italic>PDGFB</italic> involving exons 2â5 of <italic>PDGFB</italic> was described in a sporadic PFBC patient [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> provides an overview of all <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations.</p>

      <p>The predicted deleterious consequences of the nonsense mutations identified in <italic>PDGFB</italic> and the dual involvement of <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> led to the assumption that all PFBC mutations were loss-of-function [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two recent reports showed that some of the <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations described in PFBC indeed cause defective receptor autophosphorylation, protein stability and/or downstream signaling [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, consequences of the <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations found in PFBC cases have previously not been analyzed. Interestingly, mice carrying hypomorphic <italic>Pdgfb</italic> alleles where PDGF-B retention motif has been deleted (<italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> mice) develop brain calcifications that show age-related expansion [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>While there is a link between impairment of PDGF-B signaling and familial PFBC, it is unclear what kind and extent of impairment that is required to trigger PFBC. Since defective PDGFB signaling also leads to severely reduced pericyte counts and a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier in the adult mouse brain, we previously hypothesized a causal relationship between these defects and the observed brain calcifications. However, it remains possible that the pericyte/BBB deficiencies and brain calcifications represent independent consequences of impaired PDGF-B signaling. Whereas all human <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations described to-date are dominant, and at least some of them able to act through haploinsufficiency, the <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> mouse model of PFBC is clearly acting differently. We therefore characterized human <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Using biochemical and cellular approaches, we analyzed the effects of the point mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> on expression and secretion of PDGF-B, activation of PDGF-RÎ², and actin reorganization in primary human pericytes. We confirmed and complemented previous findings on the effects of L658P, R987W and E1071V mutations in <italic>PDGFRB</italic> by assessing receptor tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, activation of downstream signal transduction cascades and cell migration. Moreover, we analyzed the consequences of different degrees of <italic>Pdgfb</italic> and/or <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> genetic insufficiency on pericyte coverage and blood-brain barrier integrity in mice.</p>

<italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations are null or loss-of-function mutations</title>
        <p>To study the functional consequences of <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations described in PFBC (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), cDNA sequences carrying the different mutations identified in six PFBC families were introduced into the pcDNA3.1 vector, transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and after G-418 selection, stably expressing clones were generated. Wild-type <italic>PDGFB</italic> cDNA and empty pcDNA3.1 vector served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In order to assess the expression and secretion of mutant PDGF-B, transfected cells were lysed for RNA or protein extraction. In separated experiments, serum-free conditioned medium was collected and analyzed.</p>
        <p>All <italic>PDGFB</italic> constructs produced comparable levels of <italic>PDGFB</italic> mRNA in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To assess protein expression, a polyclonal anti-PGDF-B antibody was used in Western blotting of cell lysates. Wild-type PDGF-B was detected as a major â14-kDa and a minor 25-kDa species probably representing fully and partially proteolytically processed PDGF-B chains, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, arrowheads) [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among the expression vectors expressing mutated PDGF-B, PDGF-B antibodies detected specific PDGF-B products only from the initiation and stop codon mutants, respectively (M1? and *242Yext*89). The â21â22 kDa PDGF-B protein in M1?-transfected cells (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, arrow in second lane) might be explained by an alternative translational start site. Of the several in-frame ATG codons that occur up- and downstream of the native ATG, the M32 in the PDGF-B precursor would generate a 158 amino acid-long product with a MW of â21.5 kDa (if no further N-terminal or C-terminal processing occurs). The â30 kDa-protein generated by the *242Yext*89 mutation (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, arrow in eighth lane), has a size that would be predicted from an 89 residue-long C-terminal extension of a precursor protein in which N-terminal processing occurred normally (Figs <xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Since the PDGF-B precursor protein is known to be differentially processed depending on whether it is routed for secretion or degradation [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we did not address the structure of the intracellular mutant PDGF-B proteins further, but instead focused on the presence of a secreted biologically active PDGF-B protein. None of the other constructs produced any detectable PDGF-B protein (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

Wild-type (WT) <italic>PDGFB</italic>-expressing construct and empty vector (pcDNA) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. mRNA levels are shown as fold increase over basal expression of PDGF-B in HEK cells. 18s Ribosomal RNA was used for normalization.

Arrows indicate specific bands migrating slower due to a mutation-induced size shift. Non-specific bands in the background are marked with asterisks. (C) ELISA assay for detection of PDGF-BB in conditioned medium of stably transfected HEK cells. HEK cells overexpressing the different PFBC mutations were serum-starved for 24 hours prior to collection of their growth medium.

Western blot of autophosphorylation of PDGF-RÎ² in human brain pericytes (HBP). HBPs were serum-starved overnight, cooled on ice and their medium replaced by either cooled conditioned medium from B-C, or cooled pericyte medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (right lane). After 1 hour-incubation on ice, cells were lysed and immunoblots were performed on duplicate membranes using anti-phospho-PDGF-RÎ² (Y771) and anti-total PDGF-RÎ² (28E1) antibodies.</p>

        <p>Using a PDGF-RÎ²-binding based ELISA to measure PDGF-BB concentration in the conditioned media, we found that only the stop codon mutation (*242Yext*89) yielded detectable amounts of secreted PDGF-BB (2.05 Â± 0.64 ng/ml), however at 50-fold lower levels than in wild-type <italic>PDGFB</italic>-transfected HEKs (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). To assess the ability of the stop codon mutant (*242Yext*89) to activate PDGF-RÎ², and to rule out the presence of functional, yet undetected, PDGF-BB in the supernatant from mutant-transfected HEKs, serum-starved human brain pericytes (HBPs) were exposed to conditioned medium collected from HEK cells expressing different PDGFB mutants. While recombinant PDGF-BB and conditioned medium from wild-type <italic>PDGFB</italic>-transfected HEKs induced detectable PDGF-RÎ² phosphorylation (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> first and last lane, respectively), media from all PDGFB mutant-transfected, as well as the empty vector-transfected, HEKs failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRÎ² above background levels (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> lanes 2â8 and 9, respectively). Likewise, conditioned media from HEK cells expressing the PFBC <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations failed to induce rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143407.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In marked contrast, conditioned medium from wild-type <italic>PDGFB</italic>-transfected HEKs, or PDGF-BB at concentrations as low as 2 ng/ml, induced a profound reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in HBPs (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Actin remodeling anifested as a loss of stress fibers and the formation of peripheral and circular ruffles, the latter being one of the earliest, most sensitive and specific cellular events following PDGF-BB stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

        <p>In conclusion, all six analyzed <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations lead to a complete abolishment of a functional PDGF-B protein when expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> individually and in the absence of wild-type PDGF-B. Additionally, most of the mutations appeared to cause a complete loss of PDGF-B protein production (i.e. <italic>null</italic> mutations), suggesting that <italic>PDGFB</italic> haploinsufficiency could be a sufficient cause of PFBC (overview in <xref rid="pone.0143407.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

        <p>To study the functional consequences of <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations, pcDNA3.1 constructs containing 3 different <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations identified in PFBC patients (L658P, R987W and E1071V, <xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) were transfected into porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells.

        <p>Stable transfection of <italic>PDGFRB</italic> constructs into PAE cells resulted in <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mRNA production, while <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mRNA was undetectable in the empty vector control (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). There was no significant difference in <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mRNA levels between the different constructs, indicating similar transfection and transcription efficiencies between expression vectors encoding mutant or wild-type <italic>PDGFRB</italic>. The relative PDGF-RÎ² protein expression level was assessed by Western blotting. The KD and R987W PDGF-RÎ² mutants yielded a significantly weaker signal (40 and 15%, respectively) as compared with wild-type PDGF-RÎ², whereas the expression level of L658P and E1071V PDGF-RÎ² mutants did not differ from wild-type PDGF-RÎ². Proteasome and lysosome inhibitors (MG-132 and chloroquine, respectively) did not significantly increase the amount of PDGF-RÎ² R987W protein, suggesting that the lower protein level was not due to increased turnover of the protein (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

We assessed four of these (Y751, Y771, Y1009 and Y1021). PDGF-BB treatment of wild-type <italic>PDGFRB</italic>-transfected cells induced a strong phosphorylation of PDGF-RÎ² in all four tested tyrosine residues. Conversely, there was no detectable phosphorylation of KD PDGF-RÎ², despite a total PDGF-RÎ² protein signal was equivalent to the wild-type condition (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143407.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Assessment of PFBC PDGF-RÎ² mutants showed that similar to the KD condition, the L658P mutant displayed a nearly complete abolition of the phospho-PDGF-RÎ² signal following PDGF-BB treatment in all tested tyrosine residues.

Interestingly, cells expressing R987W and E1071V PDGF-RÎ² mutants did not show differences from cells expressing wild-type PDGF-RÎ² in scratch wound assay (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and 6D</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143407.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>).</p>

        <p>Whereas most of the <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations in PFBC lead to complete loss of PDGF-B protein synthesizing capacity from the mutant <italic>PDGFB</italic> allele, the mode(s) of inactivation of PDGF-RÎ² encoded by the <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations remains unclear. Since the mutant PDGF-RÎ² proteins are expressed, they may, in principle, work as dominant-negative proteins. Assuming that only PDGF-RÎ² dimers consisting of two wild-type subunits have the capacity to signal, a dominant-negative mutant would reduce total signaling strength by a maximum of 75% [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

While these mice constitute mouse models of PFBC, we suspected that the degree of PDGF-B signaling impairment in those models exceeds the one in human PFBC.</p>
        <p>In order to more closely mimic the degree of loss of PDGF-RÎ² signaling deduced from our analysis of the mutant human PDGF-B and PDGF-RÎ² proteins, we investigated other mouse models of <italic>Pdgfb</italic> and/or <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> hypomorphism.

This situation combines the features of the <italic>PDGFB</italic> haploinsufficiency observed with most <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations with the decreased PDGF-RÎ² expression seen in the R987W mutant. The combined loss of 50% of PDGF-B and 50% of PDGF-RÎ² would also be predicted to lead to a 75% total reduction of PDGF-RÎ² signaling strength, thereby mimicking a putative dominant-negative PDGF-RÎ² mutant.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>PFBC is an age-dependent neurological disease characterized by the formation of granular calcifications in specific regions of brain parenchyma [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since the first autopsy study in 1850 [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], strong evidence have accumulated that PFBC is primarily a vascular disease. Located around the brain capillaries [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], most calcified nodules seem to form within the vascular basement membrane, possibly nucleating in the pericytes [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The identification of familial monogenic forms of PFBC resulting from mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> strengthened the link between PFBC and vasculature. However, the extent to which human mutations alter PDGF-B signaling and impact pericyte recruitment, maintenance and function has remained unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that the six <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations analyzed are all <italic>null</italic> or loss-of-function alleles. We confirm that at least one of the <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutation (L658P) results in a complete, or nearly complete, loss of signaling capacity [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We also demonstrate that, comparable degrees of genetic haploinsufficiency in mice did not cause brain calcification, and moreover, that a more pronounced (â90%) decrease in PDGF-RÎ² protein level also did not cause brain calcification. Somewhat surprisingly, these situations of limited PDGF-RÎ² signaling did also not cause significant decreases in pericyte coverage or impairment of the BBB (see overview in <xref rid="pone.0143407.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations</title>
        <p>
<italic>PDGFB</italic> encodes a PDGF-B protein that makes up a biologically active PDGF-BB dimer through disulfide bridging of cysteine residues 124 and 133 [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Heterozygous <italic>PDGFB</italic> mutations can impact PDGF-BB processing and function by abolishing protein synthesis or yielding an inactive protein that does not interfere with wild-type PDGF-B processing. This would lead to a theoretical 50% decrease in PDGF-BB through haploinsufficiency without compensatory mechanisms. Indeed, doubly heterozygous <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> mice lack compensatory upregulation of mRNA from the intact alleles (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). The recently described intragenic deletion involving 4 out of 6 exons in <italic>PDGFB</italic> probably leads to a pure haploinsufficiency [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The missense mutation in the signal peptide (L9R) probably functions as a heterozygous null as well, because an N-terminal processing-deficient PDGF-B would fail to be translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum for further processing and secretion.</p>
        <p>However, an inactive PDGF-B, which retains the ability to dimerize is potentially dominant-negative, and would be predicted to cause a 75% decrease in active PDGF-BB levels. The nonsense mutations (Q145*, Q147* and R149*), which are all situated downstream of the cysteine residues engaged in inter-chain bridging (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), could potentially retain the ability to dimerize, as could the M1? and *242Yext*89 mutant proteins. While an intracellular protein product was only detectable for the two latter (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), it remains possible that the former mutations do yield a protein product that is either immediately degraded or not recognized by the antibodies. Finally, the missense mutation in the receptor-binding loop (L119P) could hinder binding of the PDGF-B pro-peptide to the mature chain. The corresponding leucine in PDGF-A (L118) was shown to be essential for correct protein folding and secretion [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Placing the PFBC PDGF-B mutations on a ribbon model of PDGF-B indeed suggests that L119 (green in <xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) is located on the outer surface of the L1 loop (grey in <xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), among a large cluster of hydrophobic amino acids similar to L118 in PDGF-A chain.</p>
        <p>Thus, Q145*, Q147*, R149* and L119P may all be unstable proteins that are rapidly targeted for intracellular degradation. In contrast the M1? and *242Yext*89 proteins accumulated intracellularly at levels that were comparable to wild-type PDGF-B, but with abnormal sizes corresponding to alternative translation initiation and C-terminal extension, respectively. A PDGF-RÎ² binding-based ELISA assay detected only the *242Yext*89 product in conditioned cell culture medium, suggesting that if any of the other mutant proteins are secreted, they fail to accumulate to significant levels extracellularly. Finally, although the *242Yext*89 product bound to PDGFRÎ² epitopes in the ELISA assay, it failed to induce any detectable PDGF-RÎ² autophosphorylation or any of the cellular cytoskeletal rearrangements typical for wild-type PDGF-BB. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that all PFBC mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> lead to loss of a functional PDGF-B protein.</p>

<italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations</title>
        <p>Regarding <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations, we confirm and complement recently reported data. In their recent study, Sanchez-Contreras <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], transfected HeLa cells with different <italic>PDGFRB</italic>-expressing constructs, two carrying the L658P and R987W mutations [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and two carrying two novel R695C and A1096V mutations identified in autopsy material stored in a brain bank of sporadic PFBC patients [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While the A1096V mutant behaved like the wild-type and was assumed to represent a benign variant, the L658P and R695C mutations resulted in defective PDGFRÎ² autophosphorylation. The R987W mutation led to decreased levels of protein [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We herein confirm the reported changes in L658P and R987W using two different cell types, HEK and PAE cells, the latter of which allowed us to assess also relevant cellular responses to PDGF-RÎ² phosphorylation. <italic>PDGFRB</italic>-transfected PAE cells are a model of choice to study PDGF receptor function because they lack endogenous PDGF receptors, but contain all the necessary downstream effectors, and they respond similar to endogenously PDGF-RÎ²-expressing fibroblasts by actin reorganization and chemotaxis upon PDGF-RÎ² stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
        <p>The L658P mutant lacked signaling ability, most likely because the new proline residue is close to the ATP-binding pocket in a highly conserved region (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0143407.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the other two mutants, R987W and E1071V, our results are more ambiguous.

<sup><italic>redeye/redeye</italic></sup>) has no detectable vessel-associated calcifications (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Alternatively, the R987W mutated receptor is disease-causing through its impaired signaling potential, as seen in the reduced activation of ERK1/2, AKT, and especially PLCÎ³ (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Indeed, we observed reduced phosphorylation levels of residue Y1009 in R987W (<xref rid="pone.0143407.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), which, together with Y1021, is necessary for PLCÎ³ phosphorylation and activation [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. PDGF-BB is a potent and selective stimulator of inorganic phosphate transport in vascular smooth muscle cells, an effect principally mediated by PLCÎ³ [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This possible link between PDGF-RÎ², PLCÎ³ and phosphate transport deserves further investigation, since mutations in the inorganic phosphate transporter Pit-2 (SLC20A2) [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and the phosphate exporter XPR1 [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] are also linked to PFBC.</p>
        <p>While R987W affects a phylogenetically conserved arginine residue in the C-terminal domain, the E1071V mutation is situated in the phylogenetically variable C-terminus of PDGF-RÎ² (<xref rid="pone.0143407.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). In addition, its effect on downstream signaling is less pronounced than R987W, suggesting that this mutation might represent a benign polymorphism. Interestingly, although all three <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations displayed significantly less membrane ruffles when stimulated with PDGF-BB, this did not translate into impaired migration of PAE cells expressing R987W or E1071V PDGF-RÎ² mutants as measured <italic>in vitro</italic> in a scratch âwound healingâ assay (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). One possible explanation for this is that endothelial migration is regulated mostly though ERK1/2 and Akt activity [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and to a lesser extend through PLCÎ³ activity.</p>

        <title>How does impaired PDGF-B/ PDGF-RÎ² signaling cause PFBC?</title>
        <p>Our analysis establishes that mutations in <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> associated with PFBC cause loss or reduced formation or function of the gene product. However, it remains unclear how impaired PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling causes brain calcification. The <italic>PDGFB</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> mutations described so far are dominant heterozygous mutations. Homozygosity for the same mutations may potentially cause pre- or perinatal lethality, similar to the situation in mouse homozygous knockouts [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

<sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> mice due to the combined 50% reduction of PDGF-B and PDGFRÎ² levels, and in the case of L658P, by an expected dominant-negative effect in receptor dimers. In a further attempt to mimic the L658P mutation in mice we investigated <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup><italic>redeye/redeye</italic></sup> mice, which display a 75% reduction of <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> transcript levels [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and a 90% reduction in PDGF-RÎ² protein levels (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Intriguingly, also <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup><italic>redeye/redeye</italic></sup> mice failed to develop brain calcifications.</p>
        <p>Thus, our data suggest that humans and mice differ with regard to the threshold levels of PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling required to protect against brain calcification. Although PDGF-RÎ² signaling levels have not been directly measured in <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> and <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup>;<italic>R26P</italic>
<sup>+/0</sup> mice, which develop brain calcifications [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we conclude that it is likely lower compared to <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup><italic>redeye/redeye</italic></sup> and <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> mice. This conclusion is based on analysis of brain vessel coverage of pericytes, which is dependent on PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling. We previously reported a correlation between the degree of pericyte deficiency in brain microvessels, BBB impairment and the extent and onset age of brain calcification [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our present analysis, we found that the pericyte coverage was 70â80% in <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup>;<italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup>+/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice (<xref rid="pone.0143407.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>), a ratio comparable to the previously analyzed <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup>;<italic>R26P</italic>
<sup>+/+</sup> mice (72% pericyte coverage compared to normal), which also lack brain calcifications [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Somewhat surprisingly, <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>
<sup><italic>redeye/redeye</italic></sup> mice did not display any measurable reduction in pericyte coverage despite a 90% reduction of PDGF-RÎ² protein levels. This may suggest that in mice, PDGF-B levels are more critically limiting for pericyte recruitment than PDGF-RÎ² levels.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results show that in mice, more severely reduced levels of PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling are required in order to trigger brain calcifications than in humans. It is possible that the same holds true for pericyte and BBB deficiency. Histopathological signs of BBB defects have been reported in one PFBC case [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but until now, pericyte densities have not been assessed in human PFBC cases. Thus, it remains unclear if pericyte loss and BBB defects correlate with brain calcification also in human PFBC.</p>
        <p>While our results further strengthen the correlation between brain calcification, and defective PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling, pericyte loss and BBB impairment at a <italic>global</italic> level, we paradoxically did get opposite results when we analyzed the specific anatomical regions in <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup><italic>ret/ret</italic></sup> mice that develop brain calcifications in comparison with regions that do not. Here, we found that the calcification-prone regions had higher pericyte coverage and lower degree of BBB leakage than calcification-<italic>non</italic>-prone regions. Whereas these data do not rule out a role for pericyte loss and BBB impairment in brain calcification, it shows that these changes by themselves are not sufficient to cause microvascular calcification in any brain region, but that other region-specific factor(s) must also be involved. In this context it is interesting to note that the deep brain regions, such as the basal ganglia in humans, appear particularly sensitive to develop calcifications in conjunction with systemic mineral imbalance or aging in humans [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Current mouse models of PFBC also do not distinguish between the developmental role and a putative homeostatic function of PDGF-B signaling the brain vasculature. For example, it is possible that impaired PDGF-B/PDGF-RÎ² signaling accelerates an age-dependent phenotypic change in pericytes that ultimately provokes the formation of microvascular calcification. Senescence and damage to vascular smooth muscle cells has been shown to cause vascular calcification of peripheral vessels [<xref rid="pone.0143407.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These and other questions should be possible to address using inducible <italic>Pdgfb</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> ablation as well as by crossing current models of PFBC, such as <italic>Pdgfb</italic>
<sup>ret/ret</sup>, into different sensitized or protective genetic backgrounds, and by exposing them to different systemic challenges, such as the induction of mineral imbalances.</p>

        <p>Conditioned medium was prepared from serum-starved HEK293 cell transfected either with an empty-vector or with vectors encoding wild-type or mutant <italic>PDGFB</italic>. After 24 hours medium was collected, centrifuged and the supernatant was stored at -80Â°C until further use. Recombinant human PDGF-BB was purchased from R&amp;D Systems. For PDGFRÎ² autophosphorylation assays, cells were starved in serum-free medium overnight and cooled on ice for 15 min before addition of 40 ng/ml PDGF-BB, conditioned medium collected from HEK cells transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant PDGF-Bs, or PDGF-BB dilution buffer only. Cells were kept on ice for 1 hour before lysis. For time-course analysis, PDGF-BB was directly added to the normal growth medium at 37Â°C to reach a concentration of 40 ng/ml. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and snap-frozen at different time-points. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 2 mM orthovanadate and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals).</p>
        <p>Unless stated otherwise, equal protein amounts from whole-cell extract were subjected to SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Thermo Scientific, Pierce). Proteins were visualized by incubating membranes with specific antibodies: rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGF-RÎ² (28E1, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-PDGF-RÎ² (Y751), phospho-PDGF-RÎ² (Y771), phospho-PDGF-RÎ² (Y1009) and phospho-PDGF-RÎ² (Tyr 1021) (Cell Signaling Technologies); rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technologies); rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technologies); rabbit anti-phospho-PLCÎ³1 (Tyr783) (Cell Signaling Technologies); rabbit anti-PDGF-BB antibody (AbCam).

Deviation from this value was analyzed with one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (mean = 100; two-tailed). For the downstream signaling study, the ratio to Î²-actin signal was calculated for each pathway and expressed as a percentage of the condition in which wild-type PDGF-RÎ² was treated with PDGF-BB for 5 minutes, which was arbitrarily set to 100% in each individual experiment.

Subsequently, the cells were serum-starved overnight, cooled on ice for 15 min, and medium was replaced by either conditioned medium or fresh medium containing PDGF-BB. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were transferred back to the 37Â°C incubator for 15 min, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 3.75% formaldehyde/PBS. Phalloidin staining was performed by incubating the cells in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) - 0.5% Triton X-100 /PBS for 1 hour, then in 2.5% PromoFluor 488-phalloidin (PromoKine) - 0.01% Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) - 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min. Cells were post-fixed for 2 min in 3.75% formaldehyde before mounting. Pictures were taken with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using a 63x objective (N/A 1.40). For quantification of membrane ruffles in PAE cells, 1 stitched image consisting of 9 adjacent images (3x3) was taken per condition (at 20x magnification, N/A 0.8). Ruffles were manually counted and the total ruffle count was normalized over the total amount of cells in the image.

<italic>In vitro</italic> scratch wound assays were performed on stably transfected PAE cells grown until confluence in 96-well ImageLock Microplates (Essen Bioscience). After a 2 hour-starvation in serum-free medium, a single wound was made down the center of each well using the 96-well WoundMaker (Essen Bioscience). Cells were washed in PBS and then stimulated with 40 ng/ml PDGF-BB or vehicle. Wound images were then automatically acquired and registered -by the IncuCyte Zoom live-cell imager (Essen Bioscience) for every 2h until the wound was healed. Data were then analyzed in relative wound density/time. Relative wound density measures the spatial cell density in the wound area relative to the spatial cell density outside of the wound area at every time point. It is designed to be 0% at t = 0, and 100% when the cell density inside the wound is the same as the cell density outside the initial wound. This metric is calculated by custom algorithms, which are part of the IncuCyte software package (Essen BioScience).</p>

          <p>Overview demonstrating that the supernatant of mutant PDGF-B producing HEK293 cells does not induce circular ruffles in HBP cells. In addition, additional positive controls with exogenous PDGF-BB (40 ng and 100 ng per ml) are shown. Cyan: DAPI. Green: Alexa 488 conjugated phalloidin. Scale bar: 30 Î¼m. Arrowheads point at representative ruffles.</p>
