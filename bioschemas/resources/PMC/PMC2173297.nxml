        <p>Multiprotein complexes are key determinants of Golgi apparatus structure and its capacity for intracellular transport and glycoprotein modification. Three complexes that have previously been partially characterized include (a) the Golgi transport complex (GTC), identified in an in vitro membrane transport assay, (b) the ldlCp complex, identified in analyses of CHO cell mutants with defects in Golgi-associated glycosylation reactions, and (c) the mammalian Sec34 complex, identified by homology to yeast Sec34p, implicated in vesicular transport. We show that these three complexes are identical and rename them the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. The COG complex comprises four previously characterized proteins (Cog1/ldlBp, Cog2/ldlCp, Cog3/Sec34, and Cog5/GTC-90), three homologues of yeast Sec34/35 complex subunits (Cog4, -6, and -8), and a previously unidentified Golgi-associated protein (Cog7). EM of ldlB and ldlC mutants established that COG is required for normal Golgi morphology. âDeep etchâ EM of purified COG revealed an â¼37-nm-long structure comprised of two similarly sized globular domains connected by smaller extensions. Consideration of biochemical and genetic data for mammalian COG and its yeast homologue suggests a model for the subunit distribution within this complex, which plays critical roles in Golgi structure and function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The eukaryotic secretory pathway consists of a set of membrane-bound compartments through which proteins move in transport vesicles or larger transport intermediates (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rothman, 1994</xref>). Vesicular transport from one compartment to the next can be divided into four sequential phases: vesicle budding; movement to the next compartment; association of the vesicle with the acceptor compartment; and fusion of vesicle and acceptor membranes (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rothman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mellman and Warren, 2000</xref>). For the Golgi apparatus, the transport structures may be the Golgi cisternae themselves, as some secretory cargo moves through the Golgi without exiting the stack in vesicles (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Many Golgi proteins, such as glycosylation enzymes, are maintained in a nonuniform steady-state distribution through the cisternae. These proteins must be transported to their sites of residence and then either be retained there or, if they move beyond them, retrieved by retrograde vesicular transport (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Waters, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, all transport steps appear to involve the movement of small vesicles (either carrying cargo in the anterograde or resident enzymes in the retrograde direction) between larger membrane compartments (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have led to the identification of several multisubunit peripheral membrane protein complexes that are thought to be involved in membrane trafficking and/or compartment function, including the Sec6/8 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Grindstaff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 1999</xref>), the TRAPP I (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sacher et al., 2001</xref>), and the Sec34/35 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">VanRheenen et al., 1998</xref>) complexes. The yeast Sec34/35 complex has eight subunits (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>), is localized to the Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Spelbrink and Nothwehr, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>), and has been suggested to be involved in anterograde ER to Golgi (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">VanRheenen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>), retrograde intra-Golgi (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>), and endosome to Golgi (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Spelbrink and Nothwehr, 1999</xref>) traffic. A mammalian Sec34-containing complex has also been identified and implicated in Golgi protein trafficking (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Suvorova et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Another complex, called the Golgi transport complex (GTC),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> was isolated because of its ability to stimulate an in vitro intra-Golgi transport assay (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>). It is a hetero-oligomeric Golgi-localized complex of â¼800 kD, comprising proteins between 70 and 110 kD. The 90-kD subunit of GTC, GTC-90, was identified and a cDNA encoding the protein was cloned.</p>
      <p>The ldlCp complex was discovered during the analysis of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)âdefective CHO cell mutants, ldlB and ldlC (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Krieger et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>). The ldlB- and ldlC-null mutants, which are viable, exhibit defects in multiple Golgi-associated reactions that result in the abnormal processing of the LDLR and many other glycoconjugates (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kingsley et al., 1986</xref>). The defects are not due to drastic disruptions in secretion or endocytosis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kingsley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Reddy and Krieger, 1989</xref>). The ldlCp protein (â¼80 kD) is a component of a large peripheral Golgi complex whose size and Golgi-association are dependent on ldlBp (â¼110 kD) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>), which suggested that they are components of the same complex.</p>
      <p>Similarities in the sizes, locations, and subunits of the ldlCp complex and GTC suggested that they might be identical (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>). We have explored this possibility through identification of all the subunits of purified GTC and examination of the physical association of the proteins in tissues and wild-type and mutant cultured cells. We have found that GTC and the ldlCp complexes are the same, and it appears to be to the mammalian homologue of the yeast Sec34/35 complex. This is consistent with the report of <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro (2001)</xref>(which appeared during the preparation of this manuscript), which showed that the yeast homologue of GTC-90, Cod4p, is a subunit of the Sec34/35 complex. We suggest that this mammalian complex be called conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, and its subunits be designated Cog1â8. We have also examined by EM the structure of the COG complex and the effects of the null mutations in ldlB (Cog1) and ldlC (Cog2) on Golgi structure.</p>

        <title>Improved COG complex purification</title>
        <p>We modified the previously described (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>) method of COG purification from bovine brain to improve the yield (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) and followed the purification by anti-Cog5 immunoblotting. During the purification, two peaks of Cog5 were resolved by hydroxyapatite chromatography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Similar complexes were also seen in CHO cell lysates not subjected to the multiple purification steps (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). We purified the protein eluting in the second peak because it represented the larger complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), here defined as COG. It is not clear if both complexes are present in vivo or if the small complex was generated during cell/tissue lysis, or if the peak 1 material, which is slightly smaller in size than COG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), shares COG components other than Cog5.</p>

        <title>Identification of subunits of the mammalian COG complex</title>
        <p>Purified COG subunits were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel individually (Cog1, -2, -6, and -8) or in pairs (Cog3/Cog5 and Cog4/Cog7) and sequenced by mass spectrometry. Eight protein components were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). All except Cog7 (see below) had been previously suggested to be components of various mammalian Golgi-associated complexes. The four individually excised proteins were identified: Cog1 as ldlBp; Cog2 as ldlCp; and Cog6 and -8 as the homologues of yeast Cod2p and Dor1p, respectively. One pair, Cog3/Cog5, was identified as the mammalian Sec34 and GTC-90; the other, Cog4/Cog7, was found to be the homologue of yeast Cod1p (Cog4) and a previously unidentified protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). The individual bands in the Cog3/Cog5 doublet were identified as Sec34 and GTC-90 based on immunoblotting (unpublished data). The assignments of the bands in the Cog4/Cog7 doublet were based on the predicted molecular weights of their human homologues and will require verification. The presence of Cog1, -2, and -3 in addition to Cog5 in the purified material was confirmed by immunoblotting partially (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and completely (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A) purified fractions.</p>

        <title>Cog7 is conserved in higher eukaryotes</title>
        <p>The human Cog7 cDNA (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. XM_041725) encodes a protein of 770 residues. Analysis of the human genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/</ext-link>) shows that the Cog7 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 and contains 17 exons. The Paircoil algorithm (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 1995</xref>) detected a potential coiled-coil domain between amino acids 70 and 100 of Cog7, however, the structure remains to be determined. Closely related homologues of Cog7 can be found in numerous vertebrates and invertebrates and several plants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>). However, homologues in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> were not found. Thus, Cog7 joins Cog1 and Cog2 in having no obvious homologue in yeast. The functions of Cog1, -2, and -7 may be performed by other proteins in lower eukaryotes (see Discussion).</p>

        <title>Cog1 and Cog7 are Golgi-associated proteins</title>
        <p>We used immunofluorescence microscopy to locate endogenous Cog1 in CHO cells and Cog7 in HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitopeâtagged Cog7. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A shows that both Cog1 (top) and Cog7 (bottom) colocalized significantly, but not completely, with the Golgi marker mannosidase II in a perinuclear distribution. Similar results have been observed for Cog2 and Cog5 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, like other COG complex components, Cog1 and Cog7 are Golgi associated.</p>

        <title>Verification of the subunit composition of COG</title>
        <p>Copurification of proteins provides strong, but not unequivocal, evidence that the proteins are members of a complex. Therefore, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. COG from rat liver cytosol was immunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A) using an anti-Cog2 antipeptide antibody (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>) in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lane 3) of the immunogenic peptide to block the precipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to COG subunits. All of the COG subunits examined coprecipitated with Cog2 (lane 2) in an anti-Cog2 antibody-specific (compare lanes 1 and 2) and immunogenic peptideâinhibitable (lane 3) fashion. In each precipitation, â¼10% or more of the total cytosolic content of each component (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, lane 4) was recovered (lane 2). Similar results were observed using an anti-Cog1 monoclonal antibody to precipitate the complex from a partially purified sample of bovine brain cytosol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). As expected, the anti-Cog1 antibody did not precipitate Sec8, a component of the Sec6/8 complex (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Thus Cog1, -2, -3, and -5 are present in the same complex, and the GTC, ldlCp, and Sec34 complexes are the same entity.</p>

        <p>The ultrastructure of purified COG was visualized by quick freeze/deep etch/rotary shadow EM (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Heuser, 1983</xref>). The images in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> are 3-D âanaglyphs,â which are best viewed with red/green stereo glasses (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Heuser, 2000</xref>). Samples that were prefixed with glutaraldehyde (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, fixed) were compared with unfixed COG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, unfixed); glutaraldehyde fixation was used to preserve structures that might disassemble on contact with mica (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Heuser, 1989</xref>). However, images of fixed samples must be interpreted with caution, as fixation can introduce structural artifacts due to cross-linking. Most of the images of the fixed samples and many of the unfixed samples suggest that COG is bilobed. In some images, the lobes appeared to be interconnected by thin rods and/or globules. The fixed form was 37 Â± 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 18) nm long. Thus, COG appears to be slightly larger than the size marker thyroglobulin (670 kD; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, leftmost in bottom row). The bilobed appearance of COG looks substantially different than comparable images of the mammalian Sec6/8 complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, first four images in fifth row). The Sec6/8 complex appears to have a large globular or brick-shaped âcoreâ that is surrounded by short extensions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 1998</xref>). Other molecules suitable for comparison in size and shape with COG are shown in the bottom panels of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and are described in its legend.</p>

        <p>About a third of the images of unfixed COG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, unfixed) appeared similar to the fixed samples, whereas the others appeared somewhat heterogeneous and âsplayed.â The splayed images tended to display two globules connected by disordered globular or rod-like connections. The splayed forms ranged up to 50â75 nm long. The overall size of this form was similar to that of a clathrin triskelion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, fourth image in row 5; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Heuser and Kirchhausen, 1985</xref>). Presumably, such splayed forms represent COG complexes partially disassembled by adhesion with mica. Nevertheless, they illustrate that native COG seems to be a group of globular domains interconnected by flexible arms. Additional studies will be required to determine if the native COG within cells is a tightly compacted, bilobed, or a relatively splayed structure.</p>

        <title>Effects of COG mutations on its composition and size and on the structure of the Golgi apparatus</title>
        <p>The Cog1 and Cog2 proteins were initially identified during the analysis of two classes of CHO cell mutants, ldlB and ldlC (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Krieger et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kingsley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>). We used immunoblotting of whole cell lysates to determine the steady-state levels of COG subunits in wild-type and mutant cells, as well as stable transfectants in which the mutants' phenotypes were corrected by transfection with expression vectors encoding either Cog1 (ldlB[<italic>COG1</italic>]) or Cog2 (ldlC[<italic>COG2</italic>]). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A shows that, as previously described (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>), Cog2 was not detected in the ldlC mutant (lane 4), whereas a somewhat greater than wild-type expression level of Cog2 was observed in ldlC[<italic>COG2</italic>] cells. Similar results were obtained for Cog1 expression in wild-type (lane 1), ldlB (lane 2), and ldlB[<italic>COG1</italic>] cells (lane 3), as expected from prior studies (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>). In ldlB cells, the level of Cog5 was significantly lower (lane 2) than in the wild-type (lane 1) or transfectant (lane 3) controls, but the levels of Cog3 and Cog2 were not altered. In contrast, the levels in ldlC cells of Cog1, -3, and -5 were dramatically reduced (lane 4) compared with wild-type (lane 1) or transfected (lane 5) controls. The residual level of Cog5 in ldlC cells (lane 4) was similar to that in ldlB cells (lane 2). The absence of Cog1 (lane 2) or Cog2 (lane 4) did not alter the levels of components of two other complexes involved in secretion, Î²-COP and Sec8 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). Thus, the absence of some COG subunits affected the steady-state levels of other COG components, providing genetic evidence for their interactions. The different effects of the absence of Cog1 and Cog2 on the levels of other COG subunits suggest that Cog1 and Cog2 play distinct roles in the organization of the complex.</p>
        <p>The absence of one or more subunits in a macromolecular assembly, such as COG, should alter the size of the residual complex. We size fractionated wild-type (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, top), ldlB (middle), and ldlC (bottom) cytosols and examined the distribution of the Cog1, -2, -3, and -5 subunits by immunoblotting. In wild-type cytosol, Cog1, -2, -3, and -5 comigrated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, fractions 21 and 22), and we detected a distinct, smaller complex containing Cog5 but not the other immunodetectable COG components (fractions 23â26, compare with <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, peak 1). In ldlB (Cog1) cytosol, the other COG subunits were no longer present in the large complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, fractions 21 and 22; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>). Rather, their mobilities showed, in addition to the Cog5 present in the smaller complex (fractions 23â26), that they were components of an even smaller entity whose size was much larger than that expected for the individual subunits. In the ldlC (Cog2) mutant, where the steady-state levels of total cellular Cog3 and Cog5 were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A), these subunits were no longer found in the large complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, fractions 21 and 22). These data support the conclusion that Cog1, -2, -3, and -5 are components of one large complex. They also show that in CHO cells, as was the case for bovine brain cytosol, some Cog5 was present in a distinct complex that was smaller than COG and did not contain Cog1, -2, and -3. The chromatographic mobility of this smaller Cog5-containing complex was apparently unperturbed by the absence of Cog1 or Cog2.</p>
        <p>The disruptions in the size and composition of COG in ldlB and ldlC mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) are associated with pleiotropic Golgi functional defects (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kingsley et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we examined, by transmission EM, the morphology of the Golgi apparatus in wild-type CHO, ldlB, and ldlC cells and their corresponding phenotypically corrected transfectants (ldlB [<italic>COG</italic>1] and ldlC[<italic>COG2</italic>]). <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> shows that the Golgi morphology in both ldlB and ldlC mutants was abnormal. At least half, and sometimes all, of the identifiable cisternae were dilated in the mutants. These dilated cisternae were not seen in control wild-type cells or transfectants, suggesting that they were related to the functional defects in ldlB and ldlC mutants. Additional studies will be required to determine if the dilated cisternae are located predominantly on the cis or trans sides of the Golgi stack.</p>

        <title>The components of the COG complex</title>
        <p>We characterized the composition, structure, and function of a mammalian conserved oligomeric Golgi-localized protein complex, the COG complex. Purification of COG and identification of its subunits, Cog1â8, showed that some of its polypeptides are known components of the GTC, the ldlCp complex, and the Sec34 complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that COG components (Cog1, -2, -3, and -5) are physically associated. Furthermore, the steady-state levels of some COG subunits (Cog1, -2, -3, and -5) were dramatically reduced in ldlB (Cog1) or ldlC (Cog2) mutants, establishing genetic associations between them. The loss of Cog1 or Cog2 in the mutants also led to a reduction in the sizes of the residual complexes. In addition, seven COG subunits (Cog1â5, -7, and -8) have been localized to the mammalian Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Podos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Suvorova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>; this study). Finally, independent analyses of the yeast Sec34/35 complex (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">VanRheenen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>) show that it too is a hetero-octameric complex, and five of its subunits are close homologues of COG subunits (Cog3â6 and -8) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). The remaining three subunits in the COG and Sec34/35 complex are also likely to be related functionally. Indeed, yeast Sec35p and Cog2 have limited sequence similarity (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>).</p>

      <sec>
        <title>The structure of COG</title>
        <p>Quick freeze/deep etch/rotary shadow EM suggests that COG, at least after fixation with glutaraldehyde, is â¼37 nm long and divided into two almost equally sized lobes (designated A and B, see below). In unfixed specimens, we observed similar bilobed structures and, more frequently, splayed structures with multiple small globular domains connected by relatively flexible extensions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
        <p>Insight into the relationship between the bilobed structure of COG and its subunit composition can be deduced from our studies in combination with studies of the yeast Sec34/35 complex (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). During the COG purification, we noted that Cog5 was present both in COG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, peak 2) and in a smaller complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, peak 1). The smaller complex may represent a fragment of the COG complex (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, lobe B; see below), contain COG subunits in addition to Cog5 (see below), and thus correspond to one of the two lobes seen in the EM images. Because Cog1, -2, and -3 are not part of the Cog5-containing smaller complex, they presumably reside in the other lobe.</p>
        <fig id="fig9" position="float">
          <label>Figure 9.</label>

        </fig>
        <p>Division of COG into two approximately equal-sized lobes, each having four subunits, is consistent with the classification by <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro (2001)</xref> of the yeast Sec34/35 complex's subunits into two groups of four, based on the severity of their mutant phenotypes. The first group, characterized by more severe phenotypes, contains Sec34p, Sec35p, Cod1p, and Cod3p, whereas the other group, distinguished by weaker phenotypes, comprises Dor1p, Cod2p, Cod4p, and Cod5p (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>). We suggest that the stronger and weaker phenotypes are the result of mutations in subunits residing in distinct lobes of the complex; mutations in lobe A produce stronger phenotypes (e.g., <italic>sec34</italic>), and those in lobe B (e.g., <italic>cod4</italic>) give weaker ones (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
        <p>With this assumption we can assign other subunits to the A and B lobes of COG. The weak phenotype of the <italic>cod4</italic> mutant places Cog5/Cod4p in lobe B and consequently Cog1, -2, and -3, which are in the other lobe, in lobe A (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, we propose that the fourth protein in lobe A is Cog4/Cod1p because of the severe <italic>cod1</italic> phenotype (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, the remaining proteins, Cog6â8, must reside in lobe B (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), consistent with the weaker phenotypes of <italic>cod2</italic> and <italic>dor1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>), the yeast counterparts of Cog6 and Cog8. The proposed composition of lobe B is consistent with it potentially representing the smaller Cog5-containing complex in bovine brain and CHO cell cytosols.</p>
        <p>As a consequence of these assignments (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table IV</xref>), we suggest that Cog7 in lobe B is functionally analogous to yeast Cod5p. Lastly, we speculate that (a) Cog2 and yeast Sec35p are functional analogs because of their weak sequence similarities and assignments to the A lobes, and (b) the remaining unpaired subunits, Cog1 and yeast Cod3p in lobe A, are probably functional analogs. (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table IV</xref>). Supporting this, mammalian Cog2 and Cog3, or the corresponding yeast Sec35p and Sec34p, comigrate at a smaller size when Cog1/Cod3p mutant cytosol is gel filtered (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>). Further work will be required to rigorously test this model for COG.</p>

        <title>The function of COG</title>
        <p>Cog1 and Cog2 were originally identified in a genetic screen for mutants that block LDLR activity in CHO cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Krieger et al., 1981</xref>). Analysis of the transport/secretion of the LDLR and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in ldlB and ldlC mutants and in a revertant of ldlC cells bearing an extragenic suppressor of the LDLR-deficient phenotype (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Reddy and Krieger, 1989</xref>) strongly suggested that neither membrane protein transport through the secretory pathway nor normal endocytic cycling are disrupted profoundly. The pleiotropic defects in Golgiâassociated glycosylation reactions in these mutants resulted in abnormally glycosylated, and consequently unstable, LDLRs. The ldlB and ldlC cells have essentially identical defects in numerous medial<italic>-</italic> and trans-Golgiâassociated reactions that affect virtually all protein- (N-linked and O-linked) and lipid-linked glycoconjugates (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kingsley et al., 1986</xref>). The pleiotropic nature of the defects suggested that the mutations might affect the regulation, compartmentalization, transport, or activity of several different Golgi enzymes and/or enzyme substrates, or the internal milieu of the Golgi apparatus. This correlates well with our finding in this study that Golgi cisternae are dilated in these mutants.</p>
        <p>Another COG component, Cog5, was first identified (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>) in an in vitro assay that measures glycosylation of a cargo protein as a consequence of a membrane fusion event (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balch et al., 1984</xref>). The assay is dependent on maintenance of an intraluminal environment that is compatible with glycosylation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hiebsch and Wattenberg, 1992</xref>) and on vesicular transport factors, especially those involved in membrane docking or fusion (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Block et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clary and Rothman, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Waters et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Legesse-Miller et al., 1998</xref>). Although this system was originally thought to measure anterograde vesicle traffic through the Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balch et al., 1984</xref>), it has been suggested (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Love et al., 1998</xref>) that it may in fact measure retrograde traffic of the glycosyltransferase to the cargo and, as such, recapitulate retrograde intra-Golgi traffic. The fact that COG is active in this in vitro system suggests that it may act in docking and/or fusion of vesicles within the Golgi apparatus, possibly including retrograde glycosyltransferase-bearing vesicles.</p>
        <p>Further insight into COG function can be derived from studies of its yeast homologue, the Sec34/35 complex. <italic>sec34</italic> and <italic>sec35</italic> exhibit slow growth, missorting of proteins in the secretory/vacuolar system, defective protein secretion, underglycosylation of proteins, accumulation of vesicles, and dilated membranous compartments (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wuestehube et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Mutations in Sec34/35 complex subunits genetically interact with mutations in components involved in multiple steps of transport to and through the Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">VanRheenen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Spelbrink and Nothwehr, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">VanRheenen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>). Of particular note is the recent observation that Sec34/35 complex components, which are located throughout the Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>), show strong genetic interactions with subunits of the COPI vesicle coat (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>), which is thought to function in retrograde traffic within the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Letourneur et al., 1994</xref>). This prompted <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al. (2002)</xref> to suggest that the Sec34/35 complex may function in retrograde intra-Golgi traffic, a possibility we have independently considered for mammalian COG. Indeed, it is known that maintenance of Golgi enzymes requires their retrograde vesicular transport from distal compartments (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Waters, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, a defect in intra-Golgi retrograde traffic could lead to the glycosylation defects seen in mammalian and yeast COG mutants. Compromised COG activity might also contribute to an aberrant Golgi structure through mislocalization of crucial Golgi proteins. In addition, the compromised biosynthetic trafficking seen in some yeast Sec34/35 complex mutants (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wuestehube et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>) may be a consequence of secondary anterograde trafficking defects arising from primary retrograde trafficking defects (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Reilly et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>
<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Munro (2001)</xref> suggested that the yeast Sec34/35 complex may be evolutionarily and functionally related to the Sec6/8 complex, also called the exocyst, which has been proposed to tether transport vesicles to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Grindstaff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 1999</xref>). We have found that the mammalian COG and Sec6/8 complexes comigrate during numerous purification steps. Thus, they share many biochemical and biophysical properties, including hydrodynamic size and shape and overall surface charge/hydrophobicity (this study; unpublished data). Also, as noted previously (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 1998</xref>), both complexes contain eight subunits with very similar molecular weights. However, their appearances in deep etch EM differ. Therefore, further work to elucidate the relationship of these complexes is required.</p>
        <p>In summary, mammalian COG and its yeast homologue clearly play important roles in determining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and can influence intracellular membrane trafficking. However, their precise mechanism of action remains unknown. This is highlighted by the fact that the yeast Sec34/35 complex's subunits exhibit numerous genetic interactions both with cellular components proposed to be involved in tethering vesicles to the early Golgi apparatus (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">VanRheenen et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>) and with the COPI vesicle coat (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ram et al., 2002</xref>). Genetic and biochemical studies raise the possibility that the COG and Sec34/35 complexes may be directly involved in vesicular membrane transport processes (e.g., vesicle budding, targeting, or fusion reactions). Alternatively, COG may indirectly influence trafficking as a consequence of a direct influence on the structure or activity of one or more compartments of the Golgi apparatus (e.g., potential scaffolding activity).</p>
        <p>The characterization of the composition and structure of COG combined with the analysis of COG mutants provides a strong foundation for future studies of the function of this important molecular machine.</p>

        <title>Purification of COG</title>
        <p>All procedures were performed at 4Â°C. Solutions were buffered with 25 mM TrisCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT (TD) and contained the indicated amounts of KCl (e.g., TD + 1 M KCl) and glycerol, unless otherwise noted. Bovine brain cytosol was ammonium sulfate precipitated as previously described (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Waters et al., 1992</xref>). After resuspension of the precipitated proteins and adjustment of the salt concentration to 1M KCl, the sample was chromatographed on butyl-Sepharose. The COG complex was eluted with TD + 10 mM KCl, concentrated, and the concentration of KCl in the TD buffer was adjusted to 160 mM KCl by dialysis and the addition of salt. The sample was then applied to a MonoQ HR10/10 column, COG eluted in a KCl gradient and dialyzed overnight against 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol. After adding potassium phosphate (KP<sub>i</sub>) to a final concentration of 5 mM, the dialyzed sample was chromatographed on a ceramic hydroxyapatite column. COG complex was eluted with a KP<sub>i</sub> gradient and fractions were immediately dialyzed against TD + 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol in a microdialyzer (GIBCO BRL). The second peak of Cog5 immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, peak 2) was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superose 6 HR10/30 sizing column. Fractions containing COG complex were pooled and chromatographed on a MiniQ column. An estimated 70 Î¼g of COG complex eluted at â¼220 mM KCl in the gradient.</p>
