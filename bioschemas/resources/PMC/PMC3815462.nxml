      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">The transition zone (TZ) is a specialized compartment found at the base of cilia, adjacent to the centriole distal end, where axonemal microtubules (MTs) are heavily cross-linked to the surrounding membrane to form a barrier that gates the ciliary compartment. A number of ciliopathy molecules have been found to associate with the TZ, but factors that directly recognize axonemal MTs to specify TZ assembly at the cilia base remain unclear. Here, through quantitative centrosome proteomics, we identified an axoneme-associated protein, CEP162, tethered specifically at centriole distal ends to promote TZ assembly. CEP162 interacts with core TZ components, and mediates their association with MTs. Loss of CEP162 arrests ciliogenesis at the stage of TZ assembly. Abolishing its centriolar tethering, however, allows CEP162 to stay on the growing end of the axoneme, and ectopically assemble TZ components at cilia tips. This generates extra-long cilia with strikingly swollen tips that actively release ciliary contents into the extracellular environment. CEP162 is thus an axoneme-recognition protein âpre-tetheredâ at centriole distal ends prior to ciliogenesis to promote and restrict TZ formation specifically at the cilia base.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">The primary cilium is a membrane-bound, microtubule-based sensory organelle, composed of 9 doublet microtubules (MTs), the axoneme, nucleated directly from the distal end of centrioles or basal bodies<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Primary cilia can sense a wide range of signals in the extracellular surroundings, and thus critically regulate the physiology of cells during proliferation and morphogenesis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">In vertebrate cells, cilia biogenesis follows a series of stereotyped steps<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Through the distal end, centrioles first interact with small membrane vesicles of unclear specificity, mediated by a set of accessory structures known as the distal appendages<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. This interaction facilitates the nucleation of short doublet MTs from the centriole distal end<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Nascent doublet MTs adjacent to the centriole distal end are heavily cross-linked to the surrounding membrane to form a specialized compartment described as the transition zone (TZ)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. MT-to-membrane connections in the TZ can be seen under electron microscopy (EM) as multiple rows of Y-shaped linkers<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> that form a unique organization termed the âciliary necklaceâ<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. After TZ formation, the development of a full-length, mature axoneme (or cilium) is supported and maintained by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P4">The TZ has been shown to form a barrier or part of the ciliary gate that works together with the septin ring<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, nucleoporins<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and likely distal appendages<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> to regulate selective targeting and sorting of proteins to and from the ciliary compartment<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Several multiprotein complexes, including NPHP1-4-8<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, MKS/B9<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and CEP290/NPHP5<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> complexes have been found to associate with the TZ, and many of them are ciliopathy molecules that critically regulate not only cilia biogenesis but also the activity of cilia as a sensory organelle<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. While a large number of TZ components have been discovered<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, how ciliary MTs (or axonemes) are recognized to form the TZ, and how TZ assembly is limited to the cilia base during axoneme elongation remain largely unclear.</p>

        <title>Identification of the centriole-distal-end protein CEP162 that binds microtubules</title>
        <p id="P5">The centriole distal end marks the base of cilia, and is immediately adjacent to the TZ. To identify factors that promote and/or specify TZ formation at the cilia base, we screened for centriole-distal-end proteins that possess microtubule-binding activities. A proteomic approach was designed to quantitatively differentiate core centriolar proteins from other centrosomal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) (see Methods for details). We have previously found that centriole duplication in S and G2 phases generates engaged centriole pairs consisting of one modified (mother) centriole that is MTOC competent, and one unmodified (daughter) centriole that is MTOC non-competent<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Since only the modified centriole can acquire accessory structures like the pericentriolar material (PCM) and appendages<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), an increase in the number of unmodified centrioles within a centrosome would not change the total amount of accessory proteins in that centrosome. However, an increase in centriolar proteins would occur proportionally. Such differences can be quantitatively detected and analyzed by SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and has recently been used to successfully isolate distal appendage proteins<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> associating with modified centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; 1:1 ratio). Here, the same proteomics tool was used to specifically identify core centriolar proteins present equally in both modified and unmodified centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; 6:2 ratio). Candidate core centriolar proteins were further examined for their subcellular localization. Nine centriole-distal-end proteins were identified so far, including six previously described proteins: CP110, CEP97, CEP76, Ofd1, CEP290, and SDCCAG8<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and three largely uncharacterized proteins: MPP9, KIAA1009/QN1, and CCHCR1<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Among the uncharacterized, KIAA1009 exhibits MT-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and thus was further examined.</p>
        <p id="P6">KIAA1009/QN1, now renamed CEP162, was found in organisms ranging from trypanosomes to vertebrates. It localizes to the distal end of centrioles throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), co-localizing with the known distal-end marker CP110<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> but not with the proximal-end markers C-Nap1<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> or SAS6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). During ciliogenesis, the CEP162 signal became disk-shaped, and was found at the cilia base surrounded by the distal appendage protein CEP164<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting an intimate association with the axoneme. Consistently, CEP162 was found on spindle MTs in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), suggesting that it may possess MT-binding activity. Full-length CEP162 (FL; 1â1403 a.a.) contains 3 coiled-coil (CC) stretches in the C-terminal region: CC1 (617â906 a.a.), CC2 (957â1121 a.a.), and CC3 (1167â1386 a.a.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Deletion of CC3 (ÎCC3 or tNC1C2) abolished centriole localization without affecting MT association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f &amp; h</xref>). Conversely, a fragment containing CC2 and CC3 (C2C3) localized to centrioles at distal ends, but failed to associate with MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f &amp; g</xref>), indicating that the two targeting activities of CEP162 are separable. To test if CEP162 binds directly to MTs, a microtubule-pelleting assay was used. Endogenous CEP162 in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>) or a MT-binding fragment of CEP162 (tNC1C2) purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>), but not a control fragment (CEP162<sup>1â227</sup>), could be co-pelleted with pure, taxol-stabilized MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>), demonstrating that CEP162 binds directly to MTs. Furthermore, overexpression of CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> in cells induced a large number of MT bundles that were insensitive to cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref>).</p>

        <title>CEP162 is required for ciliogenesis</title>
        <p id="P7">To determine the function of CEP162, the protein was depleted from cells by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Unlike a previous report<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, neither mitosis nor centriole duplication were affected by CEP162 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a &amp; b</xref>). However, in the absence of CEP162, ciliogenesis was specifically disrupted in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2câe</xref>). In vivo studies using zebrafish indicated that the zebrafish CEP162 homolog is maternally supplied and ubiquitously expressed during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Partial knockdown of zebrafish Cep162 using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) results in a series of phenotypes known to associate with cilia defects, including body curvature, hydrocephalus, and left-right asymmetry defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2gâk</xref>), which could be partially rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant form of CEP162 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j &amp; k</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Loss of CEP162 arrests ciliogenesis at the stage of TZ assembly</title>
        <p id="P8">Interestingly, the acquisition of distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), the removal of CP110 from the mature centriole<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and the localization of a known centriole-distal-end protein Ofd1<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) all occurred normally in the absence of CEP162. Moreover, several non-membrane bound TZ components including IFT88, Tctn1, and Cc2d2a, were recruited normally to CEP162-deficient centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3dâf</xref>), indicating that although cilia fail to form, some early steps of ciliogenesis can proceed without CEP162.</p>
        <p id="P9">Electron microscopy (EM) was used to examine the ciliogenesis defect in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). In wild-type cells, more than 88% of mature centrioles (30 out of 34) in G0/G1-arrested cells, judged by the appearance of appendages, efficiently dock to vesicle membranes and support the formation of axoneme or ciliary MTs known to organize the TZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>, left). Note that by establishing connections alongside the ciliary MTs to form the TZ, the membrane vesicle becomes severely deformed to embrace the elongated axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>, left; cartoon 1), whereas the contact between distal appendages and membranes remains at the base of the cilium (red in cartoon 1). In contrast, in CEP162-depleted cells, a small membrane vesicle with an unaltered or slightly flatten shape was often seen linked peripherally through the distal appendage to centriole distal ends (22 out of 49 mature centrioles), where the outgrowth of a short ciliary bud was evident, but no signs of membrane crosslinking alongside MTs were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>, middle &amp; right; cartoon 2). These observations suggest that loss of CEP162 does not affect centriole-to-membrane docking mediated by distal appendages, but instead arrests ciliogenesis at the stage of TZ assembly.</p>
        <p id="P10">To confirm the absence of an intact TZ at CEP162-deficient centrioles, the localization of other TZ components was examined. The TZ houses several multiprotein complexes including NPHP1-4-8<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, MKS/B9<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and CEP290/NPHP5<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> complexes. Intriguingly, upon G0/G1 arrest, NPHP8 (or RPGRIP1L) was efficiently recruited to wild-type centrioles before cilia formed, but failed to do so in the absence of CEP162 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Consistently, CEP162-deficient centrioles failed to recruit NPHP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), but had no problem to recruit IFT88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i &amp; d</xref>), indicating that targeting of the NPHP1-4-8 complex to the TZ depends on CEP162. Moreover, while CEP162 is not required for the localization of Tctn1 and Cc2d2a (members of MKS/B9 complex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e &amp; f</xref>), CEP162 depletion severely disrupted the recruitment of Tctn2 and TMEM67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j &amp; k</xref>), two components of MKS/B9 complex that contain the transmembrane (TM) domain<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Note that the stability or protein level of TZ components examined here is not affected by CEP162 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>), and that these TZ deficiencies are consistent with the EM results, revealing a lack of intact TZ structures or membranes. Together, our results indicate that the microtubule-binding protein CEP162 plays a critical role in the assembly or maintenance of the ciliary transition zone.</p>

        <p id="P11">We hypothesized that CEP162 recognizes and/or stabilizes ciliary MTs at centriole distal ends to promote TZ formation. To explore whether CEP162 interacts with ciliary MTs, CEP162<sup>ÎCC3</sup> and CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup>, which are both defective in centriole tethering but retain MT-binding activity, or CEP162<sup>C2C3</sup>, which lacks MT-binding activity, were inducibly expressed at a comparable level in wild-type RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4aâd</xref>). Strikingly, exogenous CEP162<sup>ÎCC3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) or CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), but not the centriole-tethering domain CEP162<sup>C2C3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), strongly labeled the tips of elongated cilia, whereas endogenous CEP162 remained tethered at the cilia base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Weak labeling of CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> along the axoneme was also noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Accumulation of CEP162 at cilia tips may reflect an indirect consequence of a trafficking defect in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) pathway, particularly the retrograde transport<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, caused by overexpression of truncated CEP162. To test this idea, we examined the cilia length, as most IFT defects are known to either eliminate or shorten the cilia<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the length of cilia modified by CEP162<sup>ÎCC3</sup> was greatly enhanced rather than reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Moreover, higher fractions of cells with cilia were seen in proliferating populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), suggesting that overexpression of CEP162<sup>ÎCC3</sup> does not compromise IFT activity in cilia assembly. Rather, this result suggests that CEP162 recognizes and stabilizes axonemes at tips, but that this is normally restricted to distal ends of centrioles, where nascent doublet MTs grow and form the TZ.</p>
        <p id="P12">To explore whether purified CEP162 can bind directly to the tip of membrane-extracted axonemes, wild-type RPE1 cells cultivated to form cilia were extracted with detergent-containing buffer (0.1% Triton-X100 in phosphate buffered saline). This treatment shortened but did not eliminate cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4hâj</xref>), and almost completely stripped the IFT machinery off the axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>), leaving short axonemes marked with acetylated Î±-tubulin in nearly every ciliated cell (&gt;80%). These membrane/IFT-extracted cilia remained attached to cells, and were incubated with different concentrations of purified CEP162 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Intriguingly, whereas CEP162<sup>1â227</sup> did not bind to any specific cellular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, top), low concentration of CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> preferentially marked cilia tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, middle). Incubation with a 10-fold higher concentration of CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup>, but not CEP162<sup>1â227</sup>, resulted in labeling of the entire axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, when cells expressing CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> were extracted with the same buffer, the tip-associated CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> survived the extraction, and the shortening or destabilization of cilia that accompanies extraction of control cells was largely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>). This indicates that CEP162 is an axoneme-recognition protein tethered at the distal end of centrioles, but when released, it can stay on axoneme tips and enhance cilia stability.</p>

        <title>CEP162 interacts with CEP290 and mediates its association with microtubules</title>
        <p id="P13">To determine whether CEP162 bridges TZ components to the axoneme, we examined its relationship with CEP290. CEP290 forms a complex with multiple ciliopathy molecules, including NPHP5<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, Cc2d2a, Tctn1, Mks1, and more<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and mediates the membrane-to-MT connection in the TZ<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, whether CEP290 associates directly or indirectly with ciliary MTs is unclear. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CEP162 pulled down endogenous CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), and vice versa, indicating that CEP162 and CEP290 are present in the same protein complex. Further analyses revealed that the N-terminal region of CEP162 that contains CC1 and CC2 is required to pull down endogenous CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), the same region where the axoneme-binding activity resides. Endogenous CEP290 localized to the distal ends of centrioles throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), and to mitotic spindles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, top), similar to CEP162. Intriguingly, CEP162 localizes to spindle MTs in the absence of CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, middle), but CEP290 requires CEP162 to associate with MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, overexpression of CEP162 induced MT bundles that recruited endogenous CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), whereas overexpression of CEP290 failed to decorate MTs or induce MT bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>), demonstrating that CEP290 is not a MT-binding protein but associates with MTs through CEP162. Interestingly, however, the localization of CEP162 and CEP290 at centriole distal ends is independent of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>), explaining the recruitment of Ccdc2a and Tctn1 to centrioles in the absence of CEP162 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e &amp; f</xref>), and further suggesting that CEP290 may serve as an anchor that recruit other TZ components to the vicinity of the TZ, whereas CEP162 is to act as a bridge to seal the gap, linking nearby TZ components to ciliary MTs.</p>

        <title>CEP162 promotes ectopic assembly of TZ components at cilia tips</title>
        <p id="P14">To characterize further the relationship between CEP162 and TZ assembly, we examined if CEP162 can promote ectopic assembly of TZ components. Strikingly, in cells expressing CEP162<sup>ÎCC3</sup> or CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup>, several endogenous TZ components including CEP290, Tctn1, TMEM67, and NPHP8/RPGRIP1L, which are normally seen at the base of cilia, could now be found at cilia tips marked by CEP162 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6aâd</xref>). This ectopic recruitment is specific to TZ components, as other centrosomal proteins, including CEP164 and centrin, remained localized at the cilia base under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Thus, TZ components are targeted to an ectopic ciliary site via non-tethered CEP162, revealing CEP162 as a critical promoter for TZ assembly.</p>
        <p id="P15">The consequence of having a TZ-like structure at cilia tips was further examined. RPE1 cells expressing GFP-tagged CEP162<sup>tNC1C2</sup> were imaged by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The GFP-CEP162 signal was seen first at the cilia tip as expected, but surprisingly, it became detached from the tip, and released into the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 1</xref>). In a few cases, violent bursts of cilia tips were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 2</xref>). Similar phenotypes were also seen in cells expressing CEP162<sup>ÎCC3</sup>. The detached, CEP162-positive structures, scattering amongst cells, were also positive for the TZ marker CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>) or RPGRIP1l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>), IFT marker IFT88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>), and ciliary membrane marker Arl13b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>), indicating that CEP162-modified cilia are actively discharging ciliary contents from their tips. Correlative light-scanning electron microscopy revealed that CEP162-modified tips are severely swollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>), forming a blister-like configuration. The swelling is likely a consequence of excess accumulation of proteins at tips, including CEP162, and other ciliary materials (e.g. TZ components, IFT, and Arl13b). We donât understand how these ciliary materials are excessively trapped there, although it is consistent with the idea that some form of a barrier is built, separating the tip from the rest of the ciliary compartment.<bold/> The bulging structures released from cilia tips differed in size, and were irregularly shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>), suggesting that they are membranous structures randomly breaking away from the exceedingly enlarged tip. However, the GFP signal was retained over time in some of these detached structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>), rather than being diluted or dispersed, an indication of intact membrane-coated structures. Note that secretion-like activities have been reported to occur at the flagella tip in Chlamydomonas<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Together, these observations demonstrate that the spatial restriction of TZ assembly to the cilia base is critical for proper cilia structure and function, and that one important role of centriole-distal-end proteins is to provide such spatial cues.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P16">In cycling cells, the TZ is formed transiently with most of its components recruited from the cytoplasm. However, a few TZ factors are âpre-tetheredâ at the assembly site, i.e. the distal end of centrioles, before ciliogenesis initiates, potentially serving as a promoter or anchor that drives TZ assembly. Our results reveal CEP162 as a critical promoter as: (a) it localizes to distal ends of centrioles, where nascent ciliary MTs form, (b) it binds directly to ciliary MTs, (c) CEP162 interacts with the core TZ component CEP290, and mediates its association with (ciliary) MTs, (d) loss of CEP162 blocks TZ assembly, and (e) gain of CEP162 at cilia tips promotes ectopic assembly of TZ components. CEP290, which localizes to centriole distal ends independent of CEP162, and anchors its associated components to the vicinity of ciliary MTs, also plays a critical role in TZ formation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P17">Most of centriolar components involved in ciliogenesis are concentrated at the distal portion of centrioles. Some of these factors, e.g. CEP162 and CEP290, are present at every centriole regardless of the age, but others, such as the appendages<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, associate only with mature mother centrioles. A systematic method that can differentially identify these two distinct classes of distal-end-associated molecules would greatly facilitate the study of cilia biogenesis. Here we have established a quantitative proteomic approach to map proteins associated with specific structural elements of the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This has allowed us to identify a list of molecules present at distal ends of all centrioles, and in a separate story<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, carefully characterize the molecular composition and function of the distal appendages<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The centriole distal end appears to play several critical roles in ciliogenesis: (i) it interacts with the membrane vesicles, which leads to docking of cilia to the plasma membrane, (ii) it is the site where ciliary microtubules grow, and (iii) it is immediately adjacent to the site of TZ assembly. It will be interesting to see if the centriole-distal-end components identified here are involved in any of these processes.</p>

In both samples, only modified centrioles carry the accessory structure (i.e. PCM and appendages).

Importantly, non-specific contaminants co-purified with centrosomes are also present equally. Conversely, higher amounts of proteins from unmodified centrioles should associate with rosette centrosomes, showing rations higher than 1. For example, proteins specifically associated with unmodified centrioles would give the highest ratio around 5 (5:1), while core centriolar proteins present equally in both modified and unmodified centrioles would display a smaller ratio around 3 (6:2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

Primers (Cep162-F: 5â-atggctcatagactgaccaaagagg -3â and Cep162-R: 5â-AATCTGGATGTTCTCCTCCTGTAAG -3â) were used to amplify the N-terminus of Cep162 to determine efficacy of knockdown.</p>

        <p id="P30">Cells were grown on square 22 mm coverslips, fixed for 30 minutes at RT with 4% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, buffered with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate followed by 0.1% sodium borohydride to quench glutaraldehyde autofluorescense. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence (as above). Following fluorescent staining, the cells were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series to 95% ethanol to limit quenching of florescence that occurs when exposed to 100% ethanol. Cells were placed in three changes of hexamethyldisilazane, the final change was allowed to evaporate and fully dry the cells under a fume hood. <bold>Fluorescence Imaging:</bold> Samples were imaged with a Zeiss AxioObserver using Zeiss Shuttle and Find. Coverslips (one at a time) were securely fastened in a Zeiss designed coverslip holder. Prior to imaging, the coverslip was calibrated using fiducial markers built into the coverslip holder to assign precise XY coordinates to targeted cells. Fluorescing cells were imaged with a 63x oil objective using Zeiss AxioVision v4.8 and captured with a Ziess HRm camera. <bold>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM):</bold> After fluorescence imaging, the coverslip holder was placed on the stage of a Zeiss SUPRA 40 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Zeiss Shuttle and Find software was again used to calibrate the stage and automatically locate the target cells. The SAME cells imaged for fluorescence were then imaged at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. Merged SEM and color images were created using Zeiss AxioVision v 4.8.</p>
