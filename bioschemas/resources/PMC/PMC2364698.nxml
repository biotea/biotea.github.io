        <p>Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling is activated by growth factors such as insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and regulates several functions such as cell cycling, apoptosis, cell growth, and cell migration. Here, we find that Kank is an Akt substrate located downstream of PI3K and a 14-3-3âbinding protein. The interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 is regulated by insulin and EGF and is mediated through phosphorylation of Kank by Akt. In NIH3T3 cells expressing Kank, the amount of actin stress fibers is reduced, and the coexpression of 14-3-3 disrupted this effect. Kank also inhibits insulin-induced cell migration via 14-3-3 binding. Furthermore, Kank inhibits insulin and active Akt-dependent activation of RhoA through binding to 14-3-3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Kank negatively regulates the formation of actin stress fibers and cell migration through the inhibition of RhoA activity, which is controlled by binding of Kank to 14-3-3 in PI3KâAkt signaling.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling regulates several important functions in cells, such as cell cycling, apoptosis, cell growth, and cell migration. PI3K activity is induced by insulin and various growth factors such as EGF, PDGF, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) to form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franke et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okano et al., 2000</xref>). An oncogene, <italic>v-PI3K</italic>, encoding a catalytic subunit (PI3Kp100Î±) of PI3K plays an active role in oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2000</xref>), and a tumor suppressor, PTEN, dephosphorylates PIP3 to form PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furnari et al., 1998</xref>). PIP3 directly as well as indirectly activates Akt, also known as protein kinase B. Activated Akt directly phosphorylates many cellular proteins such as p122RhoGAP, BAD, p27<sup>kip1</sup>, glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK3Î²), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fulton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hers et al., 2006</xref>). v-Akt, an oncogenic gag-fused Akt, has strong kinase activity and transformation activity in rodent and avian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Staal, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellacosa et al., 1991</xref>). Akt phosphorylates serines or threonines in the motif RXRXX(S/T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yaffe et al., 2001</xref>). Some Akt substrates bind to 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For example, BAD itself enhances apoptosis, but when it is phosphorylated by Akt at a serine residue, 14-3-3 binds to it and releases antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 1997</xref>). When Akt phosphorylates Thr157 of p27<sup>kip1</sup>, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, phosphorylated p27<sup>kip1</sup> binds to 14-3-3, and this protein complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm and promotes cell cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sekimoto et al., 2004</xref>). These lines of evidence indicate that some Akt substrates exert their functions through association with 14-3-3.</p><p>14-3-3 is a family of proteins with seven isoforms in mammals and is ubiquitously expressed. 14-3-3 forms homo- or heterodimers and interacts with various cellular proteins, acting as an adaptor or a molecular chaperone. 14-3-3 interacts with its target proteins in either a phosphorylation-dependent or -independent manner. 14-3-3 itself has no enzymatic activity, although its binding to the target proteins may lead to enhanced apoptosis, cell cycling, cell growth, vesicular transport, cell spreading, or cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mhawech, 2005</xref>). 14-3-3 is associated with several signaling pathways, including PI3KâAkt signaling. It affects not only the interaction between Akt substrates and 14-3-3, but also the PI3KâAkt pathway and its upstream factors. 14-3-3Î¸ binds to a catalytic subunit of PI3K (PI3Kp110) and inhibits its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnefoy-BÃ©rard et al., 1995</xref>). 14-3-3 binds to some proteins upstream of PI3KâAkt, such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IGF-1 receptor, EGFR, and integrin Î²1, and regulates these signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craparo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oksvold et al., 2004</xref>). Accordingly, 14-3-3 is important for the regulation of these signaling pathways.</p><p>Cell migration plays a central role in many biological and pathological processes such as embryogenesis, tissue repair, cell invasion, and metastasis. PI3KâAkt signaling is also associated with cell migration. PI3K enhances actin remodeling and generates membrane protrusions through activating Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scita et al., 2000</xref>). PI3KâAkt signals also induce the activation of p70S6K, causing the remodeling of actin and leading to cell migration and cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2004</xref>). An Akt-interacting protein, Girdin/Akt-phosphorylation enhancer (APE), promotes actin organization and cell motility regulated by Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). Because of these findings, PI3K signals are considered to be important in cell migration by controlling actin dynamics.</p><p>The <italic>Kank</italic> gene, which encodes a kidney ankyrin repeatâcontaining protein, was originally identified in the region showing a loss of heterozygosity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC); reduced or loss of expression of the gene was observed in RCC tissues and cell lines, and overexpression of Kank resulted in disorganization of Î²-actin distribution in G-402 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarkar et al., 2002</xref>). In familial cerebral palsy, the region containing the <italic>Kank</italic> gene is often deleted, and this lesion is likely to be associated with this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lerer et al., 2005</xref>). An orthologue of Kank in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, VAB-19, is localized at the epidermal attachment structure, and a mutant of this gene causes a phenotype of aberrant actin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Kank inhibits the polymerization of actin and the formation of membrane ruffles induced by active Rac1/cdc42 by directly binding to IRSp53 (unpublished data). From these lines of evidence, Kank is likely to be important for actin dynamics. Kank has a coiled-coil domain at the N terminus and an ankyrin repeat domain at the C terminus. These domains may be involved in proteinâprotein interactions, and, as it has no apparent enzymatic domain, Kank may work as an adaptor protein. Therefore, identification of Kank-binding proteins is important to find its functions.</p><p>Here, we find that Kank is a substrate of Akt and binds to 14-3-3 in a phosphoserine-dependent manner. The interaction between 14-3-3 and Kank is regulated by PI3KâAkt signaling. Furthermore, Kank regulates actin stress fibers and the migration of cells through the inhibition of RhoA, which is controlled by binding of Kank to 14-3-3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Kank binds to 14-3-3 isoforms Î³, Îµ, Î·, and Î¸</title><p>To characterize the functions of Kank exerted through its binding proteins, we performed a pull-down assay using an antiâFLAG-tag mAb conjugated to agarose gel with the lysate of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells transfected with FLAG-Kank expression vector. Then, after the coprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, the bound proteins were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization on a time-of-flight mass spectrometry (unpublished data). We found several proteins that bind to Kank, including 14-3-3Îµ and Î¸. We first confirmed the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 by immunoprecipitation and immunostaining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Endogenous 14-3-3Î¸ was coimmunoprecipitated with an anti-Kank antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, lane 2), and Kank and 14-3-3 were colocalized in VMRC-RCW cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, panels 1â3).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Kank interacts with 14-3-3 isoforms Î³, Îµ, Î·, and Î¸.</bold> (A) Kank interacts with 14-3-3Î¸. VMRC-RCW cells were lysed and the lysate was immnunoprecipitated (IP) with control rabbit IgG (lane 1) or anti-Kank pAb (lane 2). The immunoprecipitates and the lysate (lane 3) were subjected to Western blotting (WB) using the antibodies indicated. (B) Endogenous Kank and 14-3-3 proteins are colocalized in VMRC-RCW cells.

Immnunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-FLAG antibody and the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810537f01"/></fig><p>We then examined which isoform of 14-3-3 bound to Kank (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). FLAG-tagged Kank and HA-tagged isoforms of 14-3-3, which were expressed in HEK293T cells, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The results indicate that 14-3-3Î¸ strongly bound to Kank, whereas 14-3-3Î³, 14-3-3Îµ, and 14-3-3Î· also bound to Kank.</p></sec><sec><title>Kank binds to 14-3-3 when its 14-3-3âbinding motifs are phosphorylated by Akt</title><p>14-3-3 interacts with its target proteins in both phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-dependent and -independent manners. Kank contains several candidate 14-3-3-binding motifs with potential phosphorylation at their serine residues. Because a construct of Kank with a deletion of the coiled-coil domain could not bind to 14-3-3 (unpublished data), we focused on two candidate motifs in the coiled-coil domain (149â156 and 162â169: <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We replaced serine with alanine in the candidate motifs (S154A and S167A) and examined the interaction between the wild type or the mutants (Kank<sup>S154A</sup> and Kank<sup>S167A</sup>) of Kank and 14-3-3Î¸ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Kank<sup>S154A</sup> still bound to 14-3-3Î¸ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lane 4), whereas Kank<sup>S167A</sup> (lane 5) and a mutant containing both mutations (Kank<sup>S154A+S167A</sup>; lane 6) could not bind to 14-3-3Î¸. Other isoforms of 14-3-3 could not bind to Kank<sup>S167A</sup> either (unpublished data). To test whether the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 was direct or indirect, we performed in vitro pull-down assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). All GST-fused 14-3-3 isoforms bound to the wild-type coiled-coil domain (Coil) but not to Coil<sup>S167A</sup>.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The 14-3-3âbinding motif of Kank is phosphorylated by Akt in vitro and their interaction is phosphorylation dependent.</bold> (A) The amino acid sequences of candidate 14-3-3âbinding (149â156 and 162â169) and Akt-phosphorylation (162â167) motifs. The consensus sequences of the 14-3-3âbinding motif and the Akt-phosphorylation motif are also shown. (B) Binding of 14-3-3 to wild-type or mutant Kank. Either Ser154 or Ser167, or both, in Kank were replaced by Ala. HEK293T cells expressing wild-type Kank (WT, lanes 2 and 3) or Kank containing mutations (S154A, S167A, and S154A + S167A; lanes 4, 5, and 6, respectively) were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. (C) The interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 is direct and requires Ser167. GST-fused 14-3-3 isoforms expressed in bacteria were pulled down using the in vitro translated coiled-coil domain (Coil; amino acids 90â360) of Kank or its mutant containing S167A (Coil<sup>S167A</sup>). Coprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting and detected by staining with streptavidin-HRP. (D) Ser167 of Kank is phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. GST-14b (amino acids 161â171 of Kank, lane 3) and GST-14bM (amino acids 161â171 of Kank containing a mutation of S167A, lane 4), GST, a negative control (lane 1), and GST-GSK3Î², a positive control (lane 2), which were all expressed in bacteria, were subjected to phosphorylation by Akt. The samples before (âAkt) or after (+Akt) treatment with Akt along with Coomassie staining are shown. (E) Phosphorylation of the 14-3-3âbinding motif by Akt enhances the association of Kank with 14-3-3. MBP-Coil with (+) or without (â) phosphorylation was subjected to pull-down assays with GST 14-3-3 isoforms Î³, Îµ, Î·, or Î¸ or control GST and the bound MBP-tagged protein was detected using an anti-MBP antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810537f02"/></fig><p>The 14-3-3âbinding motif at 164â169 has an Akt-phosphorylation motif, and the amino acid Ser167 is a candidate site of phosphorylation by Akt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To determine whether this amino acid was phoshorylated by Akt or not, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). First, GST-GSK3Î² was phosphorylated by Akt, confirming that this Akt kinase activity was sufficient. Under this condition, GST-14b, which contains a 14-3-3âbinding motif in Kank, was phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, lane 3), but GST-14bM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, lane 4), which contains the motif with a mutation of S167A, was not phosphorylated. Therefore, the motif at 164â169 was responsible for binding of Kank to 14-3-3, and Ser167 was the site of phosphorylation by Akt.</p><p>Because Ser167 was a key amino acid for binding of 14-3-3 and this serine was phosphorylated by Akt in vitro, there was a possibility that the binding between Kank and 14-3-3 was phosphoserine dependent. To examine this, we performed in vitro pull-down assays using maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused, phosphorylated, or unphosphorylated coiled-coil domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Phosphorylation of this protein enhanced the binding to 14-3-3. In addition, the positions of the bands for both Kank and Kank<sup>S167A</sup> in polyacrylamide gels were shifted after the treatment with calyculin A, a protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor (unpublished data). Therefore, Kank may be phosphorylated at several sites, including Ser167, and its functions could be regulated by phosphorylation of these sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Association between Kank and 14-3-3 occurs downstream of PI3KâAkt signaling and is enhanced by growth factors</title><p>PI3KâAkt signaling is activated by growth factors such as insulin and EGF. Because Kank was phosphorylated by Akt in vitro (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, lane 3), the association of Kank and 14-3-3 may be regulated by the PI3KâAkt signals initiated by these growth factors. To examine this possibility, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using PI3K inhibitors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). When the assays included the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lane 3) and wortmannin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lane 4), both of which reduced the activity of Akt, the association of Kank and 14-3-3Î¸ was significantly reduced. In contrast, when rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was used (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lane 5), the association of these proteins was not affected. Moreover, when the cells were stimulated with insulin or EGF, the association of these proteins was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Meanwhile, when the cells pretreated with LY294002 were stimulated with the growth factors, the enhancement of the association of Kank and 14-3-3Î¸ was not observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lanes 4 and 6).

These results indicate that Kank is phosphorylated not only within its 14-3-3 binding motif but also at other serines and/or threonines, and this phosphorylation may be regulated by protein phosphatase 2A and other serine/thereonine kinases. We found that Kank bound to 14-3-3 and that this interaction was enhanced by the phosphorylation of Kank in vitro by Akt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Furthermore, PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, significantly reduced the level of this interaction, whereas the stimulation of cells with insulin and EGF significantly enhanced it (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that PI3KâAkt signaling may control the function of Kank through 14-3-3 by phosphorylation of a site within the 14-3-3âbinding motif. Lack of phosphorylation of the 14-3-3âbinding motif and endogenous Kank resulting from treatment with LY294002 resulted in weak binding of Kank to 14-3-3 in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and E</xref>; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Raf-1 binds to 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muslin et al., 1996</xref>). Although recombinant bacterial Raf-1, which is likely to be unphosphorylated, also binds to 14-3-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1995</xref>), the complex may not be functional. Similarly, the interaction between the unphosphorylated 14-3-3âbinding motif in Kank and 14-3-3 may be nonfunctional or may be so weak at this interaction that Kank is not fully functional through 14-3-3. However, Kank bound to all isoforms of 14-3-3 in vitro, whereas Kank bound to the isoforms Î³, Îµ, Î·, and Î¸ in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2 C</xref>). This difference may be caused by the state of folding of Kank in live cells. In fact, HSP70 is one of the Kank-binding proteins (unpublished data). This protein, as well as 14-3-3, may act as a molecular chaperone and may affect the folding of Kank. The folding of Kank may be one of the important factors for the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3, and the difference of the abilities of the isoforms of 14-3-3 to bind to Kank may result in different functions.</p><p>RhoA, a small GTPase, is critical for the formation of actin stress fibers and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ridley and Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takaishi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshioka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurokawa and Matsuda, 2005</xref>). Active RhoA, GTP-loaded RhoA, activates downstream effectors ROCK and Dia, resulting in organization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maekawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wallar and Alberts, 2003</xref>). RhoA is activated in the tail and the leading edge of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurokawa and Matsuda, 2005</xref>), and the degree of cell invasion is significantly reduced when the cells are treated with a RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshioka et al., 1999</xref>). These facts indicate that RhoA activation is tightly related to cell migration. However, the relationship between 14-3-3 and actin polymerization has not been thoroughly investigated. However, 14-3-3 enhanced actin cytoskeleton formation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lottersberger et al., 2006</xref>). 14-3-3 has many binding partners, including those related to actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pozuelo Rubio et al., 2004</xref>). Among them, p190RhoGEF and AKAP-Lbc, which are both activators of RhoA, were identified as 14-3-3âbinding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diviani et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, cofilin, an actin depolymerization factor, and SSH1L, a cofilin phosphatase, both bind to 14-3-3, and this interaction inhibits cofilin activity and enhances actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gohla and Bokoch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birkenfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soosairajah et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, 14-3-3 may be important for the regulation of actin polymerization and the function of RhoA. We found that Kank inhibited RhoA activation and that this effect is caused by the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3, which is controlled by PI3KâAkt signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). When the cells are stimulated by growth factors, PI3KâAkt signaling also activates RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2004</xref>). Simultaneously, the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 may be enhanced by growth factors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and may result in the inactivation of RhoA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, H and I</xref>). Moreover, cell migration may be regulated by the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 through RhoA inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, S2, and S3). <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> shows a hypothetical model of Kank function in RhoA regulation. Stimulation by growth factors such as insulin activates the PI3KâAkt signal. The 14-3-3 complex, downstream of Akt or, alternatively, of other signaling pathways, activates RhoA. When cells need to negatively regulate the migration or change the direction of their migration, Akt phosphorylates Kank at S167, and Kank sequesters 14-3-3 from the active 14-3-3 complex. As a result, the amount of active RhoA is decreased and the cells can negatively regulate their migration by decelerating the formation of actin stress fibers. This scheme would be effective when there are excess signals from Akt to RhoA. Furthermore, because Kank<sup>Îcoil</sup>, which lacked a coiled-coil domain containing an IRSp53-binding site and a 14-3-3âbinding motif, had no effect on actin stress fibers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), Kank function on actin stress fiber disorganization was not only dependent on 14-3-3 binding but also dependent on other proteins, and it is likely that there are additional mechanisms on actin stress fiber disorganization. Because the interaction between Kank and 14-3-3 did not affect the interaction between Kank and IRSp53 (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200707022/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200707022/DC1</ext-link>), Kank function through 14-3-3 is different from Kank-IRSp53 function. At least, the Kank coiled-coil domain may be important to actin stress fiber regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>A hypothetical model of RhoA regulation by Kank.</bold> Growth factors such as insulin stimulate the PI3KâAkt signal. The 14-3-3 complex then activates RhoA, which is located downstream of the PI3KâAkt signal or other signaling pathways. When cells need to negatively regulate the migration, Kank is phosphorylated by Akt and sequesters 14-3-3Î¸ from the 14-3-3 complex, resulting in suppression of active RhoA. Hypothetical pathways are indicated by hatched arrows.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810537f08"/></fig><p>In conclusion, Kank is a novel Akt substrate and its interaction with 14-3-3 is controlled by the PI3KâAkt signal. This interaction regulates the activation of RhoA and inhibits the formation of actin stress fibers and cell migration. Kank is likely to be a protein negatively mediating the signal from PI3KâAkt to RhoA. However, the mechanism of activating RhoA by the PI3KâAkt signal has not been well investigated, and we do not know which RhoGEF or RhoGAP is functionally associated with Kank. Akt and p70S6K phosphorylate p122RhoGAP S322 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hers et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hers et al. (2006)</xref> speculated that this phosphorylation inhibits RhoGAP activity and that the amount of active RhoA is increased. This Akt phosphorylation motif includes a candidate 14-3-3âbinding motif. Therefore, there is a possibility that p122RhoGAP is one of the targets of Kank in the downstream of Akt. In fact, Kank binds to DLC1, a tumor suppressor and a human homologue of p122RhoGAP (unpublished data). However, Kank<sup>S167A</sup> also binds to DLC1 (unpublished data), and the relationship between Kank and DLC1 through 14-3-3 has not been examined yet. Meanwhile, the expression of Kank is reduced or abrogated in RCC tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarkar et al., 2002</xref>). As knockdown of Kank resulted in enhanced cell migration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5 D</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7 C</xref>, and S3), this effect may be related to cancer progression. In addition, the deletion of the <italic>Kank</italic> region at 9p24 seems to be associated with familial cerebral palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lerer et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, Kank might be one of the targets for drug discovery for treatment of these diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mammalian expression plasmids and stable cells</title><p>To generate FLAG-tagged Kank expression plasmids, the PCR products of Kank cDNA (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession No. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_153186">NM_153186</ext-link>) were cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene), in which the FLAG tag was fused to the N terminus, or pCMV-Tag4A (Stratagene), in which the FLAG tag was fused to the C terminus.
