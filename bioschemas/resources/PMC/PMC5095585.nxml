      <abstract>
        <p>Lysine acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification regulating various biological processes. To characterize cellular functions of the human lysine acetyltransferases KAT2A (GCN5) and KAT2B (PCAF), we determined their acetylome by shotgun proteomics. One of the newly identified KAT2A/2B substrate is polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a key regulator of centrosome duplication. We demonstrate that KAT2A/2B acetylate the PLK4 kinase domain on residues K45 and K46. Molecular dynamics modelling suggests that K45/K46 acetylation impairs kinase activity by shifting the kinase to an inactive conformation. Accordingly, PLK4 activity is reduced upon <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation of its kinase domain. Moreover, the overexpression of the PLK4 K45R/K46R mutant in cells does not lead to centrosome overamplification, as observed with wild-type PLK4. We also find that impairing KAT2A/2B-acetyltransferase activity results in diminished phosphorylation of PLK4 and in excess centrosome numbers in cells. Overall, our study identifies the global human KAT2A/2B acetylome and uncovers that KAT2A/2B acetylation of PLK4 prevents centrosome amplification.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Lysine (K) acetylation has emerged as a widespread post-translational modification that is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and which regulates various biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Lysine acetylation can modify the charge of a given protein and/or create docking sites for other proteins that may alter their function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. A prime example of the significance of such modification is the acetylation of histones, which plays an essential role in transcriptional activation, DNA replication and repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Remarkably, in addition, lysine acetylation also targets thousands of non-histone proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, but the functional relevance of the vast majority of these modifications is not known.</p>
    <p>Lysine acetylation is catalysed by K acetyltransferases (KATs; formerly histone acetyltransferases, HATs), which transfer the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to the epsilon-amino group of internal lysine residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Whereas â¼6,000 proteins have been reported to be acetylated in human cells (Phosphositeplus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), only â¼20 KATs have been identified to date (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), suggesting that each KAT could acetylate several hundred targets. Thus, it is important to identify the specific subset of proteins acetylated by each individual KAT. The human KAT2A (GCN5) and its â¼70% identical paralogue KAT2B (PCAF) are known to play a role in diverse biological processes, such as chromatin remodelling, transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. KAT2A/2B are mainly studied as HATs that acetylate preferentially histone H3 and to a lesser extent H4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and references therein), leading to changes in chromatin structure. However, KAT2A/2B can also acetylate non-histone targets, such as CDC6 and cyclin A to regulate the G1/S cell cycle transition and mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. While KAT2A/2B have been implicated in given cellular processes, a comprehensive list of their cellular targets has not yet been assembled, although the identification of such targets should provide more mechanistic insights into their mode of action.</p>
    <p>Metazoan KAT2A/2B function within several multiprotein coactivator complexes, such as SAGA (Spt-Ada-GCN5 acetyltranferase (AT) containing) and ATAC (Ada-Two-A-containing complex)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. We have previously shown that ATAC controls mitotic progression by acetylating cyclin A, and that impairing the activity of KAT2A/2B leads to increased centrosome numbers in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, the mechanisms underlying the requirement of KAT2A/2B in regulating centrosome numbers remained elusive.</p>
    <p>Centrosomes consist of a pair centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material, from which microtubules are nucleated in animal cells. Proliferating cells are typically born with two centrioles, which duplicate once per cell cycle, starting towards the G1/S transition. As a result, cells in S phase and thereafter contain two pairs of centrioles, each within one centrosome. At the G2/M transition, the two centrosomes separate to direct bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis. Aberrant centrosome number has dire consequences for cell division and genome integrity, since too few centrosomes can lead to monopolar spindle assembly and too many centrosomes to multipolar spindle assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Centrosome amplification is frequently observed in human cancer and has been proposed to contribute to tumour progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Therefore, the precise regulation of the number of centrosomes is fundamental for human health.</p>
    <p>In metazoans, a key regulator of centrosome number is the serine/threonine polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. PLK4 depletion results in failure of centriole formation, whereas its overexpression leads to supernumerary centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Therefore, PLK4 protein levels and kinase activity must be tightly regulated. This is achieved in part by PLK4 protein stability being regulated by auto-phosphorylation, which triggers ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Whereas the mechanisms regulating PLK4 activation, protein ubiquitination and degradation have been clarified, those modulating PLK4 kinase activity remain elusive.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have determined the KAT2A/2B-dependent acetylome of human cells and identify 398 acetylated KAT2A/2B target proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. Furthermore, our detailed analysis uncovers that KAT2A/2B-mediated lysine acetylation of PLK4 negatively regulates its kinase activity and thus keeps in check the number of centrosomes in human cells, thereby contributing to the maintenance of genome integrity.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the human KAT2A/2B-dependent acetylome</title>
        <p>To comprehensively identify proteins acetylated specifically by endogenous KAT2A/2B (GCN5/PCAF), we performed a large-scale unbiased screen using tandem mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics, comparing acetylated proteins in control cells and in cells in which KAT2A and KAT2B were simultaneously knocked down. We used two stable HeLa cell lines in which doxycycline (Dox) induces the expression of either a control short-hairpin (sh) RNA (Tet-shCTRL) or a shRNA targeting KAT2A (Tet-shKAT2A)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition, KAT2B was knocked down in the latter cell line by siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The efficiency of KAT2A and KAT2B knockdown was verified by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and further ascertained by the decrease of histone H3 acetylation at position K9, a well-known <italic>in vivo</italic> target of these KATs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, lowest panel). The redundant acetylation of H3K9 by other nuclear KATs following the depletion of KAT2A/2B likely explains the remaining signal in lane 5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>.</p>
        <p>The acetylated peptide pool was then identified either under control conditions in five biological replicates or in the double KAT2A/2B knockdown cells in three biological replicates, and compared. Acetylated peptides and their corresponding proteins that were detected solely in the control cells (in a minimum of 3/5 replicates), but not in the knockdown conditions, were considered as potential targets of KAT2A/2B. This stringent cutoff led to the identification of 1,569 acetylated sites on 398 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Among these KAT2A/2B targets, 251 proteins (about 63%) were already found to be acetylated in global acetylome screens (see the protein modification resource: PhosphositePlus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), validating our approach. The analysis of amino-acid frequency surrounding the identified acetylated lysines revealed enrichment for further lysine residues, as compared with the frequency of residues surrounding non-acetylated lysines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). This result suggests that the amino-acid composition surrounding lysines influences the substrate specificity of KAT2A/B, which preferentially acetylate lysine-rich regions of proteins. This is in good agreement with previous reports showing an enrichment of lysines residues surrounding acetylated lysines in global human acetylome data sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
        <p>Gene ontology term analyses of the 398 non-histone proteins identified here using Manteia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> indicated that the KAT2A/2B acetylated proteins play a role in cellular functions in which KAT2A/2B have already been implicated, including chromatin remodelling, transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell death and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Interestingly, the gene ontology term analysis also suggested KAT2A/2B-dependent regulation of novel pathways, such as actin-mediated cell contraction, protein transport, phosphorylation and regulation of centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that the action of KAT2A/2B is more widespread than previously suspected and uncover novel processes by which these KAT2s might modulate cell physiology.</p>

        <title>The kinase domain of PLK4 is acetylated by KAT2A and KAT2B</title>
        <p>To further analyse the KAT2A/2B-dependent acetylome, we focused on centrosome duplication, a process in which a role for lysine acetylation was not established before our study. Given that PLK4 is one of the key regulators of centrosome duplication, and as the acetylated lysine residues (K45/K46) are localized in the PLK4 kinase domain (see tandem mass spectra of the acetylated PLK4 peptide in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), we set out to investigate the biological relevance of these acetylations. Note that these two lysine residues are conserved in PLK4 proteins from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting functional relevance.</p>
        <p>To test whether PLK4 can be acetylated by KAT2A or KAT2B <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed AT assays on recombinantly expressed PLK4 kinase domain in the presence of acetyl-CoA and purified recombinant human KAT2A or KAT2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). As a negative control, we also expressed the recombinant catalytic mutants (mut) of KAT2A and KAT2B. Histone H3 acetylation by KAT2A/2B (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, lanes 5 and 11). Importantly, we found that recombinant PLK4 kinase domain was acetylated in the presence of purified KAT2A or KAT2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 8 and 10). By contrast, the kinase domain was not acetylated when the catalytic dead double point mutant of KAT2A (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) (lane 9) or KAT2B (lane 11) were used instead. Note, however, that the double point mutant of KAT2B retained some residual acetylation activity towards the histone octamer substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, lane 12).</p>
        <p>To further validate the acetylation of K45 and K46 residues identified in the comprehensive proteomic analysis, <italic>in vitro</italic> AT assays were performed on recombinant PLK4 kinase domain, followed by tandem MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Lysines K45 and K46 were found to be acetylated by KAT2A or KAT2B, as were another two lysines of the ATP-binding site (K41 and K68), which were not identified in the large-scale study. Note that the <italic>in vitro</italic> AT assay using purified recombinant protein fragments may result in more sites than the ones identified in cells on endogenous full-length PLK4 protein. The above results together demonstrate that PLK4 can be acetylated by KAT2A/2B on residues K45/K46 in its kinase domain.</p>
        <p>To further address whether PLK4 is acetylated in cells, we have developed an antibody against a PLK4 peptide acetylated on positions K45 and K46 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). When HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for Flag-KAT2A or Flag-KAT2B, we detected an increase of the acetylated form of PLK4 (PLK4ac), in particular on overexpression of Flag-KAT2B, but not of overall PLK4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Moreover, the anti-PLK4ac antibody detected centrosomes in immunofluorescence experiments, with the signal being juxtaposed with that of antibodies directed against the centriolar protein Centrin-2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, upper panels). Importantly, the PLK4ac signal completely disappeared when PLK4 was knocked down with siRNAs (lower panel), demonstrating that the raised antibodies are specific to PLK4.</p>

        <title>KAT2A/2B and PLK4ac co-localize at centrosomes</title>
        <p>Because we identified PLK4 as an acetylated target of KAT2A/2B, and since PLK4 localizes to centrosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we investigated whether KAT2A or KAT2B also localize to centrosomes, and this across the cell cycle. To this end, we conducted immunofluorescence analyses using antibodies raised against KAT2A, or against KAT2B, together with antibodies against one of several centriolar proteins: HsSAS-6 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>); Centrin-2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>); CP110 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>); or else PLK4ac. These experiments showed that both KAT2A and KAT2B could indeed be detected at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then sought to test when during the cell cycle such centrosomal localization occurs, focusing our analysis on KAT2A. This revealed that KAT2A, which is known to localize to the nucleus in interphase and to spindle poles in mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, localized also to centrosomes, in particular in late G1 and around the G1/S transition, coinciding with the onset of centriole formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). PLK4 is enriched at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle and is thought to be critical during late G1 and/or at the G1/S transition to initiate centriole assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In agreement with the fact that PLK4 is acetylated by KAT2A/2B, we found that the percentage of cells in which PLK4ac and KAT2A were both present at centrosomes was maximal in late G1 and the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These observations together suggest that PLK4/PLK4ac and KAT2A/2B co-localize at centrosomes, primarily during late G1 and early S phases.</p>
        <p>We next addressed whether KAT2A and PLK4 could associate in cells during late G1 and early S phases. To this end, we first synchronized HeLa Kyoto cells in G1/S using a double thymidine block and then released them for given times before collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Whole-cell protein lysates (WCLs) were prepared and the cell cycle profile verified using the cell cycle progression markers Cyclin E and PLK1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Using these staged protein extracts, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were carried out with anti-KAT2A antibodies or with control antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Western blot analysis using anti-PLK4 and anti-KAT2A antibodies showed that KAT2A co-immunoprecipitated PLK4 mainly during the G1/S transition and S phases, while no PLK4 was detected in the control IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Therefore, our results together suggest that KAT2A/2B and PLK4 co-localize at centrosomes and can associate mostly during late G1 and S phases in human cells.</p>

        <title>KAT2-containing complexes regulate centrosome duplication</title>
        <p>Next, we set out to investigate the role of KAT2A/2B in the regulation of centrosome number in human cells. We previously reported that depletion of the ADA2a/ADA3 subunits of the AT module of the ATAC complex results in supernumerary centrosomes in 3T3-NIH fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, compatible with the idea that KAT2A/2B may be negative regulators of centrosome duplication. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. To investigate the hypothesis that KAT2A/2B negatively regulates centrosome numbers through PLK4 acetylation, human U2OS cells were transfected with an expression vector expressing human KAT2A or its catalytic dead double point mutant (KAT2Amut)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed and centrosomes were visualized by immunofluorescence using antibodies against the pericentriolar material component Î³-tubulin and the centriole component Centrin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Whereas cells overexpressing the wild-type (WT) version of KAT2A did not experience alterations in centrosome number, we found that cells overexpressing KAT2Amut had supernumerary centrosomes, suggestive of a dominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Moreover, we found that shRNA-mediated depletion of KAT2A, as well as that of ADA2a or ADA3, which are all subunits of the AT module of ATAC complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, led to a similar phenotype as that of cells overexpressing KAT2Amut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Note that the knockdown of ADA3 depletes the AT activity of both KAT2A- and the KAT2B-containing ATAC complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Together, these results indicate that KAT2A/2B AT activity in the ATAC coactivator complexes plays an essential role in restricting centrosome duplication in human cells.</p>

        <title>Acetylation of PLK4 stabilizes its inactive conformation</title>
        <p>Dynamic switching between active and inactive conformations regulates kinases so that their inhibition can be achieved by trapping them in their inactive state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Scrutiny of the PLK4 kinase domain revealed that K45 and K46 are located at the N-terminal extremity of Î±-helix B, a short helix situated N-terminal and almost perpendicular to the main regulatory Î±-helix C of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Thus, acetylation of K45 and K46 residues by KAT2s could conceivably affect the structure of the kinase domain and/or its dynamic equilibrium between active/inactive conformations. To address these possibilities and to understand the consequences of K45 and K46 acetylation, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the kinase domain. These <italic>in silico</italic> experiments revealed that such acetylation is expected to directly affect the H-bond network of K45 and K46, thus suppressing their interactions with neighbouring charged residues and weakening a few backboneâbackbone H-bonds within the N-lobe Î²-sheets of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>).</p>
        <p>The modelling uncovered also that K45/K46 acetylation might alter the structural dynamics of the kinase domain in regions that are somewhat distant from the acetylation site. Of particular interest, differences were noted in interaction networks and residue-to-residue distances, or dihedral angles, which involve amino acids of the kinase domain important for catalytic activity. The modelling indeed established differences in the inactive conformation of the Î²1âÎ²2 loop, which is part of the ATP-binding site. Thus, the acetylated version of the protein adopts a different conformation, in which van der Waals interactions are reinforced in this loop, which may tilt the balance towards the inactivate state. Furthermore, the most sizeable differences due to K45/K46 acetylation are observed around the D<sub>154</sub>F<sub>155</sub>G<sub>156</sub> (DFG) motif of the activation loop, which is central for kinase activation by ensuring transitions between active and inactive structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Moreover, backbone dihedral angles of residues A153 and L157 were affected as well. Importantly, the distribution of phi/psi angles sampled by D154 of the DFG loop differs in the WT and acetylated simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5câf</xref>), additionally suggesting that acetylation could stabilize the inactive conformation of the kinase. In conclusion, the simulation data indicate that K45/K46 acetylation would not only affect structural networks locally, but also at more distant amino acids, which are crucial for kinase catalytic activity. Moreover, these data indicate that such modifications are expected to shift the dynamics of the acetylated PLK4 towards the inactive conformation.</p>

        <title>Acetylation of PLK4 by KAT2A/2B inhibits its kinase activity</title>
        <p>To test the above structural predictions, we set out to determine the influence of acetylation on the kinase activity of the PLK4 kinase domain. Kinase assays were performed with either unmodified or by KAT2A- or KAT2B-acetylated kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6aâd</xref>). Acetylation of the PLK4 kinase domain in these experiments was tested by western blot using an anti-pan-acetyl-lysine antibody, whereas autophosphorylation of the recombinant kinase domain was quantified as a readout of PLK4 kinase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We found that acetylation of the PLK4 kinase domain by either KAT2A or KAT2B significantly reduced PLK4 kinase domain activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6aâd</xref>), with the extent of inhibition inversely correlating with the strength of acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6aâd</xref>). Thus, in agreement with the above modelling data, acetylation of PLK4 has an inhibitory effect on its kinase activity.</p>
        <p>We tested KAT2A- or KAT2B-acetylation-dependent inhibition of PLK4 kinase activity using a different substrate. To this end, we expressed and purified the crypto polo box (CPB) domain of PLK4, another substrate of PLK4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). The kinase domain was pre-acetylated by KAT2A or KAT2B in the presence of CPB, and the phosphorylation of CPB and PLK4 then detected by autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>, see <sup>32</sup>P panel). The effect of the acetylation on the kinase domain was also verified by using the catalytic dead mutants of KAT2A and KAT2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). We found that the presence of either KAT2A or KAT2B AT activity dampened PLK4 kinase domain activity as measured by CBP phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These results confirm that acetylation of PLK4 inhibits its kinase activity.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated whether lysines K45 and K46 are important for regulating PLK4 kinase activity. K to Q replacements mimic acetylation by substituting the charged lysine by a neutral analogue bearing an amide side chain, although it has been suggested also that this may overestimate the impact of this post-translational modification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Moreover, our molecular dynamics simulations of the PLK4 kinase domain containing K45Q and K46Q replacements revealed that the mimic would be imperfect in this case, since the Q side chains are significantly shorter than those of the acetylated K. As a result, local perturbations of the H-bond network around the mutation sites, both in the active and in the inactive conformations, were found in the catalytic site of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>), in contrast to the simulations obtained with acetylated K45/K46, which shifted the equilibrium towards the inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). As an alternative means to test whether lysines K45 and K46 are important for regulating PLK4 kinase activity, we generated a mutant version in which K45 and K46 are replaced with non-acetylable arginine (R) residues. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these substitutions stabilize the kinase in its inactive conformation without influencing its general structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). In spite of the fact that the K45R/K46R mutant cannot be acetylated, the modelling suggested that the arginine substitutions may stabilize the kinase in its inactive conformation similarly (although weaker) as do the acetylations of the K45 and K46 residues in the WT kinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Accordingly, we found that the kinase activity of the K45R/K46R mutant kinase domain was reduced 2.5-fold when compared with the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f,g</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although we cannot formally exclude that the impact of the K45R/K46R mutations might not only influence the acetylation of K45/K46, but also impair the kinase activity irrespective of these modifications, these results taken together indicate that <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation of PLK4 at positions K45 and K46, or mutation of these residues to R45/R46, inhibits PLK4 kinase activity.</p>

By contrast, levels of total centrosomal PLK4 appeared not to be altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).

        <title>PLK4 acetylation by KAT2s prevents centrosome amplification</title>
        <p>To analyse the cellular role of PLK4 acetylation in regulating centrosome numbers, we generated full-length PLK4-GFP vectors with either K45/K46 (WT) or K45R/K46R (double mutant). Cells were transfected with these expression vectors and examined 48âh thereafter by immunofluorescence with antibodies against green fluorescent protein (GFP), to monitor the localization of the fusion proteins, as well as against Centrin-2, to mark centrioles. We noted first that both WT and K45R/K46R mutant version localized to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Second, the number of Centrin-2 foci in mitotic cells was determined as read-out of successful centriole formation. Cells transfected with the empty vector (control) usually harboured four centrin foci in mitosis, with only â¼16% of cells having more than four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). As reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, overexpression of WT PLK4-GFP caused massive centriole amplification, with â¼60% of mitotic cells having more than four centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of PLK4-K45R/K46R-GFP only mildly increased the percentage of cells with more than four centrioles (â¼30% of cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Moreover, the centriole amplification provoked by overexpression of WT PLK4-GFP was dampened by the concomitant overexpression of KAT2A or KAT2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). In addition, as anticipated, removal of PLK4 activity using either siRNAs or the small molecule centrinone also prevented centriole formation in cells that were depleted of KAT2A or KAT2B in addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the combined point mutations in the kinase domain severely impair PLK4 function.</p>
        <p>Next, endogenous PLK4 was depleted using siRNAs targeting the 3â²-untranslated region of the genomic <italic>PLK4</italic> locus, a region that is absent from the two PLK4-GFP (WT and double mutant) expression vectors. Depletion of endogenous PLK4 by siRNA caused centriole underduplication, as evidenced by the fact that â¼30% of cells contained less than three centrioles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). Expression of WT PLK4-GFP rescued this phenotype. In contrast, expression of PLK4-GFP[K45R/K46R] did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>), further demonstrating that this mutant is inactive. Thus, our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments concur to suggest that AT activities of KAT2A/2B and acetylation of K45/46 in PLK4 are necessary to restrict the number of centrosomes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The role for acetylation in the regulation of several cellular processes is well documented. Moreover, the widespread nature of protein acetylation and the large number of identified acetylated proteins (more than 6,000)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> raised questions about the role of individual KATs and their importance in regulating different cellular functions. Here we describe the identification of about 400 proteins acetylated by KAT2A and KAT2B. Gene ontology analyses indicated that these acetylated non-histone proteins play a role in well-defined cellular functions, such as chromatin remodelling, transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell death and cell cycle progression. KAT2A and 2B were already suggested to be involved in several of these processes (see Introduction). Interestingly, here we identified acetylated proteins involved in novel pathways, such as actin-mediated cell contraction, protein transport, phosphorylation and regulation of centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), suggesting that by acetylating these non-histone proteins KAT2A/2B can also regulate their function. It is tempting to speculate that the coordinated acetylation by KAT2A/2B of histones and non-histone proteins at regulatory genomic locations could be linked. Indeed, by loosening the chromatin at their site of action, KAT2A/2B could facilitate the recruitment of factors involved in the chromatin-associated processes mentioned above and modulate their action by further acetylation.</p>
      <p>Other kinases besides PLK4 may be acetylated by KAT2A/2B, including CDK2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), CDK5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) and CDK9 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). However, the mechanism of kinase inhibition is different in those cases when compared with PLK4. Indeed, KAT2A/2B acetylate CDK2, CDK5 and CDK9 at the ATP-binding sites (located at positions K33 of human CDK2 and CDK5, and at position K48 of human CDK9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The impact of acetylation on the ATP-binding site of CDK5 has not been studied. However, mutations of the ATP-binding sites into non-acetylable residues (R) in CDK2 and CDK9 inhibited kinase activity by preventing ATP binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Importantly, our results suggest a different mechanism through which acetylation inhibits kinase activity in the case of PLK4. Indeed, our molecular modelling experiments indicate that acetylation not only affects structural networks near the acetylated lysines, but also at more distant amino acids, which are crucial for kinase catalytic activity (such as the DFG motif). Importantly, in addition, the simulations suggest that these modifications shift the dynamic equilibrium of the acetylated PLK4 towards its inactive conformation. Thus, our data suggest that KAT2A/2B-dependent acetylation of PLK4 in the kinase domain is required to limit kinase activity of PLK4, perhaps primarily during S phase after PLK4 has acted to initiate centriole formation, to avoid subsequent rounds of centriole formation and centrosome overamplification. KAT2A/2B are therefore important for the maintenance of genomic stability.</p>
      <p>The serine/threonine PLK4 is a pivotal regulator of centrosome duplication. Identified PLK4 substrates include Cep152 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) and STIL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, the modifications of which are both critical for the onset of procentriole assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> In this study, we have uncovered that centrosome duplication in mammalian cells is modulated by acetylation of PLK4. Our data indicate that acetylation negatively regulates PLK4 kinase activity and thus prevents centrosome overamplification. This is in line with previous reports showing that lysine acetylation is detected at centrosomes by immunofluorescence using a pan-acetyl lysine antibody<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. While we have described a role for the acetyltransferases KAT2A/2B in the regulation of centriole numbers, other studies have reported roles for lysine deacetylases (KDACs) in regulating centrosome function. For example, it was shown that KDAC8 depletion enhances centrosome splitting in human cells, while KDAC1 depletion or treatment with the KDAC inhibitor trichostatin A had opposite effects, with reduced centrosome splitting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Moreover, it has been proposed that proteins involved in centrosome cohesion would be acetylated and substrates of these KDACs. This suggestion was further supported by localization studies showing that several KDACs, including KDAC1, localize at centrosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. The above findings notwithstanding, the exact mechanism for the regulation of centrosome architecture and/or numbers by KDACs is unclear.</p>
      <p>The activity and stability of PLK4 have to be tightly controlled to avoid severe defects, such as genomic instability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. The mechanisms governing PLK4 protein stability have been well studied, with PLK4 regulating its own stability by autophosphorylation, which triggers ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). However, the mechanisms controlling PLK4 kinase activity have remained elusive. In this study, we show that lysine acetylation regulates PLK4 kinase activity. It is conceivable that degradation of PLK4 and acetylation-dependent inhibition of kinase activity act in concert to achieve a tight control of centrosome duplication. In the future, it will be interesting to investigate whether these PTMs act independently or in a coordinated fashion during cell cycle progression to accurately regulate PLK4 function.</p>

        <p>To generate polyclonal antibodies against PLK4ac, a peptide acetylated at positions K45 and K46 was synthesized: from aa 34 (TGLEVAIKMIDKacKacAMYKAGMVDQR-C) to aa 56. The same peptide without the acetylated residues was also synthetized. The acetylated peptide was coupled to ovalbumin carrier protein and used for immunization of rabbits at the IGBMC rabbit facility. Collected sera were first purified on a SulfoLink column (Pierce) to which the peptide that did not contain the acetylated residue has been conjugated through its C-terminal cysteine. Affinity columns were prepared as specified by the manufacturer. After having passed the sera through the non-acetylated peptide-containing column five times, the flow-through fraction was further purified on an affinity column to which the acetylated peptide had been conjugated. Bound proteins were extensively washed, antibodies were eluted with Tris-Glycine (pH 2.8) buffer, neutralized immediately with 2âM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), dialysed and kept at â20âÂ°C.

In the active form, segments 158â189 and 212â226 were modelled using the structures of PLK2 and PLK3 as starting templates (accession codes: 4i6h and 4b6l, respectively). In the inactive form, residues 165â191 and 211â216 were modelled using an Aurora Kinase structure (accession code 4J8M) as a starting template. This latter structure was chosen because of its similarity with the fold of the N-terminal part of the activation loop of PLK4 (in the inactive structure of PLK4, see PDB ID 4JXF).

We calculated the percentage of existence (occupancy) of the internal H-bonds of the kinase, as well as those mediated by the ATP in the active form using the COOR HBOND module of the CHARMM programme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Pairwise distances between the backbone and the side chain of each residue were calculated by using the distance between the CÎ± atom and the centre of mass of the respective side chain.

Tandem mass spectra were searched using SEQUEST HT within Proteome Discoverer 1.4, against a non-redundant protein sequence database for <italic>H. sapiens</italic> containing 27,858 protein sequence entries (Uniprot, release 2014â11). Cysteine residues were considered to be fully carbamidomethylated (+57âDa statically added), methionine considered to be oxidized (+16âDa dynamically added) and lysine considered to be acetylated (+42âDa dynamically added), and two missed cleavages were permitted. Peptide mass tolerance was set at 7âp.p.m. and 0.5(CID)/0.02(HCD) Da on the precursor and fragment ions, respectively. The minimum peptide length required was six residues. Proteins with at least two peptides were considered identified. The protein identification list was filtered at a false discovery rate below 1%.</p>
        <p>To identify KAT2A/B-dependent acetylated proteins, candidates were considered as potential targets if they lost acetylation on KAT2A/B knockdown. To identify these protein targets, the pool of acetylated peptides identified after tandem MS analyses in five independent control samples (acetylome WT) was compared with the pool of acetylated peptides identified after tandem MS analysis in three independent replicates analyses of KAT2A/2B knocked down cells (acetylome KAT2 KD) Proteins were considered as potential KAT2A/B acetylated targets if they were absent in the three replicates acetylome KAT2 KD analyses and present in at least three of the five replicates of the WT acetylome.</p>
        <p>Acetylation abundance factors were calculated as follows: PLK4 acetylated peptides specifically identified in KAT2A, KAT2B and KAT2A mutant conditions were extracted and compared. Spectral counts for similar acetylated peptides identified across these three conditions were divided by the total PLK4 spectral counts identified in each condition, to normalize for experimental variation encountered between independent runs. This calculation was performed for each acetylated peptide identified, and normalized values were then summed up to define the acetylation abundance factor of PLK4 in each condition tested.</p>

        <p>The gene ontology term analysis of the 398 KAT2A/B targets was performed in Manteia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Venn diagrams were generated using BioVenn <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/">http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/</ext-link>. The sequence logo was generated with Weblogo 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi">http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi</ext-link>). Sequence logos are a graphical representation of an amino-acid multiple sequence alignment. Each logo consists of stacks of symbols, one stack for each position in the sequence. In all, 2,501 distinct âKs' from the list of 398 proteins were used in this analysis with the 10 aa upstream and 10 aa downstream. The K itself is not shown in these logos. A random selection of 5,243 sequences (K in the middle, 21 aa length, 0.05% of the total K) from the total human proteins was used for the comparison. The overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position, while the height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position. The PLK4 multiple protein sequence alignment was performed in ClustalW2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2</ext-link>).

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) KAT2A/2B knockdown efficiency. Tetracycline (Tet) inducible stable HeLa cell lines were used in which shRNAs either not targeting any endogenous transcript (Tet-shCtrl) or targeting KAT2A (Tet-shKAT2A) were expressed under doxycycline (Dox) induction. In the Tet-shKAT2A cell line, a siRNA against <italic>KAT2B</italic> (K2B) was also transfected. The knockdown efficiency of KAT2A, KAT2B and the acetylation of histone H3K9 was tested by western blot analyses. (<bold>b</bold>) In all, 398 potential KAT2A/2B acetylated protein targets were identified as being present in control samples (3/5), but absent in all KAT2A/2B KD-depleted cell lysates. (<bold>c</bold>) Analysis of the frequency of amino acids surrounding the acetylated lysines targeted by KAT2A and KAT2B, as compared with that of amino acids surrounding non-acetylated lysines. In all, 1,569 distinct âKs' from the list of 398 proteins were used in this analysis, with 10 aa upstream (â10 on the <italic>x</italic> axis) and 10 aa downstream (+10 on the <italic>x</italic> axis). The K itself (at position 0) is not shown in these logos. A random selection of 5,243 sequences (K in the middle, 21 aa length, 0.05% of the total K) from the total human proteins was used for the comparison. The overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position, while the height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino acid at that position.

The zooms are rotated with the indicated angles when compared with the structures in the middle. On the right, the atoms of the backbone are included.
