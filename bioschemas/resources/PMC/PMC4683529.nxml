      <abstract>
        <p>BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a nuclear deubiquitinase that regulates tumor suppressor activity and widely involves many cellular processes ranging from cell cycle regulation to gluconeogenesis. Impairment of enzymatic activity and nuclear localization induce abnormal cell proliferation. It is considered to be an important driver gene, which undergoes frequent mutations in several cancers. However the role of mutation and oncogenic gain of function of BAP1 are poorly understood. Here, we investigated cellular localization, enzymatic activity and structural changes for four missense mutants of the catalytic domain of BAP1, which are prevalent in different types of cancer. These mutations triggered cytoplasmic/perinuclear accumulation in BAP1 deficient cells, which has been observed in proteins that undergo aggregation in cellular condition. Amyloidogenic activity of mutant BAP1 was revealed from its reactivity towards anti oligomeric antibody in HEK293T cells. We have also noted structural destabilization in the catalytic domain mutants, which eventually produced beta amyloid structure as indicated in atomic force microscopy study. The cancer associated mutants up-regulate heat shock response and activates transcription of genes normally co-repressed by BAP1. Overall, our results unambiguously demonstrate that structural destabilization and subsequent aggregation abrogate its cellular mechanism leading to adverse outcome.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Since last three decades considerable progress occurred in genome sequencing field that reveals genomic landscape of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Advancement of genomic studies showed that there are more than hundred genes altered due to intragenic mutation. These mutations are essential for oncogenic progression. In a specific tumor type there are some driver genes that regulate core cellular processes like cell fate, cell survival and genome integrity. In recent years, BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1), a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme has emerged as an important tumor suppressor protein, undergoes frequent mutations in different types of tumor and appears as one of the driver genes in cancer types like uveal melanoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, mesothelioma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, renal cell carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, cholangiocarcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and melanocytic tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>Human BAP1 is deubiquitinating enzyme consisting of 729 amino acid whose N-terminal catalytic domain (1â240) shows homology to other ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The C-terminal domain binds to N-terminal RING domain of BRCA1 and regulates BRCA1 mediated tumor suppressor function. BAP1 also acts as a transcriptional regulator wherein it co-activates/co-represses E2F mediated cell cycle genes through direct interaction with Host Cell Factor-1 (HCF1), a co-activator of E2F transcription factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. It is well known that <italic>calypso</italic>, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of BAP1 exists in a complex with the polycomb group (PcG) protein ASXL1 and serves as a polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Reconstituted recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. BAP1 represses genes involved in DNA replication and repair by interacting with Foxk2 and inhibiting H2A monoubiquitination. It also plays a crucial role in double strand DNA break repair through homologous recombination (HR) and it is established that BAP1 acts as a DNA damage signaling and repair enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Mutations in catalytic domain fail to recruit BAP1 in the double strand DNA damage site and impair HR mediated repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> leading to genomic instability, a hallmark in cancer pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
    <p>All types of mutation like insertions, deletions, frameshift, nonsense and missense occur in BAP1 gene located in chromosome 3p21.1, which is a hotspot region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. While BAP1 and its involvement in cancer is typically caused by mutations that lead to loss of protein function or deletion of key regulatory domains, missense mutations are more prevalent in tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database showed that out of 108 disease-associated mutations identified 69 (~60%) are located in the catalytic domain of BAP1. It is well known that hot spot mutations of any gene or predisposition of genetic elements has severe consequences on structure and function of protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Structural destabilization of proteins and its role in growing number of human diseases specifically neurodegeneration and cancer are well-established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Uncontrolled overexpression or structural instability caused by mutations contributes to gain of toxic function and shows dominant negative effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. There are evidences of missense mutations in cancer where a single change of an amino acid residue plays a major role in tumor progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The well known tumor suppressor protein p53 undergoes beta amyloid aggregation due to point mutations which has been studied thoroughly for the last few years. The molecular mechanism of aggregation of p53 in single molecule level has also been elucidated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Destabilizing mutants of p53 not only aggregate themselves but also induce the aggregation of wild type protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. It also coaggregates with other proteins like p63 and p73 in different types of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Recently, small molecules are identified to stabilize the aggregating mutants of p53 which might play a role in improvement of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. However, it remains unexplored how protein aggregation caused by alteration of protein structure particularly oncogene or tumor suppressor leads to induction of malignancy.</p>
    <p>To address these questions, we have screened missense mutations in genomic landscape of BAP1 and found that catalytic domain mutations play an important role in oncogenic progression. In the present report, we have demonstrated for the first time that cancer associated catalytic domain mutants (I47F, F81V, A95D and G178V) of BAP1 show a loss of enzymatic activity, significantly decreased protein stability and subsequently lead to beta amyloid aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Up-regulation of heat shock response and changes in transcriptional activity of genes related to cell cycle control occur as a consequence of BAP1 inactivation. Our results indicate loss of BAP1 function due to aggregation.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Sequence alignment of all UCH members of deubiquitinases showed that there are number of amino acids conserved in the UCH domain from flies to human and also among the family members, indicating their critical role in protein structure and function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a, b</xref>). Domain wise distribution of all missense mutants of BAP1 in cancer and location of the mutations in UCH domain are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. Earlier studies reported that A95D and G178V mutations impaired catalytic activity in lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. However the molecular basis of inactivation has not been elucidated. Here, we have included two other cancer-associated mutants I47F and F81V, which are also found in different types of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The homology model structure of BAP1 predicts that A95D position is close to catalytic cysteine residue and in the same helix whereas I47F, F81V and G178V mutants are away from catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). One may argue that the positioning of mutations in the rigid catalytic cleft disrupts the structural fold and that could be the possible reason for catalytic inactivation. However, there are no biochemical studies so far. Here we have attempted to explain the molecular basis of enzymatic inactivation of BAP1 upon mutation.</p>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Cytoplasmic sequestration of BAP1 in cancer associated mutants</title>
        <p>To understand how a single amino acid change affects protein localization at the cellular level, site specific mutations have been incorporated in HA-FLAG-BAP1 plasmid by site directed mutagenesis. We transiently over expressed wild type and mutant BAP1 in human lung squamous carcinoma cell line NCI-H226, which is devoid of endogenous BAP1. Immunofluorescence study showed that cytoplasmic sequestration of BAP1 occurs due to point mutation in the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To our surprise catalytic dead mutant C91S showed less intensity of BAP1 in nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). It is interesting to note that the cancer-associated mutants I47F, F81V, A95D and G178V showed significantly lower nuclear localization than C91S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). On the other hand, these mutants showed much higher perinuclear accumulation as compared to C91S and wild type BAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In our subsequent studies, we investigated BAP1 destabilization effect in cellular conditions as well as protein level.</p>

        <title>BAP1 mutants display prefibrillar aggregates in HEK293T cells</title>
        <p>Asymmetrical nuclear distribution of BAP1 prompted us to investigate the role of mutant BAP1 in perturbation of protein function. In earlier reports, there are predictions that the missense mutation induces protein structure destabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Therefore, to examine the mechanism behind cytoplasmic accumulation of BAP1 we transiently overexpressed empty vector (EV), BAP1 wild type (WT), I47F, F81V, A95D, G178V and C91S mutants in HEK293T cells. All mutants showed similar expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography was performed to fractionate cellular extracts of wild type and mutants. Each chromatographic fraction was subjected to dot blot analysis with anti-BAP1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Dot-blot analysis showed that wild type protein eluted in wide range of molecular weight fractions from 2,000 kDa to 70 kDa due to formation of multi-protein complex. On the other hand, A95D, G178V and C91S mutants were eluted from void volume to 400 kDa. To characterize the nature of high molecular weight fractions we have tested the reactivity of each chromatographic fraction with anti-A11 antibody, which specifically reacts with prefibrillar amyloid aggregates. Wild type and catalytically inactive mutant C91S showed less reactivity towards A11. Conversely, cancer associated mutants showed high reactivity with A11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To verify the destabilization effect of these mutants we have centrifuged cellular extracts of wild type and mutants at 1,00,000âÃâ<italic>g</italic>, separated pellet and supernatant fractions. Pellet was dissolved in equal amount of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by western blot. Wild type and C91S mutants were detected more in soluble fraction while I47F, F81V, A95D and G178V were observed more in pellet fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Together with microscopic data, these experiments further demonstrated aggregation of mutant BAP1 in cellular conditions.</p>

        <title>Loss of deubiquitinase activity of mutant BAP1 is associated with structural instability</title>
        <p>For better understanding of the physiochemical behavior of BAP1 mutants, His-tag BAP1 (1â729) was cloned, expressed and purified. Expression of full-length protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> was considerably low hence all biochemical and enzymatic experiments were carried out using the catalytic domain of BAP1 (1â240). Catalytic domain of BAP1 was subcloned into pGEX-6PI vector and protein was purified according to standard GST purification protocol. I47F, F81V and C91S mutants were purified similarly as wild type protein however A95D and G178V appeared mostly in pellet fraction after homogenization and centrifugation. Therefore, we modified the purification protocol by adding 0.1% TritonX100 and 5% glycerol during suspension. To examine <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of mutation on enzymatic activity of BAP1 we performed deubiquitinase assay using a model substrate, Ub-AMC. Wild type BAP1 (1â240) showed higher enzymatic activity as compared to full length BAP1 (WT FL). Lower enzymatic activity of BAP1 full length might be due to auto-inhibition by C-terminal domain (UCH L5 like domain or ULD domain). F81V and A95D showed a complete loss of enzymatic activity while I47F and G178V reflected basal level activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), which is probably due to perturbation of hydrophobic packing in the core structure. Inhibition of enzymatic activity by the mutants prompted us to further investigate mutational effect on protein structure.</p>
        <p>We conducted circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to examine the effect of mutation on the secondary structure of BAP1 catalytic domain. Secondary structure analysis showed differences in curves of I47F and A95D. However, G178V mutant showed a complete destabilization effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In order to understand the mutational effect on protein stability, we performed thermal melting analysis of wild type and mutant BAP1 (1â240). The cancer-associated mutants induce thermal instability, which is reflected in Tm values. A sharp transition curve was observed in wild type catalytic domain, C91S and F81V with a melting temperature of ~48âÂ°C, 49âÂ°C and 47âÂ°C respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). I47F mutant exhibited identical sharp transition curves with lowering of Tm value (~39âÂ°C) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) Sharp transitions are associated with cooperative unfolding where initially the protein exists as a highly compact well-folded structure whereas a gradual non-cooperative transition indicates that the protein exists as a flexible, partially unfolded or heterogeneous population of folded structure. A95D, G178V and BAP1 full length do not show cooperative melting curve but they aggregate rapidly as temperature is increased. Circular dichroism analysis revealed increase in beta sheet after heating wild type and mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Circular dichroism experiment results proved that the cancer-associated mutants destabilize the protein structure, which eventually translates into catalytic function loss.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Analysis of aggregation propensity of BAP1</title>
        <p>To understand why structurally destabilizing mutations in BAP1 induce oligomerization, we used TANGO, an algorithm for predicting protein aggregation sequences and to identify regions in protein that has more oligomerization propensity. Here, we have identified a few prone segments that span residues from 13â20, 43â52, 78â100 and 656â680. These residues are mostly hydrophobic. The segment comprising residues from 43â52 shows the highest TANGO score representing maximum tendency to form beta aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The homology model structure of BAP1 catalytic domain shows that aggregation prone regions lie in hydrophobic core of protein. Mutation in catalytic domain of BAP1 destabilizes its secondary structure, is likely to expose the regions that are normally buried in hydrophobic core, such as the aggregation-nucleating region. So these mutations are also prone to trigger aggregation of BAP1 by assembly of beta amyloid type aggregates into a sheet like structure.</p>

        <title>BAP1 mutants showed beta amyloid aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>Based on the melting behavior of wild type and mutants; we determined misfolding characteristics of BAP1 protein. Exposed hydrophobic surface of a protein plays a significant role in protein aggregation and change of single amino acid residue may alter the physico-chemical property of specific site leading to structural destabilization. Therefore, we have investigated the differential binding behaviors of wild type and mutant proteins with ANS dye. ANS specifically binds to exposed hydrophobic surfaces which is necessary for the initiation of oligomer formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. ANS binding results revealed a rapid exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in mutants of BAP1 as temperature is increased. The I47F mutant showed highest change of fluorescence intensity starting with a lag phase indicating association of monomers with oligomers and then rapid increase in the log phase, which indicates acceleration of aggregation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). F81V, A95D and G178V showed increase in ANS binding compared to wild type BAP1 while C91S behaves like BAP1 wild type protein. We have also measured binding of BAP1 protein to Thioflavin-T (ThT) dye, which binds specifically to ordered aggregates. Comparison of ThT binding activity with BAP1 wild type and mutants was examined at 25âÂ°C and heat induced condition (37âÂ°C). Enhancement of ThT fluorescence of mutant protein after heating indicates ordered aggregate formation. It is interesting to note that full length BAP1 also binds with ThT confirming its inherent amyloidogenic character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p>
        <p>We have characterized morphology of protein aggregates after heat-induced condition by atomic force microscopy. All cancer associated mutants showed fibrillar aggregates upon heating though the extent of fibrillization varies in each mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Full length BAP1 (1â729) also exhibited fine fibrillar structure when heated. It is evident from TANGO analysis that BAP1 has several beta propensity regions mostly in catalytic and ULD domain. Consensus structure prediction also revealed that the middle region of BAP1 is mostly unstructured. This might be the probable reason for heat induced aggregation behavior of full length BAP1. In fact, the fibrillar structure of full length BAP1 corroborates with Tm analysis as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>. In summary, BAP1 resembles amyloidogenic properties of aggregation prone proteins and instigated us to investigate loss of functional activity of BAP1 due to mutation.</p>

        <title>Cellular toxicity of mutant BAP1</title>
        <p>Oligomer A11 antibody specifically binds to the prefibrillar protein aggregates and here we have demonstrated that BAP1 and cancer associated mutants overexpressed in HEK293T cells showed strong reactivity against A11. It has been established that cells exposed to prefibrillar aggregates or beta amyloid aggregates induce cell death response. Here we have tested the effect of BAP1 catalytic domain mutant aggregates on cellular toxicity. Prefibrillar aggregates of BAP1 (1â240) wild type and mutants were generated by heat induction at 37âÂ°C. All mutants showed higher reactivity against A11 compared to BAP1 (1â240) wild type and its C91S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We also tested the reactivity of the same aggregates with OC antibody, which specifically binds to amyloid fibrils. BAP1 wild type and mutant aggregates also showed reactivity against OC. Our results demonstrated that in the experimental condition there is a mixed population of prefibrillar and fibrillar aggregate which corroborates with our AFM results. Cellular toxicity of prefibrillar aggregates was tested by cell viability assay in HEK293T cells. Cells exposed to mutant aggregates showed higher mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) in MTT assay.</p>

        <title>Aggregation of mutant BAP1 up-regulates heat shock protein response</title>
        <p>The question remains however elusive as how aggregation of mutant BAP1 is linked to cancer pathogenesis. The heat shock proteins specifically Hsp70 and Hsp90 are known to be overexpressed in cancers and several chaperone proteins promote tumor cell proliferation while inhibiting cell death pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Hsp90 acts directly upon amyloidogenic substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Hsp70 is found to be associated with misfolded proteins and overexpressed in metastatic cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Chaperones are critical to guide protein folding and their up-regulation enhances oncogenic progression. They help in modulating destabilized structure and facilitate inhibition of oligomer formation. Protein aggregation is one of the strong trigger factors of heat shock response and BAP1 might acquire the tumorigenic properties through the activation of heat shock proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. The cancer-associated mutants and BAP1 wild type were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells to assess Hsp90 and Hsp70 expression by western blot. I47F and F81V showed almost 1.5 to 3.0 fold up-regulation in Hsp90 protein levels with a marginal up-regulation in Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). qPCR analysis of Hsp70 and Hsp90 also corroborated with western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Molecular chaperones are known to be up-regulated transcriptionally during misfolding response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Therefore, up-regulation of Hsps at gene level in BAP1 mutation may drive tumorigenesis.</p>

        <title>Impact of missense mutations on transcriptional regulation</title>
        <p>It is well known that BAP1 is associated with chromatin and acts as a co-activator/co-repressor for its target genes. It is recognized as an important regulator protein that dynamically controls transcriptional responses. It controls activation and deactivation of genes related to DNA replication and repair by interacting with transcription factors like Foxk2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. To determine the effect of mutants on transcriptional activity, we have transfected HEK293T cells with wild type and mutant plasmids. We performed quantitative PCR on genes which are regulated by BAP1 (<italic>MCM3, CDKN1B</italic> and <italic>TP53I3</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. MCM3 is a protein required during initiation of DNA replication, <italic>CDKN1B</italic> is a cell cycle regulator gene and <italic>TP53I3</italic> is up-regulated during cellular stress. Therefore, transactivity of these genes are important in regulation of oncogenesis. We found that mutants I47F, F81V and A95D significantly increased the expression of genes where BAP1 acts as a co-repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). I47F and A95D augmented expression of <italic>MCM3, CDKN1B</italic> and <italic>TP53I3</italic> to three fold as compared to wild type. F81V and catalytic inactive mutant C91S showed marginal increase in expression of these genes. To our surprise, G178V did not show any impact on gene regulation. Collectively, these results suggest mutational loss of BAP1 can lead to dominant negative effect. Role of BAP1 in gene silencing has important implications in its anti-tumorigenic potential. Therefore, loss of BAP1 function due to mutation might lead to cancer progression.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous reports of BAP1 mutations showed wide range of consequences on tumor suppressor activity that contributes to oncogenic progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The effects of these mutations are highly diverse including loss of deubiquitinase activity, aberrant nuclear trafficking to cell cycle progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Different types of mutations are found but missense type is predominant in UCH domain which is the core activity domain of BAP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Here, we report that BAP1 protein undergoes aggregation due to mutation at protein and cellular level. Oligomerization propensity of BAP1 in catalytic domain is due to presence of abundant hydrophobic patches. Minor alterations in these hydrophobic regions expose a stretch of aggregation prone sequence leading to structural destabilization as observed in the ANS binding study. In BAP1 null cells, mutant protein accumulates in cytoplasmic region and impairs nuclear localization. The question arises what disturbs nuclear localization of BAP1. The mono ubiquitination of BAP1 by UBE2O ligase induces its cytoplasmic stay and auto deubiquitination of BAP1 protects it from cytoplasmic sequestration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Our observations revealed that auto deubiquitination activity is not only responsible for contributing to cytoplasmic sequestration or perinuclear accumulation. Cytoplasmic sequestration or perinuclear localization as a consequence of protein aggregation is a well-known phenomenon and it is observed in several proteins like p53, Htt proteins, ataxin-3 and TDP43<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It is known that misfolded proteins undergo oligomerization to form high molecular weight aggregates that perturb nuclear trafficking of proteins. Thus BAP1 aggregation could be one of the causes for cytoplasmic sequestration or perinuclear accumulation for cancer associated mutants. In cellular condition, reactivity of oligomer specific antibody (A11) with cancer-associated mutants of BAP1 demonstrated that they form prefibrillar aggregates. These prefibrillar aggregates induce cellular toxicity, which is a characteristic behavior for aggregation prone protein.</p>
      <p>Our biochemical study revealed that loss of enzymatic activity of BAP1 is associated with mutation in the catalytic domain. The thermal melting and circular dichroism studies have indicated that cancer associated mutations destabilize protein structure leading to the loss of activity. Circular dichroism analysis showed that there is an increase in beta sheet or disordered structure in mutants as compared to wild type when heated. In heat induced condition, catalytic domain protein aggregates also showed binding with A11 antibody confirming its prefibrillar nature which eventually produce more rigid beta amyloid aggregates as evident from OC antibody reactivity, ThT binding and AFM studies. These prefibrillar aggregates of BAP1 induce cytoxicity in HEK 293T cells which is contrary to its tumor suppressor function. But aggregation of p53 also induces cell death in cells. Gain of toxic function is important incase of amyloid diseases and cancer is now considered to be one of the amyloid specific diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. p53 induced cell death releases toxic aggregates that may cause chemoresistance in some kind of tumors or they may be transmitted for immortalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results also lend support to the consequences of aggregation in functional activity of BAP1. We found that mutant BAP1 up-regulated heat shock response. Activation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 both at protein and gene level was observed. Heat shock proteins act as biochemical buffer to maintain stability of cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Therefore, activation of this response due to conformational change in BAP1 links mutational effect of BAP1 with cancer. Another important aspect of BAP1 mutation towards functional loss is impairment of regulatory role of BAP1 in gene transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Here, mutants of BAP1 showed higher levels of <italic>MCM3, CDKN1B</italic> and <italic>TP53I3</italic> expression where BAP1 acts as a co-repressor. BAP1 plays a major role in gene silencing mechanism by deubiquitinating H2A along with other interacting partners like Foxk2. Here, missense mutations in BAP1 increase transcriptional activity. Transcription of specific genes like <italic>MCM3</italic> and <italic>CDKN1B</italic> effects tumor suppressor ability of BAP1. TP53I3 is a regulator of cellular stress and activation of this gene due to BAP1 inactivation might aggravate oncogenic activity. So, these results highlight negative effect of BAP1 mutations at cellular level.</p>
      <p>Our study unambiguously demonstrated that cancer associated catalytic domain BAP1 mutations destabilize protein structure leading to formation of beta amyloid aggregates. Aggregation of protein and its association with cancer biology are not very well understood. However, there are a few examples where tumor suppressor protein p53 showed beta aggregation properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In fact, prion and protein-only inheritance in cancer is recently appreciated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Amyloidogenicity of BAP1 will inevitably strengthen the prion hypothesis in cancer biology; however a detailed molecular study is necessary to understand its aggregation mechanism. Here we have hypothesized a schematic model showing that structural destabilization of BAP1 after mutation in the catalytic domain leads to aggregation followed by cytoplasmic sequestration and subsequent functional loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). According to our hypothesis, oligomerization of mutant BAP1 inhibits PR-DUB complex formation and deubiquitination of histone 2A due to loss of its catalytic activity and impairment of nuclear transport that culminates into enhancement of oncogenic activity thereby explaining the effect of missense mutations in BAP1. Finally, correlating BAP1 mutation and cancer outcome at molecular level will help us to understand tumor biology and potential therapeutic development to combat cancer in general.</p>
