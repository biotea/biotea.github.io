      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Once stimulated, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) undergoes self-phosphorylation, which, on the one hand, instigates signaling cascades, and on the other hand, recruits CBL ubiquitin ligases, which mark EGFRs for degradation. Using RNA interference screens, we identified a deubiquitinating enzyme, Cezanne-1, that opposes receptor degradation and enhances EGFR signaling. These functions require the catalytic and ubiquitin-binding domains of Cezanne-1, and they involve physical interactions and trans-phosphorylaton of Cezanne-1 by EGFR. In line with the ability of Cezanne-1 to augment EGF-induced growth and migration signals, the enzyme is overexpressed in breast cancer. Congruently, the corresponding gene is amplified in approximately one third of mammary tumors, and high transcript levels predict an aggressive disease course. In conclusion, deubiquitination by Cezanne-1 curtails degradation of growth factor receptors, thereby promotes oncogenic growth signals.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P2">Binding of EGF to the cognate transmembrane receptor, EGFR, stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and culminates in cell fate decisions. Importantly, these positively acting processes are coupled to a web of negatively acting feedback loops (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Avraham and Yarden, 2010</xref>). One robust and early feedback loop entails targeting activated EGFRs to degradation in lysosomes, or to an escape recycling route (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009</xref>). EGFR transfer from endosomes back to the plasma membrane is thought to enhance intracellular signaling (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Fehrenbacher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Goh <italic>et al.</italic></xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Vieira <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The regulation of receptor trafficking and the underlying intracellular signals appear complex and redundant. Sorting at the plasma membrane is executed by adaptors of clathrin, the phosphotyrosine-binding protein GRB2 (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Goh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and the kinase inhibitor RALT/MIG6 (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Frosi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). By contrast, sorting at the multi-vesicular body (MVB), a pre-lysosomal compartment, depends on an E3 ligase molecule called CBL (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Levkowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, CBL modifies multiple lysine residues, located within the kinase domain of EGFR, with monomeric (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Haglund <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Mosesson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), as well as with polymeric ubiquitin molecules (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Ubiquitin moieties attached to EGFR are then recognized by a set of ubiquitin-binding adaptors of the clathrin coat (e.g., Epsin). These adaptors harbor ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs), and thereby assemble active receptors at clathrin-coated regions of the plasma membrane, endosomes and the MVB (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Katzmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Although they are topologically different, the sorting assemblies (called: endosomal sorting complexes required for transport; ESCRTs) share a mechanism of cargo dissociation and reloading: at the endosome, E3 ligases of the AIP4/Nedd4 family ubiquitinate the ubiquitin binders, for example HRS, to promote their intramolecular folding in a way that dissociates the cargo and enables loading of a new receptor upon their de-ubiquitination (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Katz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Polo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P3">Enzymatic deubiquitination of the endocytic machinery, as well as deubiquitination of receptor molecules, play essential regulatory roles (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sacco <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Approximately 100 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are known that fall into five classes: ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), the ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs), Josephins, the JAB1/MPN/MOV3 metalloenzymes (JAMM), and the ovarian tumor proteases (OTUDs). At least three DUBs are involved, either directly or indirectly, in EGFR endocytosis. The best characterized is AMSH, a JAMM family member whose knockdown leads to enhanced degradation of EGFR (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bowers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">McCullough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Targeting of AMSH to endosomes may occur via clathrin (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) or by ESCRT-III (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The roles for another endosomal DUB, UBPY (USP8), deviate from a simple model of receptor deubiquitination, as this enzyme is involved in stabilization of two endosomal sorting components, HRS and STAM, and it destabilizes EGFR (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Row <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). A third DUB regulating EGFR, namely USP18, acts at the level of protein translation (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Duex and Sorkin, 2009</xref>). The present study assumed that yet uncovered DUBs regulate EGFR endocytosis, hence applied screens of siRNA libraries to EGF-stimulated cells. In addition to AMSH, our screen identified an OTUD family member, Cezanne-1, as an enzyme able to stabilize ligand-activated EGFRs. In agreement with the ability of Cezanne-1 to enhance receptor signaling, we found that the expression of the corresponding gene, from a locus frequently amplified in tumors, predicts short survival of breast cancer patients.</p>

        <title>siRNA screens identify Cezanne proteins as EGFR-specific DUBs</title>
        <p id="P4">To identify EGFR-regulating enzymes, we performed siRNA screens of the majority of human DUBs. Because EGFR is expressed in epithelial cell types, we assumed that the putative DUB is co-expressed in epithelial tumor cells, such as KB oral cells. Hence, we transfected KB cells with siRNA duplexes against different DUBs, and stimulated the cells with EGF. This strategy was confirmed by transfecting KB cells with siRNA oligonucleotides specific to AMSH (as a positive control), or USP19, as a negative control. Ligand-induced degradation of EGFR was moderately enhanced upon AMSH knockdown, consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">McCullough <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition to AMSH, our screens of 95 human DUBs identified Cezanne-1, a DUB previously implicated in NFÎºB signaling (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Enesa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Evans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and its family member, Cezanne-2, as candidate DUBs of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Accordingly, simultaneous knockdown of Cezanne-1 and Cezanne-2 by using two pools of four oligonucleotides (approximately 70% and 50%, respectively) moderately enhanced both basal and inducible degradation of EGFR, whereas the reciprocal silencing of c-CBL and CBL-b showed the expected opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P5">Because Cezanne-1 is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells (see below), but Cezanne-2 displays no extensive alterations, we focused on Cezanne-1. To extend the effects beyond KB cells to other Cezanne-1 expressing cell, we employed the widely used HeLa cells, which were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Cezanne-1 and a Flag-tagged ubiquitin. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref> confirmed that Cezanne-1 overexpression associates with remarkably reduced ubiquitination of EGFR, as well as with stabilization the receptor and an increase in auto-phosphorylation. Application of a reciprocal approach in HeLa cells, which employed specific siRNAs, confirmed that knockdown of Cezanne-1 correlates with accelerated degradation and decreased receptor phosphorylation. Moreover, diminished phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Notably, silencing Cezanne-1 inactivated EGFR's kinase prior to receptor degradation, probably due to enhanced ubiquitination that either disabled the enzyme or occluded lysine acceptors of ubiquitin. In conclusion, our genetic screens and validation tests indicated that Cezanne-1 regulates EGFR levels, as well as downstream signals.</p>

        <title>Cezanne-1 stabilizes and physically interacts with EGFR</title>
        <p id="P6">Cezanne-1 and Cezanne-2 belong to the family of Otubains, which harbor a catalytically active deubiquitinating domain (OTU) and two ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs): a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) and an A20-like Zinc Finger (ZnF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To study the functions of Cezanne-1, we generated a set of mutants: The catalytic cysteine of OTU was replaced by a serine, generating a catalytically inactive mutant (C194S). Likewise, we deleted the UBA and the ZnF (ÎUBA and ÎZnF). Previous studies defined the A20-like ZnF of Rabex as a UBD that employs a diaromatic patch to recognize a polar region centered on Asp58 of ubiquitin (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Hence, we also mutated the respective diaromatic patch of Cezanne-1 (mutants denoted F809A and Y810A). Comparison of Cezanne-1 WT and C194S confirmed that overexpression of WT caused stabilization of EGFR following stimulation with EGF, but C194S accelerated EGFR degradation, in line with functionality of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">Next, we sought to determine if Cezanne-1 and EGFR maintain bi-directional enzyme-substrate interactions. As a first step, we overexpressed WT and C194S, along with EGFR, in HEK-293T cells. In addition, to enhance ubiquitination, we also transfected c-CBL, and stimulated the cells under conditions that partly inhibit EGFR degradation. This experiment suggested that both forms of Cezanne-1 can co-immunoprecipitate with the un-stimulated EGFR molecule, and this interaction can be enhanced upon EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Co-expression of c-CBL, which leads to increased receptor ubiquitination, further strengthened the interaction. Interestingly, C194S displayed slightly weaker co-precipitation. Nevertheless, when combined with c-CBL, this mutant precipitated a high molecular weight form of EGFR, probably the ubiquitinated version (marked by an arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These observations implied that Cezanne-1 pre-assembles with EGFR molecules. Upon activation by EGF, these interactions are enhanced, probably due to receptor ubiquitination. In line with this model, when we co-expressed EGFR and Cezanne-1 under conditions that inhibit receptor degradation due to overexpression, we observed EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cezanne-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Importantly, a mutant lacking the ZnF lost the ability to undergo inducible phosphorylation, but the catalytically-defective C194S mutant retained tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations predicted rapid onset of EGFR-Cezanne complexes, followed by dissociation due to deubiquitination. Indeed, in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment of the endogenous EGFR and Cezanne-1, the peak time of complex formation was reached 5 minutes after stimulation, and this was followed by a rapid decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In conclusion, EGF-induced and CBL-mediated ubiquitination of EGFR permit phosphorylation and recruitment of Cezanne-1 to multiple ubiquitins, but subsequent deubiquitination by Cezanne-1 dissociates the complex.</p>

        <title>Deubiquitination of EGFR by Cezanne-1 inhibits receptor downregulation</title>
        <p id="P8">To ascertain the effect of Cezanne-1 on EGFR ubiquitination, HeLa cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Cezanne-1, either WT or a catalytically inactive mutant, and a Flag-tagged ubiquitin. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> confirmed the necessity of the catalytic function of Cezanne-1 for deubiquitination of EGFR. The reciprocal experiment, in which we knocked-down both Cezanne-1 and Cezanne-2 detected increased ubiquitin/receptor ratios and enhanced rates of receptor degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In summary, the combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches lent support to the conclusion that Cezanne family proteins regulate the level of EGFR ubiquitination.</p>
        <p id="P9">To validate enzyme-substrate relations, we performed in vitro deubiquitination experiments. HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated. In parallel, recombinant forms of a His-tagged Cezanne-1 (WT and C194S) were purified from bacteria, and incubated with the immunoprecipitated receptor. Blotting for ubiquitinated receptors confirmed that Cezanne-1 WT can deubiquitinate EGFR in vitro. In contrast, C194S showed no evidence of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Next we analyzed the effects of Cezanne-1-mediated deubiquitination on receptor endocytosis. HeLa cells were stimulated for up to 2 hours with physiological concentrations of EGF (2 ng/ml), and receptors remaining on the cell surface were quantified with a radioactive EGF. Overexpression of Cezanne-1 WT inhibited receptor downregulation at all time intervals. In contrast, both C194S and ÎZnF exerted no inhibitory effects and a third mutant, ÎUBA, resembled the phenotype induced by WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and data not shown). In conclusion, the deubiquitinating and ubiquitin-binding function of Cezanne-1 enable rescue of EGFR from intracellular degradation.</p>

        <title>The Zinc Finger of Cezanne-1 interacts with the non-canonical ubiquitin face centered on aspartate 58</title>
        <p id="P10">While many UBDs recognize the canonical surface of ubiquitin centered on Ile-44, ubiquitin may also be recognized via an Asp-58-centered interface (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Penengo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). To determine the specificity of the ZnF, we employed mutants of the diaromatic motif of the ZnF of Cezanne-1, the putative Asp-58 interfacing site, as well as ubiquitins mutated at Ile44 and Asp-58. As a first step, we incubated cell extracts containing Cezanne-1 (WT or FY/AA) with bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of ubiquitin (Ub; WT, D58A, or I44A). The results of this experiment indicated that the WT form of Cezanne-1 specifically binds with either surface of ubiquitin, presumably because the UBA recognizes Ile-44 whereas the ZnF binds with Asp-58. This model was supported by the observed inability of FY/AA to recognize Ub-I44A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Further support was provided by an experiment that tested individual ZnF mutants: F809A (which bound Ub-I44A) and Y810A, which practically lost the ability to recognize Ub-I44A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). To determine the affinity of monoubiquitin binding to the ZnF, we used Surface Plasmon Resonance. The GST-ZnF was immobilized on a CM-5 chip, and a flow of HA-monoubiquitin was injected at different concentrations, essentially as described before (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Crosetto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The calculated dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>), 205 ÂµM, for the ZnF-Ub complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) is well within the low affinity range of interactions compared to other UBDs (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Dikic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">To evaluate the biological significance of the recognition of ubiquitin by the ZnF, we co-transfected cells with EGFR, along with either WT or ÎZnF Cezanne-1. As expected, the WT form of Cezanne-1 inhibited ligand-dependent degradation of EGFR. However, ÎZnF failed to inhibit receptor degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), in line with a critical role for ubiquitin binding. A similar analysis, in which we applied a more detailed time course, proposed that the ZnF is essential for Cezanne-1 mediated retardation of EGFR degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), possibly by binding to the Asp-58 surface of ubiquitins decorating internalized EGFRs. In summary, our data indicate that the A20-like ZnF of Cezanne-1 contacts ubiquitin via Asp-58, and that the interfacing residue involves Tyr-810 of Cezanne-1. Moreover, the Asp-58/Tyr-810 interaction is necessary for the stabilizing effect of Cezanne-1 toward EGFR.</p>

These results are consistent with findings reported by a previous mass-spectrometry study (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sowa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and they reinforce the notion that Cezanne-1 regulates receptor endocytosis.</p>

        <title>Cezanne-1 associates with cellular proliferation, migration and malignancy of breast lesions</title>
        <p id="P13">To address the consequences of Cezanne-1-mediated stabilization of active EGFRs, we established HeLa clones stably overexpressing the enzyme, and performed a clonogenic assay under anchorage-dependent conditions. As expected, overexpression of the DUB resulted in more abundant and larger colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The reason for these differences was provided by a cell growth assay: whereas control cells reached saturation, overexpression of Cezanne-1 released cells from density-dependent arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Interestingly, stimulation with EGF exerted relatively minor effects on cell growth under the conditions we examined. Hence, we tested the ability of EGF and Cezanne-1 to increase an alternative outcome, namely migration and invasion of mammary tumor cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were first transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides and 24 hours later they were plated on porous filters, which were either uncoated (migration assay) or pre-coated with an extracellular matrix (Matrigel; invasion assay). Cells that migrated through the filter toward EGF in the lower compartment were stained and photographed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5c and 5d</xref>). Importantly, pretreatment with a pool of oligonucleotides directed at Cezanne-1 effectively reduced expression of the enzyme as determined by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>), as well as reduced both invasion and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>), but once again EGF exerted only limited effects.</p>
        <p id="P14">Because these observations raised the possibility that Cezanne-1 harbors attributes of an oncoprotein, we examined potential associations with markers of disease aggressiveness. To enable analyses of clinical specimens, we generated a monoclonal antibody by immunizing mice with a recombinant human Cezanne-1. Thereafter, we retrieved a breast tissue microarray, which included normal breast, fibrocystic mastopathy, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ (DCIS and LCIS) and several types of invasive carcinoma. In addition to hematoxylin-eosin stains, immunohistochemical analyses were carried out using our anti-Cezanne-1 monoclonal antibody. Cezanne-1 expression was scored as strong (3), moderate (2), weak (1) or negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The scores resulting from our analyses revealed consistently higher expression of Cezanne-1 in malignant mammary tissues, as compared to normal breast or benign disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Notably, this increase in Cezanne-1 expression could be observed already in early forms of the disease, such as DCIS and LCIS, but we cannot exclude association of the DUB with signaling pathways other than EGFR. Taken together with our biochemical and cell growth analyses, these results strongly implicate Cezanne-1 in breast cancer progression.</p>

        <title>The gene encoding Cezanne-1 is frequently amplified in mammary tumors, and enhanced levels of the respective mRNA predict shorter patient survival</title>
        <p id="P15">The remarkably variable abundance of Cezanne-1 in breast tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>) prompted us to analyze gene copy numbers in a collection of 60 human tumor cell lines (NCI-60). The corresponding array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data indicated that the gene, which is localized to 1q21.2, is amplified in one third of the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>). It is notable that approximately 50% of breast tumors present gains at 1q, whereas the short arm presents mostly losses (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Courjal and Theillet, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hawthorn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Orsetti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Indeed, immunoblotting of a set of tumor and normal mammary cell lines detected variable abundance of the characteristic bands of Cezanne-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figs. S3b and S3c</xref>). Hence, in the next step we analyzed a cohort of 173 breast tumors reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov">http://cancergenome.nih.gov</ext-link>), and found that 32% presented a DNA amplification corresponding to the CEZ1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). We also analyzed the same cohort for correlation between mRNA levels and copy number of CEZ1, and found positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.46, p=7.75e-11). Hence, we compared mRNA abundance in tumors versus the adjacent normal tissues. The results we obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>) clearly indicated that Cezanne-1 is overexpressed in tumors compared to paired adjacent normal tissues. Importantly, analysis of 148 breast cancer patients from the same cohort, for whom clinical data was available, revealed that high abundance of the corresponding mRNA predicts shorter patient survival time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Collectively, the results we obtained using clinical data offer a model attributing to receptor deubiquitination and escape from degradation critical roles in promoting tumor aggressiveness.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P16">Early feedback loops controlling EGFR depend on covalent modifications, whereas late processes rely on newly synthesized proteins, and aberrant variants of both are implicated in cancer (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Avraham and Yarden, 2010</xref>). Concentrating on the early loops, we previously identified DEP-1, a tyrosine phosphatase often deleted in carcinomas, as an enzyme that inactivates EGFR (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Tarcic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Because phosphorylation and ubiquitination of EGFR are coupled, we assumed that the tumor suppressor function of DEP-1 would be mirrored by oncogenic functions of EGFR-specific DUBs. In line with this prediction, overexpression of the DUB we identified, Cezanne-1, is associated with a relatively aggressive course of breast cancers. Like DEP-1, Cezanne-1 assembles with EGFR prior to stimulation, and this physical interaction is enhanced by EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), probably due to interactions of the two UBDs of Cezanne-1 with ubiquitins that decorate active EGFRs. Interestingly, our results attribute different binding specificities to the two UBDs of Cezanne-1: whereas the UBA binds with the canonical isoleucine-44 aspect of ubiquitin, the ZnF binds with aspartate-58. It is worth noting that A20, a negative regulator of the NFÎºB pathway, shares with Cezanne-1 both a ZnF and a catalytic OTU domain. This multifunctional enzyme acts as an editing enzyme: the enzyme first removes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitins from its substrate, RIP, and then it attaches to RIP Lys-48-linked polyubiquitins via its ZnF (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Wertz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Whether Cezanne-1 similarly edits ubiquitinated EGFRs remains an intriguing question. Our results propose that this DUB rapidly associates with active receptors, once they undergo ubiquitination. Subsequently, Cezanne-1 d e-ubiquitinates the receptors, thereby delaying their degradation and prolonging growth and motility signals.</p>
      <p id="P17">Certain genomic amplicons have been associated with vesicle recycling in tumors (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Mills <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). For example, 8p11-12 is frequently amplified in breast cancer. This region encodes the RAB-coupling protein, RCP, which confers oncogenic properties by shunting integrins and other receptors to a recycling route (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Likewise, RAB23 is encoded by the 6p11 amplicon and contributes to invasiveness of gastric cancer (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The long arm of chromosome 1 is involved in quantitative anomalies in at least 50% of breast tumors. 1q22 encodes RAB25, an oncogenic partner of RCP, which is overexpressed in breast and in ovarian cancer (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). A family member of RAB25, called RAB11A, is overexpressed in DCIS (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Palmieri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and yet another component of the recycling route, RAB4A, is encoded by the 1q42 amplicon (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Orsetti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The identification of Cezanne-1 as a regulator of EGFR trafficking adds a deubiquitination enzyme to the list of amplicon-encoded proteins that inhibit receptor degradation. Conceivably, amplicon-driven overexpression of Cezanne-1 results in deubiquitination of surface-bound or internalized EGFRs, thereby enhancing their firing in tumors. In addition, because recycling mechanisms are shared by several growth factor receptors and by adhesion molecules like integrins, overexpression of Cezanne-1 is expected to enhance recycling of multiple endosomal cargos, especially in the leading edge of tumor cells, thereby promoting cellular motility and invasion (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Caswell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Validation of these predictions is expected to motivate pharmacological strategies to intercept Cezanne-1 in tumors.</p>

Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were treated with EGF and whole cell lysates analyzed. (<bold>d)</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Cezanne-1, or an empty plasmid, alongside with a plasmid encoding a Flag-tagged ubiquitin. Forty-eight hours later, cells were incubated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated intervals. Cell lysates and EGFR immunoprecipitates were analyzed as indicated. (<bold>e)</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting Cezanne-1, or with control oligonucleotides. Forty-eight hours later, cells were stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for the depicted intervals. Thereafter, whole cell extracts were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, including antibodies to the phosphorylated forms of AKT and ERK, as well as antibodies specific to specific phosphorylated tyrosines of EGFR. Signal intensities of phosphorylated AKT and ERK2 were quantified, normalized and graphically presented (right panels). All panels presented in this figure were repeated at least thrice.</p>
