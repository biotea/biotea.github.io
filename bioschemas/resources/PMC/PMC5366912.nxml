      <abstract>
        <p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique population of cells defined by their capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. Here, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene in hESCs, <italic>C9ORF135</italic>, which is sharply downregulated during gastrulation and gametogenesis, along with the pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Human ESCs express two <italic>C9ORF135</italic> isoforms, the longer of which encodes a membrane-associated protein, as determined by immunostaining and western blotting of fractionated cell lysates. Moreover, the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), mass spectrometry (MS), and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses demonstrated that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> expression is regulated by OCT4 and SOX2 and that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> interacts with non-muscle myosin IIA and myosin IIB. Collectively, these data indicated that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> encodes a membrane-associated protein that may serve as a surface marker for undifferentiated hESCs.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are pluripotent cells typically derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst-stage embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. These cells have the capacity to maintain self-renewal but they can also differentiate into ectoderm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, mesoderm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and endoderm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, in addition to primordial germ cells (PGCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and embryonic germ cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Understanding the transcriptional cues that direct hESC differentiation is essential for future clinical applications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
    <p>Subtractive gene expression profiling comparing differentiated and undifferentiated cells has identified several potential regulators of the differentiation process, such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, which form a transcriptional regulatory circuit necessary to maintain hESCs pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, epigenetic changes have been proposed to direct hESC differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, the specific proteins that support the specific morphology of hESCs have not yet been identified. Previous work has sought to identify hESC surface marker proteins to facilitate the identification of these cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>; the identified markers include E-cadherin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and P-cadherin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Most of these surface markers are also expressed in epithelial cells. Therefore, examination of the transcriptomes of hESCs and their differentiated counterparts has been regarded as an alternative method for screening specific hESC surface markers.</p>
    <p>In this study, we performed a large-scale transcriptional analysis with gene expression profiles of undifferentiated hESCs, embryoid bodies, and progenies of cell lineages obtained from the GEO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and ArrayExpress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> databases, focusing on uncharacterized genes that either contain putative transmembrane domains or are downregulated during hESC differentiation. In this analysis, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, <italic>C9ORF135</italic>, which has been found in seven independent studies to be highly expressed in hESCs but to decrease rapidly in expression after cell differentiation. In the Swiss-Prot annotation database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, sequence analysis suggests that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> encodes a protein with a single putative transmembrane domain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5VTT2">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5VTT2</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>Candidate indicators of human embryonic stem cell differentiation identified by gene expression profiling</title>
        <p>We downloaded six microarray datasets examining gene expression in hESCs, cells from the three differentiated germ layers, and PGC from the GEO database. Our data for hESCs (LiY) and embryonic germ cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> were generated with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 microarrays. These microarray data for differentiated hESCs with the same platform (U133 Plus 2) were collected and further analyzed to determine fold changes between hESCs and differentiated cells by expression profiling. The top 100 most differentially expressed genes were identified from each study, and those found in 4 or more studies were recorded for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, we found that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> was sharply downregulated during differentiation in all seven studies, along with other known pluripotency genes (<italic>NANOG, SOX2</italic>), HLA (<italic>HLA-DPB2</italic>), and adhesion molecules (<italic>CD24, CDH1</italic>).</p>

        <title>Two <italic>C9ORF135</italic> isoforms are expressed in hESCs</title>
        <p>To confirm our microarray findings, we designed primers to the <italic>C9ORF135</italic> coding sequence (NM_001010940) and found two distinct transcripts expressed in the hESC lines H9 and H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Further analysis showed that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> was also expressed in human MRC5 normal lung and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, but not in HEK293A cells. Interestingly, 1700028P14Rik, the mouse homolog of <italic>C9ORF135</italic>, displayed no or low expression in mouse ESCs but was highly expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Nevertheless, in hESCs, the expression of both transcripts was dramatically decreased when cells were subjected to retinoic acid (RA)-induced neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The human <italic>C9ORF135</italic> loci structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>. Isoform 1 (full-length) has 6 exons and is 690 nt in size, whereas isoform 2 has a stop codon (TGA) in the junction of exons 1 and 3, owing to the lack of exon 2. Isoform 2 of C9ORF135 encodes a short peptide of only 50 amino acid residues, because of a stop codon at nt 151â153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Therefore, we chose to explore the functions of isoform 1 and its encoded protein (Swiss-Prot ID: Q5VTT2) in hESCs.</p>

        <title>C9ORF135 protein localizes to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane in hESCs</title>
        <p>C9ORF135 is not expressed in HEK293A cells. Hence, we exogenously expressed full-length <italic>C9ORF135</italic> (isoform 1) with an N-terminal FLAG tag and confirmed its localization in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm by anti-FLAG immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This staining pattern was also observed in mouse E14 ESCs with exogenous expression of 1700028P14Rik (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Then, we tested the specificity of the C9ORF135 polyclonal antibody by western blotting analysis in HEK293A cells after overexpression of C9ORF135 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). A unique band was detected by the C9ORF135 antibody (Rabbit) in a similar position to that identified by the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mouse). This result indicated the specificity of the C9ORF135 antibody and its ability to recognize the target protein. This observation was also consistent with the RT-PCR analysis showing that C9ORF135 was not expressed in HEK293A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Then, the H1 hESCs were digested with collagenase IV and stained with anti-C9ORF135 antibody. Further immunofluorescence showed that the endogenously expressed protein also displayed a similar localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed there were approximately 79.5% cells that were C9ORF135 positive among the H1 hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Double staining of C9ORF135 and E-cadherin in H1 hESCs indicated that C9ORF135 colocalized with E-cadherin at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). We also performed subcellular fractionation of H1 hESCs to isolate proteins in the various cell compartments, namely, the cytosol, membrane and organelles, nucleus, and cytoskeleton, and examined C9ORF135 localization by western blotting. These results also indicated that the C9ORF135 protein localized to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Identification of C9ORF135 interactors</title>
        <p>We sought to identify C9ORF135 binding proteins by mass spectrometry (MS) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses. First, C9ORF135 antibody, anti-serum, and control IgG pulldowns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. We then excised three bands present only in the antibody pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and performed a molecular analysis by MS, which identified the bands as myosin-9 (MYH9, myosin-IIA) and myosin-10 (MYH10, myosin-IIB), belonging to a family of conventional non-muscle myosins involved in cytokinesis, cell motility and maintenance of cell shape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Subsequent co-IP experiments confirmed myosin-IIA as a bona fide interactor of C9ORF135 in hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Pluripotency factors OCT4 and SOX2 regulate C9ORF135 expression</title>
        <p>OCT4 and SOX2 are transcriptional regulators essential for maintaining hESC pluripotency. To determine whether C9ORF135 expression is regulated by OCT4 and SOX2, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in H1 hESCs and found that both SOX2 and OCT4 occupied the <italic>C9ORF135</italic> promoter in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Additionally, we generated a luciferase reporter containing the <italic>C9ORF135</italic> proximal promoter to monitor transcriptional activity in the presence or absence of exogenous OCT4 and SOX2. Notably, both transcription factors induced luciferase activity in a synergistic and dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>), thus indicating that SOX2 and OCT4 promote C9ORF135 expression by direct or indirect promoter binding. Subsequent analysis also showed that C9ORF135, as well as the core pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, were downregulated in H1, H9, and LiY ESCs treated with RA for seven days to induce differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs. 5c,d</xref>). However, NANOG neither had transcriptional activity at the C9ORF135 promoter nor showed synergistic effects with OCT4 in the luciferase reporter system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>). This finding further confirmed that C9ORF135 expression is regulated by OCT4 and SOX2 in hESCs.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Decreased expression of <italic>C9ORF135</italic> in early stages of hESC differentiation</title>
        <p>We repeated the immunostaining experiment in H1 hESCs with antibodies to C9ORF135 and OCT4 (pluripotent marker). The results again showed that C9ORF135 and OCT4 were expressed in hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In addition, we induced spontaneous differentiation in H1 hESCs by withdrawing bFGF and TGFÎ² from the E6 culture medium. The H1 cells formed embryoid bodies (EBs), which were cultivated for 4 days under the same conditions. We collected cells from the ESCs and EBs to compare their mRNA and protein levels of the pluripotency marker NANOG and three germ layer markers, as well as C9ORF135. The immunostaining analyses showed that the ectoderm marker Nestin was strongly positive in the EBs formed from spontaneous differentiation, whereas C9ORF135 was significantly downregulated. However, the EBs exhibited negative staining for the mesoderm marker KDR and the endoderm marker Sox17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The results of RT-qPCR were similar to the results of immunostaining analyses. The expression of NANOG (pluripotency marker) decreased for EBs, similar to C9ORF135. Expression levels of Nestin and Pax6 (ectoderm markers) increased substantially for EBs. However, we observed only minor fluctuations at the mRNA level for endoderm (FoxA2 and Sox17) and mesoderm (Brachyury T and KDR) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Therefore, the results of immunostaining analyses and RT-qPCR indicated that hESCs were inclined toward the ectoderm lineage cells during the spontaneous differentiation.</p>
        <p>Then, we established a 4-day designated protocol to induce the differentiation of EBs toward the three germ layers in order to observe the expression of C9ORF135 in the early stage of differentiation. Lineage-specific markers were used to identify EBs both at the mRNA and protein levels. The results of double immunostaining and RT-qPCR analyses indicated that the expression of C9ORF135 was significantly downregulated during differentiation. The lineage-specific markers Nestin (ectoderm), KDR (mesoderm) and Sox17 (endoderm) are upregulated substantially as shown by immunostaining analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of lineage-specific markers, Nestin and Pax6 for ectoderm, Sox17 and FoxA2 for endoderm, and Brachyury T and KDR for mesoderm, increased dramatically at the early differentiation stage of EBs, as demonstrated by RT-qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). The expression levels of pluripotency marker NANOG and C9ORF135 decreased sharply during the designated differentiation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>

        <title>Morphological alterations in differentiation after <italic>C9ORF135</italic> knockdown in hESCs</title>
        <p>Our results indicated that the specific shRNA to C9ORF135 decreased C9ORF135 expression and altered the morphology of hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">b</xref>). However, the scrambled shRNA changed neither the C9ORF135 expression level nor the morphology of hESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>RA induces neural differentiation in ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Accordingly, hESCs displayed morphological spreading when the cultures were either treated with RA for seven days or subjected to <italic>C9ORF135</italic> shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Analysis of RA-differentiated cells also showed downregulation of the C9ORF135 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>) as well as an increase in the neural cell markers TUBB3 and MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Human ESCs have the capacity to differentiate into all three germ layers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, a process during which their gene expression profiles change dramatically. In this study, we obtained microarray data from six studies analyzing hESC differentiation. A meta-analysis of these studies, in addition to our own data, revealed that the previously uncharacterized factor <italic>C9ORF135</italic> was markedly downregulated in response to hESC differentiation. Further examination showed that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> is expressed in two isoforms in hESCs and that the larger full-length protein localizes to the plasma membrane and cytosol. Notably, C9ORF135 expression in hESCs is regulated by the core pluripotency transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4, all of which are downregulated during RA-induced neural differentiation.</p>
      <p>Human ESCs form round colonies with well-defined edges that are particularly sensitive to dissociation into single-cell suspensions, whereas mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) form smaller, irregular clones that are more resistant to clone disruption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. These physiological differences indicate that species-specific molecules may exist in hESCs. C9ORF135 is expressed throughout the cytoplasm and membranes of hESCs, but its mouse homolog is not detected in mESCs. As expected, the hESC clone morphology was markedly changed after <italic>C9ORF135</italic> knockdown and during differentiation. Additionally, MS and co-IP analyses suggest that C9ORF135 may interact with non-muscle myosin-9 (also known as myosin-IIA), which generates contractile tension to drive epithelial morphogenesis and support cell integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our results showed that <italic>C9ORF135</italic> is a membrane-associated protein. The expression of <italic>C9ORF135</italic> is regulated by OCT4 and SOX2 and decreases dramatically during hESC differentiation, thus suggesting that this protein may be a key regulator of pluripotency and may be used as a potential surface marker of hESCs.</p>

        <title>Gene expression profiling</title>
        <p>Microarray datasets of hESCs and differentiated cells were generated on the GPL570 platform (Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or were downloaded from GEO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>; our analyses included data from hESCs, embryoid body (EB) and neural progenitor cells (GSE9940, ectoderm), pancreatic cells (GSE14503, endoderm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, hepatocytes (GSE25417, endoderm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, hematopoietic progenitor cells (GSE29115, mesoderm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and male adult germ stem cells (GSE11350)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
        <p>We also performed a microarray analysis on LiY hESCs and embryonic germ cells on the Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 platform. For this analysis, 10âÎ¼g of total RNA was used as input for labeled cRNA synthesis, per the manufacturerâs instructions (IVT: 16âh). The quality-checked cRNA samples were hybridized in biological replicates for 18âh. All the steps were performed according to the manufacturerâs instructions, and the data were analyzed in Affymetrix Expression Console Software 1.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA). The gene expression fold-change was assessed to select the top 100 differentially expressed genes between hESCs and differentiated cells for each downloaded study and our primary data.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and hESC differentiation with retinoic acid</title>
        <p>HEK293A and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The hESC lines H1 and H9 were obtained from WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI, USA), and the hESC line named LiY was established in our lab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These hESCs were maintained on a layer of MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) feeder cells with 80% DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR), 1 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.1âmM Î²-mercaptoethanol (all from Invitrogen), and 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). Cell cultures were passaged with collagenase IV (Invitrogen), and the medium was changed every two days.</p>
        <p>To induce hESC differentiation, hESCs were dissociated with 0.5âmM EDTA and then replated onto a bacteriological dish at 5âÃâ10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL in 10âmL minimum essential medium (MEM alpha) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 3âmM sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1âmM 2-ME. On day 2, retinoic acid (RA, 500ânM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the cultures and incubated for 7 days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.

        <p>To generate <italic>C9ORF135</italic> expression vectors, the full-length cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 containing an N-terminal FLAG tag with terminal BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. PCR primers for C9ORF135 amplification are as follows: forward, 5â²-GATGGATCCATGGATAGCCTTGACAGATC-3â² and reverse, 5â²-GCGGAATTCTTAAATTGGCACAATAGGCC-3â². The C9ORF135 mouse homolog, 1700028P14Rik, was isolated from the testes of C57BL/6 mice by RT-PCR. The resulting cDNA was cloned into the episomal PpyCAGIP vector and transfected into E14 mouse embryonic stem cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).</p>
        <p>The C9ORF135 knockdown vector was generated by cloning CoORF135 shRNA (5â²-CAGAAACUCUAUCCCUUGATT-3â²) into the HpaI and XhoI sites of the pLL3.7 lentivirus vector with a U6 promoter. Lentiviral infection was performed by cotransfection of 15âÎ¼g of pLL3.7-shRNA together with 5âÎ¼g each of pMDLg/pRRE, RSV/Rev, and VSV-G into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The medium was changed 6âh later, and cultures were incubated for another 48âh. Culture supernatants were then collected, filtered with a 0.45-Î¼m filter (Millipore) and then added to hESC cultures in the presence of 10âng/Î¼L polybrene (Sigma).</p>

        <title>Antibodies, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry</title>
        <p>N-terminal <italic>C9ORF135</italic> peptides were used to immunize two rabbits over the course of one month. The immunized sera were collected and purified with an affinity column (Epitomics Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). The purified antibody was used for immunofluorescence analysis alongside antibodies against TUBB3 and MAP2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), E-cadherin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and anti-FLAG (Sigma). The antibodies to Nestin, Sox17, and KDR were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and anti-OCT4 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Alexa Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen.</p>
        <p>The digested H1 hESCs were washed twice with PBS plus 0.5% FBS. Then, the cells were stained with primary antibody against C9ORF135 (1:200) and the corresponding secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG). Approximately 10,000 cells were acquired with a BD FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FACSCalibur tools.</p>

        <p>For ChIP analysis, 10<sup>7</sup> infected ES cells were collected and fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde. Cell lysates were prepared by incubating the cells in lysis buffer (50âmM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150âmM NaCl, 0.5% NP40) for 30âmin at 4âÂ°C, and samples were centrifuged at 14,000â<italic>g</italic> for 30âmin at 4âÂ°C. The fragmented chromatin by sonication was then precleared with protein A and G Sepharose beads before immunoprecipitation with SOX2 and OCT4 antibodies bound to Sepharose beads. The bound material was washed, eluted, and purified with a Qiagen PCR purification kit. The samples were then analyzed by PCR with 1âÎ¼L of purified DNA and amplified for 36 cycles with the following primers: forward, 5â²-TTCTTGTGCCCACTCCACTCTA-3â² and reverse, 5â²-ACGAGAGAACATCCCCTGAAAC-3â².</p>
        <p>For western blotting, the cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The protein (50â80âÎ¼g) was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to 0.2-Î¼m PVDF membranes. After being blocked in 5% skimmed milk for 1âh, the membranes were incubated at 4âÂ°C overnight with primary antibodies against C9ORF135 (Epitomics Inc.), GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), myosin IIA (Abcam), and Î²-actin (Sigma). The membranes were washed with PBST buffer three times.
