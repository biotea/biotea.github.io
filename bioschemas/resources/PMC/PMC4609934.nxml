      <abstract>
        <p>The voltage-gated Kv2.1 potassium channel encoded by <italic>KCNB1</italic> produces the major delayed rectifier potassium current in pyramidal neurons. Recently, <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous missense <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations have been identified in three patients with epileptic encephalopathy and a patient with neurodevelopmental disorder. However, the frequency of <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations in infantile epileptic patients and their effects on neuronal activity are yet unknown. We searched whole exome sequencing data of a total of 437 patients with infantile epilepsy, and found novel <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous missense <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations in two patients showing psychomotor developmental delay and severe infantile generalized seizures with high-amplitude spike-and-wave electroencephalogram discharges. The mutation located in the channel voltage sensor (p.R306C) disrupted sensitivity and cooperativity of the sensor, while the mutation in the channel pore domain (p.G401R) selectively abolished endogenous Kv2 currents in transfected pyramidal neurons, indicating a dominant-negative effect. Both mutants inhibited repetitive neuronal firing through preventing production of deep interspike voltages. Thus <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations can be a rare genetic cause of infantile epilepsy, and insufficient firing of pyramidal neurons would disturb both development and stability of neuronal circuits, leading to the disease phenotypes.</p>

    <p>Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (Kv) play important roles in regulating electrical excitability in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. They typically consist of tetrameric Î± subunits, with each subunit having six membrane-spanning Î±-helices (S1âS6). S1âS4 and S5âS6 segments form voltage-sensing and pore domains of the channel, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. There are 12âKv subfamilies (Kv1 to Kv12) in humans, which contribute to diverse aspects of neuronal signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Heterozygous mutations in Kv are involved in epileptic disorders, for example <italic>KCNA2</italic> (Kv1.2), <italic>KCNC1</italic> (Kv3.1), <italic>KCNQ2</italic> (Kv7.2), <italic>KCNQ3</italic> (Kv7.3), and <italic>KCNH1</italic> (Kv10.1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p>Kv2 includes Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, encoded by <italic>KCNB1</italic> at 20q13.13 and <italic>KCNB2</italic> at 8q13.3, respectively. Kv2.1/KCNB1 is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons throughout the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and produces the major delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Kv2.1 expression can be modulated by neuronal activity via phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, which may control homeostatic changes in neuronal excitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>Recently, <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations were reported in three patients with epileptic encephalopathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and a patient with neurodevelopmental disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Functional analysis of three missense mutations (p.S347R, p.T374I and p.G379R) in the pore domain showed loss of ion selectivity and gain of depolarizing inward cation conductance in CHO-K1 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, suggesting that the mutations may cause depolarized resting membrane potential and impaired membrane repolarization, which would lead to increased excitability of neurons. However, actual mutational effects on neuronal activity, which must be influenced by various properties of ion channels and other molecules, and frequency of <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations in epileptic patients, remains to be elucidated.</p>
    <p>In this study, we identified two patients with novel <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations (p.R306C and p.G401R) among 437 patients with infantile epilepsy. These mutations were located in the voltage-sensing and pore domains, respectively. Extensive functional examination using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in Neuro2a cells and primary cortical neurons showed that these Kv2.1 mutants, with different mechanisms from the previously reported ones, inhibit production of sufficiently deep interspike voltages, thereby inhibiting repetitive action potential (AP) firing to different degrees in cortical neurons. Our study highlighted the importance of Kv2.1 for controlling neuronal activity in humans.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>de novo KCNB1</italic> mutations</title>
        <p>We have been conducting whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis of inherited intractable disorders including infantile epilepsy as a national project since 2011. Our attention to <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations was raised by finding a <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutation in patient 1 by trio-based WES, in which the mean read depth of protein-coding regions in RefSeq genes ranged from 138â161, with 94.7â95.6% of target coding sequences covered by 10 or more reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In this trio analysis, we identified two <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and two candidate X-linked recessive variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Among them, the <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in <italic>KCNB1</italic> (c.1201G&gt;A (p.G401R)) was the most likely candidate because <italic>KCNB1</italic> encodes Kv2.1, which is the major delayed rectifier Kv that regulates cortical pyramidal neuron excitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This assumption was later justified by recent reports of three patients with <italic>de novo KCNB1</italic> mutations and epileptic encephalopathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Searching WES data of other 436 patients, we identified another candidate heterozygous <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutation (c.916C&gt;T (p.R306C)) in patient 2, and confirmed it as <italic>de novo</italic> by Sanger sequencing. Two mutations were absent in dbSNP 137, our in-house 575 control exomes, and Exome Variant Server database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Locations of the two <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations along with four previously reported mutations are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. The p.G401R mutation is located in S6 of the pore domain, in which the four reported mutations were also located. The p.R306C mutation is located in S4 of the voltage-sensing domain. Web-based prediction tools suggested that these two mutations could affect protein function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, the two missense mutations occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acids important for Kv gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>): R306 is one of positively charged residues (mainly arginines) in S4, responsible for voltage sensing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and G401 in S6 functions as a gating hinge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Therefore, p.R306C and p.G401R mutations are predicted to affect voltage sensing and pore gating of Kv2.1, respectively.</p>

        <title>Current properties of Kv2.1 mutants expressed in Neuro2a cells</title>
        <p>To examine the mutational effect on Kv2.1 function, we expressed the Kv2.1 mutants in Neuro2a cells and performed voltage-clamp analysis of membrane currents. Neuro2a cells are reported to have no endogenous Kv conductance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, although a significant voltage-gated current was detected in another report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In our culture and experimental conditions, small but significant voltage-gated outward currents were generated in both cells transfected with empty vector and untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2AâD</xref>, empty and no vector), confirming presence of endogenous voltage-gated currents. Currents were activated in response to voltage steps â¥ââ30âmV, with slow activation kinetics in the negative voltage range and much faster kinetics in the positive voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>), reminiscent of currents mediated by wild-type (WT) Kv2, as reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Indeed, application of guangxitoxin-1E (a specific Kv2 blocker; GxTX) abolished these currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). Thus, the endogenous currents were solely mediated by Kv2 in our experimental conditions.</p>
        <p>Transfection of cells with WT Kv2.1 produced currents two orders of magnitude larger than endogenous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,D</xref>). Voltage dependence of the time constant (Ï) of current activation was similar to that of endogenous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Transfection with R306C mutant produced currents approximately two times larger than endogenous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,D</xref>). However, current-voltage (IâV) dependence and activation kinetics differed from WT currents. Significant current responses were even detected at &lt;ââ30âmV, and the typical slow activation kinetics in the negative voltage range were lost. Activation Ïs at the beginning of voltage steps between â30 and â20âmV were much smaller than those of WT currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Nevertheless, voltage dependence of Ï was so weak that the Ï at +50âmV was significantly larger than the WT current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Moreover, especially in the positive voltage range, slow rises in current amplitude continued throughout the voltage steps after the initial rapid rising phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The rises persisted even when the voltage step period was extended to 8âs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>), and the current response to a test voltage pulse after the voltage step still increased with increasing level of the voltage step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). In WT and endogenous currents, the rise in amplitude stopped after the initial rising phase and was followed by slow current inactivation, particularly in the positive voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, these findings suggest that loss of one electric charge at R306 in the S4 voltage sensor strongly affects sensitivity and cooperativity of the sensor, thereby slowing channel opening and inactivation. Indeed, tail current analysis confirmed disruption of voltage sensor sensitivity and cooperativity in the R306C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). In stark contrast to the R306C mutant, transfection with G401R mutant nearly abolished endogenous currents, similar to GxTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,D</xref>). This suggests that the G401R mutant does not function as an ion channel and may exert a dominant-negative effect on WT channels.</p>

        <title>Characteristics of K<sup>+</sup> currents in primary cortical neurons expressing Kv2.1 mutants</title>
        <p>To investigate how Kv2.1 aberrations may cause epileptic phenotypes, we next analyzed the mutational effect on total K<sup>+</sup> currents and firing activities in cultured cortical neurons. The K<sup>+</sup> current in cortical neurons consists of multiple Kv components including Kv2. Applying voltage steps to neurons transfected with empty vector evoked endogenous Kv currents 20-times larger than in Neuro2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, empty, left panel, and 4B). The transient outward current component elicited at the beginning of voltage steps between â40 and 0âmV is the typical KCND/Kv4-mediated current, so called âI<sub>A</sub>â. This component can be separated from the total current by applying a 25âms prepulse to â30âmV because of its fast activating and inactivating property at this voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, empty, right panel). The slowly activating component elicited by voltage steps between â20 and 0âmV after I<sub>A</sub> removal strongly implicates endogenous Kv2. Indeed, activation Ïs of the slowly activating component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, empty) matched those in Neuro2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>, empty). However, Ïs in the positive voltage range (e.g., 2.9âÂ±â0.3âms at +50âmV, <italic>n</italic>â=â25) were significantly smaller than in Neuro2a cells (6.2âÂ±â0.4âms at +50âmV, <italic>n</italic>â=â24, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.01 by 2-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test). Moreover, the rate of current inactivation in the positive voltage range (e.g., Ï of 248.4âÂ±â37.6âms at +30âmV) was clearly faster than in Neuro2a cells (3268.2âÂ±â172.0âms). These findings presumably reflect faster activation and inactivation of other Kv types.</p>
        <p>Transfection of neurons with WT Kv2.1 produced currents approximately four times larger than endogenous currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). After I<sub>A</sub> removal, activation Ïs in the voltage range between â20 and 0âmV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, WT) also matched those in Neuro2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>, WT). However, activation and inactivation rates in the positive voltage range were faster than in Neuro2a cells, as were those of endogenous currents. Transfection with R306C mutant produced currents that were similar in amplitude to endogenous currents in the positive voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) but larger in the negative voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, the activation time course after I<sub>A</sub> removal was much slower than WT and endogenous currents, especially in the positive voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). Voltage dependence of the activation Ï in R306C-transfected neurons was different from Neuro2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>, R306C). The reason for the difference is discussed later. Transfection with G401R mutant produced significantly smaller peak currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and faster rates of current inactivation (e.g., 92.7âÂ±â5.8âms at +50âmV, <italic>n</italic>â=â28) compared with endogenous currents (145.7âÂ±â12.9âms at +50âmV, <italic>n</italic>â=â25, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.01 by 2-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, the typical slow activation kinetics in the negative voltage range were completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,C</xref>). This can be explained by selective suppression of endogenous Kv2 by the dominant-negative action of the G401R mutant. Only fast activating and inactivating current components mediated by other Kv types contributed to the current response. This was also indicated by the tail currents after the voltage steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In general, deactivation processes of fast activating Kv components (such as Kv1/KCNA and Kv3/KCNC) are too fast to be detected as tail currents. Thus, the currents observed here mainly reflect deactivation processes of slowly activating components like Kv2. The peak current density of tail currents in G401R-transfected neurons was greatly suppressed (4.8âÂ±â1.8âpA/pF, after +50âmV voltage steps) compared with endogenous currents (31.3âÂ±â4.2âpA/pF, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.01 by Kruskal-Wallis test), although smaller but comparable current amplitudes were generated during the preceding voltage steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Tail currents in WT- and mutant-transfected neurons also indicate differences in voltage dependence of slowly activating components, including Kv2. The half-maximal activation voltage significantly shifted to the left in WT Kv2.1-transfected neurons compared with empty vector-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). This was due to dominance of WT Kv2.1 with half-maximal activation of approximately â17âmV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) in the slowly activating components. A marked increase in slope factor was apparent in R306C-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>), consistent with our finding in Neuro2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This was reflected in significant tail currents even after voltage steps to â30 and â40âmV in R306C-transfected neurons only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>) and also in the larger currents during the preceding voltage steps in the voltage range less than â20âmV in R306C-transfected neurons, compared with those in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Kv2.1 mutants inhibit repetitive AP firing</title>
        <p>Next, we examined changes in passive membrane properties and firing activities of transfected neurons under current-clamp conditions. We found notable changes in passive membrane properties of R306C-transfected neurons, specifically, large decreases in input resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and corresponding increases in the minimum stimulus current required for AP firing (rheobase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These observations are due to a significant fraction of open R306C mutants below the threshold for AP firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), because of the corresponding large slope factor of voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>E). To a lesser degree, similar changes were also observed in G401R-transfected neurons. The shape of a single AP evoked by a short (2â5âms) current injection was varied in WT- and R306C-transfected neurons. The half-width of AP spike was prolonged, compared with empty vector-transfected neurons, owing to reduction in speed of the spike downstroke without change in the spike upstroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C,F</xref>). There were no statistical differences in these spike parameters between WT- and R306C-transfected neurons. Other minor changes in passive membrane properties and in single spike parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5DâF</xref>.</p>
        <p>The pattern of repetitive AP firing elicited by a long 500âms current injection varied greatly between neurons transfected with different vectors. In empty vector-transfected neurons, the spike number during current injection increased up to around 10 with increasing strength of current injection (up to three times the rheobase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>, empty). Similar increases in spike number were observed in WT-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>, WT). In stark contrast, in R306C-transfected neurons, increased current strength did not increase spike number: only 1 or 2 spikes were generated at the beginning of current injections in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). In G401R-transfected neurons, a current increase of two times the rheobase increased the spike number to around 5. However, spikes were likely dampened during injection, and a further current increase suppressed the repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To understand the basis for spike pattern differences, we further examined several spike parameters during repetitive firing induced by a two times rheobase current. In empty vector-transfected neurons, the minimum interspike voltage between the first and second spikes first increased by 2â3âmV in the next interval, and was then sustained during the following repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>, interspike voltage). In WT-transfected neurons, the interspike voltage was sustained from the beginning, with the final level being lower than that in empty vector-transfected neurons. In R306C-transfected neurons, the initial interspike voltage was much higher than in empty- and WT-transfected neurons. The initial interspike voltage in G401R-transfected neurons was between that of empty- and R306C-transfected neurons, but the voltage rose progressively during repetitive firing. These differences in interspike voltage may affect the speed of spike upstroke in the following spikes, because recovery of Na<sup>+</sup> channels from inactivation is hampered at high voltages. Indeed, the upstroke speed in the middle of repetitive firing was greatly suppressed in G401R-transfected neurons, whereas it was largely maintained in WT-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>, dV/dt up). The upstroke speed may in turn affect the subsequent spike downstrokes, amplitudes, and frequencies, because Kv opening depends greatly upon membrane depolarization caused by Na<sup>+</sup> influx. In fact, all of these parameters followed the same trend as the spike upstroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). These findings confirm the important role of WT Kv2.1 in preserving low interspike voltages to maintain repetitive firing, as reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The novel Kv2.1 mutants inhibit production of sufficiently deep interspike voltages, thereby inhibiting repetitive firing to different degrees.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we identified two novel <italic>de novo KCNB1</italic> mutations by WES. Location of the p.R306C and p.G401R mutations suggests they affect Kv2.1 voltage sensing and pore gating, respectively. Indeed, the R306C mutation reduced sensitivity and cooperativity of the voltage sensor for channel opening. These effects on repetitive AP firing were so robust that firing was restricted to only one or two spikes, even in response to strong current injections. The G401R mutation nullified channel function and had a dominant-negative effect on endogenous Kv2, presumably through inhibition of pore gating. This effect caused fast dampening of repetitive firing, consistent with previous reports using another dominant-negative mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and the Kv2 blocker GxTX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Thus, both mutations significantly alter channel function of Kv2.1, and firing properties of cortical neurons, strongly suggesting they are causative for the phenotype of the two patients.</p>
      <p>Including the two patients from this study, six patients with d<italic>e novo KCNB1</italic> mutations have been identified, with detailed clinical information available for four patients (excluding case 3 in Torkamani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and a patient with neurodevelopmental disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In all these four patients, the initial symptom was developmental delay, and thereafter developed various types of infantile-onset seizures. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to state that patients with <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations showed encephalopathy with seizures. Although focal seizures were also observed, generalized seizures including clonic, tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, and spasms were seen in common. Diffuse epileptic EEG discharges were observed in all four patients, and three of them (with p.R306C, p.G379R, and p.G401R mutations) showed spike and wave discharges. Hypotonia was observed in three patients with mutations within the pore domain (p.S347R, p.G379R, and p.G401R), but not with the p.R306C mutation. Involuntary movements and behavioural problems such as tantrums and agitation were observed in two patients (with p.G379R and p.G401R mutations). Altogether, these findings suggest that Kv2.1 dysfunction in humans is associated with diffuse brain dysfunction, manifested as developmental, neurological, or behavioural symptoms. Infantile generalized seizures with spike and wave discharges may be a key feature in suspected <italic>KCNB1</italic> mutations.</p>
      <p>A study examining <italic>Kcnb1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice also reported diffuse brain dysfunction in knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Approximately 10% of <italic>Kcnb1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice exhibited nonlethal, tonic-clonic seizures for several seconds during routine animal handling, and they were susceptible to chemically induced seizures. In addition, <italic>Kcnb1</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> mice show hyperactive behaviour and spatial learning deficits. This suggests a critical role for Kv2.1 as a homeostatic suppressor of neuronal excitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Given there is widespread expression of Kv2.1 in the brain, including the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, various generalized seizures with diffuse EEG abnormalities may originate from either the entire cortex or subcortical structures such as the hippocampus.</p>
      <p>Although the peak amplitude of total K<sup>+</sup> currents was maintained in R306C-transfected neurons, the stronger effect of R306C mutant on repetitive firing must be due to delayed activation of the R306C mutant. Delayed activation failed to produce a deep interspike voltage after the initial spike, but would have strongly inhibited subsequent spike generation through counteracting depolarizing Na<sup>+</sup> entry with hyperpolarizing K<sup>+</sup> efflux. This is in contrast to G401R-transfected neurons, with Na<sup>+</sup> entry for the second spike generation not counteracted because of a lack of slowly activating Kv components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>The difference in initial activation Ï between R306C-transfected Neuro2a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>) and cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>) was in part due to the use of prepulses, during which a significant fraction of R306C mutants would have been activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>E), in cortical neurons. Thus the slowly rising component of R306C-mediated currents after the initial fast rising phase (observed in Neuro2a cells) would have mainly contributed to current time course after the prepulse in R306C-transfected neurons. Moreover, inactivation of other Kvs also shaped the time course in cortical neurons. Another possibility might be that the difference in expression level of endogenous Kv2 between Neuro2a cells and cortical neurons yielded different ratios of heteromeric combination of WT to R306C (e.g., 1:3 or 2:2) in a Kv2 tetramer and these heteromers produced somewhat different Ïs.</p>
      <p>Two novel Kv2.1 mutants greatly suppressed and did not facilitate, repetitive firing in cultured cortical neurons. The mechanism by which suppression of repetitive firing leads to epileptic phenotypes in humans is currently unknown. One possibility is that suppression of firing in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons promotes epileptic discharges if Kv2.1 dominates repetitive firing in these interneurons. Nevertheless, the characteristic fast spiking of GABAergic interneurons is known to be driven mainly by Kv3/KCNC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and the contribution of Kv2/KCNB to repetitive firing is expected to be minimal. Conversely, it is possible that input reduction from mutant Kv2.1-expressing pyramidal neurons to interneurons mediating feedforward and/or feedback recurrent and lateral inhibitory circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> may cause unregulated firing in the surrounding neuronal circuitry. Moreover, during seizure-like firing events, with both glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal firing occurring excessively, intracellular Cl<sup>â</sup> levels in both pyramidal neurons and interneurons can be raised<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. This Cl<sup>â</sup> accumulation may convert inhibitory GABAergic inputs into excitatory signals and promote synchronous neuronal firing throughout neuronal circuits, as demonstrated in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Cl<sup>â</sup> accumulation is mainly mediated by Cl<sup>â</sup> entry through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors under depolarized conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Cl<sup>â</sup> entry would be enhanced with raised interspike voltages and/or mean membrane voltage levels during depolarizing inputs, even when repetitive spiking is suppressed as in R306C- and G401R-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, it may be possible that Kv2.1 mutations promote greater intracellular Cl<sup>â</sup> accumulation during seizure-like firing events, quickly rendering GABAergic inputs excitatory and lowering the threshold for and/or prolonging the duration of epileptic synchronous firings throughout the circuits.</p>
      <p>In summary, our data suggest that Kv2.1 functional aberrations in humans are associated with developmental delay, infantile generalized seizures, hypotonia, and behavioural problems, and also highlight a critical role for Kv2.1 in regulating neuronal firing in neuronal circuits.</p>

To produce activation curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>E, peak amplitudes of tail currents were measured 2âms after beginning test voltage steps, and fitted to the Boltzmann equation: Iâ=âI<sub>base</sub>â+âI<sub>max</sub>/[1â+âexp{(V<sub>h</sub>âV)/V<sub>s</sub>}], where I<sub>base</sub> and I<sub>max</sub> are the basal and maximum current amplitudes, respectively; V is the voltage level before the test voltage step (prepulse voltage); V<sub>h</sub> is the half-maximal voltage; and V<sub>s</sub> is the slope factor. Peak amplitudes after subtraction of I<sub>base</sub> were normalized to I<sub>max</sub> and mean values over the cells plotted against the prepulse voltage. To produce inactivation curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>, currents were elicited by 8âs long voltage steps ranging from â100 toâ+30âmV in 10âmV increments, followed by a brief 1âms pulse to +70âmV and a 100âms test voltage step to +40âmV. The brief pulse reduced residual capacitive current components in response to the test voltage step. Peak amplitudes of current responses to test voltages steps in empty vector- and WT Kv2.1-transfected cells were fitted to the Boltzmann equation: Iâ=âI<sub>baseâ</sub>+âI<sub>max</sub>/[1â+âexp{(VâV<sub>h</sub>)/V<sub>s</sub>}], in the voltage range of long voltage steps (prepulse voltage) from â100 to 0âmV. Amplitudes were normalized to the sum of I<sub>base</sub> and I<sub>max</sub>, and mean values over the cells plotted against the prepulse voltage. Amplitudes in the positive prepulse voltage range were slightly larger than those at 0âmV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>, dotted lines), indicating U-type inactivation of Kv2.1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In R306C mutant-transfected cells, amplitudes were normalized to the current evoked after the prepulse to â100âmV.</p>
        <p>Input resistance under resting conditions in current-clamp mode was measured from membrane voltage changes induced by 500âms hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current injections in 20 or 50âpA increments from the resting membrane voltage. Resistance was determined as the linear regression slope of peak voltage changes against injected currents in the voltage range below the firing threshold and above â80âmV. Rheobase was determined by applying 500âms depolarizing current injections in 20âpA increments from the resting membrane voltage.</p>

        <title>Statistics</title>
        <p>For patch-clamp data, statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS ver.21 software. Data were first assessed for normality of distribution using the KolmogorovâSmirnov test. When confirmed, multiple comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA followed <italic>post hoc</italic> by RyanâEinotâGabrielâWelsch <italic>F</italic> (REGW) or Dunnettâs T3 tests, depending if equal variances could be assumed or not, respectively, from Levene statistic. When the normality was not confirmed, comparisons were performed using the KruskalâWallis test followed by the Dunn procedure. Data are presented as mean Â± standard error of the mean.</p>
