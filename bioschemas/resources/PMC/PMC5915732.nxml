        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>The ability of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to reactivate from latent infection of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) is intimately linked to cellular differentiation. HCMV encodes UL7 that our group has shown is secreted from infected cells and induces angiogenesis. In this study, we show that UL7 is a ligand for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt-3R), a well-known critical factor in HPC differentiation. We observed that UL7 directly binds Flt-3R and induces downstream signaling cascades, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Importantly, we show that UL7 protein induces differentiation of both CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Last, we show that an HCMV mutant lacking UL7 fails to reactivate in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in humanized mice. These observations define the first virally encoded differentiation factor with significant implications not only for HCMV reactivation but also for alteration of the hematopoietic compartment in transplant patients.</p>

        <title>IMPORTANCE</title>
        <p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) represent a critical reservoir of latent HCMV in the transplant population, thereby providing a source of virus for dissemination to visceral organs. HCMV reactivation has been linked to HPC/myeloid cellular differentiation; however, the mechanisms involved in these events are poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, we show that a viral protein is a ligand for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt-3R) and that the binding of HCMV UL7 to the Flt-3R triggers HPC and monocyte differentiation. Moreover, the loss of UL7 prevents viral reactivation in HPCs <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in humanized mice. These observations define the first virally encoded differentiation factor with significant implications not only for HCMV reactivation but also for alteration of the hematopoietic compartment in transplant patients.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In these patients, cytopenias occur as part of an âHCMV syndromeâ defined by the presence of fever, viremia, and myelosuppression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) provide a critical reservoir for HCMV, and infection of these cells may have both direct and indirect effects on hematopoiesis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; recently reviewed in reference <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several mechanisms may explain the deleterious effect of HCMV on bone marrow function, including altering hematopoiesis in infected cells and altering the cytokine expression program to affect the bone marrow microenvironment and differentiation of HPCs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">â</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additionally, HCMV infection has also been associated with poor engraftment of HPCs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Early studies using <italic>in vitro</italic> CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC systems indicated that HCMV infection of CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs alters lymphoid and myeloid development (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the mechanisms involved in these events remain unknown.</p>
      <p>Several <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models have shown that reactivation of latent virus requires stimulation of latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs by cytokines and growth factors that induce the myeloid differentiation events needed for production of infectious virus (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Consistent with these observations, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs in mice latently infected with HCMV induces an increase in myeloid cells in the peripheral blood, resulting in reactivation of virus in various tissue macrophages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs into fully differentiated tissue macrophages is a multistep process with each step requiring a specific and appropriate milieu of cytokines and cell-cell interactions. Similarly, the reactivation of latent HCMV is also a complex process integrally linked to the differentiation of the cells.</p>
      <p>Over the past 2 decades, analysis of HCMV in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs and myeloid lineage cells have identified several virally encoded genes associated with latency, including the UL133-138 locus (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">â</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), US28 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">â</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and LUNA (latency unique natural antigen) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Expression of these viral genes has been detected during latent infection of CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, and mutation of UL138, UL135, or US28 alters the ability of HCMV to establish latency in these cells. Moreover, these latency genes are hypothesized to promote and maintain the viral latent phenotype. Reactivation of HCMV from latency is a multistep process requiring the expression of viral genes in a cascade event in which immediate early (IE) genes are necessary to transcriptionally activate the early and late genes that encode proteins necessary for viral DNA replication and virion formation. Most of the characterization studies of the timing of viral gene expression during infection were performed in human fibroblasts (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The temporal class of HCMV gene expression during reactivation in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs remains unknown. The expression of IE genes is considered the primary event for reactivation; however, these genes can be expressed in cells that do not produce virus such as in monocytes where further myeloid differentiation events are necessary to activate the complete viral transcriptome.</p>
      <p>UL7 is a member of the HCMV RL11 gene family and encodes a 222-amino-acid type I glycoprotein that is proteolytically cleaved to produce a heavily glycosylated ectodomain that is secreted into the supernatant of infected cells. The UL7 gene is kinetically expressed during the early-late phase of HCMV replication, it is nonessential for replication in human fibroblasts, and it is not expressed in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs during latency (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that UL7 induces phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, resulting in the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in endothelial cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Additionally, UL7 was observed to be a proangiogenic factor inducing angiogenesis in aortic endothelial cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the current study, we examined the functional aspects of UL7 on HCMV reactivation in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs as well as the effect of this protein on hematopoiesis. UL7 protein was found to bind Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt-3R), inducing differentiation of both CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs and blood monocytes, thus promoting myelopoiesis. We observed that deletion of UL7 in HCMV significantly reduced the ability of the virus to reactivate using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> latency models. These results indicate that UL7 is a Flt-3R ligand that is an important factor for HCMV reaction in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs through the induction of myeloid cell differentiation.</p>

        <p>Since HCMV UL7 induces signaling through the STAT3 and MAP kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathways, resulting in the production of IL-6 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), which is important for both myeloid cell differentiation and viral reactivation, we initially examined the effect of UL7 expression in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs on the activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activated through these pathways. For these studies, CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs were transduced with an adenovirus vector expressing UL7 (Ad-UL7) followed by analysis of RTKs 24Â h posttransduction using the PathScan RTK signaling antibody array that detects the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in 28 RTKs and activation of 11 signaling nodes. Analysis of the results revealed a 5.8-fold increase in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and a 3.4-fold increase in Flt-3R, as well as activation of intracellular Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3 in comparison to a control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1A</xref>).</p>

            <p>UL7 activates Flt-3R, inducing phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. (A) Purified CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs were infected with adenovirus expressing UL7 (Ad-UL7) or GFP (Ad-GFP). Cell lysate were harvested at 24Â h and analyzed using PathScan signaling antibody array. The experiment was performed with cells from two independent donors for each set of duplicate spots. Significant results (more than twofold induction) are marked with an asterisk; error bars show the standard errors of the means (SEM). (B) Protein lysates were generated and immunoblotted for phosphorylation of Flt-3R, Akt, and ERK1/2 from serum-starved RS4;11Â cells stimulated (+) with 50Â ng/ml of pUL7, Fc, or Flt-3L for the indicated time (in minutes). P-Flt3, phosphorylated Flt3; P-Akt, phosphorylated Akt; P-ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2. (C) RS4;11Â cells were transiently transfected with Flt-3R siRNA or a scrambled siRNA for 24Â h, and stimulated for 10Â min. (D) RS4;11Â cells were pretreated with AC220 (100Â nM) for 1Â h and then stimulated for 10Â min. Protein lysates were generated and immunoblotted for phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Equal loading was confirmed by Flt-3R, Akt, ERK1, and actin antibody staining. Numbers under the immunoblots indicate relative phosphorylation of Flt-3R, Akt (Thr308), or ERK1/2 normalized to the amount of Flt3-R, Akt or ERK1 and to the value of untreated cells untreated or cells treated with Fc.

        <p>Flt-3R is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic lineage cells, and activation of this receptor mediates CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC, lymphoid, and myeloid cell differentiation events (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">â</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylation of Flt-3R results in the activation of signaling in the Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. These observations suggested that UL7 may act as a Flt-3R ligand, activating the signaling events observed in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs. In order to determine whether secreted UL7 binds Flt-3R to activate signaling, soluble Flt-3 ligand (Flt-3L), purified UL7 (pUL7), or a protein control (Fc) was added to cultures of bone marrow lymphoblast RS4;11Â cells that express high Flt-3R levels (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), followed by analysis of Flt-3R signaling events. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1B</xref>, pUL7 induced phosphorylation of Flt-3R (14-fold compared to the Fc control), Akt (8-fold), and ERK1/2 (9-fold) within 10Â min of stimulation. To determine whether the effects of UL7 were mediated through Flt-3R, RS4;11Â cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting Flt-3R followed by administration of pUL7, Fc, or Flt-3L. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1C</xref>, Flt-3R siRNA significantly decreased the protein level of the receptor and that correlated with the reduction to basal levels of Akt or ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by pUL7 or Flt-3L. The specificity of the Flt-3R siRNA is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.Â S1</xref> in the supplemental material. To further confirm these results, RS4;11Â cells were treated with the Flt-3R inhibitor quizartinib (AC220), followed by the addition of pUL7, Flt-3L, or Fc, and analysis of signaling was performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1D</xref>, addition of AC220 abolished the pUL7-induced phosphorylation of Flt-3R, Akt, and ERK1/2. Similar results were obtained in primary blood monocytes stimulated with Flt-3L, pUL7, or Fc in the presence or absence of AC220 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.Â S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to determine whether pUL7-mediated ERK1/2 and AKT signaling is due to direct interaction with Flt-3R, stable HEK-293 cells expressing human Flt-3R (HEK-293-hFlt-3R) were made. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2A</xref>, pUL7 or Flt-3L, but not the Fc control, induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 only in HEK-293-hFlt-3R cells, and this effect was blocked by treatment with AC220. HEK-293 cells do not express the receptor, and neither pUL7 nor Flt-3L was able to activate downstream signaling. In order to determine whether pUL7 directly binds to Flt-3R, biotinylated pUL7 was added to cultures of HEK-293-hFlt-3R or control cells and assessed for binding by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2B</xref>, pUL7 bound to the HEK-293-hFlt-3R cells, but not control cells, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, a reduction in binding by 62% was observed in cells incubated with 100-fold excess of nonbiotinylated pUL7 and 63% with 100-fold excess of Flt-3L compared to HEK-293-hFlt-3R cells incubated with biotinylated pUL7 alone. Finally, treatment with the anti-Flt-3R antibody significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) decreased the binding of biotinylated pUL7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2C</xref>). In order to compare the relative activities of pUL7 and Flt-3L, HEK-293-hFlt-3R cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations (0.05 to 10Â nM) of the two ligands, and Flt-3R phosphorylation was measured by a PathScan ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2D</xref>, the highest level of total tyrosine phosphorylation induced by pUL7 and Flt-3L was achieved at 10Â nM after 10Â min of stimulation, suggesting a similar mode of Flt-3R activation.</p>

        <p>To extend the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4</xref>, we examined the ability of HCMVÎUL7 to reactivate in a humanized mouse model. In this model, CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs are engrafted into NOD-<italic>scid</italic>IL2RÎ³c null mice (huNSG), followed by HCMV infection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). After viral latency is established, HCMV can be reactivated and disseminated into tissues through infected macrophages following treatment of mice with G-CSF and AMD3100 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5</xref>, both WT HCMV and HCMVÎUL7 were able to establish a low level of latent infection in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5A</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5B</xref>). However, only WT HCMV, not HCMVÎUL7, reactivated in these tissues. The lack of reactivation in mice infected with HCMVÎUL7 was not due to differences in the levels of human cell engraftment compared to the animals infected with WT HCMV, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">TableÂ 1</xref>. Interestingly, analysis of human hematopoietic cell populations in WT HCMV-infected huNSG mice compared to HCMVÎUL7-infected huNSG mice indicated that CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5C</xref>), but not lymphocyte populations (CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>), were increased in the peripheral blood in WT HCMV-infected mice.

At 8Â weeks postinfection, viral reactivation was triggered by treating latently infected WT HCMV and HCMVÎUL7 (<italic>n</italic> = 5) animals with G-CSF and AMD-3100. At 1Â week posttreatment, mice were euthanized and tissues were harvested. Total genomic DNA was isolated from spleen (A) and liver (B) tissues, and HCMV genomes were quantified using quantitative PCR with primers and probe specific for the <italic>UL141</italic> gene. Statistical significance was determined using two-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroniâs <italic>posthoc</italic> test (<italic>P</italic>Â values are shown). Peripheral blood was harvested from mock-infected huNSG mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5), huNSG mice latently infected with WT HCMV (<italic>n</italic> = 4), or HCMVÎUL7-infected huNSG mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5) at 8Â weeks postinfection and analyzed by flow cytometry for the relative percentage of human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (C), CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (D), and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells (E). All samples were treated with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer, blocked with human and mouse serum, and stained with antibodies specific for human CD3, CD14, CD19, and CD45, and mouse CD45. Data shown for each individual huNSG mouse were gated on total, viable, mouse CD45<sup>â</sup>, human CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes. Error bars represent standard errors of the means. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukeyâs posthoc test (<italic>P</italic>Â values are shown; NS, not significant).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In summary, our results indicate that UL7 signals through the Flt-3R to activate the PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways in both CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs and blood monocytes, resulting in differentiation of these cells. pUL7 was sufficient to induce CD34<sup>+</sup> HPC myelopoiesis and monocyte differentiation, and deletion of the gene in the virus altered CD14<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic populations in tissues. These observations, in combination with the inability of HCMVÎUL7 to reactivate in latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs, suggest that UL7 mediates the cellular differentiation necessary for viral reactivation from latency. We propose a model in which inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) trigger reactivation of latent HCMV in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs by activating immediate early (IE), early, and late genes. The late gene UL7 is then secreted from cells and through an autocrine manner binds to Flt-3R on HCMV-infected cells, inducing myeloid cell differentiation into macrophages, thus allowing full expression of the viral transcriptome and production of progeny virus.</p>
      <p>UL7 belongs to the RL11 family (RL11-13, UL1, UL4-11, RL6, RL5A) that encodes a characteristic domain, called RL11D, which has limited sequence homology to immunoglobulin domains and to the immunomodulatory E3 proteins of adenoviruses (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). All members of the family are dispensable for virus growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, and most of the viral genes are predicted to encode membrane glycoproteins (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Functional data for these genes are limited. RL13 has been described as a potent inhibitor of viral replication (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and an immunomodulatory protein (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). UL1 is a viral tropism factor (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), UL8 was reported to decrease the release of proinflammatory factors (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and UL10 (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and UL11 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) were observed to modulate T cell activation. Among RL11D genes, UL7 exhibits high sequence conservation across different CMV genotypes (97 to 100% intragenotype conservation and 83 to 93% intergenotype conservation), suggesting a critical role for UL7 in viral fitness (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>
      <p>Reactivation of HCMV <italic>in vitro</italic> can be triggered from early myeloid cells (CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells) by differentiation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Early studies demonstrated that treatment of monocytes with a mixture of cytokines that promote macrophage differentiation could trigger the reactivation of IE gene expression (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and, in some instances, infectious particles (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). More recently, studies have now established that HCMV reactivation occurs in myeloid progenitors differentiated into dendritic cells (DCs) by specific cytokine stimulation, including IL-6 (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We previously reported that UL7 induces secretion of IL-6 in endothelial cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of long-term cultures of nonadherent, experimentally latent monocytes in media supplemented with IL-6 has been shown to induce HCMV reactivation (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and similarly, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated reactivation of HCMV from experimentally latent immature DCs has been shown to be dependent on IL-6 (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). An interesting aspect of these studies was the phenotype of the differentiated monocyte: the cells reactivating HCMV coexpressed both macrophage (CD68) and DC (CD83) markers. In accordance with these data, we observed an increase of CD68 in monocytes and CD11c DCs after 4Â days of stimulation with pUL7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>).</p>
      <p>Among herpesviruses, HCMV UL7 is not the only viral factor able to induce cellular differentiation. Kaposiâs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a viral IL-6 that shares 25% homology with human IL-6 and is sufficient to drive blood to lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation through the JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). KSHV also encodes a viral microRNA (miRNA), miR-K12-11, that shares 100% seed sequence homology with hsa-mir-155, an oncogenic human miRNA that functions as a key regulator of hematopoiesis and B-cell differentiation (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). An <italic>in vivo</italic> study validated miR-K12-11 as a functional ortholog of miR-155 in the context of hematopoiesis by demonstrating that miR-K12-11 induces B-cell expansion and potentially KSHV-associated lymphomagenesis (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Our new data now demonstrate that UL7 represents the first HCMV-encoded protein to regulate hematopoietic differentiation events, in particular by favoring myeloid cell differentiation.</p>
      <p>Flt-3R is a member of the type III RTK family and is known to play a crucial role during hematopoiesis (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In normal bone marrow, Flt-3R is selectively expressed on CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells and immature hematopoietic progenitors, including B-lymphoid progenitors, myeloid precursors, and monocytes (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Furthermore, it has been experimentally shown that CD34<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells can give rise to two different populations according to the level of Flt-3R expression: cells expressing high levels of the receptor mature into granulocyte-macrophage colonies in <italic>in vitro</italic> myeloid colony assays, while cells that express low levels of the receptor preferentially mature into burst-forming unit erythroid colonies (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Flt-3R is also expressed in other hematopoietic organs, such as the spleen, liver, thymus, lymph nodes, and placenta, and is found in blood-forming organs, such as gonads and brain (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Here, we found that UL7 is able to bind Flt-3R on cells expressing the Flt-3R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2B</xref>) and is sufficient to induce both myeloid colony formation from HPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3A</xref>) and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>).</p>
      <p>A commonly encountered clinical manifestation of HCMV infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid-organ transplant recipients is myelosuppression (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Despite the well-described clinical relevance of hematopoietic cell lineage infection by HCMV, the fundamental mechanisms underlying myelosuppression and graft failure are poorly understood. Several mechanisms may explain the deleterious effect of HCMV on bone marrow function, including altering hematopoiesis in infected cells and an altered cytokine expression program that affects the bone marrow microenvironment. In regard to direct effects, our new data suggest that expression of UL7 induces myeloid colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3A</xref>) and is essential <italic>in vivo</italic> for the HCMV-driven maturation and expansion of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5C</xref>). We hypothesize that secretion of HCMV UL7 directly promotes myelopoiesis, which may explain the increase in CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in tissues of humanized mice infected with WT HCMV, but not HCMVÎUL7. Our observation that UL7 regulates hematopoiesis has implications on the potential role of HCMV in hematological diseases.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, HCMV reactivation is a multistep process that involves changes in the cellular environment. An incorrect assumption would be that there is one de facto mechanism required for viral reactivation. The induction of IE gene expression is predicted to be essential for initiating HCMV reactivation; however, expression of these genes does not dictate that infectious virus will be produced from latently infected cells. Our data indicate that other viral gene products, such as UL7, and cellular interactions that lead to myeloid cell differentiation are important for driving HCMV reactivation and production of progeny virus. Future studies will elucidate the role of UL7 in HCMV reactivation and development of hematopoietic disease.</p>

        <p>CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) were isolated from fetal liver obtained from Advances Bioscience Resources and cultured as previously described (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donors as approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects at Louisiana State University Health Sciences CenterâShreveport, and follows all guidelines outlined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll Histopaque 1077 gradient (Sigma-Aldrich) and then washed with irrigation-grade saline, and the monocytes were purified over a Percoll gradient (Amersham Pharmacia). Purified monocytes were washed in RPMI 1640 medium and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 1% human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich). RS4;11 cells (bone marrow lymphoblasts) and MRC-5 cells (fetal human lung fibroblasts) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Long-term cultures were maintained in Myelocult supplemented with hydrocortisone in Transwells above an irradiated M2-10B4 and S1/S1 stromal cell monolayer for 12Â days (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). After 12Â days in long-term bone marrow culture, infected hematopoietic cell populations were serially diluted twofold in reactivation medium, namely, RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1Â mM sodium pyruvate, 2Â mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100Â U/ml penicillin, 100Â Âµg/ml streptomycin, 15Â ng/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 15Â ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and 15Â ng/ml Flt-3L (all cytokines purchased from R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Fibroblasts were examined microscopically for GFP expression for up to 40Â days. To differentiate virus made as a result of reactivation from virus preexisting in the cell cultures, an equal number of cells was serially diluted and plated on fibroblasts after being mechanically disrupted. The frequency of infectious center production during the culture period was measured using a limiting dilution assay as previously described (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p>

        <p>Purified CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs were infected with Ad-UL7 or Ad-Empty for 24Â h at an MOI of 1,000, and then 5 Ã 10e2 cells/ml were seeded in methylcellulose medium, MethoCult H4434 (Stem Cell Technologies) in a minimum of three replicate dishes per group. Hematopoietic colonies were scored microscopically 7 and 14Â days later. Fresh peripheral blood monocytes were treated with pUL7 (50Â ng/ml) or Flt-3L (50Â ng/ml) in the presence or absence of AC220 (100Â nM), plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips, and incubated for 6Â days. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) and visualized with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). The average size (in arbitrary units) of at least 50 monocytes for each experimental arm was determined from the captured images using ImageJ software.</p>

Cells were treated with an Fc receptor (FcR) blocking reagent (MACS), followed by staining with anti-CD68 antibody conjugated to PE (BioLegend) or anti-CD11c antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 700 (BioLegend). After antibody (Ab) staining, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences). Human cell reconstitution and specific human cell populations were determined by flow cytometry on freshly isolated mononuclear cells obtained from blood from humanized or control mice. Samples were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer, washed with PBS, and stained with the viability dye Zombie Aqua (BioLegend) prior to antibody staining. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked prior to and during staining using human and mouse serum. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using antibodies specific for the human cell surface markers CD3 (clone UCHT1), CD14 (M5E2 or HCD14), CD19 (HIB19), CD45 (HI30), and the murine cell surface marker CD45 (all from BioLegend). All samples were fixed with 2% neutral buffered formalin prior to analysis. All data were collected and analyzed using an LSRII flow cytometer equipped with FACS Diva (Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo v10 (TreeStar).</p>

The animals (12 to 14Â weeks postengraftment) were treated with 1Â ml of 4% thioglycolate (Brewerâs medium; BD) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection to recruit monocyte/macrophages. At 24Â h posttreatment, mice were infected with wild-type HCMV TB40E or HCMVÎUL7-infected fibroblasts (approximately 10<sup>5</sup>Â PFU of cell-associated virus per mouse) via i.p. injection. A control group of engrafted mice were mock infected using uninfected fibroblasts.

Viral genomes in humanized mice were normalized to 1Â Âµg input DNA. Viral genomes synthesized during infection in CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs were normalized to the total cell number determined using human Î²-globin as a reference (probe, GGACAGATCCCCAAAGGACT; forward primer, 5â²-TTAGGGTTGCCCATAACAGC; reverse primer, 5â²-TTGGACCCAGAGGTTCTTTG). The reaction was initiated using TaqMan Fast Advanced master mix (Applied Biosystems) activated at 95Â°C for 10Â min, followed by 40 cycles (1 cycle consists of 15Â s at 95Â°C and 1Â min at 60Â°C) using a StepOnePlus TaqMan PCR machine.
