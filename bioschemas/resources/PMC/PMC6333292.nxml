        <p id="P2">The clinical benefit in patients with diverse types of metastatic cancers
that is observed upon blockade of the PD-1 â PD-L1 interaction has
highlighted the importance of this inhibitory axis in the suppression of
tumor-specific T cell responses<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In spite of the
key role of PD-L1 expression by cells within the tumor micro-environment, our
understanding of the regulation of the PD-L1 protein is limited<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Using a haploid genetic screen, we here identify CMTM6, a type 3
transmembrane protein of previously unknown function, as a regulator of the
PD-L1 protein. Interference with CMTM6 expression results in impaired PD-L1
protein expression in all tumor cell types tested and in primary human dendritic
cells. Furthermore, through both a haploid genetic modifier screen in CMTM6
deficient cells and genetic complementation experiments, we demonstrate that
this function is shared by its closest family member CMTM4, but not by all other
CMTM members tested. Notably, CMTM6 increases the PD-L1 protein pool without
affecting PD-L1 transcript levels. Rather, we demonstrate that CMTM6 is present
at the cell surface, associates with the PD-L1 protein, reduces its
ubiquitination and increases PD-L1 protein half-life. Consistent with its role
in PD-L1 protein regulation, T cell inhibitory capacity of PD-L1 expressing
tumor cells is enhanced by CMTM6. Collectively, our data reveal that PD-L1
relies on CMTM6/4 to efficiently carry out its inhibitory function, and suggest
potential new avenues to block this pathway.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P3">Antibodies that block the PD-1 â PD-L1 axis are currently evaluated in
approximately 800 clinical studies and have been approved for 7 different tumor types.
In addition, expression of PD-L1 on either tumor cells or on tumor-infiltrating immune
cells identifies patients that are more likely to respond to these therapies<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In
view of the limited understanding of the regulation of PD-L1 expression, we set out to
identify PD-L1 protein regulators through genetic screening. Interferon gamma
(IFNÎ³) treated haploid HAP1 cells<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> express high levels of cell surface PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Based on this observation, we
performed a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based haploid genetic screen for
PD-L1 modulators in IFNÎ³ treated HAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1a</xref>, experimental outline as in <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).
The entire IFNÎ³R signaling pathway<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> plus
IRF1, a known regulator of PD-L1 upon IFNÎ³ exposure<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> were identified as strong hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary
table 1</xref>), demonstrating the validity of the screen setup. In addition, the
PD-L1 gene itself (CD274) showed a strikingly different integration pattern in
PD-L1<sup>HI</sup> and PD-L1<sup>LOW</sup> cells. Specifically, whereas
PD-L1<sup>LOW</sup> cells showed the expected enrichment of integrations towards the
5â end of the gene, a strong enrichment of integrations in intron 5 and 6 was
observed in PD-L1<sup>HI</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig.
1b</xref>), fully consistent with the recently described negative regulatory role of
the PD-L1 3â UTR<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">In addition to the above hits, we identified CKLF (Chemokine-like factor)-like
MARVEL transmembrane domain containing family member 6 (CMTM6) as one of the most
significant hits within PD-L1<sup>LOW</sup> cells. CMTM6 was not observed in a similar
screen for regulators of IRF1 protein levels<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
suggesting that its role was independent of the IFNÎ³R pathway. CMTM6 is a
ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that belongs to a family of 8 MARVEL
domain-containing proteins<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> for which no clear
function has been described. Transcriptome analysis of tumor samples in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed CMTM6 expression in all of the analyzed samples distributed
across 30 cancer types, and showed that RNA expression levels of CMTM6 and CD274 are
weakly correlated in the majority of tumor types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended
Data Fig. 2</xref>). shRNA mediated knockdown of CMTM6 in HAP1 cells reduced
IFNÎ³-induced PD-L1 expression approximately 2-fold as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). To assess whether CMTM6 also influences
PD-L1 cell surface levels beyond the HAP1 system, we examined the effect of CMTM6
knockdown in a series of tumor lines. In A375 melanoma cells, which only show detectable
PD-L1 expression after IFNÎ³ exposure, CMTM6 knockdown prevented
IFNÎ³âinduced PD-L1 expression to a large extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, reduction up to 11 fold). CMTM6-deficient A375 clones
generated with CRISPRs/Cas9 likewise showed reduced cell surface and overall PD-L1
protein levels, while lentiviral reconstitution of CMTM6 reverted this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). In the 8505C thyroid cancer cell line
that shows a high basal level of PD-L1 expression, both steady state and
IFNÎ³-induced PD-L1 cell surface and total protein levels were substantially
reduced by CMTM6 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>, up to 7- and
5-fold). In total, we assessed the effect of CMTM6 knockdown in 12 human tumor lines,
representing melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a-d</xref>), thyroid cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3e,f,i,k</xref>), lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3l,n-p</xref>) and CML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), and also in three short term cultures of melanoma xenografts
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3q</xref>), and consistently
observed diminished expression of PD-L1 (between 2 and 11 fold) upon knockdown of CMTM6.
Reduced PD-L1 cell surface levels were likewise observed when cells were stained with
recombinant PD-1-Fc protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig.
3h,j,m</xref>). PD-L1 can both be expressed by cancer cells and by infiltrating
immune cells, and PD-L1 expression on immune cells may contribute to T cell
inhibition<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. To assess whether CMTM6 also influences PD-L1 levels in primary human
dendritic cells (DCs), we generated DCs from human bone marrow (BM) progenitors<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Comparison of LPS-induced PD-L1 expression in
control and CMTM6 knockdown DCs showed that partial knockdown of CMTM6 resulted in
partial reduction of PD-L1 cell surface levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2h,i</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">The above data establish CMTM6 as a modulator of PD-L1 protein levels. Whereas in
some tumor lines, the effect of CMTM6 knockdown is profound (e.g. A375, 8505c), in
others it is moderate (e.g. HAP1), suggesting the possible existence of (an) additional
regulator(s). We therefore generated CMTM6-knockout HAP1 cells and performed a modifier
screen, with the aim to identify genetic factors that selectively regulate PD-L1 in the
absence of CMTM6. Consistent with the primary screen, genes mediating IFNÎ³R
signaling were prominent hits. As expected, in this setting, integrations within the
CMTM6 locus were no longer enriched within the PD-L1<sup>LOW</sup> cell population
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary table 2</xref>).
Strikingly, in CMTM6-deficient HAP1 cells, CMTM4, another member of the CMTM family with
55% homology to CMTM6 was identified as a positive regulator of PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably, while CMTM4 is a highly
significant hit in CMTM6-deficient HAP1 cells (36.7-fold,
FCPvâ¤10<sup>-314</sup>), it is not in CMTM6 proficient HAP1 cells (0.9-fold,
FCPv=0.94789), suggesting that in this system, CMTM4 functions as a back-up regulator of
PD-L1 expression.</p>
    <p id="P6">To validate these data, we transduced H2030 cells, in which CMTM6 depletion
modestly suppresses PD-L1 expression and CMTM4 is highly expressed, with shRNAs for
CMTM4 and CMTM6, either separately or in combination. In these cells, silencing of CMTM6
led to repression of IFNÎ³-induced PD-L1 expression that was further enhanced when
CMTM4 was simultaneously targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). More directly, ectopic
expression of CMTM4 could fully restore IFNÎ³-induced PD-L1 expression in
CMTM6-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b,c</xref>). To
understand whether regulation of PD-L1 expression is a specific property of CMTM6 and 4,
we individually introduced FLAG-tagged versions of all CMTM family members into
CMTM6-deficient A375 cells. Contrary to what was observed upon CMTM6 and 4 introduction,
expression of other CMTM members (detected for CMTM1, 3, 5, and 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4d,e</xref>) did not induce a substantial increase in
PD-L1 expression, as assessed by either flow cytometry or Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">To study the mechanism by which CMTM6 regulates PD-L1 levels, we first assessed
the relationship between CMTM6 expression and PD-L1 mRNA levels. Comparison of PD-L1
mRNA levels and cell surface protein levels at different time points after IFNÎ³
stimulation revealed that while CMTM6 depletion greatly reduced PD-L1 cell surface
levels, induction of PD-L1 mRNA by IFNÎ³ was not substantially altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended
Data Fig. 5d</xref>). Notably, both in cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>) and in primary DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5b,c</xref>) levels of MHC-I and PD-L2 protein were not
significantly affected by CMTM6 inhibition, indicating that while CMTM6 regulates PD-L1
at the protein level, it is not a general regulator of protein translation or
stability.</p>
    <p id="P8">To determine where in the PD-L1 protein life cycle CMTM6 exerts its effect,
CMTM6-deficient and CMTM6-overexpressing A375 cells were transduced with a V5-tagged
PD-L1 gene. Immunoprecipitation of PD-L1-V5 at different time points after a 1-h
<sup>35</sup>S pulse labeling demonstrated a much more rapid decay of PD-L1 in the
absence of CMTM6 (fraction PD-L1 remaining at t= 6h; 94% versus 8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig.
5e</xref>). Notably, PD-L1 resistance to deglycosylation by Endoglycosidase H, was
equally efficient in both cell populations, indicating that CMTM6 influences PD-L1
protein fate after egress from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">To reveal the cellular localization of endogenous CMTM6, we performed mass
spectrometry analysis of different subcellular fractions, demonstrating that endogenous
CMTM6 is predominantly present within the plasma membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>) In addition, immunohistochemical analysis
confirmed the presence of CMTM6 at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig.6b</xref>). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of 9
melanomas revealed CMTM6 protein expression in human tumors, and also showed that PD-L1
staining in 8 of these samples was restricted to areas with clear CMTM6 expression
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). Similarly, in 3 out
of 5 PD-L1 positive lung cancer samples, we observed PD-L1 localization in CMTM6
positive areas.</p>
    <p id="P10">A hypothesis arising from the above data is that CMTM6 and PD-L1 could interact
molecularly. To test this, we performed immunoprecipitations of PD-L1 followed by
Western blot analysis of CMTM6, and vice versa. In lysates from A375 cells or 8505C
cells, anti-PD-L1 antibody co-immunoprecipitated CMTM6. Likewise, PD-L1 was present in
anti-CMTM6 immunoprecipitates. As expected, co-immunoprecipitation of PD-L1 and CMTM6 in
A375 was dependent upon PD-L1 induction by IFNÎ³. As a further control for
antibody specificity, co-immunoprecipation of both CMTM6 and PD-L1 was abrogated upon
gene inactivation of the partner molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7a,b</xref>).
Co-immunoprecipitation was likewise observed for PD-L1 and CMTM4, and CMTM4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 7c,d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">To understand how CMTM6 influences PD-L1 degradation, wild type, CMTM6 KO, and
CMTM6 overexpressing A375 were transduced with a V5-tagged PD-L1 gene and ubiquitination
of PD-L1 was analyzed. In the absence of CMTM6, the amount of ubiquitinated PD-L1 was
increased, in spite of the overall lower PD-L1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig.8a</xref>),
suggesting that CMTM4/6 may protect PD-L1 from ubiquitination. Intriguingly, STUB1, an
E3 ubiquitin ligase that has amongst others been implicated in degradation of Foxp3 in
regulatory T cells<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, was identified as a
negative regulator of PD-L1 expression in both haploid genetic screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8b,c</xref>). To assess whether STUB1
affects PD-L1 degradation, we disrupted STUB1 in either CMTM6 proficient or deficient
A375 cells. Deletion of STUB1 resulted in a more profound increase in PD-L1 levels in
CMTM6 deficient than in CMTM6 proficient cells, identifying STUB1 as an E3 ligase that
causes destabilization of PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>), either
by direct modification of one of the lysines in the PD-L1 cytoplasmic domain or
indirectly. Consistent with the model that CMTM6 may protect PD-L1 by preventing
ubiquitination, cell surface levels of PD-L1/L2 fusion proteins are only influenced by
CMTM6 when carrying the PD-L1 transmembrane and intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8d,e</xref>). Exploiting the fact that
CMTM6 and PD-L2 do not show detectable association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8f</xref>), we also used PD-L1/L2 fusion proteins to demonstrate
that the PD-L1 transmembrane domain is required for efficient interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8g</xref>). In line with the role of the
PD-L1 transmembrane and intracellular domain in CMTM6-mediated stabilization,
orientation mapping of CMTM6 revealed that a large part of the molecule is located
within the cytosol and cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Fig.
9</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">In view of the broad RNA expression pattern of CMTM6, we wished to assess the
effects of CMTM6 on the membrane proteome in an unbiased manner. Mass spectrometric
analysis of a series of independent CMTM6 deficient and proficient clones revealed that,
both within the RKO colorectal cancer line and the 8505c thyroid cancer cell line, PD-L1
was the most significantly influenced hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4h,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10a,b</xref>).
Expression of PD-L1 affects T cell responsiveness in a quantitative manner, with higher
levels of PD-L1 expression leading to an increased impairment of T cell survival/
activity<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. To determine whether CMTM6 influences PD-L1 mediated T cell suppression,
we incubated mixtures of MART-I TCR transduced T cells that expressed different levels
of PD-1 with antigen-loaded CMTM6-deficient or âproficient 8505C or A375 cells.
IL-2 production of PD-1<sup>INTER</sup> and PD-1<sup>HI</sup> T cells upon encounter of
CMTM6-proficient tumor cells was reduced relative to that of PD-1<sup>NEG</sup> T cells.
However, upon CMTM6 disruption in either 8505C or A375 tumor cells, IL-2 production of
PD-1 expressing T cells was significantly restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10c-e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P13">Recent work has revealed a number of mechanisms of transcriptional and
post-transcriptional (dys)regulation of the PD-L1 gene in tumor cells<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Here we identify CMTM6 and CMTM4 as regulators of PD-L1 protein stability.
Based on the available data we conclude that CMTM6/4, the two most closely related
members of the CMTM family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4f</xref>),
influence PD-L1 expression across a range of cell types. Furthermore, the observations
that I) CMTM6 affects PD-L1 protein stability at late time points after biosynthesis,
II) CMTM6, CMTM4 and PD-L1 interact, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, III) CMTM6 is
largely located at the cell surface collectively sketch a model in which CMTM6 interacts
with PD-L1 at the tumor cell surface and thereby protects it from degradation. In line
with this, CMTM6 influences the levels of PD-L1 ubiquitination and absence of the STUB1
E3 ubiquitin ligase partially reverts the CMTM6 KO phenotype. Intriguingly, for one of
the other CMTM family members, CMTM7, cell surface expression has been described in
association with the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, where it may contribute to BCR
signaling<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. It could be speculated that
CMTM6 may also fulfill a similar role in the immunological synapse between T cells and
tumor cells or antigen presenting cells (APCs). Finally, the co-localization of PD-L1
and CMTM6 in melanoma samples and the observation that CMTM6 depletion ameliorates PD-L1
mediated T cell suppression suggest a potential value of CMTM6/4 as therapeutic targets,
either in isolation, or to enhance the effectiveness of the current PD-L1/PD-1 blocking
therapies.</p>

        <title>Identification of genetic regulators</title>
        <p id="P15">The approach as described in Brockmann <italic>et al</italic>. was
followed to identify regulators of PD-L1 abundance. Mutagenized HAP1 libraries
(starting with either wild-type cells or CMTM6-deficient HAP1 cells) were
expanded to approximately 1.5x10<sup>9</sup> cells and subsequently treated with
0.5 ng/ml IFNÎ³ (Peprotech) for 24 hours to induce expression of PD-L1.
Subsequently, approximately 3x10<sup>9</sup> cells were dissociated using
trypsin-EDTA (Life technologies), washed with PBS and stained with FITC labelled
anti-PD-L1 antibody (BD pharmingen) at 1:20 dilution for 30â at RT in PBS
containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.2% w/v sodium azide
(Sigma). Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1% FCS
and stained with FITC labeled polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig (BD pharmingen) at
1:100 dilution for 30â at RT in PBS containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum
albumin (Sigma) and 0.2% w/v sodium azide (Sigma) to allow signal amplification.
Following two washes with PBS containing 1% FCS and one wash with PBS, stained
cells were passed through a 40 Âµm strainer (BD FalconTM) and subsequently
fixed using BD fix buffer I (BD biosciences) for 10 minutes at 37Â°C,
followed by a wash with PBS containing 1% FCS. Subsequently, cells were
permeabilized by suspension in cold (-20Â°C) BD permeabilization buffer
(BD biosciences) while vortexing, and incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to
incubation with 100 Âµg/ml RNAse A (Qiagen, Germany) and 10 Âµg/ml
propidium iodide (Cayman Chemical) at 37Â°C temperature for 30 minutes.
Alternatively, cells were subjected to treatment with 3 ÂµM 4',6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30 minutes. Stainings were concluded by a
final wash in PBS 10% FCS. Following staining, cells were sorted on a Biorad S3
Cell sorter (Biorad) or a Moflo Asterios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) to
collect the 1-5% of cells with the highest and lowest PD-L1 staining intensity
and 1n DNA content. Sorted cells were used for isolation of genomic DNA and
retroviral gene-trap insertion sites were retrieved, mapped and analyzed as
described in Brockmann <italic>et al</italic>. For PD-L1 it has been described
that alterations of the 3â portion of the gene can stabilize the gene
product and lead to higher PD-L1 proteins levels<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. As this was also recapitulated by our gene-trap insertion method
(gene-trap integrations into the 3â portion of the gene resulting in
increased rather than decreased staining intensity for PD-L1), integrations in
the portion of the gene that lies downstream of exon 5 (Refseq identifier
NM_014143.3) were disregarded where indicated.</p>

Two-dimensional kernel density estimates were computed using the MASS::kde2d()
function in version 3.3.1 of the R programming language. We computed the
correlations between CMTM6 and 10<sup>4</sup> randomly selected genes (identical
between sequencing projects) to obtain a reference distribution of correlation

PD-L1 (âCMTM6 KO+PD-L1 OEâ). IL-2 production in T cells that
expressed high, intermediate, or low levels of PD-1
(âPD-1<sup>HI</sup>â, âPD-1<sup>INTER</sup>â
or âPD-1<sup>LOW</sup>â) were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Untransduced A375 cells (âParentalâ) served as controls. Data
are representative of three independent experiments and were analyzed by
unpaired t-test <bold>(c)</bold>. Error bars represent s.d. of triplicates.
