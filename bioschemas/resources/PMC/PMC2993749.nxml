      <abstract>
        <p>A pool of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) accumulates within nucleoli and accounts for a large fraction of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase activity in this subnuclear structure. Using a combination of fluorescence imaging with quantitative proteomics, we mapped the subnuclear localization of the three mammalian PP1 isoforms stably expressed as GFP-fusions in live cells and identified RRP1B as a novel nucleolar targeting subunit that shows a specificity for PP1Î² and PP1Î³. RRP1B, one of two mammalian orthologues of the yeast Rrp1p protein, shows an RNAse-dependent localization to the granular component of the nucleolus and distributes in a similar manner throughout the cell cycle to proteins involved in later steps of rRNA processing. Quantitative proteomic analysis of complexes containing both RRP1B and PP1Î³ revealed enrichment of an overlapping subset of large (60S) ribosomal subunit proteins and pre-60S nonribosomal proteins involved in mid-late processing. Targeting of PP1 to this complex by RRP1B in mammalian cells is likely to contribute to modulation of ribosome biogenesis by mechanisms involving reversible phosphorylation events, thus playing a role in the rapid transduction of cellular signals that call for regulation of ribosome production in response to cellular stress and/or changes in growth conditions.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The primary role of the nucleolus, a nonmembrane-bound organelle that forms around tandem repeats of rDNA in the nucleus, is to ensure that the cell receives the essential supply of ribosomes required for protein synthesis (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Boisvert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Because it must respond to dynamic changes in cell growth rate and metabolic activity with either an increase or decrease in ribosome subunit biogenesis, tight control of nucleolar pathways of rDNA transcription and ribosome subunit processing and export is critical. Several key cellular kinases and phosphatases have been linked to regulation of nucleolar events throughout the cell cycle, and our work has shown that the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) accounts for â¼80% of Ser/Thr phosphatase activity within this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The intracellular localization and substrate specificity of the core catalytic subunit of PP1 is regulated through its association with a spectrum of interacting proteins, termed targeting subunits (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cohen, 2002</xref>). Most of these targeting subunits contain conserved motifs that mediate direct binding to PP1, including the âRVxFâ motif with its consensus Arg/Lys-Val/Ile-Xaa-Phe/Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Egloff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wakula <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Over the years biochemical, bioinformatic, and proteomic approaches have been used to identify and characterize a wide range of PP1 targeting subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Meiselbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Roadcap <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Moorhead <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Hendrickx <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), however the current list still cannot account for the large number of regulatory pathways in which PP1 is known to play a critical role.</p><p>Of the three closely-related mammalian isoforms, PP1Î±, PP1Î², and PP1Î³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Barker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Shima <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Barker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>), only the Î² and Î³ isoforms show significant accumulations within nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lesage <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Andreassen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This difference has been attributed to a specific N-terminal Arginine residue (Arg19 in PP1Î² and Arg20 in PP1Î³) that is not present in PP1Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lesage <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Having validated the use of FP-PP1 fusion proteins as markers for endogenous pools of PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), we went on to demonstrate that isoform-specific binding partners detected via affinity purification of the respective tagged proteins reflect the isoform-specific localization patterns observed by fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Although our initial comparison of nuclear PP1 complexes focused on the Î± and Î³ isoforms, we have now established a cell line stably expressing low levels of GFP-tagged PP1Î². In addition, we have further optimized a SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative immunoprecipitation approach for both increased sensitivity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and developed an efficient method for extracting multiprotein complexes from purified nucleoli for interactome analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chamousset <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). As presented here, nucleolar interactome screens of GFP-PP1 define a wide range of multiprotein complexes to which the phosphatase is targeted, including complexes involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis.</p><p>The pathway of ribosome subunit biogenesis is initiated in the nucleolus by RNA Pol Iâmediated transcription of pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Russell and Zomerdijk, 2005</xref>). This transcript is further processed into 18S transcripts (which form the 40S subunit) and 5.8S and 28S transcripts (which combine with RNA Pol III-transcribed 5S rRNA to form the 60S subunit). The ribosomal proteins assemble on these complexes (RPLs with 60S, RPSs with 40S), where they are joined by a large number of nonribosomal processing proteins. In yeast, &gt;300 proteins, many of which show transient associations, have been characterized or predicted to play roles in the maturation and export of pre-ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Nissan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Affinity purification-based analysis of mutant strains that lead to accumulations of pre-rRNAs characteristic of early, intermediate, or late steps, in combination with proteinâprotein interactions deposited from 32 individual publications in the BioGrid database, was recently used to build up a network of physical interactions consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lebreton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, structure and function are intrinsically linked in the nucleolus, and thus localization to a particular compartment can provide clues to protein function. The transcription machinery is found in the fibrillar center (FC) and rRNA transcription occurs at the border of this region with the dense fibrillar component (DFC), while additional processing occurs within the granular component (GC). A further remarkable feature of the mammalian cell nucleolus is its coordinated mitotic disassembly and post-mitotic reassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dundr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Leung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Disassembly at prophase is initiated by inhibition of transcription, and reassembly in early G1 is driven by resumption of transcriptional activity. In most cases proteins with related roles remain associated throughout this process.</p><p>Using biochemical, fluorescence imaging, and quantitative proteomic approaches, we define here a specific pool of PP1 in the granular component of mammalian cell nucleoli that is associated with pre-60S ribosomal subunit processing complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and Antibodies</title><p>All FP-PP1 constructs were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). PP1Î²-EGFP was prepared by subcloning the PP1Î² cDNA into the EGFP-N3 vector. The EYFP-NLS plasmid (nuclear localization signal cloned into EYFP-C1), which accumulates in nucleoli in addition to its cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, was a generous gift from Dr. Archa Fox (Western Australia Institute for Medical Research, Australia). RRP1B was cloned from an expressed sequence tag using oligonucleotide primers and inserted into EGFP/mCherry/pET vectors. The Val and Phe residues of the putative PP1 binding motif (residues 684 and 686) were changed to Ala using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Nol1, RPL5, and RPS23 were cloned and inserted into the EGFP-C1 vector, while EGFP/EYFP-tagged RPA39, Fibrillarin, PWP1, Gar1, B23, Pescadillo, and RPL27 were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Leung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). YFP-RRN3 and GFP-NNP-1/Nop52 were generous gifts from Drs. Joost Zomerdijk (University of Dundee, UK) and Daniela Hernandez-Verdun (Institut Jacques Monod, France). Recombinant 6His-tagged RRP1B was expressed in bacteria, purified using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA beads, and injected into rabbits for the generation of the polyclonal antibodies used in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Far Western Blotting</title><p>Recombinant purified wild-type and KATA mutant RRP1B (200 ng each) were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, along with control lanes containing 10 Î¼g of total protein from rat nuclear extracts.

For live cell imaging, cells were cultured in glass-bottomed dishes (WILLCO; Ted Pella, Redding, CA). For fixed cell imaging, cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 5 min in 3.7% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in CSK buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 10 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM EDTA) at room temperature, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable Cell Lines</title><p>HeLa<sup>EGFP-PP1Î±</sup> and HeLa<sup>EGFP-PP1Î³</sup> stable cell lines were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

Images were collected using a 60Ã NA 1.4 Plan-Apochromat objective and recorded with a CoolSNAP coupled-charge device (CCD) camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). DIC imaging was obtained with the approporiate prism insert (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). The microscope was controlled by SoftWorX acquisition and deconvolution software (Applied Precision). DNA was stained by incubating the cells for 30 min in medium containing 0.25 Î¼g/ml Hoechst No 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For FRAP experiments, a single section was imaged before photobleaching, a region of interest was then bleached to â¼50% of its original intensity using the 488-nm laser, and a rapid series of images was acquired after the photobleaching period. Recovery curves were plotted and the mobile fraction and half time of recovery were determined using SoftWorX and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</p></sec><sec><title>RNAse and DNAse Treatments</title><p>Cells were grown on glass coverslips, rinsed once with PBS and once with ASE buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA), and permeabilized by incubating for 5 min at room temperature in ASE buffer plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then treated for 20 min at room temperature with either PBS (mock treatment), RNAse (100 Î¼g/ml; Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), or DNAse (1000 U/ml; Worthington). After treatment the cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% PFA in CSK buffer for 5 min. After 10 min permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were stained sequentially with the rabbit polyclonal anti-RRP1B primary antibody, DyLight488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce), Hoechst 33342 (2.5 Î¼g/ml for 2 min), and Pyronin Y (33 mM for 5 s). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using FluorSave mounting media (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting</title><p>Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5; 0.5 M NaCl; 1% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40; 1% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS; 2 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The lysate was passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen) to shear DNA and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C.

All control or âlightâ media contained L-arginine and L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). GFP-tagged proteins were affinity purified by incubation for 1 h at 4Â°C with the GFP-Trap-A reagent (Chromotek, Martinsried, Germany). For affinity purification of endogenous RRP1B, the affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was covalently conjugated to protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Covalently-conjugated affinity purified rabbit IgG was used for the control IP. Control and experimental IPs were carried out separately by incubating the beads with equivalent total protein amounts of cellular, nuclear or nucleolar extracts. After a 1 h incubation at 4Â°C, the extracts were removed and the beads washed once with ice-cold RIPA buffer. The control and experimental beads were then carefully combined and washed an additional three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer.

To discriminate between a potential role for RRP1B in rRNA transcription or rRNA processing, we exploited the unique properties of the nucleoside analog 5,6-Dichloro-1-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). DRB inhibits certain protein kinases, including casein kinase II (CK2), and indirectly inhibits RNA Pol II transcription.

Despite the breakdown in nucleolar structure, RNA Pol I transcription continues, with rRNA transcripts originating in the transcriptional beads and diffusing to the neighboring processing bodies. On treatment of U2OS cells with DRB, both endogenous and GFP-RRP1B relocalize to smaller granular bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, arrows) surrounded by dispersed masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, arrowheads). The relocation of core nucleolar RRP1B to the nucleoplasm upon DRB treatment was also demonstrated by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). On removal of DRB, nucleoli reform and RRP1B and GFP-RRP1B resume their normal GC localization pattern (Supplemental Figure 3A). Coexpression of RRP1B and markers for either transcription/early processing (fibrillarin, Supplemental Figure 2F) or later rRNA processing (RPL27, Supplemental Figure 2D) confirmed that the RRP1B granular bodies are indeed processing bodies, distinct from the transcriptional âbeads.â</p><p>The association of RRP1B with rRNA transcripts is supported by the observation that the protein remains associated with the major nucleolar RNA signal after both ActD and DRB treatment.

While ActD and DRB treatment led to relocalization of RRP1B-containing processing complexes within nuclei, we surmise that this is caused by different signal transduction events because the primary targets of both chemicals are distinct biomolecular complexes. Using a Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) approach, we measured the dynamic turnover of nucleolar GFP-RRP1B in untreated cells compared with cells treated with either ActD or DRB. The kinetics of recovery of a photobleached GFP-tagged protein can reflect the degree and affinity of its association with other proteins and/or nucleic acids. While both drug treatments induce reorganization of the nucleolus, ActD induces a significant (p &lt; 0.01 in a two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test) decrease in the mobile fraction of nucleolar GFP-RRP1B (17.3 Â± 0.82% for Act D vs. 79.6 Â± 1.0% for untreated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Conversely, the nucleolar pool of GFP-RRP1B after DRB treatment has a similar mobile fraction to that observed in untreated cells, but the recovery rate is increased when compared with untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). These differences in the dynamic turnover rate of GFP-RRP1B between untreated, ActD-, and DRB-treated cells reveals distinct underlying interaction profiles. Their precise nature awaits investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>RRP1B Coprecipitates 60S Ribosomal Subunit Processing Complexes</title><p>To identify the molecular complexes with which RRP1B associates, we first carried out a quantitative SILAC-based immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) of GFP-RRP1B from U2OS<sup>GFP-RRP1B</sup>âderived nuclear extracts. The most highly enriched interaction partner was Nol1, a known pre-60S (large) ribosomal subunit processing protein, followed by several other 60S processing proteins. We also noted a specific enrichment of the ribosomal proteins associated with the large/60S ribosomal subunit proteins (RPLs) over the small/40S ribosomal subunit proteins (RPSs) (full dataset presented in Supplemental Table 1). When coexpressed in cells, GFP-RRP1B and mCh-Nol1 colocalize throughout the entire cell cycle, supporting their presence in overlapping molecular complexes (Supplemental Figure 2A). A quantitative immunoprecipitation of the nonPP1 binding mutant GFP-RRP1B<sub>KATA</sub> revealed a similar binding profile to that of GFP-RRP1B, with the obvious lack of PP1 (data not shown).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Quantitative immunoprecipitation of RRP1B selectively enriches molecular complexes containing 60S (RPL) proteins and pre-60S ribosomal subunit processing proteins.

Thus, we used our RRP1B antibody for immunodepletion of the endogenous protein and carried out a quantitative proteomic screen of endogenous nuclear RRP1B. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, endogenous RRP1B, like GFP-RRP1B, specifically enriches a large pool of RPLs (36/40 of the total) and an even more comprehensive array of known pre-60S processing proteins. Significant overlap was found between the interactomes of endogenous RRP1B and GFP-Nol1 (quantitatively immunoprecipitated from U2OS<sup>GFP-Nol1</sup>-derived nuclear extracts; data not shown), confirming that these proteins are found in similar complexes. When we highlighted pre-60S ribosomal subunit-related proteins in our nucleolar GFP-PP1Î³ interactome, we confirmed both the enrichment of RRP1B and of these particular factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), indicating that pulldown of nucleolar PP1 enriches a subset of pre-60S ribosomal subunit processing complexes to which it is targeted by RRP1B. Consistent with the plurifunctional nature of this enzyme, the nucleolar PP1 interactome also contains additional phosphatase complexes not involved in pre-60S ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>The quantitative aspect of these experiments, including built-in negative controls, combined with stringent analyses and the application of âbead proteomesâ to flag potential false positives (see Materials &amp; Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), provides a high level of confidence in the protein interaction partners identified. Nevertheless, we felt it important to confirm the interaction of RRP1B with a representative subset of proteins identified in our proteomic screen, including PP1Î² and PP1Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), Nol1 and B23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), two RPLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) and the pre-60S processing factor fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). We also confirmed that RRP1B coprecipitates NNP-1/Nop52, indicating that both of these NOP52 domain-containing proteins are likely present in pre-60S processing complexes. This is intriguing as both are putative mammalian orthologues of yeast Rrp1p.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>RRP1B associates with 60S ribosomal processing proteins and is found with pre-60S ribosomal subunits in both the nucleolus and nucleoplasm.

In the bottom panel, IP of GFP-RRP1B copurifies PP1Î³ from nucleoplasmic and nucleolar but not cytoplasmic cellular fractions.

Indeed, Western blot analyses show that the small (40S) ribosomal subunit protein RPS23 and the H/ACA snoRNP protein Gar 1 do not coprecipitate RRP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Furthermore, the RNA Pol I-related proteins RPA39 and RRN3, absent from our RRP1B interactome studies, do not coprecipitate RRP1B, again confirming the predicted role for RRP1B in later rRNA processing steps. Lastly, the 60S processing protein PWP1, which we found enriched with PP1 but not RRP1B, coprecipitated little to no endogenous RRP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). It should be noted that the small amount of RRP1B could be due to the difference in approach, as antibodies can be more sensitive than the mass spectrometer, and trace amounts of PWP1 may indeed be present in the RRP1B interactome.</p><p>Because our results suggest RRP1B may play a role in 60S processing, we wanted to examine the overlap between our RRP1B interactome and that of pre-60S processing complexes.

This confirms that RRP1B is found in similar complexes to its yeast counterpart.

Similarly, PP1Î³ coprecipitated with GFP-RPL27 from these fractions. No detectable PP1Î³ was found with cytoplasmic 60S subunits, although a significant pool of the phosphatase is found in this subcellular compartment.</p><p>Finally, sucrose gradient fractionation confirmed the specific association of RRP1B with nuclear pre-60S (and not pre-40S) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D).

Here we have identified RRP1B as a PP1 binding partner that docks via its RVxF motif. To further explore the architecture and possible origins of KIAA0179/RRP1B we performed a bioinformatic analysis of the sequenced genomes of a broad range of organisms. Using truncations of RRP1B and a Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the NOP52 domain (PFAM website), we identified and aligned all NOP52 domain-containing proteins and used three independent methods (Neighbor Joining, Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony) to generate phylogenetic trees. Because primary sequences of RRP1B homologues are highly divergent, apart from the NOP52 domains, trees were built with the NOP52 domain sequences only. This yielded similar relationship patterns for all three methods.</p><p>The result of this search strategy and phylogenetic analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>. Consistent with the NOP52 domain having been classified as a nucleolar domain of eukaryotic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Savino <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), we did not identify NOP52 proteins in Bacteria or Archeae. Although the NOP52 domain is highly conserved between KIAA0179/RRP1B and NNP-1/RRP1, phylogenetic analysis groups these proteins into separate branches when organisms contain both of these genes (NNP-1/RRP1 sequences are shaded blue). This analysis revealed the striking feature that the NNP-1/RRP1 protein appears only in mammals and, through gene duplication, has proliferated in several mammalian species. KIAA0179/RRP1B, on the other hand, is found in organisms throughout the eukaryotic lineage and is typically present as a single copy, with the exception of the genomes of <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> (Chromalveolate), <italic>P. patens</italic> (spikemoss), and <italic>G. max</italic> (bean).

Reports have also linked the nucleolus to control of a wide range of cellular pathways including cell division and DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Pederson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Boisvert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). It is now believed to be a major stress sensor, responding to stresses such as hypoxia and DNA damage by coordinating inhibition of ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle arrest, and, in certain cases, triggering of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mayer and Grummt, 2005</xref>). However, many of the regulatory events underlying these key functions remain undefined. Here we identified, via quantitative proteomics, fluorescence imaging and biochemical approaches, a nucleolar pool of PP1-RRP1B that is a component of pre-ribosomal subunit processing complexes. These results confirm our previous observations that a pool of PP1 activity accumulates within nucleoli and accounts for a large fraction of the associated Ser/Thr dephosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>With previous studies linking PP1 activity to the regulation of diverse nuclear functions ranging from gene transcription and splicing to cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Moorhead <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">MacKeigan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that this ubiquitous phosphatase would be targeted to more than one site within the nucleolus and to more than one level of the ribosome biogenesis pathway. Using an efficient nucleolar protein extraction method developed specifically for interactome analyses, we demonstrated the selective enrichment of a range of multiprotein complexes with nucleolar PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chamousset <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Identifying RRP1B as an interaction partner for nucleolar-targeted PP1Î² and PP1Î³ was not surprising as it has long been suggested as a candidate, although the interaction had not been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Moorhead <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Hendrickx <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Our biochemical studies and the dominant negative effect of RRP1B<sub>KATA</sub> overexpression conclusively validate RRP1B as a PP1 interactor.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis, namely that PP1 forms more than one complex in the nucleolus, is corroborated by several observations. The first is the enrichment of additional known/putative targeting subunits and a wide range of multiprotein complexes in the nucleolar PP1 interactome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chamousset <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Another is the presence of PP1 in both pre-40S and pre-60S peaks, with PP1-RRP1B limited to pre-60S peaks. Lastly, the limited dominant-negative effect of RRP1B<sub>KATA</sub> mutant overexpression suggests that other functional nucleolar PP1 complexes are not affected by its specific displacement from pre-60S ribosomal subunits. This work thus opens novel routes to elucidate the impact of PP1 on ribosome biogenesis via a direct approach on individual complexes.</p><p>The name RRP1B derives from the protein's homology to the yeast Rrp1p protein (a.k.a. NOP52), which is involved in generation of 27S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Horsey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the first published functional study on RRP1B identified it as a new candidate susceptibility gene for breast cancer progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Crawford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These data suggested that the protein plays a key role in regulating cell growth and proliferation, which could be a consequence of its predicted role in ribosome subunit biogenesis. More recently, RRP1B has also been linked to regulation of E2F-mediated apoptosis, and is believed to function directly in transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Paik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The cellular role(s) of RRP1B thus remains open for debate, particularly in light of the existence of a second mammalian orthologue of NOP52, RRP1/NNP-1/Nop52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Savino <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>We provide here the first evidence for a role for RRP1B in 60S ribosome processing and also demonstrate that this protein has a functional PP1 interaction motif lacking in RRP1/NNP-1/Nop52. It is likely that RRP1B is the more complex cellular effector, as it can recruit a phosphoregulatory mechanism to a specific subset of processing complexes in the ribosome biogenesis pathway. It is also noteworthy that predicted RNA binding motifs display a different pattern between RRP1 and RRP1B, which may reflect differing rRNA affinities. These differences will likely have significant impact on their respective cellular interaction profiles and functions. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that RRP1/NNP-1/Nop52 and KIAA0179/RRP1B are both homologues of yeast Rrp1p, yet KIAA0179/RRP1B is the true functional orthologue. This is consistent with the significant overlap between our endogenous nuclear RRP1B interactome and recently identified TAP-tagged yeast Rrp1p interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Horsey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This does not exclude RRP1/NNP-1/Nop52 from a role in pre-60S subunit processing, and indeed it is also found in the RRP1B and PP1 interactomes, however it does raise the question of how much, if any, functional overlap exists between these two mammalian proteins with regard to pre-60S ribosomal subunit processing.</p><p>We have shown here that the subnucleolar targeting of RRP1B throughout the cell cycle coincides with that of several GC-localized pre-60S processing proteins, consistent with a role for RRP1B in nucleolar rRNA processing. This targeting requires rRNA transcripts but not the presence of rDNA. In contrast, fibrillarin, which is a DFC protein involved in earlier processing steps, is partially lost with RNAse treatment and fully lost with DNAse treatment, reflecting its association with both rDNA and rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Ochs <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>). This again suggests that RRP1B is mainly involved in rRNA processing, likely interacting with these molecules after they are released from sites of transcription.</p><p>We also exploited the well-characterized segregation of nucleolar components in response to actinomycin D and DRB treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Scheer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Louvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) to compare RRP1B behavior to that of both rRNA transcripts and other known rRNA processing proteins. The retention of a pool of RRP1B in the remnant central body of the nucleolus was unique compared with the loss of nucleolar B23 and the âcappingâ of fibrillarin at the nucleolar periphery. Interestingly, the pool of RRP1B that is lost to the nucleoplasm was found to accumulate in small foci. Further work will be necessary to define these foci and determine whether they represent a link to the suggested transcriptional role of RRP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Paik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). With regard to the pool of nucleolar-retained RRPB, it remains associated with both Pyronin Y-stained nucleolar RNA and GFP-RPL27 (Supplemental Figures 1C and 2C), again suggesting a structure/function relationship between RRP1B and nucleolar pre-60S processing complexes. Nucleolar-retained GFP-RRP1B in actinomycin Dâtreated cells is significantly less mobile than GFP-RRP1B in untreated cells, and as this pool of protein is also lost upon RNAse treatment, it may be sequestered or âtrappedâ in inactive RNA processing complexes when ribosome biogenesis shuts down (Supplemental Figure 1C).</p><p>In contrast, DRB treatment, which induces segregation of FC, DFC, and GC constituents into a characteristic âbeads on a stringâ conformation while preserving RNA Pol I activity, leads to a small but significant increase in the mobility of nucleolar GFP-RRP1B. The mechanism of action of DRB is still debated, as it is a CK2 inhibitor that also indirectly inhibits RNA Pol II. Furthermore, different DRB derivatives (DMAT, TBB) give contradictory results with regard to GFP-RRP1B dynamics (Supplemental Figure 3B). Finally, CK2 targets several key nucleolar proteins, including B23 and nucleolin, and the kinase has been postulated to play a crucial role in compartmentation of nucleolar protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Louvet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Thus, apart from experimental differences including cell type, concentration, and treatment time, and the off-target effects of kinase inhibitors that can complicate interpretation of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), ribosome biogenesis has such a plethora of potential CK2-dependent effectors that direct and indirect effects are difficult to tease apart.</p><p>Our localization data strongly supported a role for RRP1B in later stages of ribosome subunit biogenesis. To validate this hypothesis, we quantitatively defined the nuclear interactome of RRP1B. We indeed found an enrichment of large ribosomal proteins (RPLs) and proteins linked to processing of the pre-60S subunit. In addition, comparison with the nucleolar interactome of PP1Î³ showed a significant overlap in the subset of proteins found in pre-60S processing complexes. Previously, we noted that the RRP1B<sub>KATA</sub> interactome is very similar to the wild-type RRP1B interactome. This suggests that RRP1B presence at rRNA processing complexes occurs independently of PP1, making RRP1B a bona fide PP1 targeting subunit.</p><p>Strikingly, proteins involved in very late stages of ribosome maturation and nuclear export are distinctly lacking in the RRP1B and PP1Î³ interactomes. Using stably expressed GFP-RPL27 as a marker for 60S subunits, we confirmed that association of RRP1B and PP1Î³ with these complexes occurs in both the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Mature cytoplasmic 60S subunits, however, do not coprecipitate either RRP1B or PP1, placing the site of action of this holoenzyme complex firmly within the nucleus.</p><p>Rrp1/Nop52 is an essential gene in yeast, with knockout compromising cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Horsey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). When we reduced cellular levels of RRP1B in U2OS or HeLa cells by â¼90% using an siRNA approach (Supplemental Figure 4, B and D), little or no effect on cell growth or proliferation was evident. Although no significant changes were observed in the distribution of either nuclear pre-ribosomal subunits or mature cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits (data not shown), an increase in larger RNA species detected by Northern blot analysis may suggest an analogous role to its yeast counterpart in 28S processing (Supplemental Figure 4C). A similar lack of effect on cell growth or proliferation in response to reduction of RRP1B levels in human cells was observed recently by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Paik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This may reflect either a degree of genetic redundancy, or that levels of RRP1B are kept deliberately high to ensure it is never limiting for the essential process of ribosome subunit production and cell growth. Alternately, subtle effects may be masked by the high level of ribosome biogenesis in immortalized cell lines and/or the presence of RRP1/NNP-1/Nop52. Alternate approaches, such as analysis in primary cell lines or concurrent knockdown of RRP1B and RRP1/NNP-1, will be required to better understand the functional role of RRP1B-PP1 in regulation of pre-60S processing and, potentially, coordination of this pathway with regulation of transcription and/or proliferation.</p><p>Importantly, future work must focus on identification of RRP1B-PP1 targets within the pre-60s processing complex. Known phosphoproteins such as B23 and EIF6 are likely targets, with the latter being particularly attractive given that dephosphorylated pre-60S subunit-bound EIF6 is believed to prevent premature association of 40S and 60S subunits in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Ceci <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It is also important to further characterize proteins identified in the RRP1B nuclear interactome that are not directly related to pre-60S processing, as they may represent links to pathways that are controlled concurrently with ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>As discussed here, the ubiquitous nature of PP1 in cellular regulation emphasizes the importance of identifying and characterizing the specific holoenzyme complex(es) involved in each pathway. As part of our systematic dissection of the molecular mechanisms controlling targeting of PP1 activity to nucleolar substrates in ribosome biogenesis, cellular proliferation, and stress response pathways, we have identified and characterized a major nucleolar pool of PP1 targeted to pre-60S ribosomal subunit processing complexes by RRP1B. It is anticipated that this information will lead to a more direct therapeutic intervention by facilitating the targeted disruption of PP1 activity in disease states related to nucleolar dysfunction, including cancer, accelerated aging and viral infection.</p></sec>
