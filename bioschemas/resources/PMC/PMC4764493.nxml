      <abstract>
        <p>SLURP-1 is a secreted toxin-like Ly-6/uPAR protein found in epithelium, sensory neurons and immune cells. Point mutations in the <italic>slurp-1</italic> gene cause the autosomal inflammation skin disease Mal de Meleda. SLURP-1 is considered an autocrine/paracrine hormone that regulates growth and differentiation of keratinocytes and controls inflammation and malignant cell transformation. The majority of previous studies of SLURP-1 have been made using fusion constructs containing, in addition to the native protein, extra polypeptide sequences. Here we describe the activity and pharmacological profile of a recombinant analogue of human SLURP-1 (rSLURP-1) differing from the native protein only by one additional <italic>N</italic>-terminal Met residue. rSLURP-1 significantly inhibited proliferation (up to ~ 40%, EC<sub>50</sub> ~ 4 nM) of human oral keratinocytes (Het-1A cells). Application of mecamylamine and atropine,ânon-selective inhibitors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively, and anti-Î±7-nAChRs antibodies revealed Î±7 type nAChRs as an rSLURP-1 target in keratinocytes. Using affinity purification from human cortical extracts, we confirmed that rSLURP-1 binds selectively to the Î±7-nAChRs. Exposure of <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> expressing Î±7-nAChRs to rSLURP-1 caused a significant non-competitive inhibition of the response to acetylcholine (up to ~ 70%, IC<sub>50</sub> ~ 1 Î¼M). It was shown that rSLURP-1 binds to Î±7-nAChRs overexpressed in GH<sub>4</sub>C<sub>l</sub> cells, but does not compete with <sup>125</sup>I-Î±-bungarotoxin for binding to the receptor. These findings imply an allosteric antagonist-like mode of SLURP-1 interaction with Î±7-nAChRs outside the classical ligand-binding site. Contrary to rSLURP-1, other inhibitors of Î±7-nAChRs (mecamylamine, Î±-bungarotoxin and Lynx1) did not suppress the proliferation of keratinocytes. Moreover, the co-application of Î±-bungarotoxin with rSLURP-1 did not influence antiproliferative activity of the latter. This supports the hypothesis that the antiproliferative activity of SLURP-1 is related to âmetabotropicâ signaling pathway through Î±7-nAChR, that activates intracellular signaling cascades without opening the receptor channel.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A number of endogenous ligands acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and belonging to the Ly-6/uPAR family were discovered in higher animals [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These proteins share structural homology with âthree-fingerâ snake Î±-neurotoxins, specific inhibitors of nAChRs [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of these endogenous ligands (Lynx1, Lynx2, Lypd6) are membrane-tethered via GPI-anchor and co-localize with nAChRs, thus modulating their functions in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], while others like Secreted Ly-6/uPAR Related Protein-1 and -2 (SLURP-1 and SLURP-2) are secreted proteins [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Human SLURP-1 was initially isolated from blood and urine libraries [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Point mutations in the <italic>slurp-1</italic> gene cause the autosomal inflammation skin disease Mal de Meleda [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using recombinant analogue of SLURP-1 it was proposed that SLURP-1 acts as allosteric modulator and potentiates ion currents through Î±7-nAChRs in the presence of acetylcholine (ACh) [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. SLURP-1 participates in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, supposedly via interaction with Î±7-nAChRs, and may function as an autocrine/paracrine hormone in epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It was shown that SLURP-1 activates protein kinase signaling cascade resulting in up-regulation of nuclear factor-ÎºB expression in keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Expression of SLURP-1 in immune cells and its anti-inflammatory effects on human intestinal epithelial cells and immunocytes have been described [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, SLURP-1 is expressed in sensory neurons and might be involved in the cholinergic pain modulation within the spinal cord [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, SLURP-1 expression was detected in HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and the SLURP-1 expression level in these cells was significantly suppressed upon nicotine treatment [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Application of a recombinant SLURP-1 analogue to these cells resulted in a significant reduction of cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>In spite of the growing evidences supporting a modulatory action of SLURP-1 on nAChR function, the current knowledge about the mechanism of SLURP-1/nAChR interactions is very limited. The progress in this field is hampered by the inability to extract sufficient amounts of SLURP-1 from natural sources and difficulties in the production of the recombinant protein with native sequence and structure. The majority of previous works on SLURP-1 were done using fusion constructs containing, in addition to SLURP-1, some polypeptide fragments, e.g. <italic>N</italic>-terminal SUMO protein, MPB protein, GST protein or <italic>C</italic>-terminal Myc-tag [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It was shown previously that the native SLURP-1 isolated from blood (MW 8,842 Da, 81 a.a.) and a recombinant SLURP-1 analogue produced in HEK-293 cells (yield ~ 0.1 mg/l of cell culture) were not glycosylated [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This fact points to the possibility to use bacterial expression systems for recombinant production of SLURP-1. Previously we developed the high-efficient <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expression system for protein analogue with the near-native structure (rSLURP-1, MW 8,974 Da, 82 a.a.) [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The only difference of rSLURP-1 from the native protein is the additional <italic>N</italic>-terminal Met residue appearing due the cloning of <italic>rslurp-1</italic> gene into the expression vector, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. The relatively high yield of the recombinant production (~ 5 mg of the refolded protein from 1 l of cell culture) allowed us to carry out NMR structural study of rSLURP-1, which ultimately confirmed its structural homology with the âthree-fingerâ snake neurotoxins and Lynx1, another âthree-fingerâ human neuromodulator acting on nAChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

      <p>Here we describe functional properties of rSLURP-1. Our data provide a new insight into the mechanism of SLURP-1 action and reveal some discrepancies with the results of previous studies obtained using SLURP-1 analogues with non-native sequences. For example, our findings demonstrate that SLURP-1 acts on Î±7-nAChRs as an allosteric antagonist and interacts with the receptor outside the classical ligand-binding site.</p>

      <p>Water-soluble domain of human Lynx1 (ws-Lynx1), rSLURP-1, and rSLURP-2 were produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as described in [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149733.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0149733.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The purity and homogeneity of the recombinant proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, HPLC, and MALDI-MS. The disulfide bonds formation was confirmed in the reaction with the Ellmanâs reagent (5,5â²-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The correct spatial structure for each batch of produced proteins was confirmed by NMR-spectroscopy.</p>

        <title>Experiments with Het-1A cells</title>
        <p>Human Het-1A squamous esophageal cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL-2692). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in BEBM media (Lonza/Clonetics Corporation) according to ATCC recommendations. Culture flasks and plates were precoated with a mixture of 0.01 mg/mL fibronectin, 0.03 mg/mL bovine collagen type I and 0.01 mg/mL bovine serum albumin dissolved in culture medium. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1Ã10<sup>4</sup> cells per well), and 24 h later the analyzed compounds were added to cells. Next, cells were incubated for 48 h, examined under microscope, and characterized using WST-1 assay and fluorescent Hoechst/propidium iodide assay as described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hoechst/propidium iodide assay allows evaluation of cell viability by staining all cell nuclei with Hoechst 33342 and dead cell nuclei with propidium iodide. For inhibition of nAChRs and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), 1 h preincubation of keratinocytes with 1 Î¼M Î±-bungarotoxin (Î±-Bgtx, Tocris), 10 Î¼M mecamylamine hydrochloride (Mec, Sigma), 1 Î¼M atropine (Sigma), or 1 Î¼g per 50 Î¼l anti-Î±7-nAChR antibody (#ab10096, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was performed before rSLURP-1 application. Antibodies at the same concentration were additionally added to the cells after 24 and 40 hours of incubation with rSLURP-1.</p>

        <title>Affinity purification</title>
        <p>Human temporal neocortical tissue was obtained from an anterior temporal lobectomy performed in two patients (females, age 30, and 44) with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal onset. Written informed consent was obtained before surgery. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee in the Capital Region of Denmark (H-2-2011-104) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The tissue was immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80Â°C until use. The neuropathological examinations of the neocortex revealed no abnormalities.</p>
        <p>rSLURP-1 was dissolved to 2 mg/ml in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O at 4Â°C for 48 hours after which it was coupled to PureProteome NHS Flexibind magnetic beads (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in a ratio of 1:2 (vol/vol) using the manufacturerâs instructions. Successful coupling was confirmed by subsequent protein determination showing a substantial decrease in the protein content of the applied rSLURP-1 solution. Another batch of beads was processed in parallel, but using PBS devoid of rSLURP-1, as a negative control. The beads were incubated in PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum (pH 7.4, 1 hour at 4Â°C) prior to use.</p>
        <p>The brain tissue was lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 Î¼l/ml protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, pH 7.5) using a PT1200C polytron blender (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland) for 20 seconds. The lysate was centrifuged 30 minutes at 160,000Ãg at 20â22Â°C using an airdriven ultracentrifuge (Airfuge, Copenhagen, Denmark), and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 by blending for 20 seconds, and incubated 2 hours at 4Â°C on a rotor (15 rpm). Thereafter, the sample was centrifuged as above and the resulting supernatant was used for affinity purification. Total protein content was determined using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and the protein (0.7â1.0 mg) was incubated with 50 Î¼l magnetic beads in a total volume of 1.5 ml lysis buffer for 18â22 h at 4Â°C on a vertical rotor (15 rpm). The magnetic beads were separated using PureProteome Magnetic Stand (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Subsequently, the beads were washed twice in 1 M NaCl, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5 and three times in 0.1 M NaCl, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5 and immediately processed for Western blotting.</p>

Amounts of lysates containing equal protein content were then diluted in loading buffer (120 mM Tris, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) bromophenol blue, pH 6.8), incubated for 10 minutes at 95Â°C, submitted to gel electrophoresis in AnykD gel (Biorad), and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (BioRad). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked in TBS containing 5% (w/v) dry milk powder, which was also used for antibody incubations. Incubation with primary antisera directed against Î²2 (1:1,000, provided by Dr. Cecilia Gotti), Î±3, Î±4, Î±5, Î±6, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> (1:100 #sc-1771, sc-5591, sc-28795, sc-27292, sc-28958 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Î±7, Î²4 (1:1,000 #ab23832 and 1:100 #ab156213 Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was performed overnight at 4Â°C on parafilm in a humidified container, followed by 3Ã10 minute washes in TBST and 1 h incubation at 21Â°C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). After thorough washing in TBST, enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Western Lightning ECL Pro, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) were used for signal detection and protein bands were visualized using a Chemidoc XR digital image analyser (Biorad).</p>

Next, <sup>125</sup>I-Î±-Bgtx (~ 2000 Ci/mmol) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 nM for 5 min followed by filtration of a reaction mixture on GF/C filters (Whatman, Maidstone) presoaked in 0.25% polyethylenimine (for cells) or on double DE-81 filters (Whatman) presoaked in binding buffer (for Ls-AChBP). Unbound radioactivity was removed from the filters by washes (3Ã3 ml) with the respective incubation buffer.

        <title>rSLURP-1 down-regulates keratinocyte proliferation</title>
        <p>Incubation of Het-1A cells (immortalized line of human oral keratinocytes) with 1 Î¼M rSLURP-1 for 48 h resulted in a significant decrease in the cell number up to 60 Â± 2% relative to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To discriminate between cytotoxicity and reduced proliferation, we performed additional microscopic examination of cells in plate wells and measured their viability with the Hoechst/propidium iodide assay. A decrease in the cell density was clearly observed, whereas morphology of most cells was not disturbed as compared to control (data not shown). Hoechst/propidium iodide assay did not reveal an increase in the fraction of dead cells even at the highest tested concentrations of rSLURP-1 (10 Î¼M): 4 Â± 1% of dead cells for both rSLURP-1 treated cells and in control. Therefore, rSLURP-1 affects Het-1A cells by reducing their proliferation. Analysis of the dose-response curve revealed a concentration-dependent mode of action for rSLURP-1 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 4.3 Â± 0.6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). For comparison, we analyzed cell growth in the presence of ws-Lynx1, another endogenous Ly-6/uPAR protein acting on nAChRs [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], at concentrations up to 1 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). No reduction in the number of cells was observed with ws-Lynx1.</p>
        <p>To distinguish the effects of rSLURP-1 caused by possible interactions with nAChRs and mAChRs (both types of receptors are presented in keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), we measured the antiproliferative activity of rSLURP-1 in the presence of a non-specific blocker of the nAChRs, Mec, and a non-specific antagonist of mAChRs, atropine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We found that Mec did not influence cell growth per se, but completely inhibits the antiproliferative effect of rSLURP-1. Contrarily, atropine neither affected cell growth per se, nor inhibited the effect of SLURP-1. Incubation of keratinocytes with Î±-Bgtx (a competitive antagonist of muscle type, Î±7 and Î±9 nAChRs) also did not affect the cell growth and antiproliferative effects of rSLURP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To further investigate role of Î±7 nAChRs in the antiproliferative action of rSLURP-1 we measured the protein activity in the presence of anti-Î±7-nAChRs antibodies. It was found that application of anti-Î±7 antibodies did not influence cell growth, but significantly inhibits the antiproliferative activity of rSLURP-1 (the relative number of viable cells was increased from ~60% to ~85%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>rSLURP-1 selectively binds to the Î±7 nAChR subtype in the human cortical extracts</title>
        <p>According to previous measurements cultured keratinocytes contain relatively low number of nicotinic receptors [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore to study the pharmacological profile of rSLURP-1 we chose other model system with larger receptor density, namely the extracts from temporal cortex. We performed affinity purification of different nAChR subunits from the extracts of the human temporal cortex using rSLURP-1 coupled to magnetic beads, followed by detection of nAChR subunits. rSLURP-1 isolated Î±7 nAChR subunits, but did not isolate the Î±3, Î±4, Î±5, Î±6, Î²2, or Î²4 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Moreover bead-coupled rSLURP-1 did not isolate subunits of the closely related 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor. None of the subunits were detected when the affinity purification was performed using non-coupled beads, confirming that isolation of Î±7 nAChR subunits was not attributable to a non-specific interaction with the beads.</p>

        <title>rSLURP-1 non-competitively inhibits ACh-evoked currents in Î±7 type nAChRs</title>
        <p>To characterize rSLURP-1 action, electrophysiological recordings were performed on <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing human Î±7 type nAChRs in the absence and presence of 200 pMâ 40 Î¼M rSLURP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

Application of rSLURP-1 did not evoke currents in the absence of ACh. There was no detectable current amplitude reduction at low ACh concentrations, but it became significant (p&lt;0.05, t-test) starting from 100 Î¼M of ACh. This activity resembles the previously described inhibitory activity of ws-Lynx1 which effect also was more pronounced in the presence of high ACh concentration [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The direct comparison of the influence of 5 Î¼M ws-Lynx1 and rSLURP-1 on the currents evoked by 1 mM ACh revealed similar level of inhibition (~ 50%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Moreover, application of rSLURP-1 (1 Î¼M) did not shift ACh dose-response curve revealing absence of competition between rSLURP-1 and ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The progress in molecular biology and studies of ligand-receptor interactions in particular is tightly coupled with the ability to produce recombinant analogues of the proteins which otherwise could not be obtained from natural sources in sufficient amounts [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Frequently, the recombinant proteins differ from the native ones and contain cloning artifacts, stabilizing mutations, purification tags, or non-native glycosylation patterns. These âmodificationsâ could affect the functional and structural properties of a studied protein.</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that the hybrid protein SUMO-SLURP-1 (MW ~ 22 kDa) inhibited proliferation of oral keratinocytes (Het-1A cells) [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and that a recombinant SLURP-1 analogue containing an unprocessed <italic>N</italic>-terminal signal peptide (103 a.a., MW ~ 11 kDa, [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) induced upregulation of nuclear factor-ÎºB gene expression in keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, the transfection of Het-1A cells with siRNA-Î±7 or inhibition of the Î±7-nAChRs with selective antagonist methyllycaconitine has resulted in the disappearance of the effects induced by this SLURP-1 analogue [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a result of above mentioned studies Grando et al have proposed that the effects of native SLURP-1 on keratinocytes could be mediated by agonistic interaction with Î±7-nAChRs [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>In agreement with these findings, we also observed inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation by rSLURP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1</xref>, 82 a.a., MW 8,974 Da). We further demonstrated that the effect of rSLURP-1 was concentration-dependent with pronounced antiproliferative activity at nanomolar concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> of ~4 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The incubation of keratinocytes with anti-Î±7-nAChRs antibodies significantly diminished the rSLURP-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, the preincubation of the cells with Î±-Bgtx (selective antagonist of Î±7-nAChRs) did not influence the rSLURP-1 antiproliferative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This discrepancy forced us to investigate in details the SLURP-1 interaction with its potential molecular targets.</p>
      <p>There are two classes of acetylcholine receptors participating in cholinergic signaling: nicotinic receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels, and muscarinic receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Keratinocytes express both types of acetylcholine receptors [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Some structural homologues of SLURP-1, e.g. non-conventional âthree-fingerâ snake toxin WTX [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and ws-Lynx1 [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), are able to interact with both classes of receptors, nAChRs and mAChRs. Therefore we decided to study whether SLURP-1 displays similar functional dualism. Analysis of the rSLURP-1 antiproliferative effect in the presence of Mec and atropine,ânon-selective inhibitors of nAChRs and mAChRs, respectively, revealed nicotinic receptors as a rSLURP-1 target in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
      <p>To further characterize the potential targets of rSLURP-1 we performed affinity purification of different nAChR subunits using the bead-coupled ligand. Due to a low expression of nicotinic receptors on keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] we used a different tissue: cortical extracts from the human brain. Using this approach we demonstrated for the first time that rSLURP-1 exclusively binds to Î±7 nAChR subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This is strikingly different from the selectivity pattern of ws-Lynx1. In similar experiments, ws-Lynx1 demonstrated the interaction with Î±3, Î±4, Î±5, Î±6, Î±7, Î²2 and Î²4 nAChR subunits [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, our results highlight an exclusive targeting by SLURP-1 of Î±7 nAChRs.</p>
      <p>Electrophysiology experiments revealed that rSLURP-1 diminishes the current amplitudes of Î±7-nAChRs expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, with quite low efficiency (IC<sub>50</sub> of ~1 Î¼M). Notably, the inhibitory effect of rSLURP-1 is increased with increasing ACh concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Enhancement of rSLURP-1 effect in the presence of high agonist (ACh) concentrations is consistent with open channel block (the more receptors are activated by agonist, the more of them are inhibited by rSLURP-1). At the same time the direct blockage of the Î±7-nAChR channel by large âthree-fingerâ molecule seems to be sterically impossible. The similar âblocker-likeâ behavior is not unusual for the nAChR ligands. The well-known nAChR inhibitor d-tubocurarine also has activity of open-channel blocker [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], nevertheless only intersubunit binding sites at the extracellular part of the receptor have been identified so-far [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The non-complete (up to ~ 70%) inhibition of the ACh-evoked currents observed at the high concentrations of rSLURP-1 argues in favor of allosteric mode of interactions with the receptor. We therefore hypothesize that SLURP-1 acts as an allosteric modulator preventing hyperactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting Î±7-nAChRs thus protecting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathways from undesirable activation.</p>
      <p>It has been previously reported that a SLURP-1 variant with a <italic>C</italic>-terminal Myc-tag acted on Î±7-nAChRs at nanomolar concentrations by increasing their current amplitudes [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Here we did not observe an enhancement of current amplitudes by application of rSLURP-1 over a wide range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained by the sequence difference of the SLURP-1 variants. The Myc-tag consists of 10 residues (EQKLISEEDL), and five of them are charged. The involvement of long <italic>C</italic>-terminal tail of the âthree-fingerâ snake Î±-neurotoxins in the interaction with Î±7-nAChRs has been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is therefore possible that this relatively long negatively charged <italic>C</italic>-terminal sequence influences the properties of SLURP-1 and the mode of interaction with the receptor.</p>
      <p>We observed competition between rSLURP-1 and Î±-Bgtx for binding to muscle type nAChR and AChBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). These data suggest that the rSLURP-1 binding site at least partially overlaps with the Î±-neurotoxin binding sites on these targets. Contrary to that, no rSLURP-1 competition with Î±-Bgtx for binding with Î±7-nAChRs was detected in GH<sub>4</sub>C<sub>1</sub> cells overexpressing these receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). At the same time, the affinity purification revealed that rSLURP-1 binds to Î±7-nAChR subunit in these cells although with lower affinity than Î±-Bgtx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The affinity of rSLURP-1 to Î±7-nAChR subunit was comparable or slightly less than affinity of rSLURP-2. Taking in to account that rSLURP-2 acts on Î±7-nAChRs at nanomolar concentrations (Lyukmanova et al, unpublished data) we could not exclude that the rSLURP-1 also has nanomolar affinity to Î±7-nAChRs.</p>
      <p>The absence of competition between rSLURP-1 and ACh was revealed by electrophysiology on <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing Î±7-nAChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Taken together with data obtained on Î±7-nAChRs overexpressed in GH<sub>4</sub>C<sub>1</sub> cells, these findings demonstrate that rSLURP-1 binds to Î±7-nAChRs outside the classical agonist/antagonist binding site. Similar results have been recently reported for ws-Lynx1, which at concentration of 10 Î¼M inhibited currents through Î±7, Î±4Î²2, and Î±3Î²2 receptors, but did not compete with <sup>125</sup>I-Î±-Bgtx and <sup>3</sup>H-epibatidine for binding to Î±7- and Î±4Î²2-nAChRs at concentrations up to 30 Î¼M [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several effects could be responsible for the observed two-order of magnitude difference in the effective rSLURP-1 concentrations in various assays (~ 4 nM for inhibition of keratinocytes proliferation and ~1 Î¼M for suppression of ionic currents at Î±7-nAChRs). First of all, we cannot exclude the possibility that Î±7 receptors of keratinocytes have different properties from the receptors expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. For instance, the observed difference could arise from complex interactions of rSLURP-1 with various states of Î±7-nAChR in keratinocytes (coupled, uncoupled, desensitized etc.). However, the provocative idea that the inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation by rSLURP-1 is not connected with the modulation of ionic currents through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting Î±7-nAChRs seems also possible. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of antiproliferative activity of the nAChR inhibitors (Mec and Î±-Bgtx, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and of ws-Lynx1, which demonstrates modulatory activity on Î±7-nAChR currents that is comparable to that of rSLURP-1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0149733.g003">3C</xref>). We could hypothesize that rSLURP-1 activity in keratinocytes is related to ânon-classicalâ signaling pathway through Î±7-nAChR, that activates intracellular signaling cascades without opening the receptor channel (metabotropic type of signaling). It is possible that SLURP-1 has two different binding sites on Î±7-nAChR, and that binding to the âhigh-affinityâ site mediates metabotropic type of signaling, whereas biding to the âlow-affinityâ site is responsible for the regulation of ion flow through the receptor channel. This would explain the responses of keratinocytes to co-application of SLURP-1 with different Î±7-nAChR inhibitors: the non-specific blocker of nAChR Mec inhibits both metabotropic and ionotropic pathways, while competitive antagonist Î±-Bgtx blocks only ionotropic events and thus does not influence rSLURP-1 antiproliferative activity. The inhibition of the rSLURP-1 antiproliferative effect by anti-Î±7-nAChR antibodies could be explained by sterical hindrances induced by the large antibody molecule, which could shield the rSLURP-1 binding sites on the receptor surface.</p>
      <p>A possible effect of SLURP-1 on metabotropic signaling through the Î±7-nAChR has recently been suggested by Grando et al, who observed that the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> passage through Î±7-nAChRs in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium or by Cd<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions only partially suppress the SLURP-1 effects in keratinocytes [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. According to recent reports, metabotropic signaling through nAChRs could involve different effector molecules: Jak2 kinase [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], EGF and VEGEF receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and G-proteins [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Probably these molecules could sense the changes in the cytoplasmic part of the nAChRs arisen from SLURP-1 binding to extracellular part of the receptor, and transmit the signal further to other cytoplasmic targets.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Engineering of the bacterial expression system for production of rSLURP-1 with near-native structure (the only difference is the addition of <italic>N</italic>-terminal Met) [<xref rid="pone.0149733.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] allowed us to obtain new information about the function of this protein. For the first time we demonstrated that rSLURP-1 binds selectively to the Î±7 subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. rSLURP-1 does not compete with Î±-bungarotoxin for binding to GH<sub>4</sub>C<sub>l</sub> cells expressing Î±7-nAChRs, but inhibits Î±7-nAChRs expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes acting as allosteric antagonist. rSLURP-1 reduces proliferation of human keratinocytes, and the antiproliferative activity of rSLURP-1 is mediated by interaction with Î±7-nAChRs, but not suppressed by Î±-bungarotoxin. Our data support the hypothesis that the effects of SLURP-1 in the cells are mediated by a ânon-classicalâ mode of interaction with Î±7-nAChR, which may rely on metabotropic signaling. We hope that future structural-functional studies will give an opportunity to elucidate possible molecular partners involved in this type of nAChR signaling and shed light on the detailed molecular mechanisms of SLURP-1/receptor interaction.</p>
