          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Variations within the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) are associated with the risk to develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PTPN22 is involved in the regulation of T- and B-cell receptor signaling, but although it is highly expressed in innate immune cells, its function in other signaling pathways is less clear. Here, we study whether loss of PTPN22 controls muramyl-dipeptide (MDP)-induced signaling and effects in immune cells.</p>

          <title>Material &amp; Methods</title>
          <p>Stable knockdown of PTPN22 was induced in THP-1 cells by shRNA transduction prior to stimulation with the NOD2 ligand MDP. Cells were analyzed for signaling protein activation and mRNA expression by Western blot and quantitative PCR; cytokine secretion was assessed by ELISA, autophagosome induction by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were obtained from PTPN22 knockout mice or wild-type animals.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>MDP-treatment induced PTPN22 expression and activity in human and mouse cells. Knockdown of PTPN22 enhanced MDP-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-isoforms p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase as well as canonical NF-ÎºB signaling molecules in THP-1 cells and BMDC derived from PTPN22 knockout mice. Loss of PTPN22 enhanced mRNA levels and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and TNF in THP-1 cells and PTPN22 knockout BMDC. Additionally, loss of PTPN22 resulted in increased, MDP-mediated autophagy in human and mouse cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Our data demonstrate that PTPN22 controls NOD2 signaling, and loss of PTPN22 renders monocytes more reactive towards bacterial products, what might explain the association of PTPN22 variants with IBD pathogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In the healthy gut, commensal bacteria populate our intestine without provoking a significant immune reaction. However, there is an intense and effective immune response as soon as pathogenic bacteria penetrate the epithelial surface. Usually, monocytes and macrophages initiate and orchestrate effective immune responses by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as soon pathogenic bacterial components are present. When recruited to the intestine however, peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) differentiate into intestinal macrophages (iMAC) that are characterized by reduced reactivity and immune tolerance towards commensal bacteria <xref rid="pone.0072384-Rogler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. If the discrimination between pathogenic and commensal bacteria in the gut is disturbed, tolerance is lost and hyper-activated intestinal macrophages drive intestinal inflammation, ultimately resulting in chronic inflammatory conditions as can be observed during inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) with its major subforms, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohnâs disease (CD).</p>
      <p>Monocytes, like other innate immune cells, sense bacteria via conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain containing type 2 (NOD2) <xref rid="pone.0072384-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is obvious that a very tight control of PRR activation is crucial for tolerance towards commensal gut flora. NOD2 is a cytosolic receptor that recognizes invading bacteria by ligation to muramyl-dipeptide (MDP) <xref rid="pone.0072384-Girardin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, a highly conserved bacterial cell wall component. Presence of certain polymorphisms within the gene encoding NOD2, that result in aberrant receptor activation, are associated with IBD <xref rid="pone.0072384-Ogura1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0072384-Hugot1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and malfunction in NOD2 receptor activation interferes with effective clearance of intracellular bacteria in the gut <xref rid="pone.0072384-PetnickiOcwieja1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Upon activation, NOD2 induces the phosphorylation of proteins of the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, resulting in enhanced expression of adhesions molecules and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0072384-Ting1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, NOD2 ligation leads to the induction of autophagy <xref rid="pone.0072384-Cooney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Autophagy is a homeostatic process involved in removal of damaged proteins and organelles in the cytosol, but it also plays an important role in host defense and clearance of intracellular bacteria <xref rid="pone.0072384-Saitoh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Changes in autophagy are involved in IBD pathogenesis, and variants in autophagy-16 like 1 (ATG16L1), a protein crucial for autophagosome formation, result in an enhanced risk for developing CD <xref rid="pone.0072384-Hampe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genome-wide association studies revealed that variants within the gene locus encoding for protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) are linked with the risk to develop autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, UC and CD <xref rid="pone.0072384-DiazGallo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Yet, the functional link between the presence of PTPN22 variants and inflammatory diseases is still not well understood. By dephosphorylation of signaling molecules, tyrosine phosphatases are generally involved in the regulation of immune receptor activity. PTPN22 in particular, has been shown to negatively regulate signaling molecules downstream of T- and B-cell receptors <xref rid="pone.0072384-Cloutier1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072384-Rieck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and disease associated variants lead to altered B-cell, NK-cell and dendritic cell (DC) activation <xref rid="pone.0072384-Rieck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0072384-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However it has not been addressed if PTPN22 also interferes with pattern recognition receptor induced signaling cascades. We have previously shown that PTPN22 expression is decreased in the intestine of patients with active CD, in particular in CD68-positive monocytes/macrophages. Loss of PTPN22 results in decreased signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, but increased MAPK-signaling in human monocytes. On a functional level, PTPN22-deficiency results in elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17 secretion <xref rid="pone.0072384-Spalinger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we address the question whether PTPN22 affects NOD2-induced signaling pathways, cytokine secretion, and autophagy in myeloid cells. We found that loss of PTPN22 leads to aberrant MDP/NOD2-induced MAPK and NF-ÎºB) activation, resulting in changed gene expression and cytokine secretion. Additionally, MDP-induced autophagy was enhanced when PTPN22 was missing. This influence of PTPN22 on IBD associated intracellular pathways could provide an explanation of how PTPN22 variants might functionally be linked with IBD.</p>

Stability of the knockdown was determined prior to each experiment by real-time PCR and knockdown efficiency found between 20â40%. In addition knockdown was verified after each experiment by Western blot or real-time PCR. For NOD2 activation, MDP (Invivogen) was dissolved in DMSO and mixed with FuGene (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) in culture media for 15 min before applying on the cells. For control transfections, DMSO mixed with FuGene was used.</p>

        <title>MDP Treatment Induces PTPN22 Expression and Activity</title>
        <p>First, we addressed whether PTPN22 expression in THP-1 cells might be regulated by MDP-induced NOD2 activation. Cells were treated with different concentrations of MDP and a concentration of 500 ng/ml MDP seemed to exert the highest effect on PTPN22 mRNA expression (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, in our subsequent experiments, cells were treated with 500 ng/ml MDP. We found enhanced levels of PTPN22 mRNA after treatment for 2, 4, 8 and 24 h while longer exposure to MDP (48 h and 72 h) reduced PTPN22 mRNA in THP-1 cells (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). On a protein level, we detected enhanced amounts of PTPN22 reaching a maximum by 24 h treatment (p&lt;0.01). After 48 h, PTPN22 levels in MDP-treated cells were comparable to those in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, PTPN22 phosphatase activity was increased in response to MDP reaching its maximum only after 48 h (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These observations suggest that expression levels and enzymatic activity of PTPN22 protein are not necessarily correlated. To confirm our findings, we next treated bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from wild-type mice for increasing time with MDP. Again, we could detect increased levels of PTPN22 mRNA at 4 h and 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together these findings demonstrate that MDP induces PTPN22 expression and activity in a time-dependent manner.</p>

        <p>To address if activation of other PRRs beside NOD2, might also influence expression of PTPN22, THP-1 cells were treated for increasing time with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligand), the TLR1/2 ligand PamCys or the Nod1 ligand C12-iE-DAP. While stimulation with LPS also led to a significant increase in PTPN22 expression after 24 h, TLR1/2 activation by PamCys reduced PTPN22 expression and C12-iE-DAP-mediated NOD1 activation did not change PTPN22 expression at all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072384.s001">Figures S1AâC</xref>). This indicates that PTPN22 is differentially regulated by distinct pathogen associated molecular patterns and suggest that PTPN22 is regulated by the PRR via different signaling pathways.</p>

        <title>Knock-down of PTPN22 Enhances MAPK Activation</title>
        <p>As PTPN22 is induced by MDP-treatment, we addressed if PTPN22 is involved in the regulation of MDP-induced signaling pathways, such as MAPK or NF-ÎºB activation. For this purpose, THP-1 cells were transduced with lentiviral particles either containing non-targeting control, or PTPN22 silencing shRNA. After selection of cells stably expressing shRNA, PTPN22 expression was reduced for about 60â80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This cell lines were used for all subsequent studies. After treatment with MDP, we detected an increase in p38, JNK, and ERK phosphorylation (meaning activation) in control shRNA transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g002">Figures 2BâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072384.s002">Figures S2A+B</xref>). Loss of PTPN22 enhanced basal and MDP-induced phosphorylation of p38 and MDP-induced JNK phosphorylation.

To confirm our findings, and rule out possible off-target effects of PTPN22 shRNA, we treated BMDC from either wild type (WT) or PTPN22 knockout (KO) mice for 30 min with MDP. Again, we found increased levels of p38 phosphorylation upon MDP-treatment and this increase was further enhanced in cells lacking PTPN22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

        <title>Enhanced Autophagy Induction upon Knock-down of PTPN22</title>
        <p>As NOD2 activation leads to an increase in autophagy <xref rid="pone.0072384-Cooney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, we next addressed whether loss of PTPN22 also interferes with autophagosome formation. Therefore, THP-1 cells expressing non-targeting control or PTPN22-silencing shRNA, were treated for 30 min or 24 h with MDP. At both time points, we could detect increased levels of LC3B-II, the cleaved and activated form of LC3B, upon MDP-treatment, indicative for elevated autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g007">Figures 7A</xref>+B). In cells transduced with PTPN22 shRNA, LC3B-II levels were increased even prior to MDP-treatment and further enhanced by MDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g007">Figures 7A</xref>+B). No difference in the protein levels of autophagy-like (ATG)5 or ATG7 could be detected in control-transduced MDP-treated cells. In PTPN22 deficient cells however, ATG7 levels were enhanced with or without MDP-treatment, but no change in ATG5 levels could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g007">Figures 7C</xref>+D). As p62 transports proteins to the autophagosome and subsequently gets degraded in autolysosomes, its reduction can serve as an additional marker for functional autophagy <xref rid="pone.0072384-Komatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Consistent with enhanced LC3B-II levels in PTPN22 deficient cells, we also detected a decrease in p62 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further address autophagy induction, THP-1 cells were treated for 24 h with MDP or the autophagy activator rapamycine and whole cells fluorescently stained for LC3B. In untreated, PTPN22 competent cells, LC3B staining was diffuse and rather weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). When cells were stimulated with MDP or rapamycine, bright LC3B spots, indicative for autophagosome formation became visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g008">Figures 8B</xref>+C). Correlating to our Western blot data, in PTPN22 knockdown cells however, bright LC3B dots were already detectable in untreated cells and did further increase by MDP or rapamycine-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0072384-g008">Figures 8DâF</xref>). Together with the results from protein analysis, this indicates that loss of PTPN22 enhances autophagy.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that PTPN22 is activated by MDP-treatment, and its loss interferes with signaling events downstream of NOD2 receptor in human THP-1 cells and mouse BMDC. By controlling MAPK and NF-ÎºB activation, loss of PTPN22 influences MDP-induced gene expression, cytokine release and autophagy. We show that loss of PTPN22 results in enhanced MDP-mediated p38, JNK and NF-ÎºB p65 phosphorylation, all involved in monocyte and macrophage differentiation and activation <xref rid="pone.0072384-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0072384-SanchezTillo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In IBD, hyper-activated intestinal macrophages are important drivers of intestinal inflammation <xref rid="pone.0072384-Rugtveit1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our results suggest that loss of PTPN22 renders monocytes and intestinal macrophages more reactive towards bacterial antigens, possibly leading to hyper-activation finally resulting in a chronic inflammatory state of the intestinal mucosa. Ultimately, loss of PTPN22 results in enhanced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF, all highly increased in IBD <xref rid="pone.0072384-Mahida1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072384-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. While IL-8 is involved in recruiting neutrophils to inflamed sites, and thereby enhances innate inflammatory events, IL-6 is involved in the switch from innate to adaptive immune responses <xref rid="pone.0072384-Hurst1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, it activates B-cells, and plays a role in shaping the T-helper (Th) cell response <xref rid="pone.0072384-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Increased levels of IL-6 promote the development of IL-17 secreting T-cell subsets <xref rid="pone.0072384-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, which are found expanded in CD and play an important role in disease pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0072384-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. IFN-Î³, on the other hand, is involved in controlling the development of Th17 cells <xref rid="pone.0072384-Harrington1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and exerts protective effects in a mouse model of acute colitis <xref rid="pone.0072384-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore, our data suggest how loss of PTPN22 might contribute to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa what could finally result in a chronic inflammatory state of the gastrointestinal tract establishing IBD.</p>
      <p>Cao <italic>et al</italic> found decreased levels of ERK phosphorylation and enhanced levels of p38 phosphorylation in patients carrying a gain of function variant of PTPN22, indicating that PTPN22 would regulate ERK signaling and facilitate p38 activation <xref rid="pone.0072384-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, there is evidence that the PTPN22 gain of function variant leads to reduced stability of the PTPN22 protein, resulting in decreased levels of PTPN22 <xref rid="pone.0072384-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This would be in line with our findings here, indicating that reduced levels of PTPN22 result in decreased ERK activation but enhanced p38 phosphorylation.</p>
      <p>p38-MAPK signaling is important for shaping the monocyte/dendritic cell-induced adaptive immune reaction and its presence in antigen presenting cells is crucial for Th17 cell development <xref rid="pone.0072384-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The enhanced activity of p38-MAPK upon loss of PTPN22 might therefore directly influence the capacity of monocytes to promote T-cell development. In line with this, reduced PTPN22 levels result in decreased levels of the Th1 cell transcription factor T-bet, which is important for IFN-Î³ secretion in both, adaptive and innate immune cells <xref rid="pone.0072384-Neurath1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Together with enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, this indicates that loss of PTPN22 could result in an altered ability of monocytes to prime specific T helper cell responses.</p>
      <p>In line with our previous findings in IFN-Î³-treated cells <xref rid="pone.0072384-Spalinger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, where loss of PTPN22 decreased p65 phosphorylation, loss of PTPN22 had different effects on NF-ÎºB activation depending on the used stimulus. NF-ÎºB subunits are serine phosphorylated and can therefore not be a direct target of PTPN22. As we showed previously in IFN-Î³-treated cells, where p65 activity is down-regulated by silencer of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 <xref rid="pone.0072384-Spalinger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, differentially activated additional regulatory pathways could mediate the observed stimulus dependent differences in NF-ÎºB phosphorylation in MDP-treated cells.</p>
      <p>We further observed that loss of PTPN22 results in enhanced autophagosome formation in response to MDP. Autophagy plays a crucial role in the clearance of intracellular bacteria <xref rid="pone.0072384-Travassos1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, hence the enhanced autophagy, detectable in PTPN22 deficient cells, seems to provide anti-inflammatory effects on a first sight. This is surprising, as we could previously detect decreased levels of PTPN22 in intestinal biopsies from IBD patients <xref rid="pone.0072384-Spalinger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, autophagy is also important for the activation and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages <xref rid="pone.0072384-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and plays a role in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II mediated antigen presentation <xref rid="pone.0072384-Cooney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, JNK mediated autophagy is important to prevent activated macrophages from apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0072384-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Therefore, it is well possible that increased autophagy, as detectable upon loss of PTPN22, could lead to a prolonged survival of activated monocytes/macrophages. Together with enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, this might result in an increased activation of the adaptive immune response and ultimately promote inflammatory conditions.</p>
      <p>It has been further demonstrated that p38 and JNK activation play a role in autophagy induction in monocytic cells <xref rid="pone.0072384-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072384-Matsuzawa1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Hence the increased p38/JNK-MAPK activity detected upon loss of PTPN22 could lead to the enhanced autophagy induction detectable in these cells. However, further experiments would be necessary to reveal the precise mechanism of how PTPN22 influences autophagy induction.</p>
      <p>In summary, our data indicate that PTPN22, beyond its important role in regulating receptor signaling in the adaptive arm of the immune system <xref rid="pone.0072384-Rieck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072384-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, also interferes with innate immune receptor pathways and innate immune functions such as autophagy. We could demonstrate that loss of PTPN22 interferes with signaling pathways induced by bacterial components and it is involved in the fine-tuning of signaling cascades downstream of NOD2 ligation. Given the importance of NOD2 activation and autophagy induction in regulating intestinal immune responses, this might explain the association of PTPN22 variants with CD and UC.</p>
