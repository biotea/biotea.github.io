      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), caused by mutations in the gene encoding Î±-L-iduronidase (IDUA), is one of approximately 70 genetic disorders collectively known as the lysosomal storage diseases. To gain insight into the basis for MPS I, we have crystallized human IDUA produced in an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana cgl</italic> mutant. IDUA consists of a TIM barrel domain containing the catalytic site, a Î²-sandwich domain and a fibronectin-like domain. Structures of IDUA bound to induronate analogues illustrate the Michaelis complex and reveal a <sup>2,5</sup>B conformation in the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, that suggest a retaining double displacement reaction employing the nucleophilic Glu299 and the general acid/base Glu182. Surprisingly, the N-glycan attached to Asn372 interacts with iduronate analogues in the active site and is required for enzymatic activity. Finally, these IDUA structures and biochemical analysis of the disease-relevant Pro533Arg mutation have enabled us to correlate the effects of mutations in IDUA to clinical phenotypes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a broad class of devastating genetic diseases that collectively represent over 70 disorders. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is an autosomal recessive LSD characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme Î±-L-iduronidase (IDUA)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. IDUA participates in the stepwise degradation of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate, by removing a single Î±-L-iduronyl residue from the non-reducing ends of these complex polysaccharides. Because of the widespread distribution of GAGs in tissues and organs (in which they typically exist as proteoglycans), severely affected humans with no residual IDUA activity typically die in early childhood because of profound skeletal, cardiac and neurological disturbances<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. MPS I patients are typically described as belonging to one of three clinical phenotypes: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie, for the severe, intermediate, and attenuated forms of the disease, respectively<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. MPS I is a rare disease; it is estimated to affect 1 in every 100,000 live births. Collectively, LSDs comprise a significant proportion of childhood metabolic diseases, with a combined frequency of about 1 in every 5,000 live births. The currently approved treatment for MPS I is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Due to the high price associated with ERT (~$450,000 per patient per year) alternative treatments, such as the development of pharmacological chaperones<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, are being sought for many of the LSDs.</p>
      <p id="P3">Over 100 gene mutations causing the various forms of MPS I have been reported<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Despite the considerable detail available concerning genotypes and the corresponding clinical phenotypes of MPS I, a correlation between the two has been difficult due to the lack of a detailed three-dimensional molecular structure of the enzyme. Not only has the lack of a molecular structure contributed to the difficulty in interpreting the effects of these mutations but also there has been a difficulty in deciphering a detailed enzymatic mechanism for IDUA. The only other member of the family 39 glycoside hydrolases that has had its tertiary structure elucidated is the Î²-D-xylosidase (TsXy)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> from <italic>Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum</italic>. Those structural analyses contributed to the understanding of a bacterial version of the GH39 family, but the marginal sequence identity between TsXy and the mammalian IDUA (~22% identical)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> has made it extremely difficult to predict accurately the correct structure of IDUA<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> or to interpret the mechanism of IDUA.</p>
      <p id="P4">Here we present five comprehensive three-dimensional structures for human IDUA including two apo-enzyme structures and three enzyme-inhibitor complexes. These âsnap-shotâ structures are instrumental in delineating the full course of catalytic events during substrate hydrolysis by IDUA. A novel finding of a high-mannose N-glycan at Asn372 contributing to the enzymatic activity of IDUA is reported. Taking Pro533Arg, a relatively frequent missense mutation in <italic>IDUA</italic> gene among MPS I patients as a case in point, we discuss the implications of these protein structures for understanding MPS I disease pathophysiology, particularly the enzyme mechanism and some of the phenotype-genotype correlations for predicting clinical phenotypes and the clinical outcomes of ERT. Future design of active-site-specific inhibitors (pharmacological chaperones) as alternative disease therapeutics for MPS I will be greatly aided by our findings.</p>

        <title>Crystal Structures of apo-IDUA</title>
        <p id="P5">The molecular structure of recombinant human IDUA produced in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has been determined in two crystal forms, a rhombohedral form, space group R3 and a monoclinic form, space group P2<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Results</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The R3 crystal form has two molecules in the asymmetric unit and has been refined to 2.1Ã resolution; the P2<sub>1</sub> crystal form (one molecule/asymmetric unit) has been refined to 2.2Ã resolution. Leastâsquares comparisons among these three molecules show that all three structural determinations agree very well with one another (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). As with many of the glycoside hydrolases, IDUA has three prominent domains: a TIM barrel extending from Arg48 to Ala394 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref>) that contains the active site residues Glu182 and Glu299, a Î²-sandwich (Glu398 to Ala542) that contains the N-terminus of the enzyme and the first Î²-strand, Î²1 (His30 to Leu43) and a third domain (Thr552 to Glu640) that resembles the fold of a type III fibronectin domain and consists of the C-terminal residues of the enzyme (see the topology diagram in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">In human IDUA, there are six N-linked glycosylation sites. The oligosaccharide structures at each site of recombinant human IDUA secreted from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line have been determined by mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The IDUA expressed in the seeds of a <italic>cgl</italic> mutant of Arabidopsis has much reduced complexity in these N-linked glycans<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, the majority of which are non-matured, high mannose N-glycans (~95%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). The two crystal forms that have been determined in the present study reveal only three N-glycosylated Asn residues, Asn110, Asn372 and Asn415. There was no interpretable electron density that could be associated with carbohydrate residues at the other three sites, Asn190, Asn336 and Asn451. The most well defined N-glycan from all of the structures determined is present on Asn372 in the three structures of the IdoA analogues bound to molecule B of IDUA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">There are two unique structural features of IDUA that are found on insertions in a) the TIM barrel domain (Î²12 and Î²13) and b) the Î²-sandwich domain (Î±15 and Î±16) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The glycosylation site, Asn372, resides on the Î²-hairpin insertion between Î²11 and Î²14 of the TIM barrel. Asn372 has been shown to be a high mannose site in both forms of recombinant human IDUA (that produced in CHO cells<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and that produced in plants<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>). Two helices (Î±15 and Î±16) are inserted between strands Î²19 and Î²20 of the Î²-sandwich domain. These helices and the loop of polypeptide linking them are packed against the glycan-containing Î²-hairpin formed by Î²12 and Î²13. These two structural features are not observed in the TsXy structure<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P8">The third domain of IDUA (extending from Thr552 to the C-terminus of the enzyme) resembles a type III fibronectin fold. The last residue that is visible in our electron density maps is Pro642. The remaining 11 residues are disordered in the present structures (from Val643 to Pro653).</p>
        <p id="P9">A view of the catalytic residues in the TIM barrel of IDUA is shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. Previous sequence alignments and biochemical studies on the family 39 Î²-D-xylosidase (TsXy) and IDUA have provided evidence via LC-mass spectrometric analysis of peptides from labeled enzyme that the nucleophilic carboxylate is Glu299 in IDUA (Glu277 in TsXy) and that the general acid/base in IDUA is Glu182 (Glu160 in TsXy)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the crystal structure of a covalently bound 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-Î±-D-xylosyl-xylosidase intermediate complex confirmed that indeed the nucleophile is Glu277 in TsXy<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The relative disposition and surrounding environments of Glu299 and Glu182 in human IDUA are shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. The carboxylates of Glu299 and Glu182 are separated by 5.2Ã, a distance that is typically observed in retaining glycoside hydrolases<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The environment of Glu299 is consistent with its carboxyl group being ionized; it is the recipient of two hydrogen bonds, one from N<sup>Î¶</sup> of Lys264 and the other from N<sup>Î·1</sup> of Arg89. On the other hand, the carboxyl group of Glu182 is partially buried and does not make hydrogen bonds to other groups on IDUA. It is predicted to have a pKa of 5.6, consistent with a catalytic mechanism that requires it to be protonated at the pH of the lysosome<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>Structures of IDUA-inhibitor complexes</title>
        <p id="P10">Through crystal soaking and co-crystallization, we have obtained complexes of IDUA with each of the three substrate analogue/inhibitors, 5-fluoro-Î±-L-idopyranosyluronic acid fluoride (5F-IdoAF), 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-Î±-L-idopyranosyluronic acid fluoride (2F-IdoAF), and [2<italic>R</italic>, 3<italic>R</italic>, 4<italic>R</italic>, 5<italic>S</italic>]-2-carboxy-3,4,5-trihydroxy-piperidine (IdoADNJ) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Both 5F-IdoAF and 2F-IdoAF were designed as reagents to trap the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, though in both cases turnover of this intermediate was seen to be fast<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Through flash-cooling of the crystals it was anticipated that either a Michaelis complex or the covalent intermediate might be trapped. IdoADNJ was synthesized as a potential transition state analogue inhibitor, but was found to bind with only weak affinity (IC<sub>50</sub> â 3 mM). The refined Ï<sup>A</sup>-weighted, 2||Fo|-|Fc|| electron density maps clearly revealed that both 5F-IdoAF and IdoADNJ are bound in a <sup>2</sup>S<sub>o</sub> skew-boat conformation in the active site of IDUA, likely mimicking an enzyme-substrate Michaelis complex on the normal catalytic pathway (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a)</xref>). The 2F-IdoAF molecule forms a covalent adduct with the carboxylate group of Glu299 and the resulting 2F-IdoA adduct adopts a distorted <sup>2,5</sup>B conformation, thereby illuminating the key glycosyl-enzyme intermediate on the catalytic pathway (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The protein structures in all three complexes align very well with one another as well as with the native enzyme structures; r.m.s.d.s range from 0.14 to 0.36Ã and there are no detectable inter-domain movements, consistent with these molecular structures representing the catalytically competent conformation of the enzyme (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">In total, the non-covalently bound 5F-IdoAF, forms 11 H-bonds and around 70 van der Waals contacts (cut-off, 4Ã) with the enzyme (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref>). 2F-IdoA and IdoADNJ bind to the active site of IDUA with similar numbers of H-bonds and van der Waals interactions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)(c)</xref>). All of the hydroxyl groups of the IdoA analogues participate in H-bond interactions with IDUA. Furthermore, O3, as seen in molecule B in the asymmetric unit, is involved in a polar interaction with a mannose residue from the oligosaccharide chain extending from the N-glycosylation site Asn372 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3(a) and 3(b)</xref>).</p>

        <title>Role of glycosylation at Asn372</title>
        <p id="P12">The observation that the N-glycan on Asn372 participates in substrate binding is surprising and to our knowledge, a novel finding for glycosidases. It was previously reported that the major N-glycan on Asn372 of CHO-produced IDUA is of a high-mannose type (Man<sub>9</sub>NAG<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Similarly, high-mannose structures were found at this position in our plant-produced enzyme<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. We have traced Man<sub>7</sub>NAG<sub>2</sub> in molecule B of the two IDUA molecules in the asymmetric unit of the R3 crystal form. Mannose-D (Man7 in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) which connects to Mannose-B via an Î±-1,2-linkage, makes polar and van der Waals contacts (&lt; 4Ã) with atoms O3, C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 of the IdoA analogues bound in the active site of IDUA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3 (a) and 3(b)</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In addition, this mannose is situated approximately 4.3Ã on top of the C5-carboxylate of the IdoA analogues. The active site of IDUA is relatively more open to the solvent compared to that of TsXy; however, it seems that IDUA effectively utilizes this high mannose chain to extend the âback wallâ of the IdoA binding pocket upward, thereby separating the bound IdoA from solvent at the Î±-face. We have determined that the enzymatic activity of the deglycosylated IDUA (IDUA treated with carbohydrate-binding-module-peptide-N-glycosidase F (CBM-PNGase F)) was 11.2% of that of the untreated (glycosylated) IDUA. The K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> of deglycosylated IDUA were roughly 3 times and 50% of the K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> of the untreated IDUA, respectively, suggesting that N-glycosylation is critical for IDUA activity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Further support of the involvement of Asn372 N-glycan in catalysis came from a report published online while a revised version of this manuscript was being reviewed, that showed a correlation between the level of N-glycosylation at Asn372 and the enzymatic activity of IDUA<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. A vital role for Asn372 glycosylation in substrate binding or catalysis is a tantalizing prospect; mutation of the N-glycan sequon at position 372 followed by a determination of the kinetic consequences (Km) would be required to assess this thoroughly.</p>

        <p id="P13">Based on kinetics data, a previous study<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> postulated that two cationic binding sites exist in IDUA, one of which might interact with the C5-carboxylate group of IdoA. Evidence for the carboxylate-binding site is now found in our structures. The C5-carboxylates of 5F-IdoAF, 2F-IdoA and IdoADNJ are all bound snugly in a positively charged pocket formed by the side chains of Arg363, and Lys264, and the main chain NH groups of Gly305 and Trp306 of IDUA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2(d)</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3(a)(b)</xref>). The N<sup>Î·2</sup> of Arg363 donates an H-bond of 2.7Ã and 2.9Ã to one of the carboxylate oxygens (O6A) of 5F-IdoAF in molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit, respectively. This same carboxylate oxygen of 5F-IdoAF also forms H-bonds with the N<sup>Î¶</sup> of Lys264 and the main chain amide nitrogen of Gly305. The other carboxylate oxygen (O6B) of 5F-IdoAF is involved in an H-bond interaction with the main chain nitrogen of Trp306. Such a concentration of H-bonds to the C5-carboxylate suggests that this site may be the anchor point for initial substrate binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, Arg363 is required for IDUA activity in tissue culture (transformed fibroblasts) and an Arg363Cys mutation in IDUA is associated with a clinical manifestation of the Hurler-Scheie (intermediate) MPS I phenotype<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the structural recognition of both the presence and proper configuration of the C5-carboxylate of IdoA by IDUA is mutual: an IdoA analogue without the L-configured-C5-carboxylate moiety is not an active substrate for IDUA<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, indicating an essential role for the specific interactions between IdoA and the carboxylate-binding pocket in substrate recognition and turnover by IDUA.</p>
        <p id="P14">The O2, O3 and O4 hydroxyl groups of IdoA are also involved in multiple H-bonds with IDUA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Additionally, F1 and by inference, the glycosidic oxygen atoms of substrate molecules accept an H-bond from the O<sup>Îµ2</sup> of Glu182. Overall, an extensive network of polar and non-polar interactions exists between these IdoA analogues and IDUA, involving several of the key residues in the active site. The clinical findings that mutations at some of the above residues are associated with MPS I phenotypes also substantiate the importance of these residues in substrate binding and/or catalysis<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>

        <title>Implications for the catalytic mechanism</title>
        <p id="P15">IDUA is an Î±-retaining glycoside hydrolase with strict substrate specificity for L-IdoA<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. As shown for many other configuration-retaining glycosidases, the hydrolysis of polysaccharide substrates by IDUA likely proceeds through a double displacement mechanism<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Our crystal structures have confirmed that the general acid/base in this reaction is Glu182<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the covalent complex of IDUA-2F-IdoA is consistent with the general catalytic mechanism of retaining glycosidases<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P16">The two key âsnapshotsâ of Ido A analogues bound to IDUA have allowed us to envisage the full course of events along the catalytic pathway (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3(a)</xref> shows a view of an analogue (5F-IdoAF) of the Michaelis complex with the anomeric carbon (C1) of IdoA poised to receive the nucleophilic attack by the carboxylate of Glu299; this ideal spatial placement results from the <sup>2</sup>S<sub>o</sub> conformation of the IdoA pyranose ring. The general acid carboxyl group of Glu182 is also ideally positioned to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of a substrate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(d)</xref>). In the IDUA-5F-IdoAF complex, the carboxyl group of Glu182 makes an H-bond (3.0Ã) to the F1 substituent of the pyranose ring (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a)</xref>). The inferred spatial orientation of the general acid and the glycosidic oxygen of a polysaccharide substrate is fully consistent with the lateral protonation mechanism reported for the Clan GHA glycosidases<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P17">By superposing the IDUA-5F-IdoAF complex and the IDUA-2F-IdoA adduct, it is possible to appreciate the conformational changes that the pyranose ring undergoes as a result of the electrophilic migration during catalysis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The major change is in the position of C1 as it moves ~1.2Ã to form the covalent bond to the nucleophilic carboxylate of Glu299 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(c)</xref>). As a consequence of this movement through the transition state, the pyranose ring converts from the <sup>2</sup>S<sub>o</sub> skew-boat conformation in the Michaelis complex to a <italic><sup>2,5</sup></italic>B boat conformation in the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The equivalent <italic><sup>2,5</sup></italic>B conformation has been seen previously in the glycosyl-enzyme intermediates of the GH11 family Xylanases with substrates having no C-5 substituents<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P18">In addition to the conformational changes taking place in the substrate as one traverses the catalytic pathway, there are conformational adjustments in the side chain of Glu299; notably, the Ï<sup>1</sup> angle of Glu299 changes from gauche (â) (â77Â°) to gauche (+) (54Â°) conformation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(c)</xref>). This results in only a minor difference in the position adopted by the nucleophilic oxygen atom (O<sup>Îµ1</sup>) and it remains in an ideal orientation to carry out the nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon atom (C1) of the substrate in the Michaelis complex. The N<sup>Î¶</sup> of Lys264 is located about 3.0Ã from the ring oxygen in the 2F-IdoA-IDUA complex, a distance suggestive of an H-bond. In the glycosylated intermediate, this potential H-bond would involve one of the lone pair electrons of the ring oxygen in an ideal geometry that can only be satisfied by a <sup>2,5</sup>B conformation of the IdoA molecule. A similar orientation and distance (~3.0Ã) between the endocyclic oxygen of the xylose substrate and the O<sup>Î·</sup> of Tyr85 of <italic>Bacillus agaradhaerens</italic> family 11 xylanase was reported previously <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P19">A water molecule was observed ~3.2Ã from the carboxylate of Glu182 and about 4.7Ã from the C1 of the covalently attached 2FIdoA molecule (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref>). This is consistent with the role of Glu182 in the second half of the hydrolytic reaction, in which a nucleophilic water molecule, assisted by the general base, Glu182, carries out an in-line attack at the C1 atom to release the second product, iduronic acid from the enzyme.</p>

        <title>Correlation of Clinical Phenotypes with IDUA Mutants</title>
        <p id="P20">More than one hundred mutations in the gene encoding IDUA and that cause disease of variable severity in MPS I patients have been reported<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Many of these mutations are missense mutations whose structural implications are difficult to predict without a crystal structure of IDUA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Our present structures of human IDUA offer, for the first time, insights into the association between the clinical phenotypes and defects in the IDUA structure caused by the corresponding missense mutations. In <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref> we have listed our analysis of the structural consequences of each mutation. As an initial effort to validate these predictions, we have analyzed the effects of the Pro533Arg mutation on the IDUA structure and enzymatic activity. This is a relatively frequent missense mutation in the IDUA gene that is associated with intermediate to severe MPS I phenotypes and has shown relatively high prevalence in Brazilian, Tunisian and Moroccan MPS I patients<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Being ~25Ã from the catalytic Glu299, Pro533 is located on a loop that connects strands Î²23 and Î²24 of the Î²-sandwich domain; this loop interacts with helix Î±13 of the TIM barrel and with a helical loop leading to Î±15. Through a core of hydrophobic interactions with Î²23, Î²24 and Î±16, helix Î±15 is intimately involved in positioning the N-glycan chain on Asn372 that lies above the active site of IDUA and makes contact with the substrate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(a)(b)</xref>). Pro533 is surrounded by the side chains of Ala448, Leu535, and Val316 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(c)</xref>); replacement of the proline by the much bulkier and positively charged arginine at position 533 is likely to cause serious structural perturbations due to both space limitation and to the charge on the arginine residue. By affecting the conformation of the TIM barrel as well as the position of Î±15 hence the conformation of the Asn372-linked N-glycan, the Pro533Arg mutation may impair catalysis, and possibly also the ability of IDUA to bind its natural substrates. Such a structural perturbation could also affect protein folding, interfering with the ability of the IDUA enzyme to pass ER quality control, and thus undergo maturation and trafficking to the lysosome, as intimated by a previous report<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In further examining the effects of this mutation on IDUA activity by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays performed on the purified recombinant enzymes, the K<sub>m</sub> of the Pro533Arg IDUA mutant for the artificial (4MUI) substrate was relatively unaffected, whereas the V<sub>max</sub> decreased by two-fold when compared to that of the wild type enzyme (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(d)</xref>). Furthermore, heat inactivation experiments indicated that the Pro533Arg mutant has a lower thermodynamic stability as compared to the wild-type enzyme (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(e)</xref>). This largely supports the data in two previous reports <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and the conclusions therein regarding the Pro533Arg IDUA mutant as not only having lowered specific activity, but also showing significant impairment in processing/trafficking.</p>

      <p id="P21">MPS I, like many other LSDs, is associated with varying degrees of clinical severity and significant symptom heterogeneity in patients who may carry one or two types of debilitating mutations in the IDUA alleles. The only current FDA-approved therapy for MPS I is ERT; this type of therapy has drawbacks in both efficacy and cost. Our crystal structures of IDUA provide the first glimpse into the molecular organization of the enzymeâs active site in both the apo- and the ligand-bound conformations. Such structural information has substantially enhanced our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of IDUA and related enzymes involved in a family of important human disorders. While our structural models cannot directly predict how mutations will affect the rates of IDUA protein folding, or the <italic>in situ</italic> half-life of IDUA in different human tissues, they nonetheless provide an extremely valuable basis for casting viable predictions that can later be tested. It will be imperative to follow up this work with a detailed characterization of how the various missense mutations directly affect the catalytic ability of the IDUA enzyme, and/or impede the maturation pathway leading to the functional IDUA enzyme within the lysosome. Our findings provide a solid basis for clinical prognosis of outcomes of ERT and for future structure-based drug design and synthesis aimed at developing alternative MPS I therapeutics via the âpharmacological chaperoneâ approach.</p>

The IDUA protein was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Two distinct morphologies of crystals were observed after 5â7 days growth at room temperature. The best-isolated needle-shaped crystals were grown from condition 84 of the Index Screen (0.2M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1M HEPES pH 7.5, 25% PEG 3350, Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) together with semi-crystalline spherulites also reported previously<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The rhomboid plate-shaped crystals were grown from condition 86 of the Index Screen (0.2M sodium potassium tartrate, 20% PEG 3350, Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA).

Michaelis-Menten kinetics for plant-derived IDUA were determined at 37 Â°C and pH 4.5 using a fluorometric assay as described previously<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 100 Î¼L, with ~35 ng of purified plant-derived IDUA in a buffer containing 0.1 M dimethylglutarate (pH 4.5), 2 mM sodium metabisulfite and 0.35% bovine serum albumin and substrate (4-Methylumbelliferyl Î±-L-idopyranosid)uronic acid (Cat. No. M334701, Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (at concentrations of 1â750 Î¼M). All measurements were made in triplicate. Rates of reaction were determined by dividing by the reaction time and concentration of the enzyme, and fit to a Michaelis-Menten curve using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).</p>

        <p id="P36">Equal amounts of the purified Pro533Arg and wild-type enzymes were incubated at 50 Â°C in the storage buffer (20 mM dimethylglutaric acid, pH 6.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) ethonaol) and their catalytic activities on the synthetic substrate 4-MUI were monitored over time. Enzyme activity assay condition is the same as described above using 4-MUI (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) at 750 Î¼M. For each enzyme, three replicates were taken at each time point and chilled on ice followed by determination of enzyme activities. Residual activity was taken as the percentage of enzyme activity at time zero. Data were plotted as mean Â± s.d.. To evaluate the decrease of residual enzymatic activity of the Pro533Arg mutant IDUA relative to that of the wild-type IDUA enzyme, simultaneous multiple comparison of the measurements at all time points except for time zero was performed using the Bonferonni correction (R package version 3.0.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). The significance level Î± for the overall comparison was set to be 0.05 and the null hypothesis of no difference between the Pro533Arg and wild-type IDUA was strongly rejected.</p>

        <title>Overview of the IDUA molecule and close-up view of the catalytic domain</title>
        <p><bold>(a)</bold> Two views (related by a 90Â° rotation) of the complete apo-IDUA molecule from the P2<sub>1</sub> crystal form. The TIM barrel is colored slate blue with the central eight strands of the Î²âbarrel represented in yellow. Three of the six possible N-glycosylation sites have electron density for the attached sugar residues; Asn110 has a single NAG; Asn372 has five saccharide residues (Man<sub>3</sub>NAG<sub>2</sub>) and Asn415 has a single NAG (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The Î²-sandwich domain is represented in green. The C-terminal type III fibronectin-like domain is represented in a red color. <bold>(b)</bold> A close-up view of the active site of IDUA. The carbon atoms of the nucleophile, Glu299 and the general acid/base, Glu182 are colored in magenta. Other residues that are proposed to be of importance in substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism are colored in yellow for the carbon atoms, red for oxygen atoms and blue for nitrogen atoms. The residues involved in substrate binding are: Arg363, Asp349, His91 and Asn181. Arg89 and Lys264 provide a positively-charged environment that ensures a depressed pK<sub>a</sub> for the carboxyl group of Glu 299.</p>

        <title>Structural and biochemical analyses of the Pro533Arg mutation in IDUA</title>
        <p><bold>(a)</bold> A full-molecule view of the Pro533Arg mutation relative to the active site, the Asn372-linked N-glycan, and the unique insertions in the IDUA protein (magenta, Î²23 and Î²24; cyan, Î±15 and Î±16 ). The domains of IDUA are colored as in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The Asn372-linked N-glycan and the bound 5F-IdoAF are represented as sticks with grey and green carbon atoms, respectively. Pro533 is shown as space-filling spheres with salmon-colored carbon atoms. <bold>(b)</bold> Hydrophobic packing among Î±15, Î±16, Î²23 and Î²24 contributes to stabilizing the conformation of the Asn372 N-glycan. <bold>(c)</bold> The side chain of Pro533 is involved in multiple van der Waals interactions with several nearby residues. <bold>(d)</bold> The Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the wild-type and Pro533Arg mutant enzymes. The assays were carried out in triplicates and results are presented as mean Â± s.d.. The K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values obtained by fitting the raw data to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation are 36.2Â±2.9 Î¼M and 8.8Â±0.18 umol/min/mg for wild-type IDUA, and 35.3Â±3.66 Î¼M and 4.5Â±0.15 umol/min/mg for the Pro533Arg mutant. <bold>(e)</bold> Time course of the effect of heat inactivation at 50 Â°C on the catalytic activities of the wild-type and the Pro533Arg mutant enzymes measured at 37 Â°C. For each enzyme, three samples were assayed at each time point and results are shown as mean Â± s.d.. The level of decrease in enzyme activity is significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) for the Pro533Arg mutant in comparison with that for the wild-type enzyme.</p>
