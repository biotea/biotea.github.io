        <p>Calcium and integrin binding protein 1 (CIB1) is a specific
binding
partner for the cytoplasmic domain of the Î±IIb subunit of the
highly abundant platelet integrin Î±IIbÎ²3. This protein
has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of the activation
of Î±IIbÎ²3, a process leading to platelet aggregation and
blood coagulation. In this work, the solution structure of the deuterated
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 protein complexed with an Î±IIb peptide
was first determined through modern RDC-based NMR methods. Next, we
generated a complex structure for CIB1 and the Î±IIb domain (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb) using the program Haddock, which is based
on experimental restraints obtained for the proteinâpeptide
interface from cross-saturation NMR experiments. In this data-driven
complex structure, the N-terminal Î±-helix of the cytoplasmic
domain of Î±IIb is buried in the hydrophobic pocket of the C-lobe
of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1. The C-terminal acidic tail of Î±IIb
remains unstructured and likely interacts with several positively
charged residues in the N-lobe of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1. A potential
molecular mechanism for the CIB1-mediated activation of the platelet
integrin could be proposed on the basis of the model structure of
this protein complex. Another feature of this work is that, in the
NMR cross-saturation experiments, we applied the selective radio frequency
irradiation to the smaller binding partner (the Î±IIb peptide),
and successfully detected the binding interface on the larger binding
partner Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 through its selectively protonated methyl
groups. This âreverseâ methodology has a broad potential
to be employed to many other complexes where synthetic peptides and
a suitably isotope-labeled medium- to large-sized protein are used
to study proteinâprotein interactions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Integrins are cell surface receptors that
mediate cell adhesion
processes, including cellâcell, cellâextracellular matrix,
and cellâpathogen interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> In general,
integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins that are formed by a single
Î± and a single Î² subunit. Both the Î± and Î²
subunits are single-pass transmembrane proteins, and such proteins
are often involved in signal transduction processes. Integrins are
known to be involved in bidirectional signal transduction across the
plasma membrane, commonly referred to as âinside-outâ
and âoutside-inâ signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Both the Î± and
Î² subunits are made up of a large extracellular ectomembrane
domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a small cytoplasmic domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that the dissociation of the cytoplasmic domains
of the Î± and Î² subunits is critical for bidirectional
transmembrane signaling events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Î±IIbÎ²3 integrin heterodimer is exclusively expressed
at very high levels in platelets. Because of its role in the formation
of blood clots and maintaining hemostasis, the structure of this complex
is of particular interest. These two subunits associate in the membrane
and in the cytoplasm with a low affinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The interaction between these two parts of the dimeric integrin
protein has been hard to detect in aqueous solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> or studies resulted in different structures, especially
for the cytoplasmic domains of Î±IIbÎ²3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> probably reflecting
the dynamic nature of the cytoplasmic domain of Î±IIbÎ²3.
In the inside-out signaling pathway, the cytoskeletal protein talin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> has been reported to be able to bind specifically
to the cytoplasmic domain of Î²3 and in turn activate integrin
Î±IIbÎ²3.</p>
      <p>The calcium- and integrin-binding protein
1 (CIB1) was originally
discovered as a binding partner for the cytoplasmic domain of Î±IIb
in a yeast two-hybrid screening study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> CIB1 is now known as a ubiquitous regulatory protein that is made
up of four EF-hands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> with a molecular
weight of 22 kDa. CIB1 can carry a myristoyl group at its N-terminus,
but the function of this myristoyl group in vivo is not yet fully
understood since it has been found that CIB1 can interact with Î±IIb
in vitro without the myristoyl group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> The myristoyl group
of CIB1 appears to act like a membrane anchor, similar to what has
been found for many related calcium-binding proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> CIB1 has four helixâloopâhelix EF-hand motifs,
but only EF-III and EF-IV have the capacity to bind divalent metal
ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In the resting state of most cells,
magnesium is present in the cytoplasm at â¼1â2 mM allowing
the folded form of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 to be present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> When the cell is excited, Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters the cytoplasm
and its concentration rises to micromolar levels; Ca<sup>2+</sup> displaces
Mg<sup>2+</sup> and forms Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in a well-folded conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and
Mg<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 can interact with a synthetic peptide representing
the Î±IIb cytoplasmic domain and part of its transmembrane domain,
with similar micromolar affinities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Solution
NMR studies of CIB1 require deuteration and methyl group labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> because of its relatively large molecular weight (24 kDa including
the purification-tag). It has been shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1
and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 have a similar overall topology with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 having a relatively more exposed hydrophobic pocket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> NMR chemical shift perturbation studies concerning
the interaction of Î±IIb with both Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound CIB1 suggest that both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-forms interact with Î±IIb via a hydrophobic pocket
in the C-terminal domain of CIB1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> It
has been reported previously that CIB1 is capable of disrupting the
association of Î±IIb and Î²3 by binding to Î±IIb and
in turn activate the integrin Î±IIbÎ²3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, blocking complex formation between the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein (WASP) and CIB1 has been shown to affect the conformational
change of Î±IIbÎ²3 and further affects its interaction with
fibrinogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In contrast, CIB1 has also
been suggested to negatively regulate the activation of integrin Î±IIbÎ²3
by competing with talin for binding to Î±IIbÎ²3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Therefore, structural characterization of the
CIB1/Î±IIb complex is of considerable interest to provide further
insight into the mechanism of the regulation of the activation of
Î±IIbÎ²3 by CIB1 or to determine the role of CIB1 in collaborating
with talin in the regulation of Î±IIbÎ²3 activation as suggested
by Yuan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Even though the CIB1/Î±IIb
interaction has been suggested to be similar to that of the homologous
protein calcineurin B (CnB) with calcineurin A (CnA) in terms of the
relative orientation of the proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> no direct experimental results have been reported to date to support
this notion. By determining a structure for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb
complex, we hope to obtain insight into the inside-out signaling of
integrin as well as to establish the connections between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling pathway and the integrin-signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>In this work, we report a structure for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb
complex. An experimental approach of employing reverse cross-saturation
NMR experiments using the labeled methyl groups of Ile/Leu/Val (I/L/V)
in an otherwise deuterated CIB1 protein has been implemented to accurately
identify the interface for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb complex.
Moreover, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) as determined in multiple
alignment media were used to provide additional information about
the structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in complex with Î±IIb.</p>

experiments to determine the interface for the interaction between
CIB1 and the human platelet Î±IIb subunit. The 26-residue Î±IIb
synthetic peptide (Ac-L<sub>983</sub>VLAMWKVGFFKRNRPPLEEDDEEGQ<sub>1008</sub>-OH) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> was used; this peptide corresponds to amino acids 983â1008
of the Î±IIb cytoplasmic domain and part of the transmembrane
domain (hereafter referred to as Î±IIb-L, Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Another truncated 15-residue synthetic peptide (Ac-L<sub>983</sub>VLAMWKVGFFKRNR<sub>997</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>) (Î±IIb-S,

to amino acids 983â997 of the Î±IIb subunit. These synthetic
peptides were both purchased from GenScript Corp. and they were more
than 95% pure as determined by mass spectrometry and HPLC. Protein
and peptide concentrations were determined by using the extinction
coefficients: Îµ<sub>280</sub>= 3040 for CIB1, Îµ<sub>280</sub>= 5500 for Î±IIb-L, and Îµ<sub>280</sub>= 5500 for Î±IIb-S.</p>

irradiation using an RF (radio frequency) field was applied as suggested,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> which covers from 3.5 to 8.5 ppm with the irradiation

        <p>Using the refined solution structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in
the complex and the structure of Î±IIb-L, a docking model for
the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L complex was generated using
the Haddock web-server.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> It is known that the
C-terminal extension of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 experiences on/off slow
motions from the hydrophobic pocket in the C-lobe of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in solution, thereby blocking nonspecific interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Hence, in our calculations, the structure of the complexed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 protein was truncated in order to avoid blocking the
access of Î±IIb-L to the hydrophobic pocket of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1; the truncated version of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 contains residues
8â178 with the C-terminal tail of the protein (residues 179â191)
removed. In the setup, positive methyl cross-saturation results were
implemented as interfacial restraints for docking. The significantly
affected methyl groups of residues I73, I114, L131, L135, I153, I168,
V176, and I177 were set as the active residues, while the slightly
affected methyl-containing residues I27, L28, L61, V76, V97, V132,
L152, and I156 were set as passive residues in the Haddock calculations.
Residues L983, W988, F992, and F993 in Î±IIb-L have been reported
to be critical for the interaction between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and
Î±IIb-L by a combined approach of site-directed mutagenesis and
in vitro fluorescence studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Hence,
these four residues were set as the active residues for Î±IIb-L.
Also in the setup, since Î±IIb-L residues L983âR995 have
been determined to be helical and the remainder (N996âQ1008)
to be an extended structure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> fragment 995â1008
of Î±IIb-L was set as fully flexible for the docking model generation.
Because Haddock can automatically detect semiflexible fragments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> CIB1 was not set as fully flexible. RDC restrains
that were used for the structure calculation for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in complex with Î±IIb-L were also implemented in the docking
model generation. In addition, dihedral angle restraints for CIB1
(8â178) and Î±IIb-L (983â995) were created based
on the lowest RDC energy structure determined for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in protein complex with Î±IIb-L as well as the available

        <p>The solution structure (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 protein in complex with Î±IIb-L
was refined based on three sets of backbone RDCs obtained in two alignment
media (NH and Câ²N RDCs in pf1, and NH RDCs in PEG) using the
solution structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2L4H">2L4H</ext-link>) as the starting
model and a two-stage low-temperature simulated annealing protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> The use of multiple sets of alignment media
has been previously suggested because it can avoid the intrinsic degeneracy
problem of using RDCs as well as avoid any preference for a minor
conformation that could result from the use of a single alignment
medium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Some residues on the flexible loop of CIB1
(residues 137â145) and the C-terminal end (180â191)
have reduced RDC values due to local mobility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> and these residues were excluded from the structure calculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> A good structural precision has been obtained
for the structure calculation; the backbone rmsd of the 10 lowest
energy structures is 0.46 Ã (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).
The statistics of the structure determination of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 protein when complexed with Î±IIb-L have been summarized
in <xref rid="notes-2">Supporting Information Table S1</xref>. The
solution structure of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 protein in the complex
also shows a similar overall topology compared with the solution structure
of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 alone, with a backbone rmsd of 3.7 Ã
(Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Compared with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 structure, the N-terminal Î±-helix (Helix 0, H0) in the
new structure has shifted to some extent. The N-terminal Î±-helix
is assumed to carry a myristoyl group in vivo which should associate
with the cell membrane. Therefore, binding of Î±IIb-L could affect
the orientation of CIB1 relative to the cell membrane. Moreover, the
interhelical angles measured using an in-house script suggest that
the opening of the helix pairs in each EF hand changes upon binding
aIIb. (<xref rid="notes-2">Table S2</xref>). The two EF-hands in the
C-lobe have a bigger interhelical opening than free Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 by approximately 20Â° (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).
The resultant enlarged hydrophobic pocket in the C-lobe could readily
adopt aIIb. The Q factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> (<xref rid="notes-2">Table S3</xref> and <xref rid="notes-2">Figure S1</xref>) before and after structural refinement denote a significant improvement

        <title>Reverse Cross-Saturation Detects the Interface of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L Complex</title>
        <p>Cross-saturation NMR
experiments employing backbone amide proton NH resonances were originally
developed to detect the interface for proteinâprotein interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> Compared with the commonly used NMR Chemical
Shift Perturbation (CSP) approach, which is widely used for determining
the interface of protein/peptide complexes, the cross-saturation method
avoids possible artifacts arising from induced conformational changes,
where residues that experienced a large chemical shift change can
in fact be far away from the actual interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> A more recent version of the cross-saturation experiment
uses isotope labeled methyl groups rather than backbone amides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> It has several advantages over the traditional
cross-saturation backbone <sup>15</sup>NâH method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> such as high sensitivity, higher efficiency
of magnetization transfer, and suitability for studying hydrophobic
interactions that are often involved in protein/protein complex formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Traditionally, the cross-saturation approach
has been used to detect the binding interface of the smaller partner
by irradiating the larger partner because the magnetization will be
more efficiently transferred by spin diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> in a larger protein. In our work, we applied the selective
irradiation in a reverse manner (referred to as reverse cross-saturation),
in a way that is somewhat similar to previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> We saturated the smaller binding partner (Î±IIb-L, 3 kDa) to
detect the interface on the larger binding partner (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1, 24 kDa including the purification His-tag) (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In our methyl-probe cross-saturation experiments,
selective irradiation was employed to cover the spectral region from
3.5 to 8.5 ppm (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S2</xref>). To avoid artifacts,
99.9% D<sub>2</sub>O was used as the solvent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> In the spectral area from 3.5 to 8.5 ppm (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure
S2</xref>), methyl labeled but otherwise perdeuterated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 has no signals except for some peaks due to the <italic>d</italic><sub>18</sub>-HEPES buffer (98% pure) used to dissolve the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L complex, while Î±IIb-L contains aromatic
protons, aliphatic proteins (HÎ±, HÎ², HÎ³, etc.) and
no amide protons (NH) because of the presence of the D<sub>2</sub>O solvent (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, the
irradiation selectively targets Î±IIb-L but not the deuterated
CIB1. This saturation should then be transferred to the protonated
methyl groups involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L interface
by spin-diffusion (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The interface
of CIB1 in its complex with Î±IIb-L can therefore be accurately
mapped using cross-saturation experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> The results for these experiments are shown in Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. In this case, control experiments were carried out on an
NMR sample containing only Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1, and the results show
that all the methyl groups were evenly affected to a minimum level
(half of all methyls are below 0.1 and the other half are between
0.1 and 0.2 in terms of signal loss) (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Since the irradiation pulse was suggested to be adiabatic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> the signal loss in the control experiments is
probably due to the presence of residual protons of the <italic>d</italic><sub>18</sub>-HEPES buffer (50 mM, 98% pure) (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S2</xref>; for further discussion see Shimada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup>).</p>

        <p>To identify the interface between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and Î±IIb-L,
an identical setup as the one used for the control experiments was
used for a sample of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 complexed with 1/1.2 ratio
of Î±IIb-L. The results obtained are illustrated for the superimposed
HSQC spectra of the Ile region (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A1).
With irradiation, the I73, I114, and I177 residues show significant
signal loss compared to the reference spectrum (Tsat = 0 s) (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A2 and B), whereas other methyl protonated isoleucines
(e.g., I58, I106, I162, and I189) are relatively less affected by
the cross-saturation. The significantly affected methyl-containing
Ile, Leu, and Val residues with a signal loss ratio above 0.3 include
I73, I114, L131, L135, I153, I168, V176, and I177 (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), and these were classified as the active residues
in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L interface that make direct
contact with the binding partner Î±IIb-L. Other slightly affected
methyl-containing residues with signal loss ratio between 0.2 and
0.3, which include I27, L28, L61, V76, V97, V132, L152, and I156 (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), have been classified as passive residues that
are close to the interface, but lack direct contact with Î±IIb-L.
The remaining peaks are the nonaffected or marginally affected methyl
groups with a signal loss ratio less than 0.2 (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), and these are considered not involved in the hydrophobic
interactions between the protein and the peptide.</p>
        <p>The cross-saturation
effects were mapped on the newly determined
structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 in complex with Î±IIb-L (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Compared with methyl CSP (chemical shift perturbation)
effects (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A), cross-saturation experiments
provide a similar interface for the interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and Î±IIb-L, suggesting that the C-domain of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 is the primary binding site for the cytoplasmic domain of Î±IIb.
Small differences between CSP and cross-saturation were also observed;
the distribution of active interfacial residues from the cross-saturation
experiments (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B) seems to suggest one
possible orientation for the Î±IIb-L peptide, whereas two possible
orientations were suggested by CSP (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Clearly, a majority of the significantly affected methyl groups
are found in the C-lobe of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1, except for residue

with Î±IIb-L in the complex. Thus, the cross-saturation results
are consistent with the backbone relaxation and relaxation dispersion
results regarding the flexibility of the C-terminal extension; the
extension remains flexible when the protein binds to Î±IIb-L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p>

experiments (results not shown) suggest that the interaction between

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 with a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of 1.4 Î¼M at 37 Â°C. This exchange behavior
seems to have hindered the determination of the solution structure
of Î±IIb-L in complex with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1. Isotope-labeled
Î±IIb-L was then prepared through bacterial expression as a fusion
protein but the solubility in aqueous solution became a problem, even
though the N-terminal acetylated synthetic Î±IIb-L peptide was
quite soluble. Fortunately, a structure for the Î±IIb subunit

that the hydrophobic pocket in the C-domain of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1

        <p>The solution
structure of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L complex has been
determined by data-driven docking. The 20 lowest energy structures
of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L complex are displayed in
Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> in both ribbon and surface charge
forms. In Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, the N-terminal helical
part of Î±IIb-L interacts with the C-domain of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1, while the negatively charged C-terminal tail of Î±IIb-L
remains unstructured (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A), possibly
interacting with some positively charged residues, for example, R33
and K65 as was suggested by backbone CSP measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> In our docking experiment setup, we solely relied on the
methyl cross-saturation results for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and on previously
reported critical residues in Î±IIb-L;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> thus, these restraints do not reflect any potential electrostatic
interactions. Therefore, the relative orientation of these two partners
was mostly driven by the enthalpy of the hydrophobic interactions
between the Î±IIb-L helix and the C-domain of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1. A related situation is found for the structure of the homologous
protein calcineurin B (CnB) complexed with calcineurin A (CnA) (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1TCO">1TCO</ext-link>) (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C), in which the C-terminal domain of CnB interacts
with the N-terminal of the CnB binding domain of CnA, with the CnB
binding domain of CnA adopting an Î±-helical conformation. Regarding
the structure of the acidic tail (P<sub>998</sub>PLEEDDEEGQ<sub>1008</sub>) of Î±IIb, we attempted to dock this portion better by adding
R33 and K65 (residues identified by backbone CSP) of CIB1 as heavily
affected residues but the tail still remained dynamic probably because
no restraints were available for this portion of the Î±IIb tail.</p>

        <title>The Model Is Supported by NMR Studies of the Interactions of
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 with Î±IIb-L and Î±IIb-S</title>
        <p>A
shorter version of the Î±IIb peptide (Î±IIb-S, Ac-L<sub>983</sub>VLAMWKVGFFKRNR<sub>997</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>) was synthesized
to examine the role of the acidic tail of Î±IIb in its interaction
with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1. Specifically, the difference between the
Î±IIb-L and Î±IIb-S peptides resides in the C-terminal fragment
P<sub>998</sub>PLEEDDEEGQ<sub>1008</sub>, which bears multiple negative
charges, making this region of Î±IIb extremely acidic. In <xref rid="notes-2">Figure S4A</xref>, the superimposed HSQC spectra of
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-S
show small differences with a few methyl groups experiencing minor
chemical shift changes. This suggests that the C-terminal fragment
P<sub>998</sub>PLEEDDEEGQ<sub>1008</sub> was not involved in specific
interactions with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1, which could affect the interactions
between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and Î±IIb-L. The residues (L8, V45,
V76, L92, L94, V97, I 106, and L170) with minor chemical shift changes
are mainly located in the N-lobe of CIB1. On the other hand, these
shifted methyl groups do not center at a specific location in the
structure, implying a dynamic interaction between the N-lobe of CIB1
and the acidic tail (P<sub>998</sub>PLEEDDEEGQ<sub>1008</sub>). Perhaps
this region of Î±IIb can associate with other protein binding
partners. A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> shows that this
part of the Î±IIb cytoplasmic domain can in fact play a role
in platelet activation, but it only does so when it is anchored to
the inner surface of the membrane.</p>

        <title>The Potential Roles of Mg<sup>2+</sup>and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in

        <p>Since Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are present in the cytoplasm with an almost invariant
concentration of around 1â2 mM and the structure of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 is overall similar to that of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> we were interested in the structural differences between the complexes

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we have obtained a solution
structure for the isotope-labeled
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 protein, complexed with the synthetic Î±IIb-L
peptide that encompasses the cytoplasmic domain and part of the transmembrane
domain of the Î±IIb subunit of platelet integrin. The structure
for the complexed protein could be determined based on RDC restraints.
With the use of the available structure of Î±IIb (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2KNC">2KNC</ext-link>), a structural model
for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L complex was obtained using
data-driven docking based on reverse cross-saturation NMR experiments.
The two binding partners in this complex structure adopt a relative
orientation with the Î±-helical N-terminal portion of Î±IIb-L
buried into the C-lobe hydrophobic pocket of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1
and the negatively charged and extended C-terminal tail of Î±IIb-L
pointing toward the N-lobe of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 but being relatively
dynamic. The superposition of the ordered structural fragment (residues
983â995) and the corresponding fragment of 2KNC provides the
orientation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L complex relative
to the cell membrane (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). As expected,
the N-terminal extension of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1(helix 0, H0) points
toward the cell membrane, which is consistent with its role in linking
to a membrane-bound myristoyl group (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). However, when modeled together with a membrane, a steric clash
was observed between the transmembrane helix of Î±IIb and the
eighth helix of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 (H8) (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). Moreover, CIB1 would become associated directly with the
membrane to a large extent if the Î±IIb subunit interacts with
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 with both of its transmembrane and cytoplasmic
domains. Since CIB1 is mainly found as a myristoylated protein in
the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> and the binding interface on
Î±IIb primarily includes the fragment of 983â995,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> it seems unlikely that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 will
penetrate into the cell membrane or be engaged with a significantly
large part of the Î±IIb transmembrane domain. Therefore, a conformational
change is likely to happen in Î±IIb upon binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1. We propose that the transmembrane helix of Î±IIb will
bend around W988 (the membrane-border residue for Î±IIb-L) when
binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B,C).
In this manner, the steric clash and the potential energy barrier
caused by an intrusion of CIB1 into the membrane would be avoided.</p>

both the transmembrane

shed some light on the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the

structures (see detailed analysis in Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and Metcalf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup>). However,
the structure of the cytoplasmic domains of Î±IIbÎ²3 was
reported to be diverse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The importance of the previously

Î±IIbÎ²3. The G<sub>991</sub>FFKR<sub>995</sub> motif on

Î²3 as revealed in the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex structure determined
using Cys-scanning-mutagenesis/disulfide-cross-linking/rosetta-modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> and another Î±IIbÎ²3 complex NMR structure

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 seems to dissociate the Î±IIbÎ²3 heterodimer,
which would potentially activate the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> because the F992 and F993 side chains become
buried in the hydrophobic pocket in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1/Î±IIb-L
complex structure (<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S5</xref>). It has also
been reported that an F992A mutation in Î±IIb may partially impair
the interaction with Î²3 although both F992 and F993 in Î±IIb
point away from the Î²3 subunit in <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2KNC">2KNC</ext-link>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Moreover,
a potential conformational change of Î±IIb upon binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) will also disturb
the stability of the structure of the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex and
cause the dissociation of these two subunits. On the basis of the
classic studies indicating that the activation of integrin can be
caused by the dissociation of the heterodimer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 is highly likely able to disrupt the association

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Taken all data together, a mechanism for
activation of Î±IIbÎ²3
upon interacting with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 can be proposed, that is
similar to the action of the cytoskeletal protein talin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> where Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 dissociates the Î±IIbÎ²3
heterodimer and consequently activates integrin Î±IIbÎ²3
(Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Alternatively CIB1 can maintain
the activated state of Î±IIbÎ²3 by covering the binding
site in Î±IIb and preventing its association with Î²3. Since
nearly identical HSQC NMR patterns were observed for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 upon interaction with Î±IIb-L
(<xref rid="notes-2">Figure S4B</xref>), our data suggest that the
same complex can form under various physiological conditions and is
not calcium-dependent per se. This notion is supported by previous
in vivo studies, in which Î±IIb was shown to interact with CIB1
in both resting and stimulated platelets with no requirement for a
rise in the intracellular calcium concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In addition, it is possible that protein phosphatase 1
could compete with CIB1 for Î±IIb, as these two proteins share
the same binding motif (K<sub>989</sub>VGF<sub>992</sub>) on the Î±IIb
cytoplasmic domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup></p>

with the N-lobe of CIB1. Subsequently, Î±IIb and Î²3 are
separated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 and this Î±IIbÎ²3 complex
dissociates. The integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 dimer is activated by
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1, which is similar to the activation by talin,
a cytoskeleton protein, which binds to the Î²3 cytoplasmic domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup>.</p>

      <p>In this work, we have used a reverse cross-saturation
NMR approach
to detect the interface on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CIB1 that recognizes the
bound Î±IIb-L peptide. In these experiments, we selectively irradiated
the smaller partner in the proteinâprotein complex, and the
results from our work (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) demonstrate that it is possible to identify the
hydrophobic residues that are involved in the interactions between
CIB1 and Î±IIb. This represents a powerful way of using the NMR
cross-saturation experiment, where normally the larger partner has
been irradiated to achieve more effective spin-difussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> Many protein complexes currently under investigation can be represented
by studying a large protein and a synthetic peptide to represent the
intact protein partner or a protein domain. Provided that the proteins
of interest can be bacterially expressed, deuterated, and selectively
protonated on methyl groups, the reverse cross-saturation experiment
with methyl detection should become a useful NMR approach for better
understanding proteinâprotein interactions in general.</p>
