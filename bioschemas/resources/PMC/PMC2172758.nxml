      <abstract>
        <p>Gle1 is required for mRNA export in yeast and human cells. Here, we report that two human Gle1 (hGle1) isoforms are expressed in HeLa cells (hGle1A and B). The two encoded proteins are identical except for their COOH-terminal regions. hGle1A ends with a unique fourâamino acid segment, whereas hGle1B has a COOH-terminal 43âamino acid span. Only hGle1B, the more abundant isoform, localizes to the nuclear envelope (NE) and pore complex. To test whether hGle1 is a dynamic shuttling transport factor, we microinjected HeLa cells with recombinant hGle1 and conducted photobleaching studies of live HeLa cells expressing EGFPâhGle1. Both strategies show that hGle1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. An internal 39âamino acid domain is necessary and sufficient for mediating nucleocytoplasmic transport. Using a cell-permeable peptide strategy, we document a role for hGle1 shuttling in mRNA export. An hGle1 shuttling domain (SD) peptide impairs the export of both total poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA and the specific dihydrofolate reductase mRNA. Coincidentally, SD peptideâtreated cells show decreased endogenous hGle1 localization at the NE and reduced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of microinjected, recombinant hGle1. These findings pinpoint the first functional motif in hGle1 and link hGle1 to the dynamic mRNA export mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>mRNAs undergo a number of processing and maturation events between their transcription by polymerases and their ultimate translation by ribosomes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maniatis and Reed, 2002</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, a key step involves export to the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nakielny and Dreyfuss, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wente, 2000</xref>). The export of mRNAs is a stepwise process (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maniatis and Reed, 2002</xref>) beginning with the processing of pre-mRNAs into heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes that are recognized by transport receptors in the nucleoplasm. The transporters subsequently target the mRNA-bound hnRNP complex (mRNP) to the NPC and mediate translocation through the NPC for release on the cytoplasmic side. The transporters and the hnRNPs are subsequently reimported into the nucleus and, thus, are considered dynamic shuttling factors.</p>
      <p>The molecular paradigms for this pathway were initially established from studies of viral RNA export (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cullen, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hammarskjold, 2001</xref>). For the HIV-1 pathway, a nuclear export sequence (NES) in the RNA-bound viral Rev protein is recognized by Crm1 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 1999</xref>), a member of a conserved family of transport receptors called karyopherins (also designated exportins/importins/transportins) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gorlich and Kutay, 1999</xref>). Through interaction with specific adaptor proteins, Crm1 also mediates the export of cellular RNAs, such as 5S RNA and U1 snRNA (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 1995</xref>), and the 60S ribosomal subunit (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2000</xref>). A different karyopherin (exportin-t/Los1) mediates the export of tRNA (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gorlich and Kutay, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Karyopherins may play multiple roles in the export of mRNPs (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2002</xref>), some being required for the export of cellular mRNAs from early response genes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gallouzi and Steitz, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gallouzi et al., 2001</xref>). Distinct sets of importins are needed for the reimport of shuttling hnRNPs (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Michael et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). However, studies in yeast, mammalian, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte systems have illustrated a central role for the novel Mex67/TAP/NXF1 protein (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Segref et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gruter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Katahira et al., 1999</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, splicing and TAP/NXF1-mediated nuclear export are believed to be coupled (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maniatis and Reed, 2002</xref>). TAP/NXF1, together with its cofactor p15/NXT1 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fribourg, et al., 2001</xref>), promotes the export of both spliced and intronless transcripts through interactions with both mRNPs and NPC proteins (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Maniatis and Reed, 2002</xref>). Thus, TAP/NXF1 may act as a shuttling bridge between the mRNP complex and the NPC (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Zenklusen and Stutz, 2001</xref>). Although TAP/NXF1 was shown to cooperate with karyopherins (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Shamsher et al., 2002</xref>), TAP/NXF1 itself does not bind Ran, and RanGTP hydrolysis is not required for TAP/NXF1-mediated mRNA export (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bachi et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several other factors are also required for mRNA export, including the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 and two NPC-associated factors Gle1 and Gle2/Rae1 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Zenklusen and Stutz, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Reed and Hurt, 2002</xref>). Dbp5 may remodel hnRNP complexes at the NPC and mediate the release of nonshuttling hnRNPs in the nucleus and shuttling hnRNPs in the cytoplasm. This could serve a critical role in mRNP transport directionality (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Snay-Hodge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tseng et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). Work from several groups strongly supports the hypothesis that Gle1 plays an essential role in mRNA export (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Del Priore et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Wente, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Noble and Guthrie, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>). Human Gle1 (hGle1) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Gle1 (scGle1) have no consensus RNA binding sites, and no functional protein motifs have been definitely identified (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Reed and Hurt, 2002</xref>). Moreover, no hGle1-interacting proteins have been identified. Genetic connections implicate scGle1 as a modulator of scDbp5 activity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hodge et al., 1999</xref>), and scGle1 also interacts with Nup42 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Wente, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stutz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Strahm et al., 1999</xref>), Dbp5, and a nonessential factor, Gfd1 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hodge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Strahm et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, our studies in yeast have shown that soluble inositol hexakisphosphate production is required for efficient scGle1 function (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">York et al., 1999</xref>). Overall, how Gle1 mediates nuclear transport is far from being resolved.</p>
      <p>A long-standing question regarding Gle1 function is whether it is a dynamic shuttling factor or a stable component of the NPC (a nucleoporin). Others have suggested that scGle1 is a static nucleoporin (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2000</xref>). However, the mammalian Gle1 protein does not cofractionate with NPCs (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cronshaw et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we have focused on the human protein. We demonstrate that two hGle1 protein variants (hGle1A and B) are encoded from a single gene. The hGle1B isoform associates with the NE/NPC in HeLa cells and is the predominant variant. We subsequently show that both proteins can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that this shuttling activity requires the presence of a novel 39âamino acid domain. Moreover, using a cell-permeable peptide strategy, we found that hGle1 shuttling is essential for poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export.</p>

        <title>Human Gle1 cDNAs encode two isoforms in HeLa cells</title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown endogenous hGle1 localization at the NPCs/NE and in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Here we show that ectopic expression of the hGle1 cDNA previously reported by <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al. (1998)</xref>, in fusion with EGFP, did not produce a protein that localized predominately to the NE of transfected cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). We speculated that this isoform (hereafter designated hGle1A, a 659âamino acid polypeptide; accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAC25561">AAC25561</ext-link>) lacked a critical region required for NPC/NE association. Recently, a human testis cDNA clone was deposited in the human EST database (accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAH30012">AAH30012</ext-link>). The predicted protein product is a 698âamino acid polypeptide (designated hGle1B) identical to hGle1A except at the COOH terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>). Based on genomic sequence information (Locus ID 2733), the <italic>hGle1</italic> gene is comprised of 16 exons. Within exon 14, a 5â² cryptic splice donor site could account for the expression of two transcript variants, with two corresponding different 3â² untranslated regions (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nissim-Rafinia and Kerem, 2002</xref>). The predicted products result in the hGle1A version with a unique fourâamino acid segment and hGle1B with a different 43âamino acid span at the COOH terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D).</p>

        <p>To determine if HeLa cells express these two mRNA isoforms, we performed semiquantitative PCR studies on total HeLa cDNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Using a forward (F) primer common to both variants and isoform-specific reverse primers (A and B, respectively; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), we found that HeLa cells expressed both the short (hGle1A) and long (hGle1B) isoforms and that hGle1B mRNA was â¼1,000-fold more abundant than hGle1A. By Northern blotting, the preferential expression of the hGle1B mRNA over hGle1A was also detected in all human tissues analyzed (unpublished data). Finally, ectopic expression experiments in HeLa cells revealed that EGFPâhGle1B localization was similar to endogenous hGle1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). These results argue that hGle1B is the prevalent isoform in human cells.</p>

        <title>Identifying an hGle1 domain with nuclear export activity</title>
        <p>We speculated that if hGle1 is dynamic and transiently associates with NPCs while entering and exiting the nucleus, it should contain domains/sequences that harbor nucleocytoplasmic transport activities. The region of hGle1 spanning amino acid residues 444â606 was specifically targeted for internal in-frame deletion based on our previous studies of scGle1 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Wente, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>). The COOH-terminal regions of scGle1 and hGle1A/B are highly similar, and the corresponding region in scGle1 contains a putative leucine-rich (LR) NES-like motif that is essential for scGle1 function in mRNA export (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D; see Discussion). As a tool to delineate the region(s) of hGle1 that may harbor nuclear export activity, we generated a panel of ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged hGle1A deletion proteins and analyzed their respective intracellular distributions independent of the endogenous hGle1 by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using anti-FLAG antibodies. To assay for export activity, we placed the SV40 large T antigen NLS in frame at the COOH terminus of FLAGâhGle1A. Based on the hypothesis that hGle1 harbors nuclear export activity, it should balance the activity of the heterologous NLS and result in cytoplasmic FLAGâhGle1AâNLS localization. Results from these experiments are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Although the majority of the FLAGâhGle1AâNLS was detected in the nucleus, FLAGâhGle1AâNLS was also clearly present in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, lower left). Strikingly, the FLAGâhGle1A<sub>Î444â606</sub>âNLS protein was localized exclusively in the nucleus. Various NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal deletions of the 444â606 region were tested to map the export activity. Deletions from the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal side eliminated cytoplasmic localization (Î444â511), whereas deletions from the COOH-terminal side up to residue 483 retained the export activity (Î484â606) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, a 39âamino acid region from residues 444â483 was necessary to confer cytoplasmic localization of FLAGâhGle1AâNLS.</p>

        <p>To further examine the transport properties of the 39âamino acid hGle1 region defined above, we conducted a series of microinjection experiments with bacterially expressed and purified GST fusion proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Binucleate HeLa cells were used for nuclear microinjection such that the export and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activities of GST fusion proteins could be coincidentally examined. First, a GST fusion with only the 39âamino acid putative domain (hGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub>) was tested by coinjection with Texas red (TR)âlabeled 70-kD dextran into one nucleus of a binucleate HeLa cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). The TRâdextran identified injected cells and the subcellular injection site (arrows). The cells were subsequently incubated at either 37Â°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, left) or 4Â°C (right), fixed, and processed for IIF microscopy with anti-GST antibodies. At 37Â°C, 86.5% (Â±2.8%; <italic>n</italic> =112) of the microinjected cells showed GSTâhGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub> at the injection site, in the cytoplasm, and in the second nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, arrowhead). In contrast, at 4Â°C, GSTâhGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub> remained at the site of injection in 87% (Â±4.3%; <italic>n</italic> = 81) of the injected cells. These results indicated that GSTâhGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub> was actively exported from the injected nucleus. In time course experiments, export was detected at full levels within 2 h after injection (unpublished data). Thus, residues 444â483 of hGle1 were sufficient to mediate nuclear export. In addition, the presence of GSTâhGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub> in the second nucleus of binucleate cells suggested that this region also had nuclear import activity. These experiments support the hypothesis that hGle1 harbors a nucleocytoplasmic transport domain, for both import and export. Hence, we have designated this 39âamino acid span the hGle1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling domain (SD).</p>

<bold>Analysis of GSTâhGle1 dynamics in HeLa cells by microinjection.</bold> (A) The hGle1 39âamino acid region from 444â483 has intrinsic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity. HeLa cells were comicroinjected with purified proteins and TR-labeled 70-kD dextran. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37Â°C or 4Â°C after injection and processed for IIF microscopy using anti-GST antibodies (top). Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (bottom). At 37Â°C (left), microinjection of GSTâhGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub> in one nucleus of a binucleate HeLa cell (top, arrow), as indicated by the TR-labeled dextran (middle), results in GST staining in the second nucleus (arrowhead). At 4Â°C (right), nuclear export and import activity of GSTâhGle1<sub>444â483 (SD)</sub> is not detected. (arrow, nuclear injection; asterisk, cytoplasmic injection). (B and D) The SD is necessary for GSTâhGle1B export. Full-length GSTâhGle1B (B) and GSTâhGle1<sub>ÎSD</sub> (D) were analyzed by microinjection. (B) After injection into one nucleus of a binucleate cell (arrowhead), GSTâhGle1B is in both the cytoplasm and the uninjected nucleus after incubation at 37Â°C (right). Cytoplasmically microinjected GSTâhGle1B (asterisk) shows strong nuclear staining. At 4Â°C (left), injected protein remains at the site of microinjection. (C) FLIP analysis reveals that EGFPâhGle1B shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in HeLa cells. An area of the cytoplasm was repeatedly bleached, and the loss of nuclear fluorescence was monitored over time. The data points plotted for EGFPâhGle1B represent averages (<italic>n</italic> = 6). EGFPâcoilin and EGFPâhNup98 data are representative of the loss of fluorescence detected in several time courses and are consistent with data previously reported (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>). (D) Microinjection of GSTâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> protein in the nucleus results in no staining outside the microinjection site after incubation at 37Â°C (both panels) (or 4Â°C; not depicted). In the right panel, partial nuclear localization is observed in two cytoplasmically injected cells (asterisks). Bars, 10 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>To analyze the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of full-length hGle1, GSTâhGle1B and GSTâhGle1A (unpublished data) were microinjected into the cytoplasm or nucleus of HeLa cells. After incubation at 37Â°C, protein localization was determined by IIF. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B shows that GSTâhGle1B was exported from the injected nucleus and imported into the second nucleus (left panel, arrowhead) in 84% (Â±2.1%; <italic>n</italic> = 56) of the injected cells. Nuclear import activity of GSTâhGle1B was also detected after cytoplasmic injection of the protein (asterisk). The transport activities appeared to be energy dependent, as shown by the lack of redistribution when incubated at 4Â°C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B, right).</p>
        <p>To independently test whether hGle1 shuttles, we analyzed the dynamics of EGFPâhGle1B in live HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). This was based on our observation that ectopically expressed EGFPâhGle1B localizes like endogenous hGle1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Using the technique of fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), we analyzed whether nuclear EGFPâhGle1B could exchange with the cytoplasmic pool of EGFPâhGle1B. By repeatedly bleaching an area of the cytoplasm, the decrease in nuclear EGFP fluorescence over time was monitored. As controls, the same bleach protocol was conducted on EGFPâhuman coilin (a nonshuttling protein) and EGFPâhNup98 (a mobile nucleoporin) transfected cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>). Our results show that EGFPâhGle1B nuclear fluorescence was lost by repetitive cytoplasmic bleaching, similar to EGFPâhNup98. In contrast, &lt;9% of nuclear EGFPâcoilin fluorescence was lost in the same time frame. Thus, these experiments corroborate the microinjection results and demonstrate that hGle1B harbors nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity.</p>
        <p>To test whether the 39âamino acid region from residues 444â483 was required for hGle1 shuttling, we attempted to analyze the dynamics of EGFPâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> in live HeLa cells. Unfortunately, ectopic expression of EGFPâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> was toxic to the cells (unpublished data). Thus, GSTâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> was purified and microinjected into one nucleus of binucleate HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D, left). After incubation at 37Â°C for 5 h, GSTâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> was detected only in the injected nucleus in 87.8% (Â±6.7%; <italic>n</italic> = 52) of injected cells. GSTâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> was also microinjected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells and detected in the nucleus in 89.4% (Â±2.5%; <italic>n</italic> = 55) of cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D, right, asterisk). However, over the same time frame after injection, the nuclear signal was not nearly as intense as with GSTâhGle1B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and D</xref>, asterisk). We concluded that GSTâhGle1B<sub>ÎSD</sub> did not have nuclear export activity, and any remaining domain(s) had weak nuclear localization activity. The SD may provide the primary nuclear import pathway (see below). Similar experiments were conducted using GSTâhGle1A and GSTâhGle1A<sub>ÎSD</sub> and showed identical results (not depicted).</p>

        <title>The SD of hGle1 is required for hGle1-dependent mRNA export</title>
        <p>Our previous studies have shown that hGle1 is required for the export of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in HeLa cells (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>). We speculated that hGle1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may be important for its transport function and that this role may be mediated by the interaction of the SD with another factor in the poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export pathway. To investigate this hypothesis, we used a cell-permeable peptide strategy that is based on inhibiting proteinâprotein interactions (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pritchard et al., 1999</xref>). We reasoned that by competing for the factor(s) required for hGle1 transport, we would abrogate the shuttling of endogenous hGle1. We would then be able to study the effect of a âstaticâ hGle1 on total poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA distribution within the cell by in situ hybridization. A similar strategy was used by <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gallouzi and Steitz (2001)</xref> in a study of mRNA export pathways.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, a peptide corresponding to the SD was synthesized as a COOH-terminal fusion to a 16âamino acid portion of helix 3 from the homeodomain of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factor antennapedia (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Prochiantz, 1999</xref>), designated APâhGle1-SD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). The antennapedia peptide (AP) sequence mediates the uptake of peptides into cells and confers stability (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Derossi et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). As a control, an AP fusion peptide was also synthesized with a randomly scrambled sequence of the same amino acid composition as the SD (designated APâhGle1-scrSD; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). As seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, incubating cultured HeLa cells (at &lt;10 passages, see Materials and methods) with media containing 5 Î¼M APâhGle1-SD peptide had distinct effects. After 4 h in the presence of APâhGle1-SD peptide, â¼5% of cells appeared to undergo apoptosis (asterisk). Interestingly, all the remaining interphase cells showed marked accumulation of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in the nucleus. In contrast, no cytotoxicity was detected with the APâhGle1-scrSD incubation, and all the cells showed normal poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA distribution by in situ hybridization (untreated control cells in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). In culture media with &lt;10% FBS or with APâhGle1-SD peptide concentrations &gt;5 Î¼M, the viability of the cells was drastically reduced. However, if the inhibitory peptide was removed after the 4-h incubation, the cells recovered and showed normal poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA distribution after 12 h (not depicted).</p>

        <p>To ensure that the increase in nuclear poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA levels did not reflect a perturbation in the polyadenylation process, we also analyzed the export of an individual mRNA. In situ hybridization experiments using a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mRNAâspecific digoxigenin-labeled antisense oligonucleotide were conducted. Incubation with the APâhGle1-SD peptide resulted in nuclear accumulation of DHFR mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). In contrast, the control APâhGle1-scrSD peptide had no effect. To confirm the in situ hybridization experiments, we analyzed the relative amounts of DHFR mRNA in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions isolated from HeLa cells pretreated with the peptides (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). Using a semiquantitative RT-PCR strategy, the presence of APâhGle1-SD peptide markedly decreased the levels of DHFR transcript in the cytoplasmic fraction. Moreover, there was a corresponding increase in the nuclear signal relative to the control APâhGle1-scrSDâtreated cells. Together, the in situ hybridization experiments and biochemical fractionation data confirm that APâhGle1-SD peptide impairs the export of mRNA from the nucleus.</p>
        <p>To test whether the decrease in mRNA export resulted from a general perturbation of transport through NPCs, protein import and export activity was analyzed. For nuclear import, cells transiently expressing a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) GFP fusion protein were treated with APâpeptides for 4 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). In the absence of the agonist dexamethasone, a substantial GRâGFP cytoplasmic pool was observed. When dexamethasone was added to induce import, nuclear accumulation of GRâGFP was observed in the presence of either peptide. To determine if protein export from the nucleus was perturbed, the intracellular distribution of karyopherin/importin Î²1 was monitored by IIF. We hypothesized that if the general nuclear protein export pathways were affected by APâhGle1-SD peptide, karyopherin/importin Î²1 would accumulate in the nucleus of treated cells. However, the cellular distribution of this shuttling karyopherin was not affected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Thus, protein import and export are not markedly inhibited under conditions where APâhGle1-SD decreases poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export. These data suggest that hGle1-SD function is specifically essential for the mRNP export process.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of hGle1-SD activity by APâhGle1-SD peptide perturbs endogenous hGle1 localization at NPCs</title>
        <p>In parallel with the study of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA distribution, we analyzed the localization of endogenous hGle1 by IIF microscopy in cells treated with APâpeptides. Different permeabilization and fixation conditions were used to discriminate between cytoplasmically accessible hGle1 and nuclear hGle1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In untreated wild-type cells processed by fixation and complete Triton X-100 permeabilization (Fix-Triton), a pool of hGle1 is localized at the NPC/NE, and a fraction of the hGle1 is cytoplasmically accessible (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). In cells treated with the control APâhGle1-scrSD peptide and processed by Fix-Triton, endogenous hGle1 was localized in a typical wild-type pattern, and cells exhibited normal poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, top). However, when cells were treated with the APâhGle1-SD peptide, distinct hGle1 staining at the NPC/NE was less apparent in cells with impaired poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, bottom).</p>

        <p>To further analyze the perturbations in hGle1 localization induced by the APâhGle1-SD peptide, cells were treated with digitonin alone to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane before fixation (Digitonin-Fix; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). Under these conditions, very little anti-hGle1 staining was observed in cells affected by the APâhGle1-SD peptide (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B, asterisks). This contrasted with the strong signal detected in APâhGle1-scrSD cells and in an unaffected cell (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B, arrowheads). The lack of antiâlamin B staining in similarly treated Digitonin-Fix cells served as a control for NE integrity. To visualize the intranuclear distribution of hGle1, cells were permeabilized with digitonin, fixed, and then incubated with Triton X-100 (Digitonin-Fix-Triton). By this method, cells treated with the control APâhGle1-scrSD showed uneven and low levels of nucleoplasmic hGle1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). The APâhGle1-SD cells seemed to show a slight increase in nucleoplasmic levels; however, the intranuclear staining pattern was not significantly changed. Western blotting confirmed that the hGle1 protein size and levels were not altered in the presence of the APâhGle1-SD peptide (not depicted).</p>
        <p>To more directly address the effect of APâhGle1-SD on hGle1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, we analyzed the distribution of microinjected GSTâhGle1A in cells treated with the APâhGle1-SD peptide. Compared with the control APâhGle1-scrSD cells, the presence of the APâhGle1-SD peptide resulted in less efficient import of cytoplasmically injected GSTâhGle1A into the nucleus (90 Â± 2.5%; <italic>n</italic> = 49 microinjected HeLa cells) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, left).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report, we have addressed the question of whether hGle1 is a stable component of the NPC or if instead it behaves as a shuttling transport factor. Our results support the conclusion that although the major hGle1 isoform (hGle1B) in HeLa cells has a steady-state localization at the NPC, its role in transport hinges on nucleocytoplasmic dynamics. These conclusions are based on several pieces of evidence. First, we identified a 39âamino acid domain in hGle1 that has intrinsic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity. Second, photobleaching (FLIP) of EGFPâhGle1B in live HeLa cells shows that hGle1 shuttles. Third, we demonstrated that an hGle1 39âamino acid domain is required for hGle1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Fourth, by disrupting the function of the SD using a cell-permeable peptide strategy, we showed that endogenous hGle1 association with NPCs is transient. Finally, we observed that interfering with hGle1 shuttling and NPC localization is coincident with a significant decrease in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export. Overall, this pinpoints the first functional motif in hGle1, demonstrates that hGle1 is a shuttling mRNA export factor, and closely links hGle1 function to the dynamic mRNA export pathway.</p>
      <p>We also report that two hGle1 isoforms are expressed in HeLa cells, hGle1A and hGle1B. Both are identical except for their very COOH-terminal regions. Two lines of evidence suggest that the main hGle1 protein in HeLa cells is hGle1B. First, in contrast to EGFPâhGle1A, EGFPâhGle1B intracellular localization is highly similar to endogenous hGle1. Second, semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments show that hGle1B is the more abundant mRNA isoform in HeLa cells. We speculate that the unique 43âamino acid region at hGle1B's COOH terminus is required for NPC/NE association. Interestingly, this region of hGle1B shares similarities with scGle1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D), which is also predominately localized at NPCs (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Wente, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2000</xref>). Our future work will address whether each hGle1 isoform plays distinct in vivo roles.</p>
      <p>Based on recent proteomic analysis of the mammalian NPC (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cronshaw et al., 2002</xref>) and these studies, we conclude that hGle1 is not a stable component of the NPC and that hGle1 is not required for overall maintenance of NPC structure and function. In cells treated with APâhGle1-SD peptide, no perturbations in the localization of nucleoporins recognized by mAb414, in GFPâGR protein import, or in karyopherin/importin Î²1 nuclear export were detected. In light of recent elegant reports on hNup153 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nakielny et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Daigle et al., 2001</xref>), hNup98 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>), Npap60/Nup50 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lindsay et al., 2002</xref>), and scNup2 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dilworth et al., 2001</xref>), it is becoming evident that a subpopulation of factors with steady-state NPC localization have unexpected dynamic properties. We propose that hGle1B transiently associates with NPCs during its function as a shuttling mRNA export mediator.</p>
      <p>Results from our photobleaching experiments and cell-permeable peptide studies strongly support the conclusion that endogenous hGle1 has a bona fide SD and dynamically enters and exits the nucleus. In the presence of competing APâhGle1-SD peptide, the association of endogenous hGle1 with the NPC/NE was substantially reduced, and the shuttling of recombinant hGle1 was severely impaired. Coincidentally, APâhGle1-SD peptide induced nuclear poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA accumulation, suggesting that hGle1 is involved in a molecular cascade that leads to the export of mRNP complexes out of the nucleus. It is possible that APâhGle1-SD peptide may compete for hGle1's nucleoporin binding site(s) or for an adaptor protein that bridges the interaction of hGle1 with nucleoporins at NPCs. The latter would be similar to the interaction networks of karyopherin/importin Î²1 for Î± (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gorlich et al., 1995a</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) or Crm1 for Rev (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>). Alternatively, the SD peptide may affect more than Gle1. If the unidentified SD-binding factor has additional interacting partners, their interactions could be equally perturbed. Thus, isolating an hGle1-SDâinteracting protein is of great interest. As a dynamic NPC-associated protein, we speculate that hGle1 either actively participates in the export process or facilitates the nuclear import of an unidentified factor that would mediate mRNA export.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of the hGle1 SD is not similar to any of the previously characterized nucleocytoplasmic SDs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). A direct alignment of the hGle1 SD with the M9 of hnRNP A1 suggests weak similarity, which could result in a potential interaction with the M9-binding karyopherin Î²2A/transportin-1 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Siomi et al., 1997</xref>). However, the key consensus residues implicated in transportin-1 binding are not present in hGle1 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Pollard et al., 1996</xref>). We tested for an hGle1-SD and transportin-1 interaction and found that bacterially expressed GSTâtransportin-1 does not directly bind immobilized hGle1-SD peptide (unpublished data). This suggests that transportin-1 is not directly involved in hGle1 shuttling. Further deletions within the hGle1 SD and selective point mutations based on interspecies homology analysis have not yet been successful in separating the nuclear import and export activities (unpublished data).</p>

      <p>Although structurally similar to hGle1, the yeast homologue scGle1 does not harbor a similar 39âamino acid peptide sequence. Rather, the same region of scGle1 contains a putative LR-NESâlike motif (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Wente, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). This motif in scGle1 is required for scGle1 function, suggesting that it may use the RevâCrm1 export pathway to exit the nucleus (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Wente, 1996</xref>). Although the scGle1 putative LR-NES by itself mediates export in heterologous transport assays, an interaction between scGle1 and scCrm1 has not been established (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Stutz and Rosbash, 1998</xref>). It is also unclear whether endogenous scGle1 shuttles. Taken together, the Gle1 mRNA export mechanisms in yeast and human cells may have subtle differences. Further studies in yeast and human cells may reveal how two highly homologous proteins can function by potentially different mechanisms and ultimately lead to a similar outcome, the export of mature mRNPs from the nucleus.</p>
      <p>Our work in this report strongly suggests that hGle1 dynamics are key to the poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA export mechanism. It will be of great interest to identify which factor(s) interacts with hGle1A and B and, in particular, the hGle1 SD. We predict that this information will be valuable in ascertaining the molecular cascade leading to hGle1-mediated mRNP export.</p>

        <p>Peptides were synthesized by FAST-moc chemistry and purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and the sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Each peptide harbors the antennapedia sequence at its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). For assays, peptides were first diluted in complete DME and added cells (CCL-2 cells; lot no. 2462426; passage &lt;10 after receipt from American Type Culture Collection) and grown to 70â80% confluency. After 4 h incubation, cells were processed for in situ hybridization and/or IIF. We noted a decrease in the susceptibility of HeLa cells after passage 150 from reception; 10% of the population appeared to become resistant to the effects of APâhGle1-SD peptide, likely due to diminished peptide uptake. This trend increases with passage number, ultimately resulting in APâhGle1-SDâresistant HeLa cell populations. Nuclear import activity in APâpeptide-treated cells was determined after transfection with pK7.GR.GFP expression vector (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al., 1996</xref>) and using dexamethasone treatment (10 Î¼g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

        <p>HeLa cells (5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) treated or untreated with APâpeptides were scraped off culture plates and suspended in ice cold RNase-free PBS. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions were isolated after the NP-40 lysis procedure (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Greenberg and Ziff, 1984</xref>), except that the lysis buffer was supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 1 U/Î¼L of RNAsinâ¢ (Promega).

Total RNA from each fraction was isolated using Trizolâ¢ reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA contamination of the purified cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was estimated by PCR before reverse transcription using the same conditions as below (not depicted). Each RNA fraction was subsequently reverse transcribed using Superscript IIâ¢ and random hexamers (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Serial dilutions of the resulting cDNAs were made, and 10% of each was used in PCR studies. For DHFR gene amplification (28 cycles), specific primers (forward, 5â²-CAGAACATGGGCATCGGCAAGAACG-3â²; reverse, 5â²-AAACAGAACTGCCACCAACTATCCA-3â²) were used. 50% of each reaction was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.7% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.
