      <abstract>
        <p>We previously reported that phosphorylation of topoisomerase (topo) IIÎ± at serine-1106 (Ser-1106) regulates enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs. In this study we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser-1106, which is flanked by acidic amino acids, is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by casein kinase (CK) IÎ´ and/or CKIÉ, but not by CKII. The CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, reduced Ser-1106 phosphorylation and decreased formation of etoposide-stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex. In contrast, the CKII inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, did not affect etoposide-stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex formation. Since, IC261 specifically targets the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated isozymes, CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ, we examined the effect of down-regulating these enzymes on Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Down-regulation of these isozymes with targeted si-RNAs led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide. However, si-RNA-mediated down-regulation of CKIIÎ± and Î±â² did not alter Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Furthermore, reduced phosphorylation of Ser-1106, observed in HRR25 (CKIÎ´/É homologous gene)-deleted <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells transformed with human topo IIÎ±, was enhanced following expression of human CKIÉ. Down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ also led to reduced formation of etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex. These results provide strong support for an essential role of CKIÎ´/É in phosphorylating Ser-1106 in human topo IIÎ± and in regulating enzyme function.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Type II DNA topoisomerases, topoisomerase II (topo II) Î± and Î², regulate DNA topology by creating transient double stranded DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1â3</xref>). Although, both enzymes exhibit significant sequence homology and catalyze redundant catalytic reactions, they are involved in different cellular functions. This difference may in part be due to differential regulation of these enzymes. Several different mechanisms have been shown to regulate topo II activity, including transcriptional, translational, as well as post-translational mechanisms. The major post-translational mechanisms that modulate topo II activity are phosphorylation, interaction with other proteins and proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1â3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Both topo IIÎ± and topo IIÎ² are phosphorylated at several sites, primarily in the divergent C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4â8</xref>). Whereas, little is known about site-specific phosphorylation of topo IIÎ², several <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have identified specific phosphorylation sites in topo IIÎ±. Within the C-terminal region of topo IIÎ± phosphorylation of threonine-1342, serine(Ser)-1376, Ser-1469 and Ser-1524 catalyzed by casein kinase (CK) II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">9â14</xref>), and of Ser-1212, Ser-1246, Ser-1353, Ser-1360 and Ser-1392 catalyzed by a proline directed kinase has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that Polo-like kinase 1 phosphorylates topo IIÎ± at Ser-1337 and Ser-1524 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition to the sites in the C-terminal region, phosphorylation of Ser-29 located in the ATP binding domain within the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and of Ser-1106 located within the catalytic core have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Whereas phosphorylation of Ser-29 is catalyzed by protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-1106 has not yet been identified.</p>
      <p>Since Ser-1106 is located in the catalytic domain of topo IIÎ± and phosphorylation of this site enhances enzyme activity and sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), it is important to decipher the mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ser-1106 is regulated. The first step toward determining this mechanism would be to identify the kinase(s) that catalyzes phosphorylation at this site. Based on the acidic amino acid sequences that flank Ser-1106 at the amino- and carboxy-terminus, two potential kinases that could phosphorylate this site are CKI and CKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although CKII has been recognized as a major kinase phosphorylating topo IIÎ±, the role of CKI in phosphorylating topo IIÎ± has not been explored. Unlike CKII, which consists of a tetramer of two catalytic subunits, Î± and/or Î±â², and two regulatory Î² subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20â22</xref>), human CKI comprises of a superfamily of seven different isozymes that function as monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Structurally these isozymes, CKIÎ±, Î², Î³1, Î³2, Î³3, Î´ and É, are organized into three distinct regions â a short N-terminal region, a highly conserved kinase domain and a highly variable C-terminal domain, primarily involved in regulating enzyme function. The CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ isozymes are very similar in structure and exhibit 98% homology in the kinase domain and 50% homology in the C-terminal domain. Autophosphorylation of the C-terminal domain leads to inhibition of the enzyme, which can be relieved following dephosphorylation or proteolytic cleavage of this region, often via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Indeed, it has been suggested that dephosphorylation of CKIÉ by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, enhances phosphorylation of DARP-32 by this isozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our earlier studies demonstrating a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism in regulating phosphorylation of Ser-1106 and in modulating sensitivity to topo II-targeted drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) suggested that the kinase responsible for phosphorylating this site may be CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ, rather than CKII. In this study we examined the role of CKIÎ´/É and CKII in phosphorylating Ser-1106 by attenuating the activity of these kinases with specific inhibitors or with targeted si-RNAs. Our results demonstrated that CKIÎ´/É, but not CKII, catalyzes the <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of Ser-1106 and regulates topo IIâDNA cleavage activity.</p>

HCT-116 cells, obtained from Dr Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine at 37<sup>Â°</sup>C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air. Cells were treated with CKI-7 (200 Î¼M), IC261 (10 Î¼M) or DRB (40 Î¼M) for 3 h. When the combination of CKI or CKII inhibitor and etoposide was employed, cells were pretreated with CKI-7, IC261 or DRB for 3 h. Following this treatment, cells were washed, resuspended in inhibitor-free medium and incubated for an additional hour in etoposide.</p>

In addition the On-Target plus SMART pool si-RNA anti-CSNKID human (si-CKIÎ´) and On-Target plus SMART pool si-RNA anti-CSNKIE human (si-CKIÉ) were purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. For targeting CKIIÎ± RNA the siGENOM SMART pool CSNK2A1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was employed. The CKIIÎ±â² si-RNA (sense: 5â²-CAGUCUGAGGAGCCGCGAGdTdT-3â², antisense: 5â²-CGGCUCCUCAGACUGdTdT-3â²), previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) was synthesized by MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany. The control si-RNA (5â²-GCUCAGAUCAAUACGGAGAdT dT-3â²) was purchased from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO. HCT-116 cells were incubated in serum-free McCoy's medium for 6â10 h with the si-RNA (100 nM) in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. When the combination of si-CKIÎ´ and si-CKIÉ was employed, the concentration of each si-RNA was reduced to 75 nM. Following the initial incubation, cells were washed and cultured in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were harvested for preparing cell lysates. When cells were transfected with si-CKIÎ´/É about 50â70% of the cells that readily detached upon washing were used for preparing lysates for 2D-phosphopeptide maps of topo IIÎ±, since both CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ were maximally down-regulated in this population.</p>

        <p>Lysates of HL-60 and HCT-116 cells were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Topo IIÎ± protein immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate was subjected to SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The membrane was stained with Gelcode Blue staining reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) to visualize the topo IIÎ± band, which was excised and processed for proteolysis with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) or trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). For determination of down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ, western blot analysis was carried out on cell lysates (20â40 Î¼g) prepared from si-RNA transfected cells that were harvested just prior to labeling with [<sup>32</sup>P]-orthophosphoric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Cell lysate of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells were prepared in Y-PER lysis buffer after freezing the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen and human topo IIÎ± present in the lysate was purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-nitrilotriacetic acid essentially as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Purified topo IIÎ± was subjected to SDSâPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and the stained topo IIÎ± band was processed for phosphopetide mapping.</p>

        <title>Phosphopeptide mapping of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled topo IIÎ±</title>
        <p>The 170 kDa <sup>32</sup>P-labeled topo IIÎ± band visualized by staining with Gelcode Blue staining reagent on the nitrocellulose membrane was excised and digested with trypsin essentially as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Following extensive washing of the membrane in water, topo IIÎ± was proteolytically cleaved with 5 Î¼g of trypsin-TPCK treated (Worthington Biochemical, Freehold, NJ) or with 2 Î¼g of trypsin GoldÂ® (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) in 1% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 at 37<sup>Â°</sup>C for 14â16 h. In initial experiments involving treatment with CKI inhibitors, proteolytic digestion with TPCK-treated trypsin consistently led to generation of two Ser-1106 containing peptides due to partial proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), whereas in subsequent experiments trypsinization with highly purified trypsin GoldÂ® consistently led to generation of a single Ser-1106 containing peptide. The tryptic peptides released in the ammonium bicarbonate solution were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tube and the membrane piece was washed with 100 Î¼l of 20% acetonitrile. The pooled eluate and washings were then concentrated by evaporation in a Savant Speed-Vac, washed three times with water and the peptides solubilized in pH 1.9 buffer (88% formic acid/glacial acetic acid/deionized water, 1:3.1:36, v/v). The peptides were then separated on thin layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis with pH 1.9 buffer in the horizontal dimension and chromatography in the vertical dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In initial experiments the phospho-chromatography buffer contained <italic>n</italic>-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water (5/3.3/1/4, v/v). To improve migration of the Ser-1106-peptide an isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/<italic>n</italic>-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/deionized water) (32.9/1/2.5/1.5/14.7, v/v), which resolves extremely hydrophilic phosphopeptides, was used.

        <p>LCâMS was carried out on tryptic digests of stained topo IIÎ± protein band excised from SDSâpolyacrylamide gels. In-gel trypsin digestion was carried out as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Briefly, following washing/destaining in two aliquots of 50% ethanol/5% acetic acid (v/v), reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide, the excised gel pieces were dried in a Speed-vac and incubated with 30 Î¼l of 20 ng/Î¼l trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate on ice for 10 min. Any excess trypsin solution was then removed and 20 Î¼l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added. Following overnight digestion at room temperature, the peptides were extracted from polyacrylamide pieces in two 30 Î¼l aliquots of 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid (v/v). These extracts were combined and evaporated to â¼5 Î¼l and then reconstituted in 1% acetic acid to a total volume of 25 Î¼l for LCâMS analysis. The tryptic peptides in the extract (2 Î¼l/injection) were separated by reversed-phase LC in a 10 cm Ã 50 Î¼m (i.d.) Phenomenex Jupiter 10 Î¼m C18 self-packed capillary column using a linear gradient of 2â70% acetonitrile containing 0.05 M acetic acid in 50 min at a constant flow rate of 0.2 Î¼l/min. The effluent was analyzed using a Finnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometry system equipped with a Protana microelectrospray ion source (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) operated at 2.5 kV. Data interpretation was performed with the programs TurboSequest and Mascot. All matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation.</p>
        <p>Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used to compare the extent of Ser-1106 phosphorylation in control scrambled si-RNA and si-CKIÎ´/É treated HCT-116 cells. The SRM experiment consisted of a 5-scan event analysis in which one scan event was a standard MS scan and the other four were different SRM descriptors directed to various sets of control or Ser-1106 containing peptides, both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated. To verify peptide recovery from the digestion procedure and the mass spectrometry response, one ion of the trypsin autolysis peptide VATVSLPR at <italic>m/z</italic> 422 (+2) and one ion of the unmodified topo IIÎ± native peptide EVTFVPGLYK at <italic>m/z</italic> 577 (+2) were monitored.

        <title>DNA cleavable complex formation</title>
        <p>The effect of etoposide on forming a stable topo IIâDNA cleavable complex was determined by measuring the amount of precipitated proteinâDNA complex and by evaluating depletion of topo IIÎ± not complexed with DNA (band depletion). For measuring precipitated proteinâDNA complex, cells were labeled for 24 h with 0.02â0.04 Î¼Ci/ml of [<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine, specific activity 53 mCi/mmol (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). For measuring DNA cleavable complex in cells down-regulated for CKIÎ´ plus CKIÉ, cells were treated for 6 h with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIÎ´ plus si-CKIÉ prior to labeling. Cells were then trypsinized, treated with etoposide for 1 h and the precipitated proteinâDNA complex was assayed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). For the band depletion experiment cells were treated similarly without the addition of [<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine. Cell lysates were prepared in 2-fold concentrated LDS-sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The lysates were incubated at 70<sup>Â°</sup>C for 10 min, sonicated and centrifuged at 12 000 Ã <italic>g</italic>. An aliquot (10â15 Î¼l) of the lysate was subjected to western blot analysis. The membranes were probed with antibodies to topo IIÎ± and topo I (internal control), which does not form a stabilized DNA cleavable complex with the topo II-targeted drug, etoposide. Down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ was also determined by western blotting with antibodies specific for CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ.</p>

        <title>Inhibitors of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ (CKI-7 and IC261) lead to hypophosphorylation of the CNBr and tryptic topo IIÎ± peptides containing Ser-1106 and reduce formation of etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex</title>
        <p>The presence of acidic amino-acid residues N-terminal to Ser-1106 and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependency of phosphorylation of this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-1106 may be regulated by protein kinase CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ. Therefore we first examined whether two CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261, specific for CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), altered phosphorylation of Ser-1106 containing peptides. Treatment of HL-60 cells with CKI-7 or IC261 led to hypophosphorylation of the CNBr (peptide 34) and tryptic phosphopeptides that were previously shown to harbor Ser-1106 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B, respectively). Comparison of the intensity of spots corresponding to the peptides containing Ser-1106 (normalized to two other peptides) revealed that CKI-7 and IC-261 led to comparable decreases (20â40% and 25â30%, respectively) in phosphorylation of Ser-1106 as compared to untreated control cells. To determine whether decreased phosphorylation observed in the presence of CKI-7 or IC261 compromises the functional activity of topo IIÎ±, we examined the effect of CKI-7 and IC261 on formation of etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with 200 Î¼M CKI-7 or 10 Î¼M IC261 for 3 h prior to treatment with 5 Î¼M etoposide for 1 h led to a significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) decrease in the formation of etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We also examined the effect of the CKII specific inhibitor, DRB, on formation of etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex. Pretreatment with 40 Î¼M DRB did not alter etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These results suggest a role for CKIÎ´/É in regulating the functional activity of topo IIÎ± via phosphorylation at Ser-1106.

        <title>Down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ with targeted si-RNA decreases phosphorylation of the tryptic peptide containing Ser-1106</title>
        <p>To confirm the role of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ in phosphorylating Ser-1106 we down-regulated these two enzymes with three different sets of si-RNAs. These included si-CKIÎ´/Éâwhich targeted the nucleotide sequence (412â430) that is identical in the CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ coding region; si-CKIÎ´âwhich is a smart pool targeted to the CKIÎ´ isozyme; and si-CKIÉâwhich is a smart pool targeted to the CKIÉ isozyme. The si-CKIÎ´ and si-CKIÉ were used individually to down-regulate the specific isozyme or used in combination to simultaneously down-regulate both isozymes. Since, HL-60 cells are difficult to transfect we used the colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116, for transfection of the si-RNAs. This cell line was chosen because it can be readily transfected and the phosphopeptide map of topo IIÎ± in HCT-116 cells is similar to that in HL-60 cells (data not shown). Transfection of the three si-RNAs in HCT-116 cells led to significant down-regulation (â¼60â80%) of the targeted isozyme; si-CKIÎ´/É and the combination of si-CKIÎ´ and si-CKIÉ led to down-regulation of both CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ, whereas si-CKIÎ´ or si-CKIÉ when used individually, down-regulated only the targeted enzyme CKIÎ´ or CKIÉ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A). When both CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ were down-regulated a slight increase in the G<sub>2</sub> + M phase of the cell cycle was observed (data not shown).

HCT-116 cells were transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIÎ´/É as described in Materials and methods section, or treated for 16 h in the absence or presence of 200 nM nocadazole. For cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIÎ´/É a small aliquot was lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to western blot analysis to determine down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and CK1É (<bold>A</bold>).

        <p>The down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ in HCT-116 cells transfected with si-CKIÎ´/É resulted in significantly decreased (75%) phosphorylation of the tryptic Ser-1106 containing phosphopeptide, as compared to cells transfected with the control scrambled si-RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). This was not due to an increase in the G<sub>2</sub> + M population observed in cells transfected with si-CKIÎ´/É, since phosphorylation at Ser-1106 was not affected when cells were blocked in mitosis following treatment with nocadazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Comparison of phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in topo IIÎ± present in cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIÎ´/É by LC-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) revealed findings that were similar to those obtained by 2D-phosphopeptide mapping. Although both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Ser-1106 was detected in control cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA, only unphosphorylated Ser-1106 was detected in cells transfected with si-CKIÎ´/É. Down-regulation of only one isozyme, CKIÎ´ or CKIÉ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), also led to hypophosphorylation of the Ser-1106 containing peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>B and 5C, respectively), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed when both CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In cells treated with si-CKIÎ´, phosphorylation of Ser-1106 was 25â40% less than that observed in cells treated with scrambled si-RNA, whereas in cells treated with si-CKIÉ phosphorylation of Ser-1106 was 40â65% less than that observed in cells treated with scrambled si-RNA. Differential hypophosphorylation of Ser-1106 in si-CKIÎ´ and si-CKIÉ transfected cells could be due to differences in the effectiveness of the two isozymes in phosphorylating this site or due to differential down-regulation of CKIÎ´ (â¼60%) and CKIÉ (â¼80%).

        <p>We previously demonstrated a functional role for Ser-1106 phosphorylation in topo IIÎ±, based on the observation that mutation of Ser-1106 to alanine in human topo IIÎ± led to decreased topo IIÎ± function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in JN394 yeast cells transformed with human topo IIÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In this study we examined whether topo IIÎ± function is affected when phosphorylation at Ser-1106 is altered by down-regulating the kinase(s), CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ, involved in phosphorylating this residue. Down-regulation of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ by si-CKIÎ´ plus si-CKIÉ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) led to a significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) decrease in SDSâKCl precipitable <sup>14</sup>C-thymidine labeled etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). Since, formation of a stable topo IIÎ±âDNA cleavable complex in the presence of etoposide leads to depletion of topo IIÎ± not complexed with DNA, we also determined the amount of topo IIÎ± in lysates of control or etoposide-treated HCT-116 cells that were transiently transfected with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIÎ´ plus si-CKIÉ. In cells transfected with si-CKIÎ´ plus si-CKIÉ depletion of topo IIÎ± following treatment with etoposide was less (â¼40â50%) than that observed in cells transfected with scrambled si-RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). This finding corroborates the previous data demonstrating decreased formation of the etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex in cells transfected with si-CKIÎ´ plus si-CKIÉ. These results indicate that CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ are involved in regulating topo IIÎ± function via phosphorylation at Ser-1106.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In the present study we identify CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ as upstream kinase(s) regulating <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of topo IIÎ± at Ser-1106 and thereby modulating the DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme. The role of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ in phosphorylating Ser-1106 is based on several lines of experimental evidence. <italic>In vivo</italic> phosphorylation of the tryptic peptide that contains Ser-1106 is decreased when CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ are inhibited by the CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 and IC261 (specific for CKIÎ´/É), or when CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ are down-regulated by targeted si-RNAs. Similarly, in human topo IIÎ± expressing HRR25 (CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ homologous gene) deleted <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells, the tryptic peptide containing Ser-1106 is also hypophosphorylated, and phosphorylation at this site can be enhanced following transformation of these cells with human CKIÉ. The decrease in phosphorylation of the Ser-1106 tryptic peptide is indeed due to reduced phosphorylation at this site, since our earlier studies indicated that <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation of this tryptic peptide was not observed when Ser-1106 in topo IIÎ± was mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Furthermore, LCâMS analysis of phosphorylated Ser-1106 in topo IIÎ± obtained from HCT-116 cells treated with scrambled si-RNA or si-CKIÎ´/É revealed the presence of phosphorylated Ser-1106 only in scrambled si-RNA treated cells.</p>
      <p>The decrease in phosphorylation at Ser-1106 observed in cells exhibiting reduced kinase activity of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ correlates with a decrease in topo IIÎ± function. Inhibition of the CKI activity in cells treated with CKI inhibitors, CKI-7 or IC-261 leads to reduced formation of topo IIâdrug DNA complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, when CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ are down-regulated by targeted si-RNAs, formation of the etoposide stabilized topo IIâDNA cleavable complex is reduced. These results indicate that the phosphorylation at Ser-1106 catalyzed by CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ enhances the <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA cleavage activity of topo IIÎ±.</p>
      <p>Several different kinases, including CKII, protein kinase C, proline directed kinases e.g. cdc2 and Polo-like kinase 1 have been reported to phosphorylate topo IIÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">9â17</xref>). However, this is the first report demonstrating CKI as a physiologically relevant kinase that modulates phosphorylation and activity of topo IIÎ±. Our data demonstrating decreased phosphorylation of several peptides (excluding the Ser-1106 containing peptide) following down-regulation of CKIIÎ± and CKIIÎ±â² with targeted si-RNAs provides evidence that CKII is also capable of phosphorylating topo IIÎ± <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, phosphorylation at CKII sites does not significantly affect sensitivity to topoII-targeted drugs, since treatment of HL-60 cells with the CKII inhibitor, DRB, did not significantly alter formation of topo II-drugâDNA complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since our study did not evaluate the effect of reduced phosphorylation at CKII sites on other functions of topo IIÎ±, the functional role of phosphorylations at CKII sites remains unclear. It is possible that phosphorylation at CKII sites, most of which map to regions in the C-terminal domain, along with other phosphorylations within this region regulate accessibility of the catalytic site to its substrate. This mechanism would be analogous to that described for regulation of the activity of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ, wherein dephosphorylation of the C-terminal region activates the enzyme.</p>
      <p>Our previous data demonstrating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1106 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), provides further support for the role of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatable enzymes), but not CKII, as physiologic kinases that modulate Ser-1106 phosphorylation. Although, the catalytic activity of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ does not require Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these enzymes can be regulated via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dephosphorylation or proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In neostriatal neurons, the metabotrophic glutamate receptors activate CKIÉ by dephosphorylating the inhibitory C-terminal autophosphorylation sites by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The activated CKIÉ then leads to phosphorylation of Ser-137 of DARPP-32. A scenario similar to that described in neostriatal muscles, could explain how phosphorylation of Ser-1106 is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Dephosphorylation by calcineurin and subsequent activation of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ could result in phosphorylation of Ser-1106. Alternatively, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protease, e.g. calpain, which is activated by calcium influx in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), could remove the inhibitory domain in CKIÎ´ or CKIÉ and lead to activation of these kinases.</p>
      <p>CKI isozymes are involved in regulating several different cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ isozymes have been shown to modulate the development process because of their role in the wnt signaling pathway. In addition, these isozymes play a role in circadian rhythm, cell division, apoptosis and neurodegenerative diseases. CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ phosphorylate p53, tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins to regulate cell growth, chromosome segregation and stress response at the spindle apparatus and the mitotic centrosome. The identification of topo IIÎ±, which is also involved in regulating DNA replication and cell division, chromosome segregation and DNA repair, as another nuclear substrate of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ in this study, suggests that these CKI isozymes may be essential for regulating various aspects of DNA metabolism. In this regard, topo IIÎ± could function as part of a protein complex that comprises of transcription factors, nuclear regulatory proteins and kinases (including CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ)/phosphatases that regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of components of the complex. Thus, it would be important to determine whether CKIÎ´ or CKIÉ is capable of associating with topo IIÎ±.</p>
      <p>In summary our results demonstrate that CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ are physiologically relevant kinase(s) that are involved in regulating site-specific phosphorylation at Ser-1106 and modulating the function of topo IIÎ±. Since Ser-1106 phosphorylation regulates sensitivity of cells to topo II-targeted drugs and expression of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ can be altered in cancer cells, one potential mechanism by which tumor cells develop resistance to topo II-targeted drugs could involve decrease in expression or activation of CKIÎ´ and/or CKIÉ. The correlation of Ser-1106 hypophosphorylation with etoposide resistance was not only observed in cell culture model systems but was also seen in blast cells isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Comparison of Ser-1106 phosphorylation with etoposide induced apoptosis revealed that reduced phosphorylation at Ser-1106 was associated with decreased apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, it might be possible to identify sensitivity of tumors to topo IIÎ±-targeting drugs by characterizing phosphorylation at Ser-1106 or by determining the expression level or activity of CKIÎ´ and CKIÉ in tumor samples.</p>
