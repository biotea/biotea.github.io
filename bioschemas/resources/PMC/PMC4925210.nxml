        <p id="P1">WNT ligands induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling on target cells. PKD1 (Polycystin 1) is considered an orphan, atypical G protein coupled receptor complexed with TRPP2 (Polycystin 2 or PKD2), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel. Inactivating mutations in their genes cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), one of the most common genetic diseases. Here, we show that WNTs bind to the extracellular domain of PKD1 and induce whole cell currents and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx dependent on TRPP2. Pathogenic <italic>PKD1</italic> or <italic>PKD2</italic> mutations that abrogate complex formation, compromise cell surface expression of PKD1, or reduce TRPP2 channel activity suppress activation by WNTs. <italic>Pkd2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> fibroblasts lack WNT-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and are unable to polarize during directed cell migration. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, PKD1, Dishevelled 2 (DVL2), and WNT9A act within the same pathway to preserve normal tubulogenesis. These data define PKD1 as a WNT (co)receptor and implicate defective WNT/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as one of the causes of ADPKD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">The WNT signaling pathway regulates essential biological functions<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. It is divided into two major arms, the canonical WNT/Î²-catenin pathway, and a Î²-catenin independent pathway that is mainly responsible for establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) and tissue morphogenesis. Activation of the noncanonical pathway is often accompanied by a transient increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The pathway leading to this increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is poorly defined, but it seems to involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores downstream of the activation of Frizzled (FZD)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and RYK receptors<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. There is also evidence for WNT-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, probably through transient receptor potential (TRP) or store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, specific receptors and channels responsible for WNT-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are unknown.</p>
      <p id="P3">In the mouse embryonic kidney, tubular diameter is controlled by WNT9B in a Î²-catenin independent manner<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. A similar mechanism seemed possible for PKD1<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, suggesting that WNT9B and PKD1 may function in the same pathway. PKD1 is a large protein of unknown function <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Its extracellular portion contains two leucine rich repeats (LRR) flanked by N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) followed by a cell-wall integrity and stress response component (WSC) domain. A second CRD showing weak homology to low density lipoproteins (LDL-A domain) is located downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. These domains are unique to PKD1 and not present in homologous molecules such as PKD1L1-3. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PKD1 interacts with multiple G protein Î±- subunits<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and TRPP2<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. TRPP2 belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels and forms a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cation channel in association with PKD1<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or other TRP channels<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The structure of PKD1 along with its ability to associate with TRPP2 has suggested that PKD1 and TRPP2 form a receptor/channel complex. However, the molecular identity of the ligand(s) of this complex and thus, its physiological mechanism of activation has been a mystery.</p>
      <p id="P4">In this study, we identify secreted WNTs as activating ligands of the PKD1/TRPP2 complex. Activation of PKD1/TRPP2 by WNTs is independent of FZD receptors. We further show that TRPP2 is required for WNT9B-induced directed cell migration, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent process often used as a surrogate assay for morphogenetic cell movements (convergent extension) during kidney tubule elongation. Finally, we identify DVL2 as an interacting partner of PKD1 and show that WNT9A, PKD1, and DVL2 function in the same pathway to control <italic>Xenopus</italic> pronephric tubule formation.</p>

        <title>WNT ligands can bind to the extracellular domain of PKD1</title>
        <p id="P5">The cystic phenotype of <italic>Wnt9b</italic>-kidney null mice, along with the presence of several CRDs in PKD1 prompted us to test whether WNTs could physically interact with PKD1. Indeed, WNT9B co-immunoprecipitated with PKD1 but not with the structurally similar PKD1L1 or TRPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Next, we tested whether WNT9B could associate with various fragments of the extracellular domain unique to PKD1 in the extracellular space. The CRD of FZD8 was used as a reference point, since its affinity to WNT9B is known (K<sub>D</sub>=482Â±16 nM<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>). WNT9B associated with the LRR-WSC-Fc and LDL-A-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). LRR-WSC-Fc also associated with WNT9B in the extracellular space <italic>in trans</italic>, whereby cells were singly transfected with Fc constructs or WNT9B, co-cultured for 24 h, and protein-protein interactions were detected in the cultured media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). PKD1 interacted with WNT9B through a site that included the C-terminal CRD of the LRR and the WSC domain (LRR-CT+WSC-Fc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). To test whether PKD1 and WNT9B interacted directly, we purified LRR-WSC-Fc from conditioned media of stably transfected HEK293 cells and incubated it with purified WNT9B. 87 ng (or 2.35 pmol) of purified WNT9B was pulled-down with 390 ng (or 5.2 pmol) of purified PKD1-Fc fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1f-h</xref>). Under the same conditions, full-length TRPP2-Myc isolated from total cell lysates did not interact with purified WNT9B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">WNT5A, WNT4, or WNT3A also bound to LRR-WSC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). WNT5A and WNT4 bound also to the LDL-A domain of PKD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b-e</xref>). The affinity of WNT3A to soluble FZD8-CRD is 3.6Â±1.2 nM<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Thus, using the FZD8-CRD/WNT9B and FZD8-CRD/WNT3A interactions as âaffinity rulersâ, we deduced that the PKD1/WNT9B or PKD1/WNT3A interactions were of comparable affinity to that of FZD8/WNT3A. Therefore, PKD1 can interact with WNTs that function through Î²-catenin (WNT3A), independently of Î²-catenin (WNT5A), or both (WNT9B, WNT4), with an estimated affinity in the low nanomolar range.</p>

        <title>WNT9B activates heterologously expressed PKD1/TRPP2 complex</title>
        <p id="P7">Next, we tested whether CHO-K1 cells co-transfected with PKD1 and TRPP2 could support an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in response to WNT9B. CHO-K1 cells do not express endogenous PKD1 or TRPP2<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Perfusion of untransfected cells with purified WNT9B did not result in an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, WNT9B induced an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, only in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells co-transfected with PKD1 and TRPP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). These data indicated that PKD1 and TRPP2 mediated WNT9B-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores.</p>
        <p id="P8">WNT9B-induced whole cell currents were determined in 50 nM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Addition of WNT9B (500 ng/ml) induced large currents in cells co-transfected with wild type PKD1 and TRPP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). These currents were ~50-100-fold larger than PKD1/TRPP2 currents reported earlier<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Cells co-transfected with the pathogenic PKD1<sup>S99I 27</sup> and TRPP2 failed to respond to WNT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,i,l</xref>), although PKD1<sup>S99I</sup> was expressed at comparable levels to wild type PKD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3a</xref>). Cell surface biotinylation revealed that S99I severely compromised surface expression of PKD1<sup>S99I</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). However, cell surface expression of TRPP2 was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistently, cell surface expression of TRPP2 was unchanged in wild type and <italic>Pkd1</italic>-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). These data suggested that cell surface expression of PKD1 is required for WNT9B-induced currents.</p>
        <p id="P9">Because at 50 nM of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated channels could contribute to whole cell currents, we buffered intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with 10 mM EGTA to eliminate contribution of these endogenous channels. However, while the contribution of endogenous channels is suppressed in zero intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the activity of TRPP2 is also suppressed by 80-90%<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. As expected, in zero intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, WNT9B-induced PKD1/TRPP2-dependent currents were ~10-fold smaller than currents in 50 nM of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and showed strong outward rectification, which is typical for members of the Polycystin family of ion channels<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,h</xref>). The reversal potential was near â20 mV, consistent with the much higher K<sup>+</sup> permeability of TRPP2 compared to Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Co-expression with PKD1<sup>S99I</sup> did not result in WNT9B-induced currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,h</xref>), as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Co-transfection of PKD1 and the TRPP2 pathogenic mutant, TRPP2<sup>D511V</sup>, suppressed the WNT9B response by ~75% compared to wild type TRPP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d,h</xref>). Cells co-transfected with PKD1 and pathogenic TRPP2<sup>R872X</sup> that does not interact with PKD1 failed to respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e,h</xref>), indicating that the PKD1/TRPP2 interaction is required for the WNT9B response. Replacement of the pore-forming region of TRPP2 with the equivalent region of the K<sup>+</sup>-permeable Kv1.3 (TRPP2<sup>Kv1.3</sup>) suppressed inward currents but not outward currents carried by K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f,h</xref>). The chimeric TRPP2<sup>Kv1.3</sup> channel was expressed in comparable levels to wild type TRPP2 and maintained its interactions with wild type TRPP2 or PKD1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). These data suggested that TRPP2 directly contributed to the formation of WNT9B-induced currents and the interaction with PKD1 was required for the effect. PKD1L1 physically interacts with TRPP2<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. However, PKD1L1 did not interact with WNT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Consistently, it did not form a WNT9B-inducible channel complex in CHO-K1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). Overall, results from these experiments support the hypothesis that the PKD1/TRPP2 complex was activated by WNT9B, likely through a direct ligand-receptor interaction between WNT9B and PKD1. To test whether activation of the PKD1/TRPP2 channel involves activation of endogenous FZDs, we co-expressed ZNRF3 and tested for an effect on WNT9B-induced currents. ZNRF3 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase clearing FZDs from the cell surface<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P17">Our data provide evidence that the PKD1/TRPP2 channel complex can function as a ligand-activated channel. Our data support the possibility of a direct ligand/receptor interaction for several reasons. First, the PKD1/WNT interaction does not require cell surface receptors, as it can occur in the extracellular space <italic>in trans</italic> and also, using purified proteins. Second, PKD1 is unlikely to function as a FZD or RYK co-receptor or downstream of these receptors, because neither WNT9B nor PKD1/TRPP2 induced or mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, an effect associated with FZD or RYK receptor activation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Third, clearing FZDs and LRP6 from the cell surface did not suppress WNT9B-or WNT3A-induced currents and heterologous expression of PKD1 and TRPP2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, which lack endogenous FZD receptors, supported WNT9B-induced currents. Therefore, PKD1 is likely to function as a (co)receptor for WNT ligands to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, independently of FZD receptors. The fact that WNT3A, a typical canonical WNT activated TRPP2, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable channel, suggests that WNT ligands could induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx regardless of their ability to signal through Î²-catenin as long as they can bind to PKD1 and PKD1/TRPP2 is present in the target cell. This may represent a general property of WNTs and implies a broader effect of WNTs on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling than previously thought. It may also help explain the strong influence of cell context on WNT signaling.</p>
      <p id="P18">We show that TRPP2 plays an important role in directional cell migration of MEFs in response to WNT9B. This is consistent with recent studies showing an essential role of PKD1 and TRPP2 in directional cell migration in embryonic kidney and endothelial cells during lymphatic development<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Despite caveats, directed cell migration in cell culture has been used as a reliable surrogate assay for convergent extension during embryonic development<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Defective convergent extension was proposed to underlie cystogenesis in embryonic <italic>Pkd1</italic> and <italic>Wnt9b</italic> mutant kidneys<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Although our data do not contradict this idea, we do not believe that defective convergent extension is the sole cause of cystogenesis in ADPKD, as deletion of core components of PCP, such as Vangl2, show very mild cystic dilatation<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. We rather propose that defective WNT-induced PKD1/TRPP2-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can adversely affect multiple processes, including convergent extension. Such a combinatorial effect can contribute to cyst initiation/formation.</p>
      <p id="P19">Experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos suggest that <italic>xPkd1</italic> genetically interacts with <italic>xDvl2</italic> in pronephric development. Overexpression of a dexamethasone-inducible, PCP-specific dominant negative form of <italic>xDvl2</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos produces dilated and shortened tubules<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, the same phenotype as the one modified by the combinatorial effects of <italic>xPkd1</italic> and <italic>xDvl2</italic>. We also show that PKD1 physically interacts with DVL2 and a point mutation in the DEP domain of DVL2 renders it unable to interact with PKD1. However, DVLs are dispensable for WNT9B-induced channel activity. These data suggest that DVL proteins can function as downstream effectors of PKD1/TRPP2 in the embryonic kidney. DVLs have been shown to function downstream of WNT/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling by an unknown mechanism<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. One possibility is that the physical interaction between PKD1 and DVLs may function to keep the two proteins in close proximity so that incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> could directly impinge on DVLs or immediate downstream effectors.</p>
      <p id="P20">We show that several WNTs can bind to PKD1. These data suggest that PKD1/TRPP2 can mediate effects of other WNTs not only in the kidney but in other tissues where WNT/Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is present.

        <p id="P32">Immediately before each experiment, a coverslip bearing CHO-K1 or MEFs was removed from the culture plate and placed onto a recording chamber, which was mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. The extracellular solution was normal Tyrode solution containing (in mM): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.33 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 5.5 glucose (pH 7.4). Pipettes were made from capillary glass (plain; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with a micropipette puller and polisher (PP-830 and MF-830, respectively; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). They were back-filled with internal solution composed of (in mM): 100 K-aspartate, 30 KCl, 0.3 Mg-ATP, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 0.03 GTP (pH 7.2). In experiments where intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was clamped to 50 nM, 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the internal solution. The pipette resistance varied from 3â5 MÎ© when filled with the internal solution. Offset potential was corrected just before a gigaohm seal formation. Series resistance and capacitance transients were compensated when CHO-K1 cells were used with a Warner PC-505B amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT, USA) and pClamp 10.0 software (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA, USA). Cell capacitance was not compensated in MEFs due to their large size (&gt;100pF). Currents were digitized with a Digidata 1440A converter (Molecular Devices), filtered through an internal four-pole Bessel filter at 1 kHz, and sampled at 2 kHz. Inward and outward whole-cell currents were obtained by employing a step-pulse protocol from â100 to +100mV every 5 s for 200 ms duration from a holding potential of â60mV. I-V curves were taken before and 5 min after the addition of WNT9B or WNT3A in the bath solution and derived from a step protocol ranging from â100 to +100 mV with 20 mV increments for 200 ms duration from a holding potential of â60mV. Steady-state currents towards the end of the pulse (between 50 and 100 ms) were used in I-V curves. Cells with a similar diameter displaying similar in magnitude stable baseline currents among various groups were selected for recordings and used for further analysis. WNT9B or WNT3A stock solution (100 ng/Î¼l) was dissolved in Tyrode solution and added directly to the recording chamber. Current traces were analyzed off-line with pClamp 10.0.</p>
