      <abstract>
        <p>HSF1, a conserved heat shock factor, has emerged as a key regulator of mammalian transcription in response to cellular metabolic status and stress. To our knowledge, it is not known whether HSF1 regulates viral transcription, particularly HIV-1 and its latent form. Here we reveal that HSF1 extensively participates in HIV transcription and is critical for HIV latent reactivation. Mode of action studies demonstrated that HSF1 binds to the HIV 5â²-LTR to reactivate viral transcription and recruits a family of closely related multi-subunit complexes, including p300 and p-TEFb. And HSF1 recruits p300 for self-acetylation is also a committed step. The knockout of HSF1 impaired HIV transcription, whereas the conditional over-expression of HSF1 improved that. These findings demonstrate that HSF1 positively regulates the transcription of latent HIV, suggesting that it might be an important target for different therapeutic strategies aimed at a cure for HIV/AIDS.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The long-lived latent viral reservoir of HIV-1 prevents its eradication and the development of a cure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The recent combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) aimed at inhibiting viral enzymatic activities prevents HIV-1 replication and halts the viral destruction of the host immune system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. However, proviruses in the latent reservoir persist in a transcriptionally inactive state, are insuppressible by cART and undetectable by the immune system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Proviruses in the latent reservoir primarily contribute to the rapid rebound of viremia after the cessation of cART<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Purging this reservoir is important for the development of a cure for AIDS and requires an understanding of latency mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
    <p>In recent years, several host cell proteins and viral regulatory proteins that influence retroviral latency have been identified. The respective lack of cellular transcription factors and HIV-1 Tat protein limits the initiation and elongation of viral transcription in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Genome-wide siRNA screenings have identified a total of 842 host genes associated with HIV-1 infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and a genome-wide mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis has revealed 497 HIV-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human proteins in HEK293 and Jurkat cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Notably, only a small fraction of cellular factors influences the latency maintenance and reactivation stages; thus, it is likely that additional cellular factors exploited by the virus during these stages remain to be identified. These factors might be engaged during transcriptional initiation and subsequent elongation processes.</p>
    <p>Until recently, cell stress proteins assisting latent reactivation, except for heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, have scarcely been detected. Here, we present a previously underappreciated stress protein, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, which extensively participates in latent HIV reactivation. First, we identified an important role for HSF1 in latent reactivation under stress. Next, the binding of HSF1 to the HIV long terminal repeat promoter (LTR) was detected during reactivation using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and two accessory factors, p300 and positive transcription elongation factor b (p-TEFb), were confirmed to assist HSF1 in maintaining function using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. Moreover, the acetylation of HSF1 was also considered as key point to latent HIV reactivation. Definitively, knockout and overexpression HSF1 further demonstrated its pivotal role in transcription. These data highlight an important role for HSF1 in HIV latency reactivation, providing a deeper understanding of latency mechanisms. These findings suggest that HSF1 might be a novel target for different therapeutic strategies against HIV/AIDS.</p>

        <title>The cell stress response selectively reactivates HIV in latency cell models</title>
        <p>To examine latent HIV in response to various cellular stresses, a well established and widely used model of HIV latency based on the Jurkat cell line, J-Lat 10.6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> was adopted in the present study. Heat shock, innate immune stress, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress are four classical stresses that can be induced by hyperthermia, poly (I:C), STA-4783 and thapsigargin respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Stress responses were detected based on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (p-eIF2Î±) in whole cells. As a result, J-Lat cells treated with these inducers showed significant up-regulation of p-eIF2Î± expression in 12âhours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). At the same time, poly (I:C) and STA-4783 increased the expression of GFP over five folds from the basal level, while thapsigargin upregulated the expression of GFP slightly. Hyperthermia (39.5âÂ°C) enhanced PHA-induced GFP expression which was in according with the report by Roesch <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although these four inducers influenced latent HIV in different extent, these results indicated that HIV is reactivated from latency in response to cell stress.</p>
        <p>We next confirmed the relationship between HIV reactivation and p-eIF2Î± upregulation after treating cells with a specific eIF2Î± dephosphorylase inhibitor (salubrinal), which effectively maintains and increases eIF2Î± phosphorylation. As a result, salubrinal efficiently induced phosphorylation of eIF2Î± in a short time and this effect was maintained by hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Consistent with this, salubrinal reactivated latent HIV in a dose-dependent manner and the reactivation was enhanced by hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The upregulated expression of the HIV capsid protein p24 was consistent with the percentage of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, the salubrinal-mediated reactivation of latent HIV appeared no toxicity to J-Lat 10.6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). As we observed, salubrinal induced phosphorylation of eIF2Î± on HIV latency cell model J-Lat 10.6 in our research, which is in agreement with the previous reports showing that it can induce eIF2Î± phosphorylation in other cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The phosphorylation of eIF2Î± is a marker of stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, while salubrinal can also inhibits ER stress. The possible explanation is that salubrinal-induced phosphorylation of eIF2Î± triggers HSF1 playing role in cellular proteostasis thus giving cell the ability to resist ER stress in return<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p>
        <p>In addition, ACH2 and U1 cell models, along with primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from HIV infected individuals receiving suppressive ART were adopted to examine HIV transcription after treatment with salubrinal. Consistently, the transcription of HIV genes such as <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>tat</italic>, <italic>vif</italic> and <italic>vpr</italic> quantitatively analyzed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were efficiently upregulated after treatment with salubrinal for 24âhours in the HIV latency cell models ACH2, U1 and J-lat 10.6. Despite that PMA/Iono significantly upregulated the transcription of HIV 5-âLTR and there was no significance between control group and salubrinal treatment group based on data from three donors, salubrinal could slightly upregulated the transcription of HIV 5â²-LTR at 48âhour in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from suppressive HIV patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the latent HIV reactivation stimulated by salubrinal was not associated with global T cell activation. The results on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref> showed that the expression of CD25 and CD69 was not up-regulated with salubrinal compared with prostratin treatment. Additionally, the expression of CD25 and CD69 on J-Lat cells was slightly down-regulated following treatment with hyperthermia (39.5âÂ°C). Together, these results indicate that stress sensitizes latent HIV to reactivation across cell models, and this is closely associated with the phosphorylation of eIF2Î± and the inhibition of global T cell activation.</p>

        <title>HSF1 is activated during HIV reactivation induced by stress inducer salubrinal</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that the cellular factors involved in the p-eIF2Î± downstream signaling pathway might play a major role in reactivation. Therefore, mRNA expression of multiple cellular transcriptional factors (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplemental Table S1</xref>) was examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). Indeed, the mRNA expression of AP-1 complex subunits, NFAT and ATF family members and HSF1 were markedly up-regulated. This effect was even more obvious after co-treatment with hyperthermia, and the same tendency was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>. As we observed, the gene expression of <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>c-Jun</italic> and <italic>ATF3</italic> were significantly upregulated within 24âhour in a time dependent manner under the treatment with salubrinal at 39.5âÂ°C. In comparison, the gene expression of <italic>NFAT2</italic> and <italic>HSF1</italic> changed slightly. Yet, the nuclear import of transcription factors were examined by Western blotting, and phosphorylated HSF1 dramatically accumulated in the nucleus when cells were treated with salubrinal for 2âhours and returned to basal levels after 4âhours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The changes in c-fos and ATF3 were consistent with phosphorylated HSF1, and the increased level of NFATc1 remained unchanged in 4âhours. However, RelA which was notably induced by TNF-Î±, PMA and prostratin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, was not up-regulated after salubrinal treatment.</p>
        <p>Next, cells treated with salubrinal or the PKC pathway modulator prostratin were respectively co-treated with AP-1 inhibitor (parthenolide, PTN), NFATc1 inhibitor (cyclosporine A, CsA), NF-ÎºB inhibitor (bay 11â7082) or HSF1 âp-TEFb complex inhibitor (KRIBB11). AP-1 and NFATc1 inhibition impaired reactivation whether induced by prostratin or salubrinal, and discrepancy was observed after NF-ÎºB inhibition. The expression of GFP was reduced in J-Lat cells when bay 11â7082 was co-treated with prostratin but persisted when co-treated with salubrinal for 48âhour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). Interestingly, HSF1 inhibition dramatically reduced latent reactivation in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of the reactivation was induced by salubrinal or prostratin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). These results suggest that multiple transcription factors are involved in latent virus reactivation. As HSF1 and its active form phosphorylated HSF1 (Ser320) showed up a significant increase tendency in the nucleus and GFP% was reduced by KRIBB11 treatments, we deduced that HSF1 may play a role in HIV latency reactivation in addition to the known transcription factors AP-1 and NFATc1. These results also suggest that the latent HIV reactivation induced by salubrinal is HSF1-dependent and NF-ÎºB-independent.</p>

        <title>HSF1 mediates the participation of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) in HIV latency reactivation</title>
        <p>HSF1 is a host transcription factor for HSPs and other stress response genes under stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we simply speculated that HSF1 downstream factor may be involved in HIV latency reactivation. The transcription of HSP genes was detected by RT-PCR. As showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, the mRNA expression of HSP90, HSP70, HSP27 and HSF1 were up-regulated in J-Lat cells under stimulation with different temperature such as 39.5âÂ°C and 42âÂ°C, and hyperthermia could efficiently enhanced the expression of HSF1 and its downstream genes. Meanwhile, the significant up-regulation of HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 mRNA expression were observed after treatment with prostratin and salubrinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
        <p>To explore whether HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 influence HIV reactivation, we used AUY922 and 17-DMAG, Ver-155008, and MK-2 inhibitor to inhibit HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27, respectively. Consistent with the results from Anderson <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, HSP90 positively participated in latency reactivation, and the inhibition of HSP90 by AUY922 and 17-DMAG reduced GFP expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similar to HSP90, HSP70 inhibition by Ver-155008 also impaired latent HIV reactivation. These two HSPs are positively involved in latent reactivation under the experimental conditions used in the present study. Additionally, the HSP70 activator YM-08 slightly increased GFP% in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>) confirmed the positive role of HSP70 in HIV latency reactivation. In contrast, we presented that HSP27 negatively affected latent reactivation, due to that the inhibition of HSP27 by MK2 inhibitor induced GFP expression rather than reduced that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results implied that HSPs actively express during HIV transcription whether induced by stress inducer salubrinal or non-stress inducer prostratin, and further potentiate our finding that HSF1 plays an important role in latent reactivation.</p>

        <title>HSF1 binds on HIV 5â²-LTR and also recruits p-TEFb to take part in transcription regulation</title>
        <p>To determine how HSF1 contributes to latent HIV reactivation in forward, we examined the impact of HSF1 on HIV 5â²-LTR during latency reactivation. According to HSE identified by Rawat <italic>et al.</italic> on HIV 5â²-LTR, we designed primers to target on 166 bp fragments (â18 to â183) on HIV LTR containing both HSF1 and NF-ÎºB binding sites. ChIP assays were employed to investigate HSF1 binding on HIV 5â²-LTR, in which TNF-Î± treatment group was made as control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, salubrinal increased the amount of HSF1 binding on HIV 5â²-LTR over two folds at 2âhour, while TNF-Î± appeared no influence on that. And the binding of HSF1 to HIV 5â²-LTR induced by salubrinal was reduced when co-treated with KRIBB11. In contrast, TNF-Î± greatly promoted the binding of NF-ÎºB to HIV 5â²-LTR while there was hardly none NF-ÎºB binding to HIV 5â²-LTR under the stimulation of salubrinal.</p>
        <p>With the corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, the PCR products were conducted agarose electrophoresis and pictures obtained were showed as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>. The PCR signal was strong in HSF1 IP group when cells were treated with salubrinal and was weakened with KRIBB11. Meanwhile, there was very weak signal in RelA IP group when cells were treated with salubrinal and was strong with TNF-Î±. These results further demonstrate that HSF1 binds on HIV 5â²-LTR and appears competitive binding with NF-kB.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated the recruitment of cellular transcriptional elongation factors mainly p-TEFb through HSF1. Co-IP experiments have shown that p-TEFb subunit CDK9 and cyclin T1 were recruited by HSF1 in J-Lat cells when treated with salubrinal for 2âhour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Meanwhile, the co-treatment with HSF1-p-TEFb complex inhibitor KRIBB11 inhibited the recruitment of p-TEFb to HSF1. As we know, p-TEFb plays a major role in transcriptional elongation by facilitating the continuation of pol II-mediated transcription after the promoter-proximal pause through the CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of the RNA pol II CTD at serine 2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Moreover, transcriptional elongation is an essential restriction step for latent HIV reactivation. Collectively, the present results demonstrated that HSF1 could bind on HIV 5â²-LTR and also recruited p-TEFb, suggesting HSF1â²s potential role in HIV transcription as well as transcription elongation.</p>

        <title>HSF1 recruiting p300 for self-acetylation is a committed step for HIV latency reversal</title>
        <p>In addition to p-TEFb, p300 has been detected involving in the complex recruited by HSF1. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>, the binding of p300 on HSF1 was increased under salubrinal treatment at 2âhour, and impaired by p300 inhibitor C646. At the same time, the acetylation of HSF1 was significantly increased in the present of salubrinal and decreased by C646 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>) which was demonstrated by IP experiments with polyclonal acetylated lysine antibody. As a result, the acetylation of HSF1 and the recruitment of acetylase p300 by HSF1 synchronized in the process of HIV reactivation under treatment with salubrinal. Now that the acetylation of HSF1 is happened in the reactivation process, we verified its necessity through inhibiting p300 by C646, and the results is predictable that p300 inhibition impaired latent HIV reactivation induced salubrinal. Similarly, latent HIV reactivation induced salubrinal was inhibited by C646 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on the result that HSF1 recruits p300 to acetylate itself, we speculated that HSF1 acetylation may extensively participates in latency reactivation. On the basis of the report that p300, HDAC, NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) and proteasome contribute to acetylation of HSF1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we validated p300 inhibitor C646 and HDAC inhibitor SAHA, Sirt1 activator resveratrol and inhibitor EX527, proteasome-ubiquitin inhibitors MG-132 and hemin on J-Lat cells as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref> indicated. It was observed that SAHA, resveratrol, MG132 and hemin which have been reported to reactivate latent HIV from other pathways, exerted strong ability of latent HIV reactivation in our research, too. SAHA reactivated latent HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>) while C646 suppressed reactivation induced by prostratin or salubrinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Resveratrol promoted the activation of latent HIV while EX527 had no effect on that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>). MG132 and hemin both boosted latent HIV reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G</xref>). Despite these compounds works on latent HIV reactivation on reported pathways, these results implied that they may also influence latent HIV through acetylizing HSF1. Collectively, we summarized that HSF1 recruiting p300 for self-acetylation is pivotal to the reactivation of latent HIV and the acetylation of HSF1 might extensively participate in latent HIV reactivation, which might provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-1 latency reversal.</p>

        <title>HSF1 broadly involves in latent HIV reactivation</title>
        <p>To verify whether the requirement of HSF1 for latent reactivation is universal, we co-treated latency reversing agents (LRAs) which reactivate latent HIV through different signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>) with KRIBB11 on J-Lat cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, HDAC inhibitor SAHA, p-TEFb activators JQ1, PKC agonists prostratin, TNF-Î±, and dilazep, efficaciously up-regulated GFP%. Meanwhile, the accumulation of phosphorylated HSF1 in the nucleus was markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). LRAs co-treated with KRIBB11 were employed to investigate the importance of HSF1 in latency reversal. Except SAHA, and the latency reactivation induced by other four LRAs used in our study were all inhibited by KRIBB11 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). As to the reason, one possible explanation was that SAHA might compete with HSF1 for p-TEFb binding, resulting in latent reactivation enhancement. Despite that, we concluded that HSF1 broadly involves in latent HIV reactivation.</p>
        <p>In further, we used TALENs to create HSF1 knockout in 293T cells, and we obtained a 293T-HSF1-KO (â4/â10âbp) cell line which was verified by sequencing and then Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D,F</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>, we found 4âbp and 10âbp deletions were generated in HSF1 gene distributing in duplex chromosomes through the analysis of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Meanwhile, HSF1 antibody detected no protein signal in 293T-HSF1-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Then HIV plasmid (pNL4-3-luc) was used to transfect 293T-HSF1-KO cells. Relative luciferase activity was detected and normalized to 293T-WT cells. The HSF1 knockout showed significantly reduced luciferase expression and HIV 5â²-LTR associated transcription activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6F</xref>). The overexpression of HSF1 in 293T-WT cells co-transfected with pNL4-3-luc showed enhanced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner under hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>), while cells transfected with HSF1 without hyperthermia showed luciferase activity inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). Phosphorylated HSF1 was augmented along with naked HSF1 under hyperthermia was detected by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Therefore, HSF1 is an indispensible element in HIV transcription, and activated HSF1 is a major contributor to HIV transcription.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Many cellular factors influence retroviral reactivation. NF-ÎºB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, AP-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, NFAT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, Ets-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, p-TEFb and p300 directly interact with HIV 5â²-LTR, extensively participating in gene transcription. HSF1 is another cellular factor reported in the present study, which largely participates in reactivation in the presence or absence of stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Rawat <italic>et al.</italic> firstly demonstrated that HSF1 is induced during acute HIV-1 infection and positively regulates HIV-1 gene expression through two distinct pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Although HSF1 has been reported as a positive regulator of HIV replication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we examined the relationship between the modality and function of this factor in latent HIV reactivation. Indeed, we propose that phosphorylation and acetylation are essential to the positive potency of HSF1, while the preliminary and ubiquitylated forms of this protein manifest negative or no potency, consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mono HSF1 is a repressor of HSP90 and HSP70 in the cytoplasm without any stimulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and mono HSF1 is transformed into a phosphorylated trimer then promote transcription under stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It then translocates into the nucleus and binds to HSE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, followed by acetylation by p300 for gene activation and ubiquitylation by ubiquitin for HSF1 degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. This mechanism might explain why the cotransfection of HSF1 with pNL4-3 does not up-regulate the transcription of HIV, suggesting that the active form of HSF1 is necessary. Beyond that, previous study showed that the mutant form of HSF1 (HSF1_ ÏªRD) posseses transcriptional activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. However, the precise post-translational modifications controlling HSF1 function remain unclear, and additional studies should focus on the phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation of HSF1 in novel primary latent models.</p>
      <p>Besides that HSF1 is induced by stress, we demonstrate that HSF1 is universal factor in latent HIV reactivation induced by LRAs and indispensable in HIV transcription. Particularly, the p-eIF2Î±-induced HSF1 activation reversed HIV latency was not associated with global T cell activation. Here we speculate that HSF1 is the crucial factor mediating this process. Besides HSF1 has been reported suppressing NF-ÎºB induced by TNF-Î±<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> or heat shock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, the binding sites of NF-ÎºB and HSF1 were overlapped in HIV 5â²-LTR as show in the previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, phosphorylated HSF1 trimer in nucleus has possibility of occupying NF-ÎºB binding sites, thus the competition binding between HSF1 and NF-ÎºB is taken place on HIV 5â²-LTR. The same phenomenon was observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) where salubrinal promoted much HSF1 binding on HIV 5â²-LTR while little NF-ÎºB. Because NF-ÎºB signaling pathway activation accelerates release of immune factors which may facilitate T cell activation and proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, the competition of NF-ÎºB and HSF1 for binding HIV 5â²-LTR may be one of the reason accounting for latent HIV reactivation by stress without global T cell activation. It needs further study to reveal underlying mechanism.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that HSF1 is an essential cellular factor for regulation of transcription and translation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and HIV hijacks this protein to promote viral proliferation. In uninfected cells, HSF1 is conditionally active to facilitate protein refolding and cell survival as a primary molecule regulating the cell stress response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In contrast, HSF1 is constitutively active in latent T cells to participate in latent HIV reactivation. Thus, the breadth of HSF1 biology is far greater than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). The results in present study indicated that latent HIV reactivation mediated by HSF1 may results from many factors such as fever, starvation or special drug stimulation. This may also account for latent HIV stochastically and spontaneously reactivates <italic>in vivo</italic>. Bypass, HSF1 and the associated post-translational modification enzymes identified in the present study provide further information for therapeutic development. Combined with anti-tumor therapy, the promotion of HSF1 activation might be an appropriate solution to antagonize provirus, resulting in the development of a cure for AIDS.</p>

        <title>Mechanisms of HSF1 mediate latent HIV-1 reactivation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</title>
        <p>Following stress stimulation or drug treatment, HSF1 is phosphorylated and spontaneously trimerized. Subsequently, HSF1 trimer translocates into nucleus. In nucleus, p300 is recruited to acetylate HSF1, and the acetylated HSF1 trimer binds sites at the HIV-1 LTR. This course is followed by HSF1-dependent elongation, in which acetylated HSF1 recruits the p-TEFb complex to TAR, and CDK9 subsequently phosphorylates the CTD of RNA pol II. Instantly, latent HIV begins transcription initiation and elongation.</p>
