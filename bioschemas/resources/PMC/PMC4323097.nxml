        <title>Summary</title>
        <p id="P1">Naturally occurring variations of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) comprise a core assembly of Polycomb group proteins and additional factors that include, surprisingly, Autism Susceptibility Candidate 2 (AUTS2). While <italic>AUTS2</italic> is often disrupted in patients with neuronal disorders, the underlying mechanism is unclear. We investigated the role of AUTS2 as part of a previously identified PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2), and in the context of neurodevelopment. In contrast to the canonical role of PRC1 in gene repression, PRC1-AUTS2 activates transcription. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the CK2 component of PRC1-AUTS2 thwarts PRC1 repressive activity while AUTS2-mediated recruitment of P300 leads to gene activation. ChIP-seq demonstrated that AUTS2 regulates neuronal gene expression through promoter association. Conditional targeting of <italic>Auts2</italic> in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) leads to various developmental defects. These findings reveal a natural means of subverting PRC1 activity, linking key epigenetic modulators with neuronal functions and diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain repressive forms of chromatin and therefore appropriate patterns of gene repression through epigenetic mechanisms. As such, PcG proteins have key roles in normal developmental progression, stem cell biology and cancer<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The two major groups of PcG protein complexes exhibit distinct enzymatic activities: Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) methylates H3K27 (H3K27me)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), catalyzes monoubiquitination of H2AK119 (H2AK119ub1)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and/or compacts chromatin<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. There are at least six distinct groups of mammalian PRC1 complexes, PRC1.1-1.6, each comprising one of six Polycomb group RING fingers (PCGFs)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and the E3 ligase RING1A/B. Further diversification arises from the mutually exclusive association of RING1A/B with either RYBP/YAF2 or one of the CBX proteins<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, which bind H3K27me3 through their chromodomains. Unlike their CBX-containing counterparts, RYBP-containing PRC1 complexes adopt a PRC2/H3K27me3 independent mechanism for targeting chromatin<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">Our previous studies revealed that PCGF3 and PCGF5 form novel PRC1 complexes comprising AUTS2<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. <italic>AUTS2</italic> maps to chromosome 7q11.2, encodes a nuclear protein<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and is frequently reported as being disrupted in individuals suffering neurological disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Although recent studies implicate <italic>AUTS2</italic> in regulating head size, neurodevelopment and enhancer function in zebrafish<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, the function of the AUTS2 protein has not been established nor has its role in regulating neuronal functions whose deregulation may result in pathogenesis.</p>
      <p id="P4">The physical link between PRC1, a key epigenetic regulator, and AUTS2, a risk factor for ASD and other neurological disorders, prompted us to investigate the functional role of the AUTS2-containing PRC1 complex (PRC1-AUTS2). Here we report that PRC1-AUTS2 exhibits a novel role in transcriptional activation, in contrast to the repressive role of canonical PRC1. Furthermore, this conversion is mediated by AUTS2. Specific deletion of the <italic>Auts2</italic> locus in neuronal progenitor cells revealed a profound neurodevelopmental phenotype, in accordance with <italic>AUTS2</italic> disruptions in humans.</p>

      <sec id="S3">
        <title>An AUTS2-containing PRC1 complex</title>
        <p id="P5">We pursued the unexpected association between PRC1 and AUTS2<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> using tandem affinity purification (TAP), followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis with AUTS2 fused to sequential N-terminal FLAG and HA tags (NFH). As previously reported<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, NFH-AUTS2 was associated with PCGF3, and with components of PRC1.5, including PCGF5, RING1A/B, RYBP and its homolog YAF2, and casein kinase 2 (CK2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We focused on the AUTS2-containing PRC1.5 complex that we designated (PRC1.5-AUTS2). Interestingly, several PRC1-unrelated polypeptides, including the co-activator P300, were also associated with AUTS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments performed with nuclear extract (NE) of 293 T-REx cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible NFH-AUTS2 and antibody against HA confirmed AUTS2 association with RING1B and PCGF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Other PRC1 components not associated with PRC1.5, such as CBX2, PCGF4/BMI1, and PCGF1, comprising PRC1.2/4, PRC1.4, and PRC1.1, respectively, did not co-immunoprecipitate with AUTS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). <italic>Auts2</italic> expression at the mRNA level was previously documented in mouse brain via <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, RING1B, but not CBX2, interacts with AUTS2 in co-IP experiments performed using NE of E15 mouse brain and AUTS2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that PRC1.5-AUTS2 forms within the CNS.</p>
        <p id="P6">AUTS2, PCGF5, RING1B, CK2B, and RYBP appear to form a stable complex as evidenced by glycerol gradient analysis of AUTS2-containing complexes (Fractions 9â11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Although PCGF5 bound both RING1B and AUTS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), RING1B interacted with AUTS2 only in the presence of PCGF5 as evidenced by IPs performed <italic>in vitro</italic> using insect cell-expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). PCGF5 is likely required to bridge RING1B and AUTS2 in complex formation. A similar <italic>in vitro</italic> IP experiment demonstrated that AUTS2 directly interacted with CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Thus, PRC1.5-AUTS2 contains at least five components: RYBP/YAF2, RING1A/B, PCGF5, AUTS2, and CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). RING1A/B associates with PCGF5 as it does with other PCGFs<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and recruits RYBP/YAF2. AUTS2 is incorporated through its interaction with PCGF5. Moreover, AUTS2 recruits CK2 through direct interaction.</p>

        <title>PRC1.5-AUTS2 activates transcription</title>
        <p id="P7">Given that PRC1 functions as a transcriptional repressor through epigenetic mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, we examined the effects of PRC1.5-AUTS2 on transcription and chromatin composition. We generated stable 293 T-REx cells containing an integrated luciferase reporter with five consecutive GAL4 DNA binding sites (UAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and one of the following doxycycline-inducible candidates: GAL4-AUTS2, GAL4-RING1B, GAL4-PCGF4, GAL4-PCGF5, or GAL4 alone. Doxycycline treatment reduced luciferase activity in GAL4-PCGF4 cells, consistent with its role in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, doxycycline treatment dramatically increased luciferase activity in GAL4-PCGF5 or GAL4-AUTS2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). This result was not due to a post-transcriptional event, as replacing the GAL4 DNA binding sequence with a FLAG-HA tag (FLAG-HA-AUTS2) resulted in the loss of AUTS2-associated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, GAL4-RING1B gave rise to considerably weaker repression, compared to GAL4-PCGF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Given that RING1A/B comprises all mammalian PRC1 complexes, the net outcome of GAL4-RING1B on transcription likely reflected the sum of all its associated complexes, i.e. repressive ones comprising PCGF4, and active ones comprising PCGF5 and AUTS2.</p>
        <p id="P8">We next probed the luciferase reporter in GAL4-AUTS2 cells for the presence of PRC1.5-AUTS2 components as well as indicators of chromatin structure using chromatin IP (ChIP) experiments. Upon doxycycline induction, GAL4-AUTS2 was recruited to the promoter region of the integrated luciferase locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). As expected, RING1B and CK2B were also recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Consistent with the locus being transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), Pol II was recruited, accompanied by an increase in trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-4 (H3K4me3) that correlates with active transcription, and a reduction in trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27me3) that correlates with repression, without appreciable change in total histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Similar results were obtained using the GAL4-PCGF5 stable line, showing enrichment of Pol II and acetylation of histone H4 at lysine-16 (H4K16ac), an active histone modification, and reduction in H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition to AUTS2, GAL4-PCGF5 recruited RING1B and CK2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">To ascertain whether reporter gene activation required other components of the PRC1.5-AUTS2 complex, we silenced RING1B or PCGF5 through siRNAs. Indeed, luciferase activity driven by GAL4-AUTS2 was reduced, relative to control siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1b, c</xref>). Similarly, <italic>AUTS2</italic> knockdown in GAL4-PCGF5 cells led to decreased luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Thus, PRC1.5-AUTS2 creates a chromatin environment favorable to transcription dependent upon the integrity of the complex.</p>

      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Mechanism of transcriptional activation</title>
        <p id="P10">PRC1 can monoubiquitinate histone H2A at lysine-119 (H2AK119) through its RING1B component. Interestingly, addition of the PRC1.5-AUTS2 component, CK2, to the recombinant ternary complex RING1B-PCGF5-AUTS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), compromised its ability to monoubiquitinate H2AK119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To rule out that CK2 may diminish requisite ATP levels, E1 was pre-charged with ubiquitin and then quenched by EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Inhibition of H2A monoubiquitination was still evident upon CK2 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Heat inactivation of CK2 obliterated its inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating that its kinase activity may be required. Indeed, a kinase assay performed with CK2 and components used in the H2A monoubiquitination assay in the presence of Î³-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP demonstrated that CK2 phosphorylated both RING1B and UbcH5c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). An additional radiolabeled species was detectable, dependent upon the presence of nucleosomes, suggesting that CK2 may target one of the core histones under these conditions. MS analysis revealed that CK2 phosphorylated Serines 41 (S41) and 168 (S168) of RING1B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). RING1B substitution mutants were generated, containing either aspartic acid (RING1B-SD) or glutamic acid (RING1B-SE) to mimic phosphorylation at S41 and S168, respectively, or alanine (RING1B-SA) to mimic non-phosphorylated forms. Compared to the appropriate alanine substitution, RING1B-S168E was significantly weaker in H2A monoubiquitination activity, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>), while RING1B-S41D was ineffectual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2e</xref>). Thus, CK2 inhibits PRC1.5-AUTS2 monoubiquitination of H2AK119 through phosphorylation of RING1B at S168.</p>
        <p id="P11">Although the presence of CK2 in PRC1.5-AUTS2 suppresses its H2A monoubiquitination activity, robust transcriptional activation likely entails an additional mechanism(s). Of note, the co-activator P300 that facilitates active transcription can associate with AUTS2 in a PRC1-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Co-IP experiments in 293T cells confirmed that AUTS2 and P300 interact and <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down experiments using recombinant AUTS2 and P300 demonstrated their direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Importantly, P300 was recruited to the promoter of the luciferase reporter upon GAL4-AUTS2 induction, as evidenced by ChIP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Moreover, RNAi-mediated silencing of P300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, insert) led to a dramatic loss in GAL4-AUTS2-mediated activation of the luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). A similar loss of activation was obtained upon treating the cells with C646 that specifically blocks P300 acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Based on results using GAL4 fusions with truncated versions of AUTS2 <italic>in vivo</italic>, AUTS2 amino acids 404 to 913 (GAL4-AUTS2M) was sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, this region overlaps a C-terminal portion of AUTS2 that correlates with more severe human phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. ChIP analysis revealed that truncated versions of GAL4-AUTS2 activate transcription dependent upon the ability to recruit P300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Thus, through its recruitment of CK2 and interaction with P300, AUTS2 is key to converting repressive PRC1 to a transcriptional activator.</p>

        <title>AUTS2 regulates CNS gene expression</title>
        <p id="P12">The tissue distribution of AUTS2 during development was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and validated AUTS2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). AUTS2 is highly expressed in the CNS of E15 mouse embryo, with its highest level being apparent in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). AUTS2 was detected in P30 adult mouse brain sections, especially in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, but at considerably lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Western blot analyses confirmed AUTS2 expression in the brain as a function of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>), consistent with reported AUTS2 mRNA levels<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Furthermore, AUTS2 is likely expressed primarily in neurons based on immunofluorescent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5e</xref>) and prior studies<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P13">We next performed ChIP followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine genomic localization of AUTS2 and RING1B, and the co-presence of various histone modifications and PolII using P1 mouse brain. AUTS2 was found predominantly in the Â±5 kb region surrounding transcriptional start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Several promoters were co-bound by AUTS2, Pol II, and histone modifications associated with active transcription, including histone H3 acteylated at lysine-27 (H3K27ac), and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, the gene bodies following these promoters were decorated with trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine-36 (H3K36me3), a modification linked with Pol II elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, H3K27me3 was not detected at these AUTS2 bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), consistent with the absence of detectable CBX protein in PRC1.5-AUTS2.

Approximately 50% of AUTS2-containing peaks comprise regions bound by H3K27ac, while only 9.0% were bound by H2AK119ub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), consistent with the intrinsic E3 ligase activity of RING1A/B being suppressed in PRC1.5-AUTS2, as shown <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Amongst the AUTS2 target genes identified, ~35.2% comprise the top 25% highly transcribed genes in mouse brain based on RPKM values obtained from our RNA-seq analysis in P1 mouse whole brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). In contrast, only 8.9% comprise the bottom 25% genes with the lowest RPKM values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). We next identified genes co-targeted by AUTS2 and RING1B, and those by BMI1 and RING1B as control. Out of 4168 AUTS2 target genes, 1488 were also bound by RING1B, while out of 1919 BMI1 target genes, 1137 were also bound by RING1B. The average expression of AUTS2 or AUTS2/RING1B target genes was significantly higher than those of BMI1 or BMI1/RING1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Of note, the overlap between AUTS2- and RING1B-targeted genes is relatively low, indicating that AUTS2 may be recruited to chromatin through PRC1-independent mechanism(s), perhaps involving other AUTS2 interacting candidates identified by our TAP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

While <italic>AUTS2</italic> disruptions affect one human allele, we characterized full homozygous knockout (KO) as well as heterozygous knockout of <italic>Auts2</italic> (HET) to better understand the <italic>Auts2</italic> phenotype, as well as gene dosage effects. In humans, ~80% of all <italic>AUTS2</italic> disruptions are associated with either low birth weight or small stature<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we observed both a striking visual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>) and quantitative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>) reduction in the size of the <italic>Auts2</italic> KO relative to wild type (WT) littermates, with HET showing an intermediate phenotype across early development.

We explored such developmental milestones in mice as a function of <italic>Auts2</italic> disruption using a pre-weanling behavioral battery including basic motor skills (e.g., righting reflex) and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) following maternal separation, often impaired in a variety of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorder<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Across early development, KO mice were deficient in both righting reflex and ultrasonic vocalizations emitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>), as well as in negative geotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>). While the KO showed a significantly smaller milk band at P1, early malnutrition or abnormal maternal behavior should not be fully responsible for all of the observed phenotypes, given that the HET showed phenotypes similar to the KO while having a milk band indistinguishable from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>). While it is difficult to directly infer human pathology from mouse phenotypes, these results strongly suggest that a gene dosage-dependent disruption of mouse <italic>Auts2</italic> resulted in impaired developmental phenotypes characteristic of <italic>AUTS2</italic> disruption in humans.</p>

      <p id="P19">Active promoters have been linked previously with the presence of PRC2 or PRC1<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, yet the heterogeneous compositions of these complexes hampered further investigations. Here, we identified AUTS2 as the transformative moiety that renders PRC1 capable of transcription stimulation, through its recruitment of CK2 and P300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These findings underscore that the natural variation in the constituents of PRC1 complexes can lead to PRC1 adopting unexpected roles in coordinating specific cellular gene expression profiles. Our findings may set a precedent for other dynamic alterations in the regulatory properties of PRC1 and perhaps PRC2, based on their constituent components.</p>
      <p id="P20">Despite a plethora of evidence from human genetics indicating that <italic>AUTS2</italic> disruption is associated with neurological disorders including ASD, AUTS2 function was unclear<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Our results provide the first causal evidence for <italic>Auts2</italic> disruption leading to specific behavioral phenotypes associated with the human condition. While the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying these developmental phenotypes are yet to be elucidated, AUTS2 association with active transcription and H3K4me3 point to its having a key role in regulating early transcriptional programs associated with normal brain development<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. AUTS2 is highly enriched in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and recent evidence suggests that the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me3 peaks fail to exhibit the normal developmental shift at a number of genes implicated in ASD pathology (e.g., PARK2, NLGN4Y, SHANK3), in the PFC of ASD patients<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, recent evidence provide a strong case for aberrant epigenetic regulation in the cerebellum of ASD patients<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. These findings combined with the enrichment of AUTS2 in cerebellar Purkinje cells and the PFC suggest that these brain regions may be involved in conferring the <italic>Auts2</italic> phenotype<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. The novel role of AUTS2 in modulating PRC1 activity to effectively purge its repressive function and exploit the complex to attain activated transcription will likely encourage alternate directions in addressing the challenges of ASD and related neurological diseases.</p>

Briefly, at postnatal day 3, pups were isolated from their mothers. Following isolation, pups were placed in a plastic container (7cm diameter) with fresh bedding contained in a sound attenuating styrofoam box. A condenser microphone (CM16/CMPA; Avisoft) descended ~15 cm above the pup through a hole in the top of the styrofoam box. Vocalizations were recorded with the Avisoft Recorder software (Version 4.2) using the UltraSoundGate 116Hb interface. Standard USV recording parameters were used<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Each recording session lasted 3 minutes. The room was maintained at 21 Â± 1Â°C during all procedures. Following generation of spectrograms, the number of USVs were counted by a trained experimenter blinded to experimental conditions with the Avisoft-SASLab Pro software.</p>

          <p id="P49">Generation of mice with <italic>Auts2</italic> conditional knockout in the nervous system and additional developmental phenotypes. <bold>a</bold> ES cells carrying an engineered allele of <italic>Auts2</italic> were generated through homologous recombination. Specifically, two LoxP sites were placed flanking exon 7 of <italic>Auts2</italic>. A cassette containing SA-IRES-tdTomato and an inverted PGK-Neo (neomycin phosphotransferase gene) were flanked by two FRT (FLP recombinase target) sites and inserted between the first LoxP site and exon 7. A WPRE (woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element) sequence was placed immediately downstream of tdTomato to enhance its expression. Homologous mice carrying this engineered sequence are expected to give rise to a transcript containing only the first six exons of <italic>Auts2</italic> followed by IRES-driven tdTomato. Red fluorescence serves as a marker for successful gene targeting. To obtain the conditional deletion of <italic>Auts2</italic>, these mice were crossed with FLIP mice to excise the FRT flanking sequence, resulting in floxed mice, which were then crossed with Nestin-Cre deleter mice to generate <italic>Auts2</italic> deletion in the nervous system. <bold>b</bold> Genotyping of the <italic>Auts2</italic> flox mice by PCR.
