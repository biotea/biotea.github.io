        <p id="P1">Metazoan development depends on accurate execution of differentiation programs that allow pluripotent stem cells to adopt specific fates <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Differentiation requires changes to chromatin architecture and transcriptional networks, yet whether other regulatory events support cell fate determination is less well understood. Here, we have identified the vertebrate-specific ubiquitin ligase CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> as an essential regulator of neural crest specification. CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralog TCOF1, whose mutation underlies the neurocristopathy Treacher Collins Syndrome <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Ubiquitylation drives formation of a TCOF1-NOLC1 platform that connects RNA polymerase I with ribosome modification enzymes and remodels the translational program of differentiating cells in favor of neural crest specification.

    <p id="P2">Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), the largest class of ubiquitylation enzymes, play critical roles in metazoan development <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. CRLs recognize their substrates through ~300 adaptor proteins, several of which are differentially expressed during development <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Although mutations in CRL adaptors have been linked to human pathology <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, little is known about how distinct CRLs ensure robust differentiation into specialized cell types.</p>
    <p id="P3">To discover CRLs with crucial roles in development, we employed genome-wide transcript analysis of differentiating human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). These experiments revealed a strong reduction in the abundance of the vertebrate-specific CUL3 adaptor KBTBD8 during hESC differentiation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1aâc</xref>), which we confirmed for KBTBD8 mRNA and protein by qRT-PCR and Western analysis (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1dâg</xref>). Consistent with evolutionary conservation, downregulation of KBTBD8 was observed in differentiating mouse ESCs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1h, i</xref>), as well as during <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> development <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Depletion of KBTBD8 did not affect the cell cycle, survival, or pluripotency programs of hESCs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2aâe</xref>). Instead, gene expression profiles of hESCs subjected to embryoid body-differentiation suggested that KBTBD8 was required for neural crest specification (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2f</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that loss of KBTBD8 reduced expression of neural crest markers, including FOXD3 and SOX10, which was accompanied by an increase in transcripts associated with central nervous system (CNS) precursor and forebrain identity (FOXG1, SIX3; <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Based on these observations, we subjected hESCs to dual-SMAD inhibition (âneural conversionâ), which directs differentiation towards CNS precursor and neural crest cells <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. As during embryoid body differentiation, depletion of KBTBD8 caused a striking loss of neural crest cells and an increase in CNS precursors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>), which was seen for multiple shRNAs and rescued by shRNA-resistant KBTBD8 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>). We corroborated these results with single-cell resolution using the neural crest marker SOX10 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) or AP2, p75, and HNK1, which are co-expressed in most neural crest cells (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). KBTBD8 was required for early neural crest specification, with CNS precursor markers accumulating in KBTBD8-depleted cells when neural crest markers were first detected in control experiments (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3bâh</xref>). KBTBD8 was accordingly critical for differentiation of hESC-derived neural crest cells into glia, mesenchymal cells, melanocytes, or chondrocytes (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Also in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis,</italic> downregulation or inhibition of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> prevented neural crest formation and caused an expansion of the CNS precursor territory in the manipulated part of the embryo (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> regulates a developmental switch that controls the generation of the neural crest, an embryonic cell population that is found only in vertebrates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To isolate essential targets of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>, we used CompPASS mass spectrometry to capture proteins that bound wild-type KBTBD8, but not variants with a mutant substrate-binding domain (KBTBD8<sup>W579A</sup>; <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5aâd</xref>). These interaction networks identified the paralogs NOLC1 and TCOF1 as predominant interactors of KBTBD8, which were not recognized by KBTBD8<sup>W579A</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Using Western analysis, we confirmed binding of TCOF1 and NOLC1 to KBTBD8, but not KBTBD8<sup>W579A</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), and showed that the same association occurred between endogenous proteins in hESCs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and in reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> systems (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. S5e, f</xref>). Denaturing purification of ubiquitin conjugates revealed that KBTBD8, but neither KBTBD8<sup>W579A</sup> nor CUL3-binding deficient KBTBD8<sup>Y74A</sup>, induced the robust monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2dâf</xref>). These events required a cofactor, Î²-arrestin, whose depletion prevented KBTBD8-recognition and monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5gâj</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Similar to loss of KBTBD8, hESCs expressing only KBTBD8<sup>W579A</sup> or KBTBD8<sup>Y74A</sup> failed to support neural crest specification and showed increased abundance of CNS precursors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Figure 6a, b</xref>). The same aberrant differentiation program was observed if we depleted TCOF1 or NOLC1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, c</xref>; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a, c, d</xref>), but not other KBTBD8-binding partners (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6e, f</xref>). Demonstrating that these proteins act in a common pathway, co-depletion of KBTBD8 and TCOF1 or NOLC1, respectively, mirrored the differentiation program of singly depleted hESCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). We therefore conclude that TCOF1 and NOLC1 are critical monoubiquitylation substrates of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> during neural crest specification. Consistent with this notion, mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> cause Treacher Collins Syndrome, a craniofacial disorder characterized by loss of cranial neural crest cells <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P8">To understand how CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> drives neural crest specification, we identified proteins that selectively recognized ubiquitylated, but not unmodified TCOF1, using cells that were reconstituted with either wt-KBTBD8, inactive KBTBD8<sup>Y74A</sup>, or empty vector. Strikingly, NOLC1 emerged as the major effector that was recruited to ubiquitylated TCOF1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), an observation that was confirmed by affinity-purification coupled to Western analysis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Monoubiquitylation often stabilizes binding partners, and indeed, depletion of KBTBD8 caused degradation of both TCOF1 and NOLC1 at later stages of neural conversion (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a, b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Based on these results, we established a sequential affinity purification protocol to determine the composition of ubiquitylation-dependent TCOF1/NOLC1-complexes. We found that TCOF1/NOLC1-assemblies engaged RNA polymerase I; the H/ACA complex catalyzing rRNA pseudouridylation; and the SSU processome controlling maturation and modification of the small ribosomal subunit (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, d</xref>; <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>). Accordingly, ubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> brought endogenous RNA polymerase I into complexes with the SSU processome (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), which required TCOF1 and NOLC1 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). Similar observations were made in hESCs, where a robust interaction between RNA polymerase I and SSU processome was lost upon depletion of KBTBD8 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> induces the ubiquitin-dependent formation of TCOF1/NOLC1-complexes that serve as a platform to connect RNA polymerase I with enzymes responsible for ribosomal processing and modification (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). This observation supports a role of ubiquitylation in neural crest specification, as mutations in RNA polymerase I also cause Treacher Collins Syndrome <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P10">Although KBTBD8 targets proteins linked to ribosome biogenesis, its depletion did not affect the abundance of rRNAs or mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins; levels of ribosomal proteins; processing of precursor rRNAs; nucleolar integrity; export of the small ribosomal subunit; ribosome binding to mRNA judged by polysome gradient analysis; global mRNA translation detected by metabolic labeling; or cell survival (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, d</xref>; <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8aâh</xref>). Accordingly, a global reduction in translation caused by rapamycin did not phenocopy the loss of KBTBD8 (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a, b</xref>). Depletion of TCOF1 also did not affect rRNA synthesis, p53 activation, or cell survival at the time of neural crest specification (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9câe</xref>), although consistent with previous work <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, it reduced rRNA levels and triggered cell death at late stages of neural conversion (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9f, g</xref>). These observations implied that KBTBD8 and TCOF1 initially specify neural crest fate without altering ribosome abundance, global mRNA translation, or cell survival.</p>
    <p id="P11">We therefore considered the possibility that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent assembly of a ribosome modification platform might produce ribosomes with distinct translational output. Indeed, as seen by RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, depletion of KBTBD8 changed the translational program of cells undergoing neural conversion, whereas it had no effect on protein synthesis in hESCs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>; <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). Similar observations were made for TCOF1, and the translation efficiency profiles of differentiating hESCs lacking KBTBD8 or TCOF1 were correlated (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. S10b</xref>). Loss of KBTBD8 caused changes in translation immediately after initiation of differentiation, and thus, prior to specification of hESCs into neural crest or CNS precursor cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">Analysis of regulated mRNAs showed that KBTBD8 suppressed the production of proteins specifying CNS precursors, whereas it did not affect translation of mRNAs connected to neural crest specification (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. S10c</xref>). In this manner, KBTBD8 or TCOF1 prevented the accumulation of CNS precursor proteins, including ATRX and PCM1, until neural crest specification had occurred (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). Underscoring the role of translational control, KBTBD8 enforced the correct timing of ATRX- and PCM1-production without regulating their mRNA levels or protein stability (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>; <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. S10dâf</xref>). The depletion of KBTBD8 also reduced the translation of mRNAs encoding histones or ribosomal components (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), yet as expected from their long half lives <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, the levels of the corresponding proteins were not diminished during our differentiation experiment (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Thus, the CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent formation of a ribosome modification platform alters translation of specific mRNAs, which delays accumulation of CNS precursor proteins until hESCs have accomplished neural crest specification.</p>
    <p id="P13">Our work, therefore, documents an important role for ubiquitylation in remodeling translational programs during differentiation and defines an early function for the CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrate and Treacher-Collins Syndrome protein TCOF1 in neural crest specification. We hypothesize that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> and TCOF1 may govern the production of differentially modified ribosomes, potentially including post-transcriptional changes in rRNA pseudouridylation and base methylation, or phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of ribosomal proteins or ribosome-associated factors. Such modifications may affect the interactions of ribosomes with select mRNAs, with factors that deliver specific mRNAs to the ribosome, or with proteins that control the synthesis or degradation of distinct mRNAs <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P14">Together with studies implying specific functions for ribosomal proteins during differentiation <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, developmental switches controlled by ribosomal regulation might explain why mutations in ribosome biogenesis factors result in tissue-specific ribosomopathies <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Manipulating such switches could lead to therapeutic strategies for pediatric diseases: as Treacher Collins Syndrome is caused by mutation of a single <italic>TCOF1</italic> allele, increasing the efficiency of KBTBD8-dependent ubiquitylation of the remaining wt-TCOF1 might reconstitute ribosomal regulation and neural crest formation.</p>
