      <abstract>
        <p>Recruitment of dynein motors to the nuclear surface is an essential step for nucleusâcentrosome coupling in prophase. In cultured human cells, this dynein pool is anchored to nuclear pore complexes through RanBP2âBicaudal D2 (BICD2) and Nup133â centromere protein F (CENP-F) networks. We previously reported that the <italic>asunder</italic> (<italic>asun</italic>) gene is required in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes for perinuclear dynein localization and nucleusâcentrosome coupling at G2/M of male meiosis. We show here that male germline expression of mammalian Asunder (ASUN) protein rescues <italic>asun</italic> flies, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of function. In cultured human cells, we find that ASUN down-regulation causes reduction of perinuclear dynein in prophase of mitosis. Additional defects after loss of ASUN include nucleusâcentrosome uncoupling, abnormal spindles, and multinucleation. Coimmunoprecipitation and overlapping localization patterns of ASUN and lissencephaly 1 (LIS1), a dynein adaptor, suggest that ASUN interacts with dynein in the cytoplasm via LIS1. Our data indicate that ASUN controls dynein localization via a mechanism distinct from that of either BICD2 or CENP-F. We present a model in which ASUN promotes perinuclear enrichment of dynein at G2/M that facilitates BICD2- and CENP-F-mediated anchoring of dynein to nuclear pore complexes.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein plays critical roles in many cellular processes by carrying out minus endâdirected transport along microÂ­tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994</xref>). Dynein is a multimeric complex composed of heavy, intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains. Each heavy chain contains six ATPase domains that power the motor. Noncatalytic subunits regulate dynein by linking the complex to its cargo and adaptor proteins. Dynein complexes approach 2 MDa in size, making dynein the largest of all known motor complexes. The composition of dynein complexes and the cellular events requiring these complexes have been defined, although a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which these complexes are regulated within cells is lacking.</p><p>Dynein complexes are subject to several modes of regulation, including phosphorylation, subunit composition, subcellular localization, and binding of accessory proteins. Dynactin, another large multimeric complex, was identified through in vitro studies as an activator of dynein; subsequent work suggested that dynein requires dynactin to perform its cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Schroer, 2004</xref>). A dynein adaptor protein, lissencephaly 1 (LIS1), binds directly to dynein heavy chains and is essential for multiple dynein functions, including coupling of centrosomes to the nucleus during neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Tanaka <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A dynein subpopulation stably anchored to the nuclear envelope (NE) at the G2/M transition is essential for proper nucleusâcentrosome coupling in multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Malone <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anderson <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Splinter <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bolhy <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Minus endâdirected movement of anchored dynein motors along astral microtubules has been hypothesized to draw centrosomes toward the nuclear surface to facilitate their attachment to the NE before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Burgess and Knight, 2004</xref>). This anchored pool of dynein has also been implicated in the process of NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Beaudouin <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Salina <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although promotion of nucleusâcentrosome coupling is a dynein-dependent function that is evolutionarily conserved, the exact molecular mechanisms appear to vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Salina <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Dynein is anchored to the nuclear surface via KASH and SUN domainâcontaining proteins in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryogenesis and during neuronal migration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Malone <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Zhang <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In a cultured mammalian cell line (HeLa), at least two distinct pathways are required to ensure proper execution of this critical event. These pathways both employ nuclear pore complex (NPC) interactions to anchor dynein motors to the nuclear surface. The first pathway uses RanBP2, a nucleoporin that associates with the cytoplasmic face of NPCs, as the docking site for Bicaudal D2 (BICD2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Splinter <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>). BICD2, directly bound to dynein, moves in a minus-end direction toward the nuclear surface just before the G2/M transition, thereby anchoring dynein at the NE. The second pathway uses another nucleoporin, Nup133, as a docking site for centromere protein F (CENP-F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bolhy <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Before G2/M, CENP-F directly binds dynein-bound NudE/EL; CENP-F then simultaneously binds Nup133 to anchor dynein, NudE/EL, and ultimately the centrosomes to the NE.</p><p>We previously identified <italic>asunder</italic> (<italic>asun</italic>; formerly known as <italic>Mat89Bb</italic>) as an essential regulator of dynein localization during <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anderson <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Spermatocytes of <italic>asun</italic> mutant testes arrest at prophase of meiosis I with centrosomes unattached to the nucleus. <italic>asun</italic> spermatocytes that progress beyond this arrest exhibit defects in meiotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. The severe loss of perinuclear dynein in <italic>asun</italic> spermatocytes is the likely basis for this constellation of defects. Our studies revealed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASUN (dASUN) plays a key role in recruiting dynein to the nuclear surface at G2/M, a critical step in establishing nucleusâcentrosome coupling and fidelity of meiotic divisions.</p><p>The human homologue of <italic>asun</italic> (also known as <italic>GCT1</italic> or <italic>C12ORF11</italic>) was originally identified in a screen for genes up-regulated in testicular seminomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bourdon <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Whereas expression of <italic>Drosophila asun</italic> is limited to male and female germline cells, transcripts of the mouse homologue were detected in both germlines and all somatic cells surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Stebbings <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bourdon <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). These findings suggested that Asunder (ASUN) might play a broader role in mammals.</p><p>To further investigate the mechanism by which ASUN regulates dynein, we examined the function of the human homologue of ASUN (hASUN) in this study. We find that, like BICD2 and CENP-F, hASUN is required in cultured cells for enrichment of dynein on the nuclear surface at the onset of mitosis. hASUN depletion leads to mitotic defects, which are likely secondary to failure of dynein localization. We present a model in which hASUN acts via a mechanism distinct from that of BICD2 and CENP-F to promote dynein recruitment to the nuclear surface at G2/M, a critical step to establishing nucleusâcentrosome coupling and fidelity of mitotic divisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Mammalian ASUN can functionally replace dASUN during spermatogenesis</title><p>The predicted hASUN and mouse ASUN (mASUN) proteins are 95% identical and 97% similar to each other; comparison of the predicted mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASUN proteins revealed that they are 43% identical and 64% similar. We sought to determine whether a mammalian form of ASUN could functionally replace dASUN in vivo. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system, we established transgenic lines expressing mCherry-tagged mASUN (CHY-mASUN) exclusively in the male germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that the presence of a single copy of the CHY-mASUN transgene significantly increased the percentage of <italic>asun<sup>f02815</sup></italic> males (hypomorphic allele) that produced adult progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anderson <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). We also observed a significant increase in the number of adult progeny produced per fertile male, albeit not to the level of wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We previously reported that germline expression of CHY-tagged dASUN fully rescued the sterility of <italic>asun</italic> males; the partial rescue obtained by germline expression of the mouse homologue might be due to the relatively low level of expression of this fusion protein in the fly testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anderson <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>mASUN partially rescues spermatogenesis defects of <italic>Drosophila asun</italic> mutants.

To test this hypothesis, we performed small interfering RNA (siRNA)âmediated knockdown of hASUN in HeLa cells. We confirmed that ASUN was efficiently depleted from cells by immunoblotting with antipeptide antibodies (M-hASUN antibody [Ab] and C-hASUN Ab) directed against distinct epitopes in the C-terminal region of hASUN (Supplemental Figure S1A). siRNA-treated cells were briefly incubated with nocodazole to enhance perinuclear localization of dyneinâdynactin complexes and accessory proteins before fixation and immunostaining for dynein intermediate chain (DIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Beswick <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hebbar <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Splinter <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bolhy <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). We found that â¼91% of NT-siRNA (nontargeting control) prophase cells showed strong perinuclear dynein staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, A and DâF</xref>). After hASUN knockdown, however, only â¼30% of cells exhibited this pattern; instead, the majority of prophase cells displayed diffuse localization of dynein in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, B and DâF</xref>). Using a second independent hASUN-siRNA sequence that efficiently depleted ASUN from cells, we observed a similar reduction in the percentage of prophase cells with perinuclear dynein (Supplemental Figure S1, BâD).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>hASUN is required for localization of dynein to the NE at mitotic entry.

We observed essentially identical tubulin staining patterns for NT-siRNA versus hASUN-siRNA cells in response to nocodazole treatment, suggesting that the lack of perinuclear dynein observed in hASUN-siRNA cells is not secondary to gross alterations of the microtubule network (Supplemental Figure S2).</p><p>To further confirm that loss of perinuclear dynein in hASUN-siRNA HeLa cells was due to depletion of endogenous hASUN, we performed a rescue experiment by transiently expressing CHY-tagged dASUN (refractory to hASUN siRNA).

BICD2âRanBP2 and NudE/ELâCENP-FâNup133 were identified as separate cassettes of proteins that provide sites to anchor dynein to the NE. We report here our findings that hASUN is a third protein required for this critical event in cultured cells. In contrast to the BICD2 and CENP-F cassettes, however, which can bind directly to components of dynein complexes, our data suggest that hASUN regulates the localization of dynein in an indirect manner via LIS1, an accessory protein of the motor. Another distinction is that BICD2 and CENP-F localize to NPCs within the NE, whereas hASUN localizes to the cytoplasm with exclusion of the NE.</p><p>We propose a model in which hASUN works in a manner distinct from that of BICD2 and CENP-F to mediate dynein recruitment to the NE at G2/M, a critical event required for nucleusâcentrosome coupling before NEBD and faithful execution of mitotic divisions. Our data lead us to hypothesize that cytoplasmic hASUN transiently interacts with LIS1, which is bound to dynein heavy chains, to promote the enrichment and/or proper orientation of dynein complexes in the vicinity of the nuclear surface at G2/M. The BICD2âRanBP2 and NudE/ELâCENP-FâNup133 cassettes then capture and stably anchor dynein complexes to NPCs. In the absence of hASUN, BICD2 and CENP-F are not sufficient to carry out the early steps in the process of dynein recruitment to the NE at G2/M; similarly, when either BICD2 or CENP-F is depleted from cells, hASUN can promote the enrichment/orientation of dynein complexes near the nuclear surface, but the complexes do not become stably anchored to the NE.</p><p>Why are so many factors required to carry out this important cellular process? A network of proteins might be required to move and properly orient dynein complexes at G2/M, given their large size and multisubunit composition. NudE, in addition to directly interacting with dynein motors, facilitates the interaction between LIS1 and dynein, suggesting that both ASUN and the NudE/ELâCENP-FâNup133 cassette might converge on dynein through LIS1 at the onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">McKenney <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2010</xref>). It will be interesting to test in future experiments whether ASUN plays a role in promoting the interaction between CENP-F tethered to the NE and cytoplasmic NudE/ELâLIS1âdynein complexes at G2/M, a possible mechanism of action that would be consistent with our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Meiotic versus mitotic roles of ASUN</title><p>Whereas ASUN remained largely uncharacterized in human cells before this study, we previously showed that it has cell cycle and developmental roles in other organisms.

Down-regulation of ASUN in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos via morpholino oligonucleotide injection resulted in disruption of gastrulation and polyploidy; the latter phenotype suggested that ASUN might regulate the mitotic cell cycles of early blastomeres during vertebrate embryogenesis. We also showed conservation of function between <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human ASUN homologues by restoring proper developmental progression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> ASUN morphants via coinjection of mRNA encoding hASUN.</p><p><italic>Drosophila asun</italic> mutants and HeLa cells depleted of ASUN exhibit strikingly similar disruptions of male meiosis and mitosis, respectively. These shared phenotypes underscore the likelihood that the transformed nature of the HeLa cell line is not responsible for the defects we observed. The reduction of dynein localized to the NE of prophase RPE cells after hASUN knockdown as reported here further validates this conclusion. One difference in the meiotic versus mitotic phenotypes is that <italic>asun</italic> spermatocytes exhibit delayed progression through meiosis, as evidenced by a large increase in the prophase fraction, whereas we report here that hASUN-siRNA HeLa cells have only a slightly increased mitotic index compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Anderson <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). We speculate that dynein localized to the nuclear surface might play a more important role in facilitating nuclear envelope breakdown at the end of prophase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes than in HeLa cells.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Drosophila asun</italic>, which is expressed exclusively in germline tissues, mouse <italic>ASUN</italic> transcripts have been detected in all tissues, both somatic and germline, surveyed in a study by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Stebbings <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bourdon <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The data we present here indicate that hASUN plays an important role in human somatic cells during mitosis. The human <italic>ASUN</italic> gene is located within a genomic region that is amplified in testicular seminomas, raising the possibility that ASUN may also regulate division of male germline cells in vertebrates as it does in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bourdon <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Why might ASUN expression be limited to germline cells in flies? The absence of dASUN expression within somatic cells may be related to the lack of an absolute requirement for centrosomes during most life cycle stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Centrioles, although important for the formation of centrosomes (as well as cilia and flagella), play nonessential roles in development from an embryo to an adult fly, with the exception of early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Basto <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Stevens <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The process of spermatogenesis in adult male flies is also exceptional in that centrioles are required to form the cilium of spermatocytes and the axoneme of spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bettencourt-Dias <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Centrioles within G2 spermatocytes undergo major changes in their positioning, moving to the cortex during the extensive growth phase to elaborate a cilium and then back toward the nucleus at G2/M; the necessity to reestablish nucleusâcentrosome coupling at the time of meiotic entry may impose a stringent requirement for dynein-localizing proteins such as ASUN in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fuller, 1993</xref>). Bicaudal, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of BICD2, is a potential candidate to cooperate with dASUN in dynein recruitment to the nuclear surface of G2 spermatocytes; our database searches, however, revealed no CENP-F homologues in flies.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolved mechanisms for dynein regulation in multicellular organisms</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein, most commonly studied for its roles in trafficking of organelles and directed cell movement, is also required in multicellular organisms for coordination of mitotic entry and exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dujardin <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Specifically, dynein promotes the coupling of centrosomes to the NE, has been hypothesized to assist in NEBD, and functions along the mitotic spindle to facilitate chromosome segregation at anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dujardin <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Tanenbaum <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In contrast, only one role for dynein has been identified in budding yeast: proper positioning of the spindle during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Stuchell-Brereton <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that none of the three proteins needed for localization of dynein to the NE of prophase HeLa cells (BICD2 and CENP-F as previously reported; hASUN as reported herein) have predicted homologues in either budding or fission yeast. The centrosome-like structure in yeast, known as the spindle pole body, is embedded into the nuclear surface throughout interphase and mitosis in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</xref>). Similarly, in fission yeast, the spindle pole body is tethered to the nuclear surface throughout interphase and will embed at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Lim <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In both cases, dynein is not required for the process of spindle pole bodyânucleus embedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Lim <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Thus metazoans appear to have evolved a finely tuned mechanism for regulating the localization of dynein complexes at the onset of mitosis, with at least three proteins required to execute the recruitment and docking of these motors to the NE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments</title><p>Flies were maintained at 25Â°C using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Greenspan, 2004</xref>). <italic>y w</italic> was obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) and used as the âwild-typeâ stock.

Formaldehyde fixation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Gunsalus <italic>etÂ al</italic>., 1995</xref>). Briefly, slides of squashed testes were snap-frozen, immersed in 4% formaldehyde (in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 7 min at â20Â°C after coverslip removal, and washed three times in PBS. Primary antibodies were used as follows: mouse anti-DHC (P1H4, 1:120; a gift from T.

To quantify the ratios of perinuclear to diffusely cytoplasmic dynein in late G2 spermatocytes (testes stained for DHC), after image acquisition, the average intensity of the DHC signal within a small rectangular region was sampled near the nuclear surface and in the surrounding cytoplasm using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA).
