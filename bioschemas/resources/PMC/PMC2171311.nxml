      <abstract>
        <p>Scribble (Scrib) is a conserved polarity protein required in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> for synaptic function, neuroblast differentiation, and epithelial polarization. It is also a tumor suppressor. In rodents, Scrib has been implicated in receptor recycling and planar polarity but not in apical/basal polarity. We now show that knockdown of Scrib disrupts adhesion between MadinâDarby canine kidney epithelial cells. As a consequence, the cells acquire a mesenchymal appearance, migrate more rapidly, and lose directionality. Although tight junction assembly is delayed, confluent monolayers remain polarized. These effects are independent of Rac activation or Scrib binding to Î²PIX. Rather, Scrib depletion disrupts E-cadherinâmediated cellâcell adhesion. The changes in morphology and migration are phenocopied by E-cadherin knockdown. Adhesion is partially rescued by expression of an E-cadherinâÎ±-catenin fusion protein but not by E-cadherinâgreen fluorescent protein. These results suggest that Scrib stabilizes the coupling between E-cadherin and the catenins and are consistent with the idea that mammalian Scrib could behave as a tumor suppressor by regulating epithelial cell adhesion and migration.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The development of epithelial sheets, which was one of the earliest steps in the evolution of the metazoa, is of fundamental importance in animal development (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Schock and Perrimon, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Zegers et al., 2003</xref>). Apical/basal polarization of epithelial cells is essential to their function, and the loss of polarity, as occurs during epithelialâmesenchymal transitions (EMTs), has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Thiery, 2003</xref>). Genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered several conserved proteins that are required for cell polarization in many different contexts (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kemphues, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tepass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Macara, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>One group of three such proteinsâScribble (Scrib), Discs large (Dlg), and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl)âidentified in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, also behave as tumor suppressors (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Woods and Bryant, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bilder, 2004</xref>), and mutations in any of the genes for these proteins cause overgrowth of embryonic tissue, particularly the imaginal disc and brain cells, forming large amorphous masses. Additionally, <italic>Scrib</italic>, <italic>Lgl</italic>, and <italic>Dlg</italic> mutants cooperate with oncogenic <italic>Ras</italic> in the transformation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> eye disc cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brumby and Richardson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pagliarini and Xu, 2003</xref>). Expression of activated Ras causes overproliferation, but the cells remain in the epithelial layer. However, in the context of a <italic>Scrib</italic> mutant, the Ras cells become metastatic. They degrade the basement membrane, migrate, and invade neighboring wild-type tissues. The key mechanism underlying this transition is the loss of E-cadherin, a transmembrane protein that forms the adherens junction between epithelial cells and is essential for apical/basal polarization. Forced coexpression of E-cadherin inhibits invasion (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pagliarini and Xu, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Scrib is required for maintenance of apical/basal polarity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>) but is also important in synaptic function (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2000</xref>) and in neuroblast asymmetric cell divisions (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Albertson and Doe, 2003</xref>). The molecular basis for loss of polarity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos lacking Scrib is not yet entirely understood. However, elegant genetic analyses revealed that in embryonic epithelial cells they are part of a complex network involving multiple polarity proteins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bilder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Tanentzapf and Tepass, 2003</xref>). The Par-3 polarity complex functions in the initial specification of the apical domain, and Scrib apparently helps specify the basolateral surface by repressing the activity of Par-3. The Crumbs polarity complex is recruited to the apical surface by Par-3 and somehow represses Scrib activity. Thus, the balance between these three groups of polarity proteins limits the extent of the apical and basolateral membranes, but the molecular mechanisms by which they do this are still unknown.</p>
      <p>The mammalian orthologue of Scrib has not yet been implicated in apical/basal polarization or as a tumor suppressor. Intriguingly, however, it is targeted for destruction by the E6 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus, the major cause of cervical cancer (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa and Huibregtse, 2000</xref>). Moreover, progression of uterine cervical carcinomas from precursor lesions to invasive cancers correlates with a dramatic decrease in Scrib expression (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa et al., 2004</xref>). Unexpectedly, murine Scrib appears to be involved in planar polarity because a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon in the protein causes a defect in the planar polarization of the inner ear epithelium (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Murdoch et al., 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, Scrib is widely expressed and associates with the lateral membranes in epithelial cells through a mechanism that appears to involve E-cadherin (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Navarro et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Scrib is a large multidomain protein that contains 16 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal leucine-rich repeats, four PSD-95, ZO-1, and Discs-large (PDZ) domains, and an uncharacterized COOH-terminal region (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Humbert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bilder, 2004</xref>). It belongs to a family of so-called LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PDZ) proteins, which includes Erbin and Densin-180, although it remains unclear whether any of these proteins possess related functions. Recently, mammalian Scrib was found to bind through its PDZ domains to the COOH terminus of Î²PIX, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Audebert et al., 2004</xref>). This interaction has been implicated in thyrotropin receptor endocytosis and recycling, but whether it is involved in cell polarity is not known (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lahuna et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> it is unlikely that a homologous interaction is important because the PDZ domains of Scrib are dispensable for epithelial polarization and for control of cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Albertson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Zeitler et al., 2004</xref>). Other binding partners for mammalian Scrib have been reported recently, but their physiological significance remains unclear (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Metais et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Petit et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Given the paucity of data on the functions of mammalian Scrib and the potential importance of the protein in embryonic development and tumor progression, we investigated the role of Scrib in MDCK epithelial cells by RNA interference (RNAi). Cells lacking Scrib appear relatively normal at high density, when they have formed polarized monolayers, but they exhibit profound defects at lower cell densities. The cells appear to undergo a morphological EMT, migrate more rapidly, and lose directionality during migration. A substantial loss of cellâcell adhesion occurs as a result of reduced E-cadherin activity. Therefore, mammalian Scrib plays a key role in regulating E-cadherin activity, and its loss is predicted to enhance tumor migration and invasion.</p>

        <title>Gene silencing of Scrib in MDCK cells</title>
        <p>Several target sequences were selected from the partial canine <italic>Scrib</italic> gene and used to construct pSUPER vectors for the expression of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Of the three sequences tested, two efficiently knocked down Scrib expression when expressed by transient transfection in MDCK II cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed Scrib to be associated with the lateral membranes in mammalian epithelial cells, and staining was substantially reduced by transfection with the ScrbKD1 or 2 vectors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Surprisingly, however, the tight junctions appeared to be intact in these cells, as assessed by occludin staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) or ZO-1 staining (not depicted). Moreover, confocal sections of cells stained for the apical marker gp135 revealed no loss of apical/basal polarization in cells expressing reduced Scrib levels (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200506094/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200506094/DC1</ext-link>), and cysts grown in Matrigel appeared to be polarized normally (not depicted). These results suggest that depletion of Scrib does not disrupt tight junction assembly. However, when the transfected cells were subjected to a calcium switch and stained for ZO-1, a short delay in junction assembly was observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). ZO-1 accumulated rapidly at the cellâcell contacts in both the control and Scrib knockdown (KD) cells but, in the absence of Scrib, the fusion of the ZO-1 lines into a continuous band encircling each cell was delayed. The defect was particularly noticeable at vertices where several cell boundaries meet. By 20 h after calcium switch, however, the ZO-1 staining in the cells lacking Scrib was indistinguishable from that in the control cells.</p>

        <title>Scrib is required for maintenance of an epithelial phenotype at low cell densities</title>
        <p>When cells were transfected with pS-ScrbKD vectors and plated at low densities, they consistently displayed a mesenchymal phenotype. Normal MDCK cells organize into discrete, tight islands with smooth boundaries, but cells lacking Scrib appeared more fibroblastic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). They spread over a much larger surface area (approximately three to five times larger; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C), and the edges of the cell clusters were disorganized as though the cells were moving apart from one another. When stained with phalloidin, the normal cortical actin rings were absent in cells lacking SCRIB and were replaced by stress fibers often oriented along the long axis of the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). These observations suggested that Scrib might regulate epithelial cell adhesion and/or migration.</p>

        <title>Scrib inhibits cell motility and is required for oriented migration</title>
        <p>To determine whether Scrib regulates MDCK cell motility, transfected cells were plated onto 8-Î¼m filters in Boyden chambers and incubated in normal medium containing 10% serum (both above and below the filter). The same number of cells was plated onto each filter. After 16â20 h, cells that had migrated through the pores to the bottom surface of the filters were stained with crystal violet. Loss of Scrib substantially increased the number of cells that had migrated through the filter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Importantly, when we expressed a GFP fusion of a human Scrib in the cells transfected with the pS-ScrbKD1 vector, the number of cells migrating through the filter was reduced to control levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). It was conceivable that the reversion to a wild-type phenotype was caused by reexpression of the endogenous protein. To test for this possibility, we blotted cell lysates for Scrib (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). The endogenous Scrib protein level was reduced upon expression of the ScrbKD1 shRNA and did not respond to coexpression of the human GFPâScrib fusion. The GFPâScrib fusion can be distinguished by its lower mobility on SDS-PAGE and was expressed at approximately two to three times the level of the endogenous protein in control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). These data prove that the effects of Scrib RNAi on motility are indeed caused by loss of the Scrib protein rather than by off-target effects of the shRNA.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The filter assay depends not only on cell motility but also on the rate of cell attachment to and spreading on the filter surface. Therefore, as an alternative approach to measuring cell motility, we performed wounding assays on MDCK monolayers and tracked the movement of individual cells within the population at the wound edge by time-lapse microscopy. The overall rate of wound closure was similar for both the control cells and those lacking Scrib (0.35 vs. 0.32 Î¼m/min). However, the behavior of cells lacking Scrib was remarkably different from that of the control (Videos 1 and 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200506094/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200506094/DC1</ext-link>). At the edges of the wound, control cells extruded lamellipodia and moved forward as an organized sheet, but the KD cells were less organized. Some of the KD cells lost their attachment to the sheet, pulled away from the leading edge, and moved in random directions. This difference can be seen in the Rose plots of cells tracked over the period of the assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D). Calculation of directionality parameters confirmed that the cells lacking Scrib move at a significantly higher speed than control cells (2.54 Â± 0.19 vs. 1.73 Â± 0.41 Î¼m/min; P = 0.026) and with a lower persistence coefficient (4.3 vs. 11.6 min; P = 0.02). The reduced persistence accounts for the similarity in the overall rate of wound closure. Interestingly, cells further back from the wound exhibited a continual jiggling motion, as if they had lost adhesion to their neighbors and were trying to move away from one another, and transient gaps appeared in the monolayer (Video 2). These results support the data shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, suggesting that loss of Scrib causes a defect in cellâcell adhesion.</p>

        <title>Scrib effects are not mediated by Î²PIX binding</title>
        <p>Cell movement is regulated by Rac, and this GTPase has also been implicated in controlling adhesion between epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ehrlich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van Aelst and Symons, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, Scrib has been reported to bind, via its PDZ domains, to the COOH terminus of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Î²PIX (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Audebert et al., 2004</xref>). To determine whether the SCRIBâÎ²PIX interaction is important in mediating the regulation of cell migration and adhesion, we first confirmed that in MDCK cells we could detect this interaction (unpublished data) and then assessed the role of Î²PIX by silencing expression of the canine protein in MDCK cells.</p>
        <p>Of four pSUPER constructs tested, three efficiently suppressed Î²PIX expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). In particular, the PixKD1 shRNA reduced expression of the protein by &gt;90%. However, loss of Î²PIX had no detectable effect on cell migration as measured using the Boyden chamber assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Moreover, in our hands, overexpression of Î²PIX did not increase cell migration in the filter assay (unpublished data). We then performed double KD experiments in which the expression of both Scrib and Î²PIX was suppressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). We reasoned that one function of Scrib might be to sequester and inactivate Î²PIX. In this case, loss of Scrib would release the Î²PIX, leading to inappropriate activation of Rac and increased migration. If this hypothesis were correct, a double KD would reverse the migration phenotype by removing the excess free Î²PIX from the cell. As depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (A and B), migration through filters was increased by Scrib KD. However, the coordinate loss of Î²PIX did not significantly perturb this effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Note that cotransfection of the PixKD shRNA did not interfere with gene silencing of Scrib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). We therefore conclude that Scrib function in cell adhesion and migration is independent of Î²PIX binding.</p>

        <p>Because Î²PIX is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, we also asked whether loss of Scrib would alter Rac activity. Rac-GTP was detected by pull-down assays using a GST fusion of the Rac binding domain of PAK. No consistent differences in Rac-GTP were detected, however, in control cells versus those lacking Scrib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). When the cells were subjected to a calcium switch, Rac was activated within 2 h of calcium addition in both the control and Scrib KD cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). We therefore conclude that the polarity defects associated with suppression of Scrib expression are independent of Î²PIX and are not mediated through the Rac GTPase. Finally, we asked whether Scrib might regulate the extracellular signalâregulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is activated by scatter factor (hepatocyte growth factor [HGF]; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tanimura et al., 1998</xref>). HGF induces an EMT in which cells lose adhesiveness and become more migratory, a phenotype similar to that observed in cells lacking SCRIB. However, no significant differences in phospho-ERK were detected when Scrib expression was knocked down either before or after addition of HGF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). These data suggest that Scrib does not function to regulate the HGF signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>Scrib is required for E-cadherinâmediated adhesion</title>
        <p>To determine whether cellâcell adhesion is compromised in the absence of Scrib, we first used an aggregation assay. Cells were trypsinized, triturated to break up clumps into individual cells, resuspended in fresh medium in a hanging drop beneath the lid of a tissue culture plate, and incubated for 18â20 h. Cell aggregation was then assessed microscopically. A dramatic loss of aggregation was apparent in cells expressing either pS-ScrbKD1 or 2 vectors, as compared with the control cells that were transfected with pS-Luc (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and C</xref>). This effect was not a result of differential loss of E-cadherin in the cell suspensions as assessed by immunoblotting lysates from the suspended cell cultures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Importantly, coexpression of human GFP-Scrib reversed the adhesion defect caused by the loss of endogenous SCRIB, proving that the effect of the shRNAs on adhesion is specifically mediated through destruction of the Scrib mRNA rather than through off-target effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and C</xref>). We also tested for a possible role for Î²PIX on aggregation, using an shRNA directed against the canine gene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). However, loss of Î²PIX from the cells had no effect on the aggregation of control cells and did not reverse the loss of aggregation observed in the absence of Scrib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D).</p>

        <p>To determine whether the aggregation defect is mediated through E-cadherin or some other cell adhesion protein, we assayed the ability of the MDCK cells to attach to a surface coated with the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. Cells were disassociated using an EGTA solution (with no trypsin), centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium, and added to 96-well plates coated with the ectodomain of E-cadherin. After 60 min, the plates were washed and remaining attached cells were counted. Results are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. Almost no cells attached to the plates in the absence of the E-cadherin ectodomain, demonstrating that during the 60-min incubation period integrin-mediated attachment is negligible. Control cells attached efficiently, and attachment was proportional to the amount of E-cadherin ectodomain on the plate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). Importantly, loss of Scrib caused a substantial drop (approximately threefold) in cell attachment, demonstrating that E-cadherin homophilic adhesion is compromised in the absence of Scrib. Addition of an arginineâglycineâaspartic acid peptide to block integrin-mediated adhesion had no significant effect (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Depletion of Scrib causes a defect in cellâcell adhesive junctions</title>
        <p>These data suggest that Scrib is required for normal E-cadherin function at cellâcell junctions. We therefore examined the distribution of E-cadherin and of the Na/K-ATPase, which is a marker for the basolateral membrane. In control cells, these proteins colocalize along the lateral cell boundaries. Scrib KD caused a distinctive phenotype in which the lateral membranes of the cells became disorganized. The membranes appeared less vertical and had convoluted edges (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). A similar phenotype was observed for Î²-catenin distribution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). However, the total amounts of E-cadherin, Î²-catenin, and Î±-catenin expressed in cells depleted of Scrib were the same as the amounts in control cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). Scrib does not, therefore, regulate the expression of these junctional proteins. Moreover, when surface proteins were biotinylated, captured on streptavidin beads, and blotted for E-cadherin, no reproducible difference was observed between the control and Scrib KD cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). These data demonstrate that there is no change in the amount of E-cadherin on the cell surface, and we conclude that Scrib is not involved in controlling the exocytosis or endocytosis of E-cadherin.</p>

Together, these results suggest that Scrib is required for the normal stabilization of Î±- and Î²-catenin at the cell cortex.</p>

        <title>Depletion of E-cadherin phenocopies the effects of Scrib KD</title>
        <p>If both the adhesion defect and the increased motility observed in response to Scrib silencing are caused by decreased E-cadherin activity, one would predict that depletion of E-cadherin would produce the same phenotype. We therefore expressed a shRNA targeted against the canine E-cadherin in MDCK cells and achieved a &gt;50% reduction in E-cadherin expression (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A). Interestingly, cells depleted of E-cadherin migrated through filters significantly faster than the control (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B). Moreover, these cells were larger and more fibroblastic in appearance than control cells when plated at low densities (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C), just as observed for the Scrib KD cells. Based on these data, we conclude that both the morphological changes and increased motility in cells depleted of Scrib can be ascribed to a failure of the E-cadherin to form normal trans-adhesive interactions.</p>

        <title>An E-cadherinâÎ±-catenin fusion protein can reverse the effects of silencing Scrib expression</title>
        <p>To determine the locus of action of Scrib, we attempted to reverse the effects of Scrib depletion by the ectopic expression either of a cadherinâGFP fusion (EcadâGFP) or of a cadherinâÎ±-catenin fusion protein (EcadâÎ±cat). This latter construct lacks Î²-catenin binding sites but can connect to the actin cytoskeleton through the COOH-terminal domain of the Î±-catenin and can promote homophilic adhesion (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nagafuchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>). The EcadâGFP has been shown previously to be fully functional (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Both constructs were expressed only at very low levels compared with the level of endogenous E-cadherin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> D). Nonetheless, the EcadâÎ±cat fusion was partially able to reverse the increase in migratory behavior of the cells depleted of Scrib (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> E). Importantly, however, a similar level of EcadâGFP was unable to reduce migration of these cells. Next, using an aggregation assay, we asked whether the fusion proteins could also reverse the adhesion defect in the Scrib KD cells. Again, the EcadâÎ±cat provided a partial restoration of cellâcell adhesion, whereas the EcadâGFP fusion did not (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, F and G</xref>). The EcadâÎ±cat fusion did not appear to increase aggregation of control cells, although a small effect would not have been detectable in this assay. Therefore, the forced, constitutive linkage of E-cadherin to Î±-catenin can restore normal adhesive and migratory behavior on cells in which Scrib expression has been reduced, suggesting that Scrib acts to modulate this linkage.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Polarization is a fundamental aspect of metazoan development, and a core set of proteins is required for the polarization of cells in many different developmental contexts (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Macara, 2004</xref>). These proteins appear to execute conserved functions during polarization, but they also possess tissue- and organism-specific functions. For example, the Par-3 polarity protein interacts with Par-6 in worms, flies, and vertebrates, but its association with the Rac exchange factor Tiam1 might be vertebrate specific (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Macara, 2005</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Scrib is a tumor suppressor that is essential for apical/basal polarization of epithelial cells and neuroblasts, but in mice it has been implicated in planar polarity of the inner ear epithelium and has not so far been linked to epithelial cell or neuroblast apical/basal differentiation or to neoplastic transformation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Humbert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bilder, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>We have now found that mammalian Scrib is a key regulator of E-cadherin adhesive activity in MDCK epithelial cells. E-cadherin is an essential component of the adherens junction and is required both for adhesive contacts between epithelial cells and, in vertebrates, for the assembly of tight junctions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gumbiner, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Initial interactions between E-cadherin on adjacent cells form rapidly and are independent both of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2004</xref>). Over time, however, the adhesive force between cells increases as the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin clusters and attaches to the actin cytoskeleton via Î±- and Î²-catenin (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>E-cadherin also possesses the characteristics of a tumor suppressor. For example, it is down-regulated in many carcinomas, heterozygosity in the <italic>E-cadherin</italic> gene increases the risk for diffuse gastric cancer, and mutations in <italic>E-cadherin</italic> are present in many types of epithelial cancer (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cavallaro and Christofori, 2004</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, mutation of <italic>Scrib</italic> in the context of Ras-transformed eye disc cells suppresses E-cadherin expression, which induces invasion of the basement membrane and metastasis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brumby and Richardson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pagliarini and Xu, 2003</xref>). We found that KD of E-cadherin in MDCK cells phenocopied the effects of Scrib KD on migration and adhesion, confirming that Scrib acts on E-cadherin function and that the changes in migratory behavior and cellâcell adhesion are causally related to one another. However, unlike in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, reduction of Scrib levels in MDCK cells had no effect on E-cadherin expression, and it did not alter either delivery to the plasma membrane or endocytosis because the surface expression of the protein was unchanged after Scrib depletion. But the amounts of detergent-insoluble Î±- and Î²-catenin were increased, suggesting that Scrib acts downstream of E-cadherin.</p>
      <p>How does Scrib operate? We were unable to detect any association of Scrib with E-cadherin, Î±-catenin, or Î²-catenin by coimmunoprecipitations (unpublished data), suggesting that the mechanism does not involve direct binding. Rac and Cdc42 are activated during the formation of cellâcell adhesions through E-cadherin, and expression of dominant-interfering Rac and Cdc42 mutants can block this formation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we initially assumed that Scrib might act by promoting the activation of Rac through association with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Î²PIX. However, suppression of Scrib expression did not detectably alter E-cadherin trafficking, and its role in cellâcell adhesion and migration appears to be independent of Î²PIX expression. Moreover, although Rac has been shown to be important in epithelial cellâcell adhesion (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hordijk et al., 1997</xref>), Rac activity was not altered by suppression of Scrib expression. These data therefore identify a new, Î²PIX-independent function for Scrib in mammalian epithelial cells.</p>
      <p>To identify the step at which Scrib acts, we tested the effects of a fusion between E-cadherin and Î±-catenin, which cannot bind to Î²-catenin. Remarkably, even very low amounts of this construct could partially rescue aggregation and reduce migration of Scrib KD cells, whereas expression of an EcadâGFP fusion had no effect. Therefore, we propose that the lesion in the Scrib KD cells is confined to the coupling between the cadherin and Î±-catenin. The data also suggest that the coupling of E-cadherin to Î±-catenin is normally dynamic and that Scrib is required to stabilize the linkage so as to permit adhesive junctions to form. The covalent attachment of E-cadherin to Î±-catenin would eliminate the need for this stabilization, thus permitting adhesions to form even when Scrib levels are reduced. If Scrib acted at another point, for instance to stabilize the coupling of Î±-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton, one would not expect the expression of an EcadâÎ±cat fusion to reverse the effects of Scrib depletion. We speculate that Scrib reduces the mobility of the catenins so as to encourage the formation of connections to the actin cytoskeleton, which in turn will reduce the lateral mobility of E-cadherin in the plasma membrane and facilitate clustering at nascent junctions.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that Scrib might possess other functions in mammalian epithelial polarization that were not revealed by partial silencing of its expression in MDCK cells. For example, it is unclear at present whether the minor defect in tight junction assembly would be exaggerated in a Scrib knockout. However, we note that shRNA-mediated reduction of ZO-1 expression by 80â90% in MDCK cells (unpublished data) closely phenocopies a ZO-1 knockout, suggesting that in some cases at least the principal biological functions of proteins are uncovered even by incomplete gene silencing. Future studies will focus on the nature of the link between Scrib and the cadherinâcatenin complex and on the mechanism by which the dynamics of the complex regulate adhesiveness.</p>

Lannigan, University of Virginia, Charlotteseville, VA); and 1 Î¼g/ml anti-myc 9E10 and anti-HA 12CA5. HRP-conjugated goat antiâmouse, mouse antiâgoat, or goat antiârabbit secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5,000â1:10,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For Odyssey detection, Alexa Fluor 680âconjugated goat antiâmouse, mouse antiâgoat (Invitrogen), or IRDye 800âconjugated goat antiârabbit (Rockland, Inc.) secondary antibodies were used. For immunofluorescence, cells were usually fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h before incubation with antibodies. For detection of Na/K-ATPase, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) at â20Â°C for 10 min. Primary antibodies were anti-Scrib (1:100) or antiâZO-1 (1:500), anti-occludin (1:500; Zymed Laboratories), antiâÎ²-catenin, antiâE-cadherin (1:500), and antiâNa/K-ATPase (1:250; Abcam). Anti-gp35 (1:300) was a gift from G. Ojakian (State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY). Alexa Fluorâconjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at a dilution of 1:1:500â1:1,000. Alexa 594âconjugated phalloidin was used at a dilution of 1:50. Cells were mounted in Slowfade (Invitrogen).</p>

        <title>Imaging</title>
        <p>Epifluorescence images were collected using an inverted microscope (T200; Nikon) with a 60Ã water-immersion lens (Plan Achromatic, NA 1.2) coupled to a charge-coupled device camera (Orca; Hamamatsu), controlled by Openlab 4.0 software (Improvision). Images were collected at 12-bit depth, 1,024 Ã 1,280 pixels resolution, and converted to TIFF files. Images were postprocessed in Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe) to increase the grayscale range and to reduce haze using an unsharp mask and were converted to 8-bit depth. In some cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C), the black and white values were inverted, and the contrast was further enhanced to emphasize cell junctions. Movies were converted to QuickTime format. Confocal imaging was performed using a microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a 100Ã oil-immersion objective (Plan Achromatic, NA 1.3).</p>

        <title>Triton X-100 solubility</title>
        <p>The Triton X-100 solubility assay was performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tsukamoto and Nigam, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>). After transfection, 1.2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated on 6-well plates. Cells were lysed after 3 d in 100 Î¼l CSK-A buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants and pellets were boiled with sample buffer, and equal volumes were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting and quantified with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.</p>

        <title>Cell surface biotinylation</title>
        <p>Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Le et al., 1999</xref>). MDCK cells were grown on filters and incubated with 1.0 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido) ethyl-dithioproprionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) (Pierce Chemical Co.) on both sides of the filter for 1 h. Cells were then washed with quenching reagent (50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in PBS containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 10 min, followed by further washes in PBS. Cells were then scraped off the filters and lysed in RIPA buffer, and cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin beads (Pierce Chemical Co.) to collect biotinylated proteins. Biotinylated E-cadherin was detected by immunoblot.</p>

        <title>Aggregation assay</title>
        <p>The hanging drop aggregation assay was performed essentially as described previously (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Thoreson et al., 2000</xref>). Cells were trypsinized in the presence of EDTA, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended at 10<sup>6</sup> cells per milliliter in normal growth medium. 3 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells were then suspended as hanging drops from the lid of a 24-well culture dish and allowed to aggregate overnight. The cells were subjected to shear force by passage 10 times through a 200-Î¼l filter pipet tip (Continental Laboratory). Cells were then imaged using a 10Ã phase-contrast objective. For quantification, in each field, the degree of aggregation was measured as the ratio of the area of the aggregates to the number of individual nonaggregated cells using Openlab software (Improvision).</p>

        <title>E-cadherin binding assay</title>
        <p>The E-cadherin binding assay was a modified version of one described previously (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 1998</xref>). Wells in a 96-well ELISA high-binding plate (Corning) were coated with 0â50 Î¼g/ml of E-cadherin extracellular domainâFc fusion protein (provided by B. Gumbiner, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) in coating buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.2) overnight at 4Â°C. Wells were then blocked with 3% BSA for 2 h, followed by three washes in HBSS+ (containing 1.2 mM Ca; Invitrogen). MDCK cells were dispersed using a cell disassociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37Â°C for 30 min and washed twice with normal medium. Cells were then resuspended in HBSS+ with 1 mM additional Ca. About 10<sup>5</sup> cells were added to wells in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml GRGDTP peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) and allowed to incubate for 60 min. After gentle washing with HBSS+, cells bound to plates were imaged. The number of cells in unwashed wells was counted, and data are presented as the percentage of cells remaining in each washed well, compared with the unwashed control.</p>

        <title>Boyden chamber cell migration and wound-healing assays</title>
        <p>Modified Boyden chamber assays were performed essentially as described previously (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sander et al., 1998</xref>). Approximately 10<sup>5</sup> cells in DME with 10% serum were seeded in the upper compartment of cell cultureâtreated Transwell filters (6.5-mm diam and 8-Î¼m pores; Corning). The lower compartment contained DME with 10% serum. After 16â20 h at 37Â°C, nonmigrating cells in the top chamber were removed with a cotton swab and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.4% crystal violet. For quantification, crystal violet was eluted with 10% acetic acid and the absorbance at 595 nm of eluant was measured. To normalize for variability in cell numbers, an identical volume of cells was seeded into another well, fixed, stained, and eluted, without the cells from the upper well being removed.</p>
        <p>For the wounding assay, confluent monolayers grown on Delta T dishes (Fisher Scientific) in DME + 10% serum + 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, were scraped with the tip of a microinjection pipette to form a linear wound. After 4 h of recovery, wound closure was recorded using a phase-contrast 20Ã objective lens at 5-min intervals for 16 h at 37Â°C. Individual cells were tracked over the course of the movie using Openlab software, transposed to the same initial x,y coordinates (0,0), and displayed as Rose plots. The mean square displacement, <italic>d</italic>
<sup>2</sup>(<italic>t</italic>), was calculated for each cell. Migration parameters were then estimated, assuming the cells migrate as persistent random walkers: <italic>d</italic>
<sup>2</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) = 2<italic>S</italic>

<italic>P</italic>[<italic>t</italic> â <italic>P</italic>(1 â e<sup>â</sup>
