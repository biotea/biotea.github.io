      <abstract>
        <p>Ciliopathies are genetic disorders arising from dysfunction of microtubule-based cellular appendages called cilia. Different cilia types possess distinct stereotypic microtubule doublet arrangements with non-motile or âprimaryâ cilia having a 9+0 and motile cilia have a 9+2 array of microtubule doublets. Primary cilia are critical sensory and signaling centers needed for normal mammalian development. Defects in their structure/function result in a spectrum of clinical and developmental pathologies including abnormal neural tube and limb patterning. Altered patterning phenotypes in the limb and neural tube are due to perturbations in the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Motile cilia are important in fluid movement and defects in motility result in chronic respiratory infections, altered left-right asymmetry, and infertility. These features are the hallmarks of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD, OMIM 244400). While mutations in several genes are associated with PCD in patients and animal models, the genetic lesion in many cases is unknown. We assessed the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of Growth Arrest Specific 8 (GAS8). GAS8 shares strong sequence similarity with the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> Nexin-Dynein Regulatory Complex (NDRC) protein 4 (DRC4) where it is needed for proper flagella motility. In mammalian cells, the GAS8 protein localizes not only to the microtubule axoneme of motile cilia, but also to the base of non-motile cilia. Gas8 was recently implicated in the Hh signaling pathway as a regulator of Smoothened trafficking into the cilium. Here, we generate the first mouse with a Gas8 mutation and show that it causes severe PCD phenotypes; however, there were no overt Hh pathway phenotypes. In addition, we identified two human patients with missense variants in Gas8. Rescue experiments in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> revealed a subtle defect in swim velocity compared to controls. Further experiments using CRISPR/Cas9 homology driven repair (HDR) to generate one of these human missense variants in mice demonstrated that this allele is likely pathogenic.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Growth-Arrest Specific 8 (Gas8) is implicated in dual roles at both the primary cilium to regulate hedgehog signaling and in motile cilia to coordinate cilia movement. To investigate these roles <italic>in vivo</italic>, we created a Gas8 genetrap mutant mouse. Though no overt primary cilia phenotypes were evident in the Gas8 genetrap mutant mice, there were severe motility defects and the mice presented with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) like symptoms including <italic>situs inversus</italic> and hydrocephalus. We also identified two potential disease causing <italic>GAS8</italic> missense variants (A391V and E199K) in humans. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 we generated a mouse to mimic the A391V allele. When we crossed the Gas8<sup>AV</sup> mutants with the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant, the compound Gas8<sup>GT/AV</sup> heterozygous animals developed mild hydrocephalus. Rescue experiments using <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> with mutations in the Gas8 homolog revealed only a modest decrease in swim velocity raising the possibility that the E199K allele is not pathogenic.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Primary cilia are solitary and immotile cellular appendages that serve as signaling hubs for pathways such as Hedgehog (Hh) during development [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Motile cilia initiate and maintain fluid flow and are critical in the brain for cerebral spinal fluid flow and are necessary for mucus transport in the lungs [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During development, motile cilia are responsible for initiating flow at the embryonic node which is critical for setting up left-right asymmetry in the mammalian body [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>While all cilia have common core components such as tubulin and intraflagellar transport proteins, motile cilia possess several accessory structures such as inner dynein arms (IDAs), outer dynein arms (ODAs), radial spokes, and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC). In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, data indicate that the N-DRC functions to link the A microtubule of one doublet with the B microtubule of the adjacent doublet. It coordinates the activities of the outer and inner dynein arms to regulate flagellar beat frequency and waveform [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Studies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> have led to the identification of several N-DRC proteins many of which appear to be conserved in mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, mutations in putative mammalian N-DRC proteins CCDC164 (DRC1), CCDC65 (DRC2), and most recently, GAS8 (DRC4) are correlated with defects in ciliary motility [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>The human homolog of Gas8 was originally identified in human breast cancer and referred to as Growth Arrest Specific 11 (<italic>GAS11</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This gene shares 56% protein identity to an N-DRC component in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> known as DRC4, the protein product of the paralyzed flagella 2 (<italic>PF2</italic>) gene [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Loss of <italic>PF2</italic> (DRC4) in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> leads to loss of IDAs and the majority of the N-DRC (N-DRC proteins DRC3-7) visible by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and results in a slower forward swimming velocity and defective waveform [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The function of Gas8 in the mammalian N-DRC remains poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Gas8 localizes to the axoneme of motile cilia and also to the base of primary cilia in vertebrate cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This led us to question if Gas8 serves as an N-DRC component in motile cilia and whether it has a separate role in non-motile primary cilia. This possibility is supported by data from knockdown studies of Gas8 in NIH3T3 cells showing defects in Hh pathway responses. Expression of truncated versions of Gas8, after knockdown of endogenous Gas8, revealed that the C-terminal region of Gas8 bound to and facilitated the transport of Smoothened into the cilium in response to Hh pathway activation using the Smoothened agonist (SAG) [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In mammals, cilia are essential for normal regulation of Hh signaling activity with many of the Hh signaling components such as Smoothened, Patched and Gli transcription factors dynamically localizing in primary cilia [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD, OMIM #244400) is a human disease characterized by abnormal motile cilia. PCD patients exhibit bronchiectasis, infertility, and chronic respiratory infections, and in some cases can present with hydrocephalus. A subset of PCD patients will also have a reversal of their left-right body axis that includes <italic>situs inversus totalis</italic> which is referred to as Kartagener syndrome [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. PCD patients often have changes in cilia axonemal ultrastructure that include defects in the inner or outer dynein arms, central complex, radial spokes, and the N-DRC [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These structural defects alter ciliary beat frequency (CBF), ciliary waveform, and cilia orientation. Recent data indicate that mutations in the putative mammalian N-DRC components CCDC164, CCDC65, and Gas8 correlate with the clinical presentation of PCD. Mutations in these genes lead to dyskinetic cilia with subtle changes in cilia ultrastructure pointing to an importance for these components in ciliary motility. Other proteins such as CCDC39 and CCDC40 are responsible for the assembly and attachment of the IDAs and N-DRC in motile cilia. The absence of these proteins results in severe motility defects [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigate a role for Gas8 in both primary and motile cilia <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this we generated a Gas8 genetrap mutant mouse. Gas8 mutants present with severe hydrocephalus and cilia motility defects on both the ependyma and trachea, as well as a <italic>situs inversus</italic> phenotype. Given the role for Gas8 in cilia motility and recent data suggesting it is a PCD causing allele, we screened human PCD patients for <italic>GAS8</italic> mutations and identified two independent missense variants. The potential pathogenicity of these alleles was tested by rescue experiments in <italic>Chlamydomonas PF2</italic> mutants and by generating a mouse model for one of the variants. In contrast to the PCD phenotypes, we did not observe Hh associated defects in any of the mutant mice or cell lines derived from them or other phenotypes typically associated with defects in primary cilia function. These results suggest that <italic>GAS8</italic> plays a highly conserved role in ciliary motility and mutations in Gas8 are associated with human disease through their impact on motile cilia.</p>

        <p>Western blot analysis shows a product of expected size (57kDa) in wildtype and heterozygous Gas8 mice. This product is absent in homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Additionally, the Gas8::Î²-geo fusion protein is detected (approx. 230kDa) in heterozygous and homozygous mutants indicating that the genetrap allele is being transcribed and translated. Loss of Gas8 led to lethality at approximately postnatal day 14 (P14) with few living to P21. All mutants presented with severe hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant mice also presented with <italic>situs inversus</italic> at a rate of 36% (6 of 16 mutants) in live births based on position of the heart and stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Both the hydrocephalic and <italic>situs inversus</italic> phenotypes suggested a defect in the function of motile cilia.</p>

        <title>Loss of Gas8 does not result in defective Hh signaling</title>
        <p>Based on a previous study reporting Gas8 as a positive effector of Hh signaling in mammals, we anticipated Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mice would present with phenotypes related to Hh signaling defects, especially since this mutation would lack the putative Smo binding domain (amino acids 386â478). However, we did not observe any hedgehog-associated phenotypes in limb patterning or neural tube formation. To further test a role for Gas8 in the Hh pathway, we isolated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) from Gas8<sup>WT</sup> and Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant mice and treated them with 150nM Smoothened agonist (SAG). The MEFs were then immunolabeled for Smo and acetylated tubulin to analyze differences in Smo trafficking into the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast to the outcome of the knockdown studies, there was no difference between the amounts of Smo present in the cilia of Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutants when compared to Gas8<sup>WT</sup> cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These data indicate that a least in the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutants, Gas8 is not an essential factor involved in regulating Smo cilia trafficking. Similarly, none of the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutants exhibited defects in dorsal ventral patterning of the neural tube typical of altered Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mice present with dyskinetic cilia and subtle cilia ultrastructural defects</title>
        <p>To investigate the hydrocephalus phenotype, cilia morphology, ultrastructure and motility on ependymal and tracheal cells was assessed. DIC analysis and immunofluorescence staining of trachea indicate motile cilia are present on the epithelium, but the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> protein fails to localize to these cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We counted cilia from trachea TEMs for broken doublet rings and found that about 9% of cilia from Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutants showed disorganization of the arrangement of the microtubule doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g004">Fig 4A</xref> arrowhead and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g004">4E</xref>). To analyze ultrastructure within the doublets, we averaged 202 doublets of both genotypes to reduce variability due to random sectioning of the 96nm repeat of the microtubule doublet. We did not observe any major structural differences in the inner or outer dynein arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, high speed video and Fourier transformation analysis revealed that cilia are largely static with only a few moving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006220.s002">S1 Movie</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006220.s003">S2 Movie</xref>). Those cilia that did moved were dyskinetic, resulting in an inability of cilia to propel fluid as seen by tracking of fluorescent beads added to either brain ventricle or trachea preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>). Beat frequency of cilia that remained motile in Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutants was modestly decreased from 17.0Hz in Gas8<sup>WT</sup> to 12.7Hz in Gas8<sup>GT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g004">Fig 4H</xref>).

        <title>GAS8 is a disease causing gene in humans</title>
        <p>The phenotypes in the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutants led us to evaluate whether mutations in <italic>GAS8</italic> are associated with PCD in humans. We identified two independent missense variants, c.595G&gt;A E199K and c.1172C&gt;T A391V, in human patients through a previously published screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The E119K patient is of Latino decent and presented with heterotaxy. Unaffected parents of the patient are heterozygotes, and an unaffected female sibling is a homozygote. This allele appears at a frequency of 11% in Latino populations (87 homozygotes and 1279 heterozygotes in a total of 11564 alleles sequenced according to ExAC). The prevalence of this allele in the Latino community makes it unlikely to be associated with disease. The A391V patient met the diagnostic criteria for PCD. This allele is infrequent, occurring only 3 times heterozygously and 0 times homozygously in 84864 alleles sequenced according to ExAC. Both variants affect highly conserved regions across multiple species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We utilized the PolyPhen-2 program to predict the pathogenicity of these alleles. The A391V allele had a PolyPhen-2 score of 0.762 suggesting that it is a potentially damaging mutation while the E199K allele had a score of only 0.082, suggesting that this is a benign mutation. Given the low allele frequency, PolyPhen-2 score, and the confirmation of the PCD diagnosis in the patient carrying the A391V variant, we chose to test potential pathogenicity of this allele in mice.</p>

        <p>To further assess the potential pathogenicity of the human allele, we created a mouse harboring the A391V mutation via homology driven repair with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Sequencing confirmed the presence of the c.1172 C&gt;T mutation resulting in an A391V amino acid change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We crossed Gas8<sup>AV</sup> mice onto the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> background to create compound heterozygous (Gas8<sup>GT/AV</sup>) mice. To determine the impact on motile cilia and test possible cause of the hydrocephalus, we took brains from 6 week old mice and analyzed cilia beat and the ability of motile cilia to move fluid. While there were no differences in beat frequency, bead flow analysis shows a modest decrease in the ability of Gas8<sup>GT/AV</sup> cilia to move fluid compared to Gas8<sup>GT/WT</sup> cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Compound heterozygotes develop mild hydrocephalus at approximately 10 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006220.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) but there were no evident laterality defects. While all the Gas8<sup>GT/AV</sup> mice analyzed (n = 6) display hydrocephalus at this age, the severity ranged from mild (arrowhead) to moderate (arrow). The phenotype in the Gas8<sup>GT/AV</sup> mice is not as severe as in the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mice and hydrocephalus was not present in any (n = 2) of the Gas8<sup>GT/WT</sup> or (n = 2) of the Gas8<sup>WT/AV</sup> mice analyzed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Defects involving cilia motility cause severe phenotypes in humans including infertility, hydrocephalus, respiratory defects, and reversal of left-right asymmetry. Much of our understanding about cilia motility has come from studies in organisms such as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. These studies and how defects in cilia motility cause disease are now being extended into mammalian systems. Recently GAS8 was implicated as a cause for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) as well as a positive effector of Smoothened transport into cilia during Hh pathway activation [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>To further evaluate the connection between Gas8 and PCD in mammals, we generated a mouse with a Î²-geo cassette inserted in intron 7 of the Gas8 gene. Insertion of the Î²-geo genetrap cassette effectively eliminated the presence of wildtype transcript and protein in mutants as verified by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Though the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant allele is translated into a large fusion protein between the N-terminal portion of Gas8 and Î²-geo, it does not localize to motile cilia. Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant mice present with hydrocephalus starting at postnatal day 5 (P5) that becomes more pronounced as the mice mature and eventually leads to mortality between P14-P21. Development of hydrocephalus is associated with severe impairment of cilia motility on ependymal cells lining the ventricles of the brain.</p>
      <p>Previous studies using image average procedures to analyze flagella ultrastructure in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> showed that strains with mutations in PF2/DRC4, the Gas8 homolog, were associated with the loss of the majority of the N-DRC complex along with a subset of the IDAs [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast to the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> results, the N-DRC and IDA do not appear to be overtly affected in Gas8 mutant mice based on standard thin-section TEM analysis. However, loss of Gas8 does effect microtubule organization, as indicated by a higher percentage of cilia with disorganized microtubule doublets in Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant mice when compared to Gas8<sup>WT</sup> mice. Altered cilia microtubules were recently also recently observed in human Gas8 patients [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Together these data suggest that defects in the mammalian N-DRC may not always be detectable using traditional TEM averaging of cross-sections. The inability to observe ultrastructural defects in human PCD patients could be attributed to having only one N-DRC per 96nm repeat. Future studies using better imaging approaches such as cryo-electron tomography and image averaging of longitudinal sections to assess the human N-DRC will likely continue to reveal structural and functional differences similar to those described for the radial spokes by Lin, <italic>et al</italic> 2014.</p>
      <p>Most Gas8<sup>GT</sup> mutant cilia failed to move, however those that were observed moving displayed a modest decrease in beat frequency. The most distinguishable phenotype observed in the cilia that moved was a very rigid and short wave pattern. This pattern has also been observed in other cilia motility mutants thought to affect the NDRC [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These changes in waveform and the lack of overall motility result in the defective fluid flow observed in these mice. Previous data show a complex relationship between planar cell polarity (PCP) and fluid flow in establishing motile cilia orientation [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Gas8<sup>GT</sup> cilia show a more random distribution of cilia orientation than their Gas8<sup>WT</sup> counterparts supporting the necessity of proper fluid flow in establishing cilia orientation.</p>
      <p>Variants in Gas8 were recently identified in human PCD patients. These mutations resulted in a similar, albeit not significant, decrease in beat frequency along with an abnormally rigid ciliary waveform [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This motility phenotype is similar to our observation in the mutant mice. Here we identified an additional independent missense mutation, c.1172C&gt;T A391V, in PCD patients as well as a variant c.595G&gt;A E199K that appears to have minimal effect on cilia motility. The A391V mutations lies in close proximity to the other published mutants, C309*, A334*, and G357* suggesting that this area is critical for GAS8 function. Similarly, the genetrap cassette in the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> allele was inserted in close proximity (K337) to the A334* mutation. The E199K mutation also affects a highly conserved region within Gas8 that is proposed to be a Microtubule Association Domain (GMAD) [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>To test pathogenicity of the A391V allele, we used CRISPR/CAS9 homology driven repair (HDR) to generate a mouse line mimicking the human mutation. Mice compound heterozygous for the Gas8<sup>GT</sup> and Gas8<sup>AV</sup> mutations develop age dependent, mild hydrocephalus, but did not present with situs defects (n = 6 Gas8<sup>GT/AV</sup> mice). The phenotype was associated with a reduced ability of ependymal cilia to move fluid. Interestingly, beat frequency was not significantly altered from that of controls, suggesting that the defect lies within a subtle waveform difference or in cilia orientation. These data suggest that the A391V allele is pathogenic though more in-depth analysis of ciliary defects will be necessary to determine the precise mechanism. Data from the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> rescue experiments suggest that the E199K allele may have very subtle effects on motility. The D198K rescued strain in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> showed a small but statistically significant reduction in forward swim velocity of approximately 10 percent. While statistically significant, additional work is needed to determine whether such small changes might impact ciliary motility and have pathogenic consequences in different tissues and different organisms. As this variant is commonly found in Latino populations, it seems more likely that this variant is a benign polymorphism.</p>
      <p>Gas8 was previously implicated as a modulator of the Hh pathway. <italic>In vitro</italic> data indicated that the C-terminal region of Gas8 binds to Smoothened (Smo) and acts at the base of primary cilia as a regulator of Smo entry into the cilium following Hh pathway activation [<xref rid="pgen.1006220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These data showed that in the absence of Gas8, Smo accumulation in the cilium is abrogated and that it cannot activate the Gli transcription factors and turn on downstream genes. Based on these <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we expected to see Hh defects in our mutant mice. However, the Gas8 mutants survive to birth and have normal digit number and patterning as well as normal neural tube dorsal ventral patterning. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in Smo accumulation in cilia between Gas8<sup>WT</sup> and Gas8<sup>GT</sup> MEFs after SAG stimulation, suggesting that in this mutant model, Gas8 does not act as a regulator for Smo entry. The role that Gas8 plays at the base of primary cilia remains uncertain; however, we do not see any other pathologies that would suggest there is a defect in primary cilia such as cystic kidney disease.</p>
      <p>The data presented here solidify <italic>GAS8</italic> as a disease causing gene in humans and elucidate the mechanisms by which loss of Gas8 causes disease. We identified new independent, homozygous missense mutations and used model systems to test the pathogenicity of the alleles. Importantly, these results suggest the A391V allele is pathogenic while the E199K variant is not. Our results demonstrate the importance of testing the potential pathogenicity of human alleles in easily amenable model systems such as <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and further reveal the ease with which CRISPR/Cas9 has now made it possible to conduct similar tests in mouse models.</p>

The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (cat# A1360, Promega Corp) to generate the plasmid pf2-Y1-A. This plasmid was further digested with <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Spe</italic>I to removed repetitive DNA and subcloned into pBlueScript to generate the plasmid pf2-Y1-B. The D198K mutation was introduced into pf2-Y1-B using the primers 5â-GAAGATGCTGCGAGACaAaATGGAGCTGCGGAGAAAG-3â and 5â-CTTCTACGACGCTCTGtTtTACCTCGACGCCTCTTTC-3â and the QuickChange II kit (Agilent Technologies) to generate the plasmid pf2-Y1-C.

        <p>CRISPR/sgRNA target sequences were queried using the MIT CRISPR server. Three sites most proximal to the desired SNP change were selected to test nuclease efficiency. CRISPR1: 5â- CTTCTCCACAGCAGCGTTCA <underline><italic toggle="yes">GGG</italic></underline>-3â (reverse strand), CRISPR2: 5â-GGTGCTGGCCGCCTCCAACC <underline><italic toggle="yes">TGG</italic></underline>-3â (forward strand), CRISPR3: 5â-GACACAAGCGTTAATGCTGT<underline><italic toggle="yes">GGG</italic></underline>-3â (reverse strand). Pronuclear injections were performed with Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/ul), CRISPR3/sgRNA (50 ng/ul) and ssODN (200 ng/ul). Efficiency of nuclease activity was assessed using a blastocyst assay. In brief, injected zygotes were cultured to the blastocyst stage and lysed to obtain genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was used in PCR and the amplicons (215 bp) were resolved by heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA). CRISPR3 was found to be most efficient and was used to generate the SNP edited mouse (C57Bl/6 background). Injected zygotes were cultured to 2-cell stage in KSOM mixed with the NHEJ inhibitor SCR7 at a final concentration of 10 mM. The 2-cell stage embryos were transferred to psuedopregnant recipient female mice, which gave birth to 13 pups. The SNP was introduced with the help of a 154 nt single stranded oligo DNA (ssODN) HDR template. Since the PAM sequence (CCC&gt;Pro) could not be modified without changing the amino acid, multiple silent changes were made in the protospacer (sgRNA binding) sequence (indicated by small letters in the sequence below). These changes were made to eliminate the chances of the sgRNA binding to the repaired allele. The SNP change introduced a restriction enzyme recognition enzyme site (BsmBI/Esp3I) and the silent changes introduced two new restriction enzyme recognition sites (BtgI and HaeII). HaeII sites were used to distinguish the wildtype and the modified alleles. Specific primers were also designed that can preferentially amplify the modified allele.

After the initial characterization of the F0 litter by PCR, the 215 bp amplicons were cloned, and selected individual clones were subjected to Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis of the 13 pups revealed that 2 had complete knock-in of the edited/repair sequence, 1 pup had incorporated the silent changes but did not have the desired SNP change, and 1 pup had indels. F0 animals were bred with wildtype C57Bl/6 mice to test germline transmission of the desired alleles. All alleles were successfully transmitted through the germline, and the positive F1 animals were used to create homozygous and compound heterozygous F2 animals.</p>
