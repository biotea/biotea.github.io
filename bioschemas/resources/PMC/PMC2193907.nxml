        <p>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) accounts for one of the first cytokine activities to have been described, and it has emerged recently to be an important regulator of innate and adaptive immunity. MIF is an upstream activator of monocytes/macrophages, and it is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. The protein is encoded by a unique but highly conserved gene, and X-ray crystallography studies have shown MIF to define a new protein fold and structural superfamily. Although recent work has begun to illuminate the signal transduction pathways activated by MIF, the nature of its membrane receptor has not been known. Using expression cloning and functional analysis, we report herein that CD74, a Type II transmembrane protein, is a high-affinity binding protein for MIF. MIF binds to the extracellular domain of CD74, and CD74 is required for MIF-induced activation of the extracellular signalâregulated kinaseâ1/2 MAP kinase cascade, cell proliferation, and PGE<sub>2</sub> production. A recombinant, soluble form of CD74 binds MIF with a dissociation constant of â¼9 Ã 10<sup>â9</sup>
<italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub>, as defined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore analysis), and soluble CD74 inhibits MIF-mediated extracellular signalâregulated kinase activation in defined cell systems. These data provide a molecular basis for MIF's interaction with target cells and identify it as a natural ligand for CD74, which has been implicated previously in signaling and accessory functions for immune cell activation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> is one of the first cytokine mediators to have been described. Its activity was defined in the mid 1960s by immunologists who sought to replicate, in vitro, key features of cell-mediated immunity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). MIF was identified to be a soluble, T cellâderived factor in 1966 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), but the protein product resisted biochemical characterization until its cloning in 1989 by David and colleagues (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A mouse homologue was described soon thereafter as a result of investigations into systemically expressed regulators of glucocorticoid action (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Within a few years, both bioactive MIF protein and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were produced, and in vitro and in vivo studies established MIF to play an important role in the inflammatory cascade (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>MIF promotes monocyte/macrophage activation and it is required for the optimal expression of TNF-Î±, IL-1, and PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). MIF-treated macrophages are more phagocytic and better able to destroy intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These activating functions have been verified by papers in MIF-knockout mice (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which have also revealed new activities such as the regulation of TLR4 expression (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). MIF's role in adaptive immunity is less well-characterized, but immunoneutralization of MIF inhibits delayed-type hypersensitivity, T cell priming, and antibody production in vivo (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). MIF expression contributes significantly to the immunopathology that results from excessive inflammation and autoimmunity (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and its role in human disease has been emphasized by the recent description of high-expression <italic>Mif</italic> alleles that are linked to severe rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>MIF's molecular mechanism of action appears to be unique among proinflammatory cytokines. MIF broadly counter-regulates the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and at the subcellular level, it induces a sustained pattern of extracellular signalâregulated kinase (ERK)â1/2 MAP kinase activation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and maintains proinflammatory function by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Despite evidence for an extracellular mode of action, no cellular receptor for MIF has been described. These circumstances have fueled interest in nonclassical mechanisms for ligand activation that have included the role of an intrinsic catalytic activity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and an endocytic pathway leading to a direct interaction between MIF and the transcriptional coactivator, Jab1 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
      <p>Using expression cloning and functional analysis, we report the identification of CD74, the cell surface form of the class IIâassociated invariant chain, as a cell surface binding protein for MIF. MIF binds to CD74 by a high-affinity interaction, and CD74 expression is required for MIF-mediated ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, PGE<sub>2</sub> production, and cell proliferation.</p>

        <p>Human recombinant MIF was prepared from an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression system and purified free of endotoxin by methods described previously (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Conjugation of MIF to Alexa-488 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) was performed by the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). Reaction conditions were optimized to give an average dye/MIF (homotrimer) ratio of 1:1, which was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Recombinant human IL-6 and IFN-Î³ were obtained from R&amp;D Systems.</p>
        <p>Human antiâhuman CD74 mAbs (clones LN2 and M-B741) were obtained from BD Biosciences, and dialyzed free of sodium azide for MIF functional studies. Control studies established that these antibodies do not cross react with recombinant MIF. CD74-KO (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and wild-type controls were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.</p>

        <title>MIF Activity Assays.</title>
        <p>MIF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 (p44/p42) was measured by Western blotting of cell lysates using specific antibodies directed against phospho-p44/p42 or total p44/p42 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). MIF-mediated suppression of apoptosis was assessed in serum-deprived, primary fibroblasts by immunoassay of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (Roche Biochemicals; references <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). MIF's tautomerase activity was measured by visible spectrophotometry using <sc>l</sc>-dopachrome methyl ester as a substrate (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). MIF-induced secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion into medium was measured by specific ELISA (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Proliferation studies were performed by a modification of previously published procedures (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Human Raji B cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640/10% FBS, plated into 96-well plates (500â1,000 cells/well), and rendered quiescent by overnight incubation in RPMI/0.5% FBS. The cells were washed, the RPMI 1640/0.5% FBS was replaced, and the MIF and antibodies were added as indicated. After an additional overnight incubation, 1 Î¼Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine was added and the cells were harvested 12 h later. Fibroblast mitogenesis was examined in normal human lung fibroblasts (CCL210; American Type Culture Collection) cultured in DMEM/10% FBS, resuspended in DMEM/2% serum, and seeded into 96-well plates (1,500 cells/well) together with MIF and antibodies as shown (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> C). Isotype control or anti-CD74 mAbs were added at a final concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml. Proliferation was assessed after overnight incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine into DNA.</p>

        <p>2.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640/10% FBS with or without 1 ng/ml IFN-Î³ for 72 h. After washing, 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with 200 ng of Alexa-488âmodified MIF (Alexa-MIF) at 4Â°C for 45 min. The cells were washed, maintained in ice-cold conditions, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis (FACSCaliburâ¢; Becton Dickinson). In selected experiments, THP-1 monocytes or COS-7 transfectants were incubated with Alexa-MIF together with 50 Î¼g/ml anti-CD74 mAb or an isotypic control mAb(36).</p>
        <p>Confocal fluorescence microscopy of Alexa-MIF binding to cells was performed with a laser scanning instrument (model LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). THP-1 cells were incubated with IFN-Î³ for 72 h and washed three times with PBS/1% FBS before staining for 30 min (4Â°C) with 2 ng/Î¼l Alexa-MIF or Alexa-MIF plus 50 ng/Î¼l of unlabeled MIF. For double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, IFN-Î³âtreated THP-1 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS, pH 7.4, and 20 Î¼g/ml Alexa-MIF and 15 Î¼g/ml anti-CD74 mAb (clone LN2) and were added at 4Â°C for 1 h. After washing in ice-cold PBS/2% FBS, the cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml PBS and a rhodamine-conjugated antiâmouse IgG was added at 0Â°C for 1 h. The samples were washed, resuspended in 0.2 ml PBS, and 30-Î¼l aliquots were added to poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysineâcoated slides followed by anti-fad mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories). Images were analyzed by Metamorph Intensity Analysis software (Universal Imaging). The percent colocalization for each image was derived from the number of positive pixels common to both images (Alexa-MIF/anti-CD74), divided by the number of positive pixels within the Alexa-MIF image (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Six cells were analyzed and the significance was determined by the paired Student's t test (independent variables).</p>

        <p>cDNA was prepared from the poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA of IFN-Î³âactivated, THP-1 monocytes, cloned into the Î»ZAP-CMV vector (Stratagene), and 2.5 Î¼g/ml DNA aliquots were transfected into 1.5 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The transfected cells were incubated with Alexa-MIF for 45 min at 4Â°C, washed, and the positively staining cells were isolated with a cell sorter (Moflo; DakoCytomation; reference <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In a typical run, 1.5 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml were injected and analyzed at a flow rate of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/s. Recovery was generally &gt;90%. Plasmid DNA was extracted from sorted cells using the Easy DNA kit (Invitrogen) and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> XL-10 gold (Stratagene) for further amplification. Purified plasmid DNA was retransfected into COS-7 cells for an additional round of sorting. After four rounds of cell sorting, 250 single colonies were picked at random and the insert size was analyzed by PCR. Clones with inserts &gt;1.4 kb were individually transfected into COS-7 cells, and the MIF binding activity was reanalyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.</p>

        <p>Full-length and truncated recombinant CD74 products were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1/V5-HisTOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). The fidelity of vector construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For pull-down experiments (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), a full-length (V5-CD74<sup>1â232</sup>), NH<sub>2</sub>-terminalâtruncated (V5-CD74<sup>46â232</sup>), membrane-truncated (V5-CD74<sup>1â72</sup>), or vector control plasmid was transfected into 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> COS-7 cells using cytofectin (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The cells were harvested 48 h later, lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5), and the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. Supernatants containing the V5-Hisâtagged CD74 proteins were incubated with 20 Î¼l Ni-NTAâagarose beads (QIAGEN), rocked at 4Â°C for 1 h, and the beads were collected by centrifugation. After resuspension in PBS, pH 7.4, the bound complexes were incubated with 2 Î¼g/ml MIF for 4 h at 4Â°C. The beads were spun down, resuspended in 1 ml PBS, and washed an additional four times. After SDS-PAGE on 4â20% polyacrylamide gels, the precipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blotting for CD74 (V5 epitope) and MIF.</p>
        <p>In vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TNT Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega). Full-length CD74 (1â232 aa) and three truncated CD74 constructs (1â72 aa, 1â109 aa, and 1â149 aa) were used as templates for coupled transcription and translation in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-containing amino acids. The binding of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled CD74 to immobilized MIF was assessed by a 3-h incubation at room temperature, as recommended by the TNT protocol (Promega).</p>

        <p>Truncated, sCD74 proteins comprising the extracellular domain (sCD74<sup>73â232</sup>) and the intracellular/transmembrane domain (sCD74<sup>1â72</sup>) were amplified by PCR and ligated into the pCR T7/CT TOPO F <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector (Invitrogen). After verification of the correct structures by DNA sequencing, the recombinant CD74 proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3)pLysS under IPTG induction. The sCD74 proteins were isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates by standard methods involving DEAE cellulose chromatography and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Both sCD74<sup>73â232</sup> and sCD74<sup>1â72</sup> showed single bands by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.</p>
        <p>The sCD74 proteins were evaluated for MIF binding by first assessing their ability to inhibit MIF detection in an MIF sandwich ELISA (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In brief, 96-well plates were coated with an anti-MIF mAb (R&amp;D Systems) at 20 ng/well. After washing, MIF was added together with sCD74<sup>1â72</sup> (intracellular and transmembrane domains) and sCD74<sup>73â232</sup> (extracellular domain) as shown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C). After incubation at 4Â°C, the wells were washed, blocked, and a biotinylated anti-MIF pAb (R&amp;D Systems) added. The bound complexes were detected after incubation and washing by adding streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (1:60) and <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate.</p>
        <p>Real-time binding of MIF to CD74 was measured by surface plasmon resonance using a optical biosensor (model BIA 2000, BIAcore; Amersham Biosciences). The SA sensor chips, amine coupling kit, and BIA Evaluation software were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. MIF or sCD74 was immobilized onto the SA chips in accordance with prescribed methods (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). A surface reference to which no ligand was bound, or to which a membrane protein contol (G protein Î²Î³) was bound, was included in the analysis. The derivatized sensor chips were washed and equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.4, 20 Î¼l/min), and the ligands were introduced at five serial dilutions in BIAcore running buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.005% P20) in 60-Î¼l injection volumes and at a flow rate of 20 Î¼l/min. Binding was measured at 25Â°C for 3 min, followed by 17 min of dissociation. Sensorgram response data were analyzed in the BIA Evaluation Kinetics package and the equilibrium affinity constant calculated (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>

        <p>Our initial attempts to prepare an <sup>125</sup>I-labeled MIF species suitable for cell binding studies were frustrated by a loss of MIF bio-activity. We found that linking the fluorescent dye Alexa 488 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) to recombinant MIF at low-molar density produced an MIF conjugate with full activity in two cell-based assays: (a) stimulation of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A), and (b) protection from apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Additionally, Alexa conjugation of MIF did not significantly influence MIF's intrinsic tautomerase activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C), which is a useful surrogate for the retention of native MIF structure (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p>

Positively staining cell fractions were purified by high-speed cell sorting, and the cDNA clones collected, amplified, and retransfected for additional rounds of cell sorting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Enumeration of the positively staining, sorted cells showed a &gt;400-fold enrichment in MIF binding activity.

We sequenced 50 clones bearing cDNA inserts of &gt;1.4 kb and found that 10 encoded the surface form of the class IIâassociated invariant chain, CD74 (CD74), a 31â41-kD Type II transmembrane protein(42).

        <p>MIF has been shown to play an important role in the activation responses of macrophages and fibroblasts, in part by inducing sustained activation of the p44/p42 (ERK-1/2) protein kinase cascade (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). To assess the functional significance of MIF binding to CD74, we examined the capacity of MIF to stimulate p44/p42 phosphorylation in macrophages obtained from mice genetically deficient in CD74<sup>34</sup>. MIF induced the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 in CD74<sup>+/+</sup> macrophages, but not in CD74<sup>â/â</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) .

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although the first biological activity attributed to MIF was described in the mid 1960s, information regarding MIF's precise role in cell physiology and immunity has emerged only in the last few years. Among recent findings has been the determination that MIF is expressed by many cell types including the monocyte/macrophage (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which historically had been considered to be the âtargetâ of MIF action (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). MIF is present preformed in macrophages (and in T cells) and it exerts important, autocrine/paracrine activating effects upon its release (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Antibody neutralization and signal transduction papers have supported the view that MIF acts by engaging a cell surface receptor (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), however, the lack of information regarding candidate receptors has prompted investigations into nonclassical or specialized modes of action. These have included the biological role of an intrinsic tautomerase activity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), which may be vestigial (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and an endocytic pathway that involves a direct interaction between MIF and the transcriptional regulator, Jab1 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
      <p>We experienced considerable difficulty in preparing a bioactive, <sup>125</sup>I-radiolabeled MIF, and in biosynthetically labeling the protein to a sufficiently high specific activity for cell binding studies. Radioiodination methods result in the adventitious oxidation of MIF's free cysteine residues, which need to be in a reduced state for cytokine bioactivity (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In contrast, we found that modification of MIF by Alexa-488 under mild conditions produced a fully bioactive protein that enabled the expression cloning of CD74 as a high-affinity, cell surface binding protein for MIF.</p>
      <p>This work provides the first insight into a membrane receptor for MIF, and the proximate steps for signal transduction may now be considered in the context of the molecular biology of CD74. A role for CD74 in the transport of class II proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex has been established (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>); however, it also is known that 2â5% of cellular CD74 is expressed on the cell surface (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). CD74 surface expression occurs independently of class II and in a variety of different cell types (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Of note, CD74-KO mice are developmentally immunocompromised and show lymphoid abnormalities beyond what would be expected from the protein's function as a class II chaperone (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Recent works have identified an accessory role for CD74 in immune cell stimulation, and this function requires a chondroitinâsulfate-dependent interaction between CD74 and CD44 (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). CD44 is a widely expressed and a polymorphic transmembrane protein with known tyrosine kinase activation properties (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and the horizontal recruitment of CD44 into an MIFâCD74 complex may be necessary for MIF signal transduction in some cell types. CD74 surface expression is also known to be regulated by the length of the protein's NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal, intracellular domain, which varies depending on which of two in-phase initiation codons are used (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Whether this differential translation of CD74 mRNA mediates cellular sensitivity to MIF will also be important to investigate.</p>
      <p>The intracellular portion of CD74 lacks sequence domains that might be predicted to interact with downstream signaling molecules. Thus, it is noteworthy that the expression of a truncated, CD74 intracellular domain alone has been shown to initiate p65-RelAâdependent transcriptional activation (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The activating ligand for CD74 was not been defined by these papers, and this activation pathway appears to require the recruitment of additional intracellular proteins (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Like MIF, CD74 is a homotrimer (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), and MIF engagement of CD74 may act to effect the oligomerization or the stabilization of the intracellular domain that is necessary for downstream signaling. Thus, the MIF binding activity of CD74 provides insight into the biology of CD74 outside of its role in the transport of class II, and supports those papers that have defined an accessory signaling function for CD74 in immune cell physiology (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>).</p>
      <p>Whether the binding of MIF to CD74 accounts for all of MIF's cellular actions is unknown, and perhaps unlikely in light of experiments suggesting a pathway for MIF internalization and binding to Jab1 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and continued interest in the biological function of MIF's NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal, catalytic domain (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Nevertheless, recent in vitro and in vivo works have placed MIF in a pivotal position for the control of innate immunity. MIF regulates the expression of TLR4 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which is the receptor for gram-negative endotoxin, and the MIF release sustains proinflammatory function by inhibiting activation-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). MIF's importance in the pathophysiology of infection also has been affirmed in experimental animal models of sepsis, where anti-MIF protects from death even when administered 8 h after infectious insult (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The recent finding that human MIF is encoded by four functionally distinct alleles, and that the high-expression alleles are associated with severe rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) further emphasize this cytokine's importance in human inflammatory disease. Pharmacological interference in the MIF-CD74 interaction may offer an important new approach to the modulation of pathologic inflammatory processes.</p>
