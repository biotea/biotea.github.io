        <p>Ciliated airway epithelial cells are subject to sustained changes in intracellular CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> during exacerbations of airway diseases, but the role of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in ciliary beat regulation is unknown. We now show not only sAC expression in human airway epithelia (by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence) but also its specific localization to the axoneme (Western blotting and immunofluorescence). Real time estimations of [cAMP] changes in ciliated cells, using FRET between fluorescently tagged PKA subunits (expressed under the foxj1 promoter solely in ciliated cells), revealed CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-mediated cAMP production. This cAMP production was specifically blocked by sAC inhibitors but not by transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) inhibitors. In addition, this cAMP production stimulated ciliary beat frequency (CBF) independently of intracellular pH because PKA and sAC inhibitors were uniquely able to block CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-mediated changes in CBF (while tmAC inhibitors had no effect). Thus, sAC is localized to motile airway cilia and it contributes to the regulation of human airway CBF. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> increases indeed reversibly stimulate intracellular cAMP production by sAC in intact cells.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>A soluble form of adenylyl cyclase activity, enzymatically distinct from G proteinâresponsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs), was first described over 30 years ago in rat testis cytosol (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Braun and Dods, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Neer, 1978</xref>). However, its molecular identity remained unknown until 1999, when soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) was finally purified, cloned, and shown to be molecularly distinct from tmACs (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Buck et al., 1999</xref>). Mammalian sAC activity is subject to different regulation than tmACs; sAC is insensitive to heterotrimeric G proteins and to forskolin (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Buck et al., 1999</xref>), and its in vitro activity has been shown to be directly activated by CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub> in a pH-independent manner (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Steegborn et al., 2005b</xref>) and by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which synergizes with [HCO<sup>3â</sup>] (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Litvin et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The importance of sAC for axonemal beat regulation has been explored in sperm from mammals and echinoderms (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Esposito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Nomura and Vacquier, 2006</xref>). Mammalian sAC has been identified in many tissues besides testis. Localization of sAC to different intracellular compartments within somatic cells (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) suggested a model whereby intracellular cAMP-mediated signaling processes, which had been hard to explain when the only known sources of cAMP were membrane-localized tmACs, could be mediated by sAC-defined cAMP signaling microdomains (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bundey and Insel, 2004</xref>). Additionally, development of pharmacological reagents selective for sAC relative to tmACs revealed that sAC is the source of cAMP in a number of physiological processes in somatic cells with tenuous historical links to this second messenger (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kamenetsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Stessin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Airway epithelial cells express motile cilia that are important for innate host defense by propelling mucus out of the airways. The regulation of flagellar beating (i.e., in sperm) differs from the regulation of cilia and thus information from sperm flagella may not be directly relevant to cilia. cAMP regulates airway ciliary beating through activation of PKA (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson and Dirksen, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Di Benedetto et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lansley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Salathe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, there is a shared requirement for an adenylyl cyclase, and because airway cells are likely exposed to sustained changes in intracellular CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> under stress during manifestations of airway diseases, sAC could be involved in regulating ciliary activity. Whether or not sAC even exists in ciliated airway epithelial cells, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that sAC is expressed in human airway epithelial cells, specifically localized to the axoneme and that sAC could contribute to airway ciliary beat frequency (CBF) regulation in conditions of changing intracellular CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> via production of cAMP.</p>

        <p>Total RNA was extracted from ALI-cultured human airway epithelial cells using the RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (QIAGEN), subsequently treated with DNase (DNase I Amplification Grade; Life Technologies), and precipitated with ethanol. Good quality of isolated RNA (28S to 18S rRNA ratio &gt;1.75) was confirmed using an RNA 6000 LabChip Kit (Agilent Technologies) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (University of Miami DNA Microarray Facility). RNA from testis, brain, liver, and kidney was purchased from Ambion. Total RNA (1 Î¼g per sample) was used for first strand cDNA synthesis with Superscript II RT (Life Technologies) using oligo-dT<sub>16</sub> primers. For PCR amplification, oligonucleotide primers (forward: 5â²-CTG AGC AGT TGG TGG AGA TCC TC-3â²; reverse: 5â²-CAG CCA GTC CTA TCT TGA CTC GG-3â²) were based on the published sequences of human sAC cDNA (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_018417">NM_018417</ext-link>). PCR reactions (40 cycles of 30 s at 94Â°C, 45 s at 61Â°C, and 1 min at 72Â°C, final elongation of 10 min at 72Â°C) were performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies). RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on ethidium bromideâstained 2% or 3% SeaKem agarose (BMA).

This antibody was used because it works well for immunohistochemistry (while it does not work well for Western blotting). Secondary antibody (goat) was coupled to Alexa 555 (1:500; Invitrogen). After extensive washing with PBS, the cultures were reexposed 60 min to anti-acetylated Î±-tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) using a secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 488 (both 1:500). DAPI (1:100; Invitrogen) was added to the last wash and incubated for 5 min before mounting in an aqueous anti-fading gel (Biomeda). Even though both antibodies (R41 and anti-acetylated Î±-tubulin antibody) were monoclonal, specificity of secondary staining was confirmed by individual staining of acetylated Î±-tubulin in different cultures (see control in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

        <title>Expression of sAC in Human Airway Epithelial Cells: RT-PCR</title>
        <p>To examine sAC mRNA expression in airway epithelial cells in comparison with other tissues, RT-PCR was performed with sAC-specific primers. The 5â² primer is located in exon 3 and the 3â² primer overlaps the splice junction between exons 5 and 6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Amplification of cDNA from human airway epithelial cells generated a major band of 280 bp with minor products of 243 and 292 bp. These products were also detected in other human tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The RT-PCR products were cloned and sequenced and found to be alternative splice variants that differ at the location of the 3â² splice junction of exons 4 and 5. The shortest, 243-bp amplimer (V1; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>) was identical to the human testicular sAC mRNA splice variant (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_018417">NM_018417</ext-link>). The 280-bp amplimer sequence is identical to a published sAC splice variant (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2005</xref>) having 37 extra nucleotides of the 3â² end of the âintronâ 4 sequence (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF331033">AF331033</ext-link>: V2; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>).

            <p>Expression of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) mRNAs in human airway epithelial cells. (A) RT-PCR products from human airway epithelial cell RNA and other tissues after gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of sAC cDNA of three different sizes. The source of the RNA is indicated at the bottom of each lane of the gel. No RT is the amplification of RNA from ALI cultures without reverse transcription. RNA was extracted from human airway epithelial cells grown at the ALI. Human testicular, brain, liver, and kidney RNA was purchased. (B) The RT-PCR products were cloned. Alternative splice variants with 243 (V1), 280 (V2), and 292 (V3) bp were found. (C) Sequencing of the vector inserts revealed a 243-bp fragment of human testicular sAC cDNA (V1) and two variants (V2 and V3). Bold-faced fragments represent the primers used for the PCR reaction; the extra 37 nucleotides in V2 and V3 are underlined and the insert of an additional 12 nucleotides in V3 is double underlined. Black and gray highlighted letters in V2 indicate variable bases in different clones. (D) Predicted protein structure of different splicing variants of sAC; V1 has the largest ORF and encodes a sAC protein that has two catalytic domains in the N-terminal one third of the protein. V2 and V3 initiate translation from a new ATG codon that is in frame with the C-terminal 1,513âamino acid ORF of the V1 mRNA. Thus, V2 and V3 encode identical proteins that differ from the V1 protein by deleting the first 97 amino acids and replacing them with five new amino acids. However, the remaining 1,513 amino acids are identical in V1, V2, and V3. The translated sequence of V1 has 42 amino acids at the N-terminal end (MNTâ¦.GV) in front of the first catalytic domain (Cat 1), which spans from LMF to KPPN and is 181-aa long. The N-terminal end of the protein of V2 and V3 starts with 5 aa (MSLSE) before a fraction of Cat 1 is expressed (GDALLAâ¦.KPPPN).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The alternative splicing of these mRNAs affects the translational open reading frames (ORFs) of the mRNAs. The shortest, V1 form, of the mRNA has the largest ORF and encodes a sAC protein that has two catalytic domains in the N-terminal one third of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The longer amplimers, containing the sequences inserted between exons 4 and 5, alter the reading frame after amino acid 97 of the V1 ORF. These changes result in termination codons after an additional 10 (V2) and 14 (V3) amino acids. However, both of these insertions also introduce a new ATG translation initiation codon and four additional amino acids that are in frame with the C-terminal 1513 amino acid ORF of the V1 mRNA. Thus, the V2 and V3 encode identical proteins that differ from the V1 protein by deleting the first 97 amino acids and replacing them with five new amino acids. All three alternatively spliced isoforms, V1, V2, and V3, share 1,513 identical amino acids. Since these changes occur within the first of the two catalytic domains in the V1 protein, the V2 and V3 proteins encode proteins with only one complete catalytic domain (C2); the first catalytic domain (C1) found in the testicular isoform is missing its first 55 amino acids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). It is interesting to note that the V2 and V3 seem to represent the major forms of sAC expressed in airway epithelial cells by mRNA. In addition, another sAC variant missing the entire exon 5 has also been described (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2005</xref>); however, the reverse primer we used overlapped exon 5 and 6, therefore this particular sAC transcript would have escaped our notice.</p>

        <title>Expression of sAC Proteins</title>
        <p>To examine the expression and localization of sAC within airway epithelial cells, Western blots were performed with proteins prepared from whole cells, deciliated cells, isolated cilia/axonemes, and testis (positive control). To probe the Western blots, an antibody made against a peptide (SLSEGDALLA) corresponding to the extreme N terminus of human sAC proteins expressed from the V2 and V3 mRNAs (GDALLA is present in all proteins) was used that works well for this application (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2005</xref>). Immunoreactive bands were detected at â¼50, 75, and 190 kD in whole airway epithelial cell and testis (control) extracts. In isolated cilia/axonemes, only the 50-kD band was detected, while this isoform seemed to be depleted in deciliated cell extracts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). For quality control of cilia/axonemes and deciliation, the same blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against acetylated Î±-tubulin and Î²-actin. Acetylated tubulin was greatly enriched in isolated cilia and in whole airway epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) relative to deciliated cells, and less Î²-actin was only present in the cilia/axonemes recovered by centrifugation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the method of deciliation resulted in a highly purified axonemal sample.</p>

        <p>To confirm the Western blot findings, we immunolocalized sAC in cultured human airway epithelial cells, fully differentiated at the ALI, as well as in human trachea. We used a monoclonal mouse antibody against sAC (R41) recognizing an epitope in the second catalytic domain of human sAC (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>); we have found this epitope to be present in all known isoforms of sAC. In addition, this antibody works well for immunohistochemistry (but poorly for Western blotting). When used for immunofluorescence, cultured human airway epithelial cells revealed positive staining that colocalized with acetylated Î±-tubulin (indicative of localization to the axoneme) in addition to localization at the apical pole of airway epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The same results were found in tracheal sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p>

(A) Human airway epithelial cells grown and differentiated at the ALI were probed with a monoclonal mouse antibody against sAC (R41) (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>) and rabbit antibodies against acetylated Î±-tubulin (AC Tubulin) as indicated in the center. For visualization, secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 555 for sAC and Alexa 488 for acetylated tubulin were used. These results show colocalization (yellow) of sAC (red) and acetylated tubulin (green) in cilia and in the apical compartment of the cells with little staining basally. The right panel shows a negative control using mouse IgG. Bars are 10 Î¼m. (B) Shown are the differential interference contrast (DIC) and immunofluorescent images of a tracheal section probed for sAC and acetylated tubulin using the same antibodies as in A. These images confirm data in ALI cultures, showing colocalization (yellow) of sAC (red) and acetylated tubulin (green) mainly in cilia. Bar, 10 Î¼m.</p>

        <title>Ciliary Beat Frequency</title>
        <p>To examine whether CBF is regulated by sAC, experiments were designed to change [CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>] in intact and basolaterally permeabilized airway epithelial cells. These experiments are complicated by the fact that changes in pH alone, independent of changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>, influence CBF directly, i.e., pH-induced changes are not mediated by PKA (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sutto et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>To examine the effects of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> on CBF, we first used intact, fully differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at the ALI, mounted in closed chambers. These cultures were continuously perfused with HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (containing no CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>) and then temporarily exposed apically to 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> solution bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Under these conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> rapidly diffuses into the cells, thereby acidifying them. In addition, this CO<sub>2</sub>-induced acidification is accompanied by a rise in intracellular [HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>]. Upon introduction of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>, CBF decreased by 19.3 Â± 1.2% from a baseline of 6 Â± 0.3 Hz in intact cells (<italic>n</italic> = 20; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and C</xref>). This decrease is consistent with the acidification of these cells measured with BCECF (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sutto et al., 2004</xref>). After pretreatment and continuous perfusion of similar cells with KH7, a specific sAC inhibitor (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Stessin et al., 2006</xref>), CBF decreased by 27.7 Â± 1.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 20, baseline not different from untreated cells) upon apical perfusion with CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>. The CBF decrease observed in the presence of KH7 was thus significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the decrease seen in untreated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). This effect was not due to a toxic effect of KH7 on cilia since KH7 did not affect baseline CBF in control experiments and did not inhibit ATP-mediated increases in CBF, which are mediated by intracellular calcium. In HBSS, CBF baseline before KH7 addition was 5.3 Â± 0.2 Hz and after 25 Î¼M KH7 addition (10 min) 5.2 Â± 0.2 Hz (P &gt; 0.05). Addition of 10 Î¼M ATP caused an increase of CBF to 6.7 Â± 0.2 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 10). In HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-containing, CO<sub>2</sub>-bubbled buffer (Krebs Henseleit), baseline CBF before KH7 addition was 5.6 Â± 0.3 Hz and after 25 Î¼M KH7 addition (10 min) 5.4 Â± 0.2 Hz (P &gt; 0.05). Addition of 10 Î¼M ATP caused an increase of CBF to 7.0 Â± 0.3 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 8). H89, another inhibitor used in these experiments used at 10 Î¼M (see below), did also neither affect CBF baseline nor the CBF stimulation upon 10 Î¼M ATP addition. In HBSS, CBF baseline before H89 addition was 4.6 Â± 0.2 Hz and after 10 Î¼M H89 addition (10 min) 4.6 Â± 0.2 Hz (P &gt; 0.05). Addition of 10 Î¼M ATP caused an increase of CBF to 6.4 Â± 0.3 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 16). In HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-containing, CO<sub>2</sub>-bubbled buffer (Krebs Henseleit), baseline CBF before H89 addition was 5.6 Â± 0.3 Hz and after 10 Î¼M H89 addition (10 min) 5.5 Â± 0.3 Hz (P &gt; 0.05). Addition of 10 Î¼M ATP caused an increase of CBF to 7.4 Â± 0.4 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 12).</p>

This decrease was again likely due to acidification caused by CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion across the ciliary membrane (into cilia) at a higher rate compared with apical HCO<sub>3</sub>

Thus, these data show that HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub> in fact stimulates production of cAMP, which stimulates CBF, and that cAMP is produced in a manner consistent with sAC, but not tmAC, activation.</p>
        <p>Since YFP fluorescence can decrease upon acidification (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Griesbeck et al., 2001</xref>), possibly mimicking an increase in FRET ratio (even though the data using 8-Br-cAMPS argued against such a possibility), we compared bilateral HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/CO<sub>2</sub> perfusion with bilateral exposure of permeabilized cells to solutions with different pH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Previous experiments have shown that the decrease in pH<sub>i</sub> upon perfusion with 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>

Bilateral perfusion of basolaterally permeabilized cells with solutions of pH 6.5 increased apparent FRET ratio by only 0.0016 Â± 0.0004 (<italic>n</italic> = 12), significantly less than the value seen with 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>

Thus, changes in YFP fluorescence due solely to acidification are not responsible for the observed changes in the FRET ratio upon 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The discovery of sAC expression in cells other than sperm and the ability of sAC to produce cAMP in vitro upon increases in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> has shed light into the question of how cAMP could be produced within cytoplasmic microdomains that are away from the plasma membrane since these microdomains are surrounded by phosphodiesterases that restrict free diffusion of cAMP throughout the cell (e.g., <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Terrin et al., 2006</xref>). sAC has now been implicated to regulate many cellular functions and is strategically localized to areas with putative changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> inside the cell. Airway epithelial cells are exposed to changing concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>. The airway acidifies in airway disease exacerbations as shown by low pH in exhaled breath condensate in exacerbations of asthma (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ojoo et al., 2005</xref>), COPD, and bronchiectasis (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kostikas et al., 2002</xref>). Inflammation causes persistent intra- and extracellular airway acidification similar to arthritic joints (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andersson et al., 1999</xref>), possibly through cytokine-mediated, increased activity of a dual NADPH oxidase expressed in airway epithelial cells that produces intracellular H<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer et al., 2004</xref>). Since acidification itself has a negative effect on CBF (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sutto et al., 2004</xref>), compensation mechanisms involving activation of sAC are possibly critical for adequate function of airway epithelial cells in vivo. In support of this notion, a recent publication has shown interactions of sAC activity and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in an airway epithelial cell line (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) and in the corneal epithelium (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since sAC has been shown to regulate sperm motility and since one of the major functions of airway epithelial cells is to maintain adequate mucociliary clearance through ciliary activity, we wanted to explore whether sAC is expressed in airway epithelial cells and whether it is involved in regulating ciliary beating upon changes in [CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>]. We have previously shown that changes in intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in the absence of HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> directly modify CBF (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sutto et al., 2004</xref>) and that intracellular acidification decreases CBF. Since biological systems contain CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> buffers, it is likely that the cell will try to counterbalance a decrease in pH through influx or production of HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>. Under these conditions, sAC would be activated and produce cAMP, a second messenger known to stimulate CBF via activation of an axonemal PKA (e.g., <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson and Dirksen, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lansley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kultgen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, this signaling is expected to counterbalance the negative effects of acidification on ciliary beating.</p>
      <p>Our data presented here show that sAC is in fact expressed in airway epithelial cells. RT-PCR revealed three variants, two of which have been previously reported. It remains unclear whether any of these variant transcripts give rise to polypeptides with distinct enzymatic activity (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2005</xref>) but two of them miss part of the first catalytic subunit. Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies revealed that three known variants of sAC (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jaiswal and Conti, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2005</xref>) were present in airway epithelial cells, resulting in immunopositive bands at â¼50, 75, and 190 kD as described before in other cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2005</xref>). Most interestingly, however, cilia contained only the 50-kD form, which was depleted in deciliated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). It remains unclear why and how this isoform is so specifically localized to the axoneme while the other forms remain in the cell body.</p>
      <p>The results obtained by Western blotting with the polyclonal antibodies were confirmed using a monoclonal antibody (R41) (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zippin et al., 2003</xref>). Immunofluorescence showed specific staining associated with cilia and the apical pole of airway cells both in sections from human tracheas as well as in airway epithelial cells cultured and fully redifferentiated at the ALI.</p>
      <p>While the expression and localization data were convincing, it was much harder to show the relevance of sAC activity to ciliary beating. The reason for this problem was the sensitivity of CBF to changes in pH<sub>i</sub>, independent of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sutto et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore had to dissect CBF responses to pH (which are independent of cAMP and PKA) from responses to CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> (which are presumably dependent on sAC, cAMP, and PKA). Since it is not possible to measure [CO<sub>2</sub>] or [HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes in real time, experiments with inhibitors of sAC and PKA were used instead.</p>
      <p>To achieve changes in [CO<sub>2</sub>] and [HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we executed a series of apical and basolateral perfusion changes using airway epithelial cells cultured and redifferentiated at the ALI. First, the apical perfusate was changed in nonpermeabilized cells to a solution buffered with 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>, while the basolateral perfusion was maintained with a HEPES-buffered, no HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-containing solution. Here, the suspected sAC activation by HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/ CO<sub>2</sub> was revealed by showing that inclusion of the specific sAC inhibitor KH7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) resulted in a larger degree of CBF decrease.</p>
      <p>We repeated these experiments with basolaterally permeabilized airway epithelial cells grown and differentiated at the ALI. First, the apical perfusate was switched from a HEPES-buffered solution to a 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>-buffered solution. Again, there was a decrease in CBF likely due to a decrease in pH<sub>i</sub> from CO<sub>2</sub> influx that could not be buffered by the basolateral, HEPES-containing solution. The decrease in CBF, however, was larger upon inhibition of PKA by H89 and of sAC by the specific inhibitor KH7. When the basolateral solution was subsequently exchanged with one containing 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>, CBF increased and this increase was again inhibited by H89 and KH7. Thus, these results strongly suggested that CBF is sensitive to changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> that stimulate sAC to produce cAMP, which in turn activates PKA.</p>
      <p>To finally show that cAMP is indeed produced by these cells in response to changing HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>, we used ciliated airway epithelial cells expressing fluorescently tagged PKA subunits that were introduced into undifferentiated cells via infection with recombinant, replication-deficient HIV-pseudotyped lentiviruses driving the expression of the fusion proteins with the ciliated cell-specific promoter foxj1 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). These cells allow direct measurement of PKA activation by changes in the FRET ratio between the regulatory subunit (RII) labeled with CFP and the catalytic subunit labeled with YFP. This activation or change in FRET is directly proportional to [cAMP] (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). These experiments not only confirmed cAMP production in ciliated cells upon increases in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>, they also showed that CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-mediated cAMP production was inhibited with sAC inhibitors, including KH7 and 2-hydroxy-17Î²-estradiol, but not with the tmAC inhibitor SQ22536 or the inactive 2-hydroxy-17Î²-estradiol analogue estrone. SQ22536 on the other hand both blocked cAMP production and CBF changes upon stimulation of the cells with forskolin, a tmAC inhibitor, while KH7 had no effect on these responses. Further specificity of the FRET ratio changes was confirmed by using a competitive inhibitor of PKA (blocking its dissociation), 8-Br-CAMPS, which inhibited tagged PKA activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since decreases in pH reduce the fluorescence of YFP, thereby possibly mimicking an increase in the FRET ratio, we also examined the direct effect of pH on FRET in basolaterally permeabilized cells (in the absence of HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>). Since 25 mM HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> results in an approximate intracellular pH decrease of 0.5 units (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sutto et al., 2004</xref>), pH<sub>i</sub> was changed to 6.5 using basolateral perfusion. While this pH change slightly increased apparent FRET ratio, the increase was significantly lower than the increase seen upon CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> perfusion. Since the inhibitor experiments also blocked the change in FRET ratio, these data strongly suggest that the recorded FRET ratio change is a true reflection of changes in intracellular cAMP and not of changes in pH.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have shown that sAC is expressed in airway epithelial cells and that at least one particular isoform is localized to the axoneme. In addition, we show functional evidence of involvement of sAC in ciliary beat regulation. Finally, we show real-time evidence for reversible, HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup>-mediated cAMP production in ciliated cells using cAMP-reporter constructs in living cells on a real-time basis, confirming the importance of sAC-mediated cAMP production in intact cells.</p>
