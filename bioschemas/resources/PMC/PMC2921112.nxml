        <p>Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a new CREB kinase for phosphorylation at Ser-271 but not Ser-133 in genotoxic stress and activates CREB transactivation function including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein) is a stimulus-induced transcription factor that plays pivotal roles in cell survival and proliferation. The transactivation function of CREB is primarily regulated through Ser-133 phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and related kinases. Here we found that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), a DNA-damage responsive nuclear kinase, is a new CREB kinase for phosphorylation at Ser-271 but not Ser-133, and activates CREB transactivation function including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression. Ser-271 to Glu-271 substitution potentiated the CREB transactivation function. ChIP assays in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that CREB Ser-271 phosphorylation by HIPK2 increased recruitment of a transcriptional coactivator CBP (CREB binding protein) without modulation of CREB binding to the BDNF CRE sequence. HIPK2â/â MEF cells were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by etoposide, a DNA-damaging agent, than HIPK2+/+ cells. Etoposide activated CRE-dependent transcription in HIPK2+/+ MEF cells but not in HIPK2â/â cells. HIPK2 knockdown in SH-SY5Y cells decreased etoposide-induced BDNF mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that HIPK2 is a new CREB kinase that regulates CREB-dependent transcription in genotoxic stress.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) belongs to the b-zip transcription factor family that contains a basic region for DNA binding and a leucine zipper domain involving dimerization within the same family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>). ATF1 (activating transcription factor 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hai <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>) and CREM (cAMP response element modulator; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Foulkes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>) are closely related to CREB in their amino acid sequences and functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>). Besides a constitutive transactivator function of CREB through interaction with TORCs (transducers of regulated CREB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Conkright <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), CREB is a stimulus-coupled transcription factor that plays a crucial role in a wide range of signaling pathways such as those triggered by G-proteinâcoupled receptors, neurotrophin receptors, growth factor receptors, and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>). CREB is also involved in neuroprotection under hypoxia and oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>). Stimulus-coupled activation of CREB has been extensively studied, in which PKA (protein kinase A; cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and several other serine/threonine kinases activate transactivation function of CREB through phosphorylation at Serine 133 located in the kinase-inducible domain (KID domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>). The activation of CREB-mediated gene transcription is facilitated by subsequent recruitment of CREB-associated coactivator proteins such as CBP (CREB-binding protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chrivia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>) via the KID interaction (KIX) domain, whereas RGS13 (regulator of G-protein signaling) serves as a nuclear inhibitor of CREB transactivation function by interacting with Serine 133âphosphorylated CREB and CBP/p300 and decreasing both CREB binding to DNA and its interaction with CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Besides CREB phosphorylation at Serine 133, calcium influx into neuronal cells was shown to induce CREB phosphorylation at two additional sites at Serines 142 and 143, in which the involvement of calmodulin kinase or casein kinase II was suggested by the effects of pharmacological inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kornhauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of Serines 142 and 143 along with Serine 133 phosphorylation was required for efficient CREB-dependent transcription induced by calcium influx despite a decreased interaction between the CREB KID domain and the CBP KIX domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kornhauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is one of the major CREB-target genes regulated by calcium and plays a vital role in cell survival and adaptive neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Shieh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Tao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). CREB is also involved in genotoxic stress-coupled gene transcription during oxidative stress and DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation, UV light, and hydrogen peroxide. These stressors were shown to induce multiple and sequential phosphorylation of CREB leading to Serine 121 phosphorylation by the DNA damage-response kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasiaâmutated) and casein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Shanware <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, these phosphorylation events on CREB induced by DNA damage inhibited CREBâCBP interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Shanware <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), resulting in inhibition of CREB transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Genotoxic stress activates a variety of protein kinases that relay signals to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), within a family of nuclear serine-threonine kinases that share significant homologies with the Dyrk dual specificity kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) has recently been characterized as a DNA-damage responsive kinase that plays a key regulatory role in both cell survival and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Rinaldo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). For instance, HIPK2 was shown to be proapoptotic in response to UV light exposure through direct phosphorylation of p53 at Serine 46, preventing MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and ultimately leading to activation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">D'Orazi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Accumulating evidence has shown that broader genotoxic stress agents including ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Dauth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents (such as cisplatin and doxorubicin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Di Stefano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Calzado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Rinaldo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor roscovitine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Wesierska-Gadek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) activate HIPK2, which in turn activates p53. In addition to p53-dependent proapoptotic role of HIPK2, the transcriptional corepressor and antiapoptotic protein CtBP was shown to be phosphorylated at Serine 422 by HIPK2, resulting in CtBP degradation by the proteasome and promoting UV-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). HIPK2 also plays an antiapoptotic role; for instance, HIPK2 is crucial for TGF-Î²âmediated survival of midbrain dopamine neurons through its interaction with Smads for activation of TGF-Î² target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, it was demonstrated that loss of HIPK2 caused increased proliferative potential in association with suppression of Î²-cateninâmediated activation of cyclin D1, and in the same study the loss of HIPK2 increased susceptibility to the two-stage carcinogenesis protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), suggesting that HIPK2 has a tumor suppressor function.</p><p>To date, only a few HIPK2 protein substrates, their phosphorylation sites, and the biofunctional impact of phosphorylation have been identified and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">D'Orazi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Wee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), even though dozens of cellular proteins have been reported to be regulated by HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Rinaldo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this study we found that HIPK2 is a new CREB kinase that phosphorylates Serine 271 but not Serine 133 and regulates CREB-dependent gene transcription including the BDNF gene and genotoxic response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and Reagents</title><p>SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma, K562 human erythroleukemia, and 293 human embryonal kidney cells transformed with adenovirus 5 DNA were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

As a control experiment, we incubated recombinant PKA with these recombinant CREB proteins to verify that our 133A CREB mutants are devoid of PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Indeed, PKA phosphorylated wt and 271A CREB proteins but failed to phosphorylate 133A and 133A/271A mutant CREB proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).

After expression of wtCREB alone or coexpression of wtCREB or 271A CREB mutant together with HIPK2 in SH-SY5Y cells, ChIP assays were performed to measure interaction of endogenous CBP with the CRE site in the BDNF promoter III.

HIPK2 preferentially phosphorylates Serine/Threonine sites adjacent to Proline: Ser46-Pro47 in p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">D'Orazi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), Pro421-Ser422-Pro423 in CtBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), Pro296-Ser297 in Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Choi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), Ser249-Pro250 and Ser276-Pro277 in AML1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and Thr281-Pro282, Thr304-Pro305, and Thr373-Pro374 in Pax6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The amino acid sequences containing CREB Serine 271 are Val-Val-Met-Ala-Ser-<italic>Ser271</italic>-Pro, which is highly conserved in ATF1 as Val-Val-Met-Thr-<italic>Ser198</italic>-Pro. Indeed, our preliminary results suggested that ATF1 at Serine 198 appears to be phosphorylated by HIPK2 (Hailemariam and Tsuji, unpublished observation). We observed retarded migration of phosphorylated CREB at Serine 271 by HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), similar to the retarded migration of Groucho, AML1, and Pax 6 phosphorylated by HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Choi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), but not CREB phosphorylation at Serine 133 by PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Protein phosphorylation has been shown to alter the stability of various transcription factors and coregulators including enhanced degradation of CtBP via Serine 422 phosphorylation by HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>); however, CREB Serine 271 phosphorylation does not appear to affect the protein stability because CREB expression levels after HIPK2 overexpression looked unchanged, along with the results showing no difference in protein expression of wtCREB and Ser271Ala mutant CREB when HIPK2 was coexpressed for 24â48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Phosphorylation affects protein localization such as the cases of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. We tested whether phosphorylation of CREB by HIPK2 facilitates the nuclear localization of endogenous and transfected CREB by Western blotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions after HIPK2 overexpression. Our results showed that endogenous and transfected CREB proteins in K562, SH-SY5Y, and 293 cells almost exclusively localized in nucleus regardless of HIPK2 overexpression or the Serine 271 mutated CREB (Supplemental Figure S3). Phosphorylation of CREB at Serine 133 was reported to increase DNA binding to some CRE sites despite more contradictory results that indicate no impact on the DNA binding ability of CREB upon Serine 133 phosphorylation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999</xref>). We tested this possibility by ChIP assays for the CRE sequence in the exon III of the BDNF promoter or by gel retardation assays for binding to the consensus CREB sequence (TGACGTCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S1), both of which suggested that CREB Serine 271 phosphorylation by HIPK2 does not modulate its DNA binding.</p><p>The transactivation function of CREB is regulated by interactions between CREB and its binding proteins. The interaction of CREB and CBP is primarily regulated by phosphorylation of CREB by PKA and other Serine 133 kinases, in which both the KID domain of CREB where Serine 133 is located and the KIX domain of CBP are involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chrivia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Our ChIP assay showed that phosphorylated CREB by HIPK2 increased or stabilized CBP recruitment to the CRE site in the BDNF exon III promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The CREB 271A mutant showed decreased association with CBP compared with wtCREB despite the equivalent binding to the CRE site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Serine 271 in CREB is located adjacent to the second glutamine-rich region (Q2/CAD) and the basic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), involved in constitutive activation of CREB and DNA binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999</xref>). It was demonstrated that phosphorylation of Serine 142 and 143 in the CREB KID domain during calcium influx into neurons decreased the binding of CREB to the KIX domain of CBP, even though the CREB-dependent transcription was ultimately activated by the cooperative phosphorylation of CREB at Serine 133 by calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kornhauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Similarly, ionizing radiation/ATM-induced phosphorylation of CREB at Serine 121 in the KID domain decreased interaction between CREB and CBP, resulting in decreased CREB transactivation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). These results suggest that additional phosphorylation events on CREB have the potential to alter interactions between CREB and CREB-binding proteins. In genotoxic stress and other yet uncharacterized conditions that activate HIPK2, cells may recruit the new mechanism of CREB activation and induction of CREB-target genes, that is through HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation of Serine 271 and facilitated interaction with CBP as demonstrated in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, HIPK2 forms a complex with the coactivator p300 and AML1, phosphorylates p300 at multiple Serine/Threonine sites and activates p300 HAT activity and coactivator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). It is therefore likely that HIPK2 activates transcription of CREB target genes in genotoxic stress conditions not only through the increased interaction of CREB-CBP but also activation CBP/p300 via direct phosphorylation. Further investigation will be necessary for understanding additional roles of HIPK2 in CREB-dependent gene transcription.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Regulation of CREB by HIPK2 in genotoxic stress. CREB is activated through phosphorylation of Serine 133 in the KID domain by PKA and related kinases in response to various receptor-mediated stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>). This study demonstrated that genotoxic stress, such as etoposide, activates HIPK2, which in turn activates CREB through phosphorylation of Serine 271 adjacent to the Q2 domain and the b-zip domain of CREB. HIPK2 does not phosphorylate CREB at Serine 133. Phosphorylation of CREB at Serine 271 by HIPK2 increases CBP recruitment. CREB phosphorylation besides these two sites is discussed in the text and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Johannessen <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmk0161095480008"/></fig><p>HIPK2 is expressed in various cell types, but its expression levels are relatively very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Despite our trials of almost all commercially available anti-HIPK2 antibodies, we failed to detect expression of endogenous HIPK2 protein by Western or immunoprecipitation/Western approach. Our results using HIPK2+/+ and â/â MEF cells showed that etoposide activated CRE-dependent transcription only in HIPK2+/+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Furthermore, HIPK2-deficient MEF cells were highly susceptible to etoposide toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). We speculated that the higher susceptibility to etoposide toxicity in HIPK2-deficient cells was, at least in part, due to the lack of expression of CRE-dependent genes serving as cell survival. Particularly in neuronal cells, CREB is a crucial transcription factor for cell survival and adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>), and BDNF is a CREB-regulated gene that plays a vital role in neuronal cell survival, differentiation, and adaptive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Shieh <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Tao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). We measured mRNA expression of several CREB-target genes in SH-SY5Y cells after etoposide treatment, in which BDNF mRNA expression showed highest induction with 10 Î¼M etoposide within 24 h. The induction of BDNF mRNA by etoposide was 50% blocked by HIPK2 knockdown in SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D), suggesting that HIPK2 is involved in etoposide-induced BDNF mRNA expression. HIPK2 was demonstrated to be proapoptotic through p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">D'Orazi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hofmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) or CtBP degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) while also serving as a prosurvival factor through Smads-regulated TGF-Î²âdependent gene expression in midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Cells may integrate these two opposing events or select either proapoptotic or prosurvival function of HIPK2, depending on the type of stress/environmental cues, magnitude of cell damage, and the type of cells and tissues.</p><p>In summary, this work has demonstrated that genotoxic stress activates another pathway of CREB regulation, in which HIPK2 phosphorylates CREB Ser-271 (but not Ser-133) and activates CREB-dependent transcription such as the BDNF gene through increased interaction with the coactivator CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). These results shed light on a new regulatory mechanism of CREB in genotoxic stress.</p></sec>
