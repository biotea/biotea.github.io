          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Colocalization of Stk33 with vimentin by double immunofluorescence in certain cells indicated that vimentin might be a target for phosphorylation by the novel kinase Stk33. We therefore tested <italic>in vitro </italic>the ability of Stk33 to phosphorylate recombinant full length vimentin and amino-terminal truncated versions thereof. In order to prove that Stk33 and vimentin are also <italic>in vivo </italic>associated proteins co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. For testing the enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Stk33 we incubated precipitated Stk33 with recombinant vimentin proteins. To investigate whether Stk33 binds directly to vimentin, an <italic>in vitro </italic>co-sedimentation assay was performed.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>The results of the kinase assays demonstrate that Stk33 is able to specifically phosphorylate the non-Î±-helical amino-terminal domain of vimentin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments employing cultured cell extracts indicate that Stk33 and vimentin are associated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immunoprecipitated Stk33 has enzymatic activity as shown by successful phosphorylation of recombinant vimentin proteins. The results of the co-sedimentation assay suggest that vimentin binds directly to Stk33 and that no additional protein mediates the association.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We hypothesize that Stk33 is involved in the <italic>in vivo </italic>dynamics of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylating vimentin.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>STK33/Stk33 is a serine/threonine kinase discovered in the course of sequencing the human chromosome 11 region 11p15 and mouse chromosome 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The <italic>Stk33 </italic>gene in the mouse (and also <italic>STK33 </italic>in human) is expressed differentially in a number of specific tissues and cells like testes, lung epithelia, alveolar macrophages, and horizontal cells in the retina. In mouse embryos <italic>Stk33 </italic>expression is found in the developing heart, brain and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Based on sequence comparison with other kinases the STK33/Stk33 protein was classified as a member of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase family (CAMK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>The CAMK group is a family of multifunctional kinases: CAMK I, CAMK II and CAMK IV. Among the most well characterized CAMKs is Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. CAMK II can phosphorylate a wide range of substrates and regulates numerous cellular functions including cell division, differentiation, cardiac contraction, and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CAMK II is abundantly expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and a major effector for calcium-dependent signaling in neurons. The important neuronal function of CAMK II Î± has been demonstrated by analysing mice with certain mutated forms of CAMK II Î± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In comparison with CAMK II Î± little is known about the CAMK II Î² subunit despite its prevailing appearance in the central nervous system. Alternative splicing variants of CAMK II Î² in brain with different kinase activity were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast to Î± and Î² isoforms predominantly expressed in neural tissues, the Î´ isoforms of CAMK II prevail in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The CAMK II Î³ isoform is mainly expressed in differentiated smooth muscle cells (dSMC). A novel variant of the Î³ isoform, CAMK II Î³ G-2, can be found in several smooth muscles, in heart and brain, but not in skeletal muscle and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In unstimulated dSMCs it colocalizes with vimentin. Activation with a depolarizing stimulus leads to autophosphorylation of CAMK II and phosphorylation of vimentin at CAMK II specific sites. As a consequence CAMK II bound to cytoskeletal vimentin is now translocated into the cytosol. This targeting is essential for signaling in differentiated smooth muscle cells because prevention of CAMK II targeting by antisense knockdown of CAMK II Î³ G-2 leads to inhibition of ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) activation as well as to inhibition of muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Anchoring CAMK II Î³ G-2 to vimentin in unstimulated cells is discussed as a prerequisite for optimal kinase activation or for spatial separation of the kinase and its substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Serine 38 and serine 82 of vimentin are the major <italic>in vitr</italic>o and <italic>in vivo </italic>phosphorylation sites by CAMK II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In cells infected with the cytoplasmatic DNA virus ASFV (African Swine Fever Virus) viral DNA replication resulted in activation of CAMK II and phosphorylation of vimentin on serine 82 by CAMK II. Incubation of cells with an inhibitor of CAMK II, KN93, prevented phosphorylation of vimentin and blocked both viral DNA replication and late gene expression. This underlines that CAMK activation is required for late ASFV gene expression, but the precise role played by CAMK II in ASFV DNA replication is still unknown. In virus infected cells vimentin phosphorylated on serine 82 disassembles into aggregates which are transported along microtubules and are reorganized into a cage like structure around virus assembly site. This vimentin cage has on the one hand a cytoprotective function by preventing the diffusion of viral components into cytoplasm and on the other hand it concentrates late structural proteins at site of virus assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state regulates the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. The major vimentin phosphatase <italic>in vivo </italic>is type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. PP1c is <italic>in vivo </italic>associated with vimentin and dephosphorylates the CAMK II-specific phosphorylation sites of vimentin Ser38 and Ser82. Phospho-Ser82 of vimentin is dephosphorylated much slower than phospho-Ser38 by PP1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This delayed Ser82 dephosphorylation might influence the dynamics of vimentin filament assembly/disassembly. A requirement for cell division during mitosis is the reorganization of the intermediate filament system through phosphorylation of vimentin as demonstrated by site-specific mutation of vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the case of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a kinase which also phosphorylates vimentin Ser82 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], elevated Ser82 phosphorylation by Plk1 may play a role in efficient segregation of vimentin filaments during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as phospho-Ser82 on vimentin is hardly dephosphorylated by PP1 in mitosis. Phospho-Ser82 may act as a memory phosphorylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>The different sites available for serine/threonine phosphorylation in vimentin are targeted by different kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since we found the striking colocalization of vimentin and Stk33 in various cell types and tissues (manuscript in preparation), we were prompted to investigate whether Stk33 might be another kinase to phosphorylate vimentin.</p>
      <p>Stk33 is a serine/threonine kinase of so far unknown function. In the present study we used bacterially expressed recombinant mouse Stk33 with several artificial vimentin deletion mutant polypeptides also expressed as recombinant proteins in <italic>E. coli </italic>for <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylation assays. In addition we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with protein extracts obtained from the mouse Sertoli cell culture SerW3. We know from previous studies (manuscript in preparation) that Stk33 and vimentin are coexpressed and colocalized in Sertoli cells of mouse testes. So, Sertoli cells should be an ideal resource for gaining native interacting Stk33 and vimentin.</p>
      <p>However, from our previous studies it is also clear, that Stk33 is not always expressed in cells together with vimentin. We find Stk33 in vimentin-negative cells, too.</p>
      <p>The differential expression pattern of Stk33 in mice and men resembles those of some members of the CAMK-Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Stk33 and CAMKII might have similar functions for example in the dynamic regulation of the intermediate filament system by phosphorylation in the course of the separation of daughter cells during mitosis. Stk33 is expressed very specifically in some organs of the developing mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, Stk33 could play also a role in organ development in addition to its function in phosphorylating vimentin. In this study, however we show that vimentin is a target for phosphorylation by Stk33 <italic>in vitro </italic>and that Stk33 and vimentin can be co-immunoprecipitated indicating a close interaction also <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Kinase assay</title>
        <p>The recombinant Stk33 enzyme was expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>and affinity purified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It contains all canonical kinase subdomains and signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and also the epitope for the anti-Stk33 antibody used in this study, which is located N-terminal to the kinase domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition to nearly full length enzyme, a naturally occurring splice variant of Stk33, Stk33Î´ was also tested in the assay. This splice variant was cloned and expressed as described for recombinant nearly full length Stk33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] [GenBank:AM056057]. In this splice variant, there are 27 base pairs within the kinase domain missing. Parts of the missing amino acid sequence include the DFG-triplet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). It is known, these amino acids are responsible for anchoring the phosphate donor ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. So this splice variant should produce an inactive form of Stk33 kinase. The recombinantly expressed Stk33Î´ isoform was tested for both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of substrates such as vimentin wildtype and casein. As a positive control PKA catalytic subunit was used because it readily phosphorylates casein. This PKA catalytic subunit is not able to phosphorylate itself. Recombinant vimentin wildtype protein and different deletion derivatives expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>were used as major targets in the assay. One technical problem had to be circumvented: Recombinant Stk33 and wildtype vimentin have a very similar electrophoretic mobility, and as we could show Stk33 is able to perform autophosphorylation. Thus on normal PAGE a discrimination between autophosphorylated Stk33 and phosphorylated wildtype vimentin is hardly possible. Therefore, the vimentin wildtype monomer was treated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] to form crosslinked vimentin tetramers with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 180 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This tetramer form of vimentin was included in the phosphorylation assay. Furthermore a number of vimentin mutants with different molecular weights were used in the kinase assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 2â6 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The deletion variants of human vimentin used are Î12, Î 20, Î 30, Î 42 and Î 50, the numbers indicate how many amino acids were deleted from the amino-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, a mutant vimentin missing the entire non-Î±-helical amino-terminal domain ("head") was employed.</p>

        <p>Recombinant mouse Stk33 kinase was incubated with Î³ <sup>32</sup>P ATP with the various substrates under optimized conditions tested previously. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by direct autoradiography. The results clearly demonstrate (autoradiographs shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D, E</xref>) that: i) Stk33 (complete kinase domain) is able to perform autophosphorylation. The incubation of Stk33 without any other substrate (lane Stk33 only; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 6; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lanes 3, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, lane 12) leads to a strong radiolabeled band with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to the one of Stk33 (black arrowhead); ii) The derivative of Stk33, Stk33Î´ in which part of the kinase domain is deleted is not able to perform autophosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lanes 1â3; white arrowhead). Furthermore, Stk33Î´ is not able to phosphorylate any of the tested substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 2 and 3) in contrast to Stk33 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 4); iii) Stk33 clearly phosphorylates vimentin <italic>in vitro </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lane 5 and 7; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9; arrows). By using the vimentin tetramer as substrate, differentiation between autophosphorylated Stk33 and phosphorylated vimentin wildtype is clearly possible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lane 5; arrow).</p>
        <p>When Stk33 is incubated together with wildtpye vimentin and the deletion variants Î12 to Î50, a preferred phosphorylation of vimentin over Stk33 is observed, however, there is always a basic autophosphorylation of Stk33 recognizable (black arrowhead in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So far it is not clear, whether the autophosphorylation is a prerequisite for the kinasing activity of Stk33 or whether also unphosphorylated Stk33 is able to phosphorylate vimentin. The limited resolution of deletion variants Î30 and Î42 in the gel might be related to a different extent of phosphorylation in truncated vimentin Î30 compared to Î42 and therefore a changed electrophoretic mobility might be the consequence, but this is speculation.</p>
        <p>Notably, the truncation mutants Î12, Î20 and Î30 are phosphorylated to a higher extent than Î42 and Î50 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Therefore we conclude that, since headless vimentin is not phosphorylated at all, only the head domain of vimentin is phosphorylated and furthermore that sites both on the first 30 amino acids and sites after amino acid 30 up to the end of the head domain are phosphorylated.</p>
        <p>As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, lane 11 it is difficult to visualize the only minute different position between autophosphorylated Stk33 and vimentin on an autoradiograph as Stk33 and vimentin have the same electrophoretic migration behaviour in a PAGE. The samples on the gel of the autoradiography 2 D were electrophoretically resolved by a longer running time than 2 E to achieve a better separation. Therefore, in lane 11, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> (shorter running time) the resolution is not good enough to resolve the two proteins of nearly identical molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility. Vimentin phosporylated by Stk33 (lane 7, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) or by PKA (lane 9, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) appears to migrate slightly different. The extent of phosphorylation might be different inducing a phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift on gels.</p>

        <title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
        <p>In order to prove that Stk33 and vimentin are also <italic>in vivo </italic>associated proteins co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. As a positive control recombinant nearly full length Stk33 protein was precipitated using protein A sepharose and anti-Stk33 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For all co-immunoprecipitation experiments Sertoli cell culture SerW3 was used. All protein samples (total protein extract from SerW3, samples of washing steps, precipitated proteins and recombinant proteins as positive controls for Western detection) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after preheating in non-reducing Laemmli buffer. Therefore, the main portion of IgG molecules is still present. The appearance of a band corresponding to the IgG heavy chain is perhaps explainable because of heating during probe preparation.</p>
        <p>Cellular Stk33 could be readily immunoprecipitated from protein extracts of cultured Sertoli cells SerW3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 5; arrow). The apparent molecular weight of the immunoprecipitated Stk33 is obviously the same as the Stk33 protein detected in unprecipitated SerW3 total protein extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 1; arrow). The additional bands (very strong signals, filled and open arrowheads) probably arise from the IgG molecules not removed from the reactions mixtures (upper band, filled arrowhead â whole IgG; lower band, open arrowhead â IgG heavy chain).</p>

        <title>Testing enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Stk33 by a kinase assay</title>
        <p>The incubation of radioactive Î³ <sup>32</sup>P ATP and recombinant vimentin protein with the co-immunocomplex obtained by co-precipitation of Stk33 and vimentin shows that immunoprecipitated Stk33 has kinase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, arrowhead) and is able to phosphorylate recombinant vimentin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, arrow). The enzymatic activity of the precipitated enzyme might be reduced by storing the immunocomplex at 4Â°C during time for Western Blotting experiments to check for successful co-immunoprecipitation which is a prerequirement for testing the enzymatic activity of Stk33. A third protein with an apparent molecular weight of about 35 kDa seems to be also co-precipitated by anti-Stk33 since a radioactively labelled additional band appears after autoradiography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, asterisk). As this additional band is not visible after anti-Stk33 reaction it is probably not a splice variant of Stk33.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the novel serine/threonine kinase Stk33 phosporylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin. The motivation to test this was a striking colocalization of vimentin and Stk33 in various tissues and differentiated cells (manuscript in preparation). The results of the <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase assays and of the co-immunoprecipitation studies are very clear:</p>
      <p>Stk33 is able to phosporylate vimentin <italic>in vitro </italic>and vimentin and Stk33 form a complex <italic>in vivo </italic>which can be readily co-precipitated by the use of an anti-Stk33 antibody. Stk33 binds directly to vimentin as determined by the co-sedimentation assay. Therefore, none intermediate protein mediates this association. We conclude that Stk33 plays a specific role in the dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylation of vimentin. It is known that phylogenetically related genes often have similar functions. Thus it is not too surprising that Stk33 -a member of the family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]- is able to phosphorylate vimentin. CAMKII among other kinases is one of the major kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In that respect it is interesting that Stk33 undergoes autophosphorylation. Whether the autophosphorylation of Stk33 is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of vimentin is not known. However, it is known, that autophosphorylation is the key event in the phosphorylation process of other members of the CAMK group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>Intermediate filament proteins form the largest family of cytoskeletal proteins in mammalian cells. Intermediate filament proteins can be classificated into six types based on their gene structure, sequence homology and immunological and/or assembly properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Vimentin belongs to type III of intermediate filament proteins which also comprises desmin, GFAP and peripherin.</p>
      <p>IF proteins are composed of an amino-terminal head, a central rod and a carboxy-terminal tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The rod domain is subdivided into further segments by non-Î±-helical regions, called linker. The head domain is essential for IF assembly and the tail for the control of lateral association. Dimerization is mediated by the rod-domain.</p>
      <p>Most of the kinases phosphorylate sites on IF proteins located in the amino-terminal non Î±-helical head domain (e.g. cdc2 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], CaMKII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], p21-activated kinase (PAK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Stk33 shows similar head domain specificity: It phosphorylates different head domain deletion derivatives, but is not able to phosphorylate vimentin in which the head domain is deleted completely. Vimentin with 50 amino acids missing from the animo-terminus is still phosphorylated by Stk33 in contrast to vimentin missing 80 amino acids. Therefore we conclude that Stk33 phosphorylates one or more of the phosphorylation sites known from other kinases. The potential phosphorylation sites beyond the head domain (downstream of amino acid 81) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and in the tail domain of vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] are not phosphorylated by Stk33. We can therefore be rather confident that the phosphorylation sites for Stk33 are located in the vimentin head-domain.</p>
      <p>In spite of the differentiation- and tissue-specific expression patterns, the function of the intermediate filament proteins has long been considered to be just structural. By forming a continuous network stretched from the nuclear surface to the cell membrane and associated in tight interaction with the nuclear lamina and the nuclear cytoskeleton, it is assumed that intermediate filaments modulate and control signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The dynamic behaviour of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton is under control of kinases and phosphatases leading to structural changes of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton like reorganization, solubilization or collapse. Various types of serine/threonine protein kinases phosphorylate intermediate filament proteins <italic>in vitro </italic>leading to disassembly of the filament structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Up to now we do not yet know whether phosphorylation of vimentin by Stk33 causes disassembly albeit this is conceivable because high levels of vimentin phosphorylation often lead to structural alterations of the filament system.</p>
      <p>The remodelling between polymerized intermediate filaments (long filaments and short filaments called squiggles) and non-filamentous particles is regulated by kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Among the different structural filament forms the non-filamentous precursors (particles) are the most interesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It has been reported that these particles can move long distances at high speed along microtubules with the help of molecular motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Filament precursors are delivered to special regions within the cell, where an assembly to long intermediate filaments takes place. Such flexibility enables cell movement and reorganization of the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the bi-directional movement of vimentin intermediate filaments along microtubule enables a kinase signaling over long distances within a cell. This is of special interest in neurons, where signals generated in axonal or dendritic processes have to travel long distances to the cell body (retrograde transport), especially to the nucleus, where the kinase can affect gene expression. The transport complex consisting of phosphorylated MAP kinase Erk1/2, importin Î² and dynein requires vimentin particles for movement along microtubule fibres in injured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Normally, adult neurons express only terminally differentiated neuronal intermediate filament proteins like neurofilament proteins, but translationally silenced vimentin mRNA is activated and synthesized in lesioned nerves. As only soluble vimentin particles are capable of binding a kinase, de novo synthesized vimentin protein has to be disassembled into particles by phosphorylation or by modification through proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. De novo synthesized vimentin is therefore exposed to high calcium concentrations that prevent assembly of vimentin particles to filaments due to vimentin phosphorylation by CAMKII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] or due to calpain-mediated cleavage of vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The creation of the kinase/vimentin complex is only possible with a phosphorylated kinase and it is promoted at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations (e.g. near site of nerve injury). On the contrary, the complex dissociates near the cell body where the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. During the retrograde transport dephosphorylation of pErk is avoided as long as vimentin stays bound to the kinase. Vimentin hides phosphorylated residues in the kinase and therefore confines the access of the phosphatase to these residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, other interacting partners are not capable of binding to the kinase, which in turn guarantees the specificity of the transmitted signal. Interestingly, this kinase transport mechanism described for lesioned nerves is not possible in vimentin null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Besides several defects (e.g. in cerebellar glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]) vimentin-null mice show a defective wound repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], which might be related to the deficit of vimentin-dependent signaling as described for lesioned nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>The dynamic changes of the intermediate filament organization are particularly prominent during cell movement or mitosis and cell division. There is a constant state of flux between non-filamentous components, short filaments and long filaments. In some but not all cell types, vimentin filaments disassemble into aggregates and short filaments during metaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The organizational changes observed during mitosis are accompanied by a significant increase in the phosphorylation state. Site-specific mutation of vimentin and therefore changes in potential phosphorylation sites have been demonstrated to induce the formation of intermediate filament bridges between unseparated daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To elucidate the precise molecular function of Stk33 in vimentin phosphorylation, it is important to determine the specific phosphorylation sites on vimentin by Stk33 which is planned for the future.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our results show that the serine/threonine kinase Stk33 phosphorylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin <italic>in vitro </italic>specifically in the vimentin head domain. Stk33 undergoes obligatory autophosphorylation, which might be a prerequisite for its kinasing activity. By co-immunoprecipitation we were able to co-isolate vimentin together with Stk33 using a polyclonal anti-Stk33 antibody. From this result we conclude that Stk33 and vimentin are interacting protein partners also <italic>in vivo</italic>. This conclusion is strongly supported by the observation that Stk33 and vimentin can be found together in many very specialized cells and tissues (manuscript in preparation). We propose that Stk33 is involved in the dynamics of intermediate filament assembly/disassembly through a specific and regulated phosphorylation of vimentin.</p>

        <p>The kinasing activity of Stk33 was determined in an <italic>in vitro </italic>kinase assay. 0.32 Î¼g recombinant Stk33 and 1.75 Î¼g vimentin/vimentin deletion derivatives were incubated with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>in 1Ã kinase buffer (Na-Hepes pH 7.0, 0.05% Briji). In order to use crosslinked vimentin tetramers as a substrate for Stk33 increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0; 0.005; 0.01; 0.02; 0.04; 0.06%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] were used to form these complexes. As a substrate positive control casein phosphorylated by both Stk33 and Protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (Sigma) was applied to the assay. As a control for a contamination with any endogenous kinase, negative controls (assay without additionally applied Stk33 or PKA) were carried out. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 Î¼Ci Î³ <sup>32</sup>P ATP. After incubation for 2 hours at 30Â°C, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer (125 mM Tris, 4% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 10 mM Î²-Mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.04% Bromphenol blue, pH6.8). Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to loading onto polyacrylamide gels and separation by SDS-PAGE. Gels were finally autoradiographed by exposure to Kodak X-AR films.</p>

To test whether Stk33 and vimentin sedimented together, Western Blotting experiments were carried out using anti-Stk33 and monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate clone RG-96 (Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) for the detection of anti-vimentin Ab-2 (Dianova).</p>

        <title>Testing enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Stk33 by kinase assay</title>
        <p>In order to test whether the immunoprecipitated Stk33 has enzymatic activity we incubated precipitated Stk33 with recombinant vimentin proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out as described before. As a discrimination between autophosphorylated Stk33 and phosphorylated vimentin is hardly possible we used recombinant vimentin with a deletion of 50 amino acids for the phosphorylation studies. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 Î¼Ci Î³ <sup>32</sup>P ATP. After 1 hour at 30Â°C the reaction was stopped by adding non-reducing Laemmli buffer. Further steps were carried out as already described in the kinase assay protocol.</p>

      <title>Authors' contributions</title>
      <p>BB had the initial idea that vimentin might be a substrate for the Stk33 kinase and planned and carried out all experiments. BB wrote also the first draft of the manuscript and prepared the figures. AM was involved in designing the kinase assays and he initially discovered the Stk33 gene and provided the sequence and the DNA for Stk33. HH provided the essential recombinant vimentin protein and deletion derivatives thereof. ERS started as principle investigator the entire research programme in which course the Stk33 gene was discovered, initiated the functional analysis of Stk33, contributed substantially to various versions including the final version of the manuscript and has given final approval of the version to be published. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p>
