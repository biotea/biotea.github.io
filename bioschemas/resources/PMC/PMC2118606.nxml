  <body>
    <p>T cells serve as a central component of the adaptive immune system. A defect in T cell activation results in severe immune deficiencies, whereas deregulated T cell activation is associated with chronic inflammations and autoimmunity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Thus, the process of T cell activation is subject to tight regulation by positive and negative mechanisms. One recently discovered mechanism of T cell regulation is ubiquitination, which plays an important role in both the development and activation of T cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Protein ubiquitination is a reversible process that is counter-regulated by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; reference <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have been extensively studied, little is known about how the DUBs participate in immune regulation, particularly in the regulation of T cell function. We have recently shown that a DUB, CYLD, regulates TCR-proximal signaling in thymocytes and is required for thymocyte development (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), although its role in peripheral T cell function is enigmatic.</p>
    <p>CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Because patients carry a heterozygous mutation of the <italic>Cyld</italic> gene with a loss of heterozygosity occurring only in tumor cells, the physiological function of CYLD was not resolved by the patient studies. The DUB function of CYLD was first revealed by in vitro work showing that CYLD inhibits the ubiquitination of certain TNF receptorâassociated factors and the regulatory subunit of IÎºB kinase ([IKK] IKKÎ³; references <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). When transfected in cell lines, CYLD inhibits the activation of NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinases stimulated by innate immune receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors and TNF receptors (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, recent studies using <italic>Cyld</italic> knockout (<italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic>) mice suggest that the signaling function of CYLD is complex and may vary among different cell types and stimulation conditions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As such, it is still not clear how CYLD regulates NF-ÎºB and other signaling pathways under physiological conditions.</p>
    <p>NF-ÎºB represents a family of transcription factors that plays a central role in regulating the activation and homeostasis of T cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The NF-ÎºB factors are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm through physical interaction with inhibitory proteins, predominantly IÎºBÎ± (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Activation of NF-ÎºB by diverse immunologic stimuli typically involves the degradation of IÎºBÎ±, which, in turn, is triggered through IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation by the IKK (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). IKK is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKÎ± and IKKÎ², and a regulatory subunit termed IKKÎ³ or NF-ÎºB essential modulator. IKKÎ² plays the primary role in mediating the canonical pathway of NF-ÎºB activation, whereas IKKÎ± regulates an alternative pathway involving processing of the NF-ÎºB2 precursor protein p100 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
    <p>Cross-linking of the TCR and CD28 costimulatory molecule in T cells leads to activation of the canonical NF-ÎºB pathway; this signaling cascade involves several intermediate molecules, including CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recent genetic evidence suggests that IKK activation by the TCR signal requires TGF-Î²âactivated kinase 1 (Tak1; references <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), a ubiquitin-dependent kinase (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) known to phosphorylate and activate IKKÎ² (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In addition to activating IKK, Tak1 also mediates the TCR-stimulated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; references <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These findings suggest that Tak1 is a master kinase that mediates the activation of both IKK and JNK, although how Tak1 is regulated in T cells remains elusive. We show in this study that CYLD physically interacts with Tak1 and inhibits its ubiquitination and catalytic activity. The loss of CYLD in T cells results in the constitutive activation of Tak1 and its downstream kinases JNK and IKKÎ². Consistently, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells display a hyperresponsive phenotype and mediate the spontaneous development of intestinal inflammation in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice. These findings establish CYLD as a specific DUB that prevents spontaneous activation of the Tak1 axis of TCR signaling and, thereby, maintains normal T cell responses.</p>

<italic>Cyld</italic>-deficient T cells are hyperresponsive to TCR stimulation in vitro</title>
        <p>To examine how CYLD regulates peripheral T cell activation, we began by analyzing the activation of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells in vitro. Interestingly, the loss of CYLD resulted in the hyperproliferation of lymph node T cells when stimulated with agonistic anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Compared with the wild-type T cells, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells also produced markedly larger amounts of cytokines, including IFN-Î³ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and IL-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with splenic T cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1</ext-link>). To determine whether the hyperresponsive phenotype of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells occurred in the naive or memory population, we purified these cells by flow cytometric cell sorting. Remarkably, the loss of CYLD resulted in hyperproliferation and aberrant cytokine production in both naive and memory T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). These results suggest a pivotal role for CYLD in negatively regulating peripheral T cell activation.</p>

<italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice spontaneously develop autoimmune symptoms and colonic inflammation</title>
        <p>Because abnormal T cell responses are often associated with chronic inflammations and autoimmunity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), we examined whether <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice develop immunological abnormalities. Even at early ages (8 wk), the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice exhibited prominent lymphocyte infiltration into the periportal region of the liver (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). More prominently, the colons of the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice contained markedly more and larger lymphoid follicles or colonic patches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom; arrows). Colonic patch hypertrophy is a hallmark of hapten-induced colitis and is implicated in the development of inflammation in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; reference <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Of note, the lymphocytes from the colonic patches often breached into the mucosal layer and were associated with crypt damage and focal architectural distortion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom; arrows). Moreover, as seen in animal models of IBD and human IBD, inflammatory cell infiltration was also detected in the lamina propria of the colon in areas that lack the colonic patches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, arrow 1). Crypt damage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, arrow 2) and thickening of the muscularis layer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, arrow 3) were also readily detected in these inflamed areas. Consistent with the involvement of CD4 T cells in IBD, we detected abundant infiltrating CD4 T cells in both the colonic patches and the inflamed mucosa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These IBD-like pathological phenotypes were not detected in the control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, AâD</xref>). Indeed, blind analyses of the colonic sections revealed that the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice had substantially higher IBD histological scores than the background scores of their wild-type littermates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).</p>

        <p>A molecular hallmark of IBD is the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, which contributes to inflammation and destruction of the colonic tissue (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). To further examine the similarity between the intestinal inflammation of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice and IBD, we analyzed cytokine gene expression in the colons of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and wild-type mice.

The level of an antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was moderately enhanced in the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> colon (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1</ext-link>). The elevated expression of IL-10 has also been detected in other models of mouse colitis as well as in human IBD patients (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), although the underlying functional significance in IBD pathogenesis is unclear. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the intestinal inflammation in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice is associated with the aberrant expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition to the histological and biochemical features of IBD, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice had substantial weight loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>), a characteristic clinical symptom of IBD patients (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Of note, these results were obtained with mice housed under pathogen-free conditions with wild-type littermates being used as controls. Thus, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice develop spontaneous colonic inflammation and extraintestinal abnormalities that resemble IBD.</p>
        <p>By analyzing the human genome sequence, we found that the human <italic>Cyld</italic> gene is located in a major IBD susceptibility locus (IBD-1) on chromosome 16 adjacent to a known IBD regulatory gene, <italic>NOD2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 H</xref>). This finding suggests an intriguing possibility that CYLD may also be involved in the regulation of human IBD.</p>

        <title>Adoptive transfer of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells induces autoimmune symptoms and colonic inflammation in recipient mice</title>
        <p>Given the hyperresponsive phenotype of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells, it was important to examine whether these mutant T cells contribute to the development of IBD-like symptoms. We adoptively transferred T cells from either <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> or wild-type mice into <italic>RAG1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice that lack endogenous lymphocytes. The <italic>RAG1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> recipients of both <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and wild-type T cells had an efficient T cell repopulation in the spleen 6 wk after the adoptive transfer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, the <italic>RAG1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> recipients of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells but not those of wild-type T cells displayed lymphocyte infiltration into the periportal regions of the liver (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>RAG1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> recipients of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells spontaneously developed colitis, which was characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, thickening of the mucosa, and goblet cell depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The IBD histology scores of these mice were markedly higher than the background detected in recipients of wild-type T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). In addition to these histological features, the recipients of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells had substantial weight loss (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>) and expressed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon (Fig. S2 B).

        <title>Constitutive activation of JNK and NF-ÎºB in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells</title>
        <p>To understand the molecular mechanism mediating the abnormal T cell responses in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice, we examined TCR signaling. We have previously shown that CYLD positively regulates LCK function and TCR-proximal signaling in thymocytes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, because LCK is largely dispensable for peripheral T cell activation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), it was intriguing to examine whether the loss of CYLD affected the TCR-proximal signaling of peripheral T cells. In naive T cells, the <italic>Cyld</italic> deficiency had no appreciable effect on the TCR/CD28-mediated phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Interestingly, in the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells, JNK became constitutively activated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, lane 4). The constitutive activation of JNK was also detected using <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> total T cells (unpublished data). Thus, in peripheral T cells, CYLD is not required for TCR-proximal signaling but serves as a crucial negative regulator of JNK.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the signaling basis for the hyperresponsive property of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells, we examined the activation of transcription factor NF-ÎºB. As expected, cross-linking of TCR/CD28 led to activation of the nuclear DNA-binding activity of NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Remarkably, as seen with JNK, high levels of active NF-ÎºB were detected in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells even under unstimulated conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, lane 5). Of note, the constitutive activation of NF-ÎºB occurred in both the naive and memory <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), further arguing for an intrinsic role for this DUB in negatively regulating the JNK and NF-ÎºB signaling axes in T cells. Antibody supershift assays revealed that the constitutively activated NF-ÎºB complex in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells was predominantly composed of the canonical NF-ÎºB members p50 and RelA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Parallel immunoblotting (IB) assays revealed the markedly enhanced expression of noncanonical NF-ÎºB members RelB and p100 at the levels of both protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>) and RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref> and not depicted). Because the genes encoding these two proteins are regulated by NF-ÎºB (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), this result further supported the conclusion that CYLD deficiency causes the constitutive activation of NF-ÎºB. We noticed that p100 remained largely unprocessed (not converted to p52; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>) despite its up-regulation. Because p100 is a specific inhibitor of RelB, this finding explained why RelB was not detected in the active nuclear NF-ÎºB complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Thus, the loss of CYLD is associated with the constitutive activation of canonical NF-ÎºB and JNK, a result that provides a mechanistic insight into the hyperresponsive phenotype of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells.</p>

        <title>Constitutive activation of IKKÎ² in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells and <italic>Cyld</italic> knockdown Jurkat T cells</title>
        <p>To understand the mechanism of constitutive NF-ÎºB activation associated with <italic>Cyld</italic> deficiency, we examined the level and fate of the primary NF-ÎºB inhibitor IÎºBÎ±. In <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells, the steady-state level of IÎºBÎ± was substantially lower than in wild-type T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, top). This abnormality was not caused by reduced expression of the IÎºBÎ± gene. In fact, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells expressed a markedly higher level of IÎºBÎ± mRNA than the wild-type T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, despite their lower level of total IÎºBÎ± protein, the mutant T cells had more phosphorylated IÎºBÎ± (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, middle). These findings suggested that IÎºBÎ± might be undergoing chronic degradation and resynthesis in the <italic>Cyld</italic>-deficient T cells. Indeed, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide led to the rapid depletion of IÎºBÎ± in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells but only had a weak effect on the IÎºBÎ± level in wild-type T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 4). The chronic degradation of IÎºBÎ± appeared to be dependent on IKKÎ² because this event was blocked by a selective IKKÎ² inhibitor, PS1145 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>, lane 7). Consistent with these results, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells displayed a high level of constitutive IKKÎ² catalytic activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>, top; lanes 1 and 2).

        <p>To determine whether the constitutive activation of IKKÎ² occurred in naive <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells, we began by analyzing the IKKÎ² kinase activity in thymocytes. As seen with peripheral T cells, <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> thymocytes exhibited constitutive IKKÎ² activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Next, we purified naive peripheral T cells by flow cytometric cell sorting. Because the low number of highly purified naive T cells precluded us from performing in vitro kinase assays, we attempted to detect the in vivo phosphorylation of IKKÎ² based on its band shift on SDS gels. Indeed, when fractionated on a low-percentage gel, IKKÎ² exhibited a clear band shift in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> but not control naive T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Consistently, the naive T cells had a reduced level of IÎºBÎ± and an up-regulated level of RelB and p100 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Thus, IKKÎ² is chronically activated in naive T cells of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice.</p>
        <p>We next used an alternative approach to confirm that the loss of CYLD in T cells causes the constitutive activation of IKKÎ². By infecting Jurkat T cells with a retroviral vector encoding a <italic>Cyld</italic>-specific small hairpin RNA (shCYLD), we were able to generate a bulk of cells with a greatly reduced level of CYLD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>, bottom). As seen with the primary T cells, the Cyld knockdown Jurkat cells displayed the hyperactivation of IKKÎ² (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>, top), and this abnormality was associated with the reduction in IÎºBÎ± protein level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>, third blot). Collectively, these results suggest that CYLD plays a crucial role in preventing the spontaneous activation of IKKÎ² or its upstream signaling steps.</p>

        <title>CYLD controls the activity of Tak1</title>
        <p>The involvement of CYLD in the regulation of both JNK and IKKÎ² suggests a role for this DUB in controlling the activity of a more upstream molecule. However, because <italic>Cyld</italic> deficiency did not cause the activation of ERK, the target of CYLD might be an intermediate signaling factor specifically mediating the activation of JNK and IKKÎ². In this regard, recent genetic studies highlighted a critical role for Tak1 in mediating the TCR-stimulated activation of IKK and JNK (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

        <p>Previous in vitro studies suggest that Tak1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Although how the catalytic activity of Tak1 is regulated in vivo is not well understood, a recent study suggests that the polyubiquitination of Tak1 mediates its autoactivation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, it was logical to examine whether CYLD targets Tak1 and regulates its ubiquitination. Interestingly, endogenous CYLD and Tak1 indeed formed a complex in T cells, which was readily detected by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assays using the anti-CYLD antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). This molecular interaction was specific because Tak1 was not precipitated by anti-CYLD from the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 2). Specific CYLDâTak1 interaction was also readily detected in transfected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). To determine whether Tak1 is a functional target of CYLD, we analyzed the effect of CYLD on Tak1 ubiquitination. As expected (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), transfected Tak1 underwent constitutive polyubiquitination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Importantly, the ubiquitination of Tak1 was efficiently inhibited by CYLD. Furthermore, consistent with the constitutive Tak1 activation in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells, transfected CYLD potently suppressed the catalytic activity of Tak1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further assess the role of CYLD in regulating Tak1 ubiquitination, we analyzed the ubiquitination of endogenous Tak1. Remarkably, the loss of CYLD resulted in a considerable elevation of Tak1 ubiquitination in T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>), thus providing evidence for the involvement of CYLD in modulating Tak1 ubiquitination in vivo. We also analyzed the effect of <italic>Cyld</italic> deficiency on the ubiquitination of IKKÎ³ because this molecular event can be inhibited by transfected CYLD (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).

Thus, Tak1 appears to be a primary target of CYLD in T cells, although the involvement of CYLD in regulating other signaling components of the NF-ÎºB pathway cannot be excluded.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrate a critical role for CYLD in controlling the catalytic activity of Tak1 and its downstream kinases in T cells. This function of CYLD was demonstrated using different cell systems: total T cells, naive T cells, and <italic>Cyld</italic> knockdown Jurkat T cells. Consistently, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells are hyperresponsive to TCR/CD28 stimulation, and the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice spontaneously develop intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells into RAG1 knockout mice is sufficient to induce the inflammatory phenotype, thus suggesting that the abnormal response of T cells in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice plays a primary role in the spontaneous development of intestinal inflammation.</p>
      <p>Genetic and biochemical evidence has established Tak1 as a pivotal kinase that mediates the activation of IKK and JNK by diverse cellular stimuli (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Using T cellâspecific Tak1 knockout mice, several groups have recently shown that Tak1 is required for the TCR-stimulated activation of IKK and JNK and T cell development (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Because of the lack of Tak1-deficient peripheral T cells in these mutant animals, the signaling function of Tak1 in naive T cells could not be assessed. In vitro deletion of Tak1 in preactivated T cells (similar to effector T cells) indicates that it is essential for JNK activation but functionally redundant for IKK activation under these conditions (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Despite the potential variations in the necessity of Tak1, its potent activity in IKK/JNK activation suggests the requirement for a tight mechanism of regulation. Our data emphasize a critical role for CYLD in Tak1 regulation. The loss of CYLD in both primary T cells and the Jurkat T cell line causes the constitutive activation of Tak1 as well as its downstream targets JNK and IKK. Because ERK is not affected by the <italic>Cyld</italic> deficiency, it is unlikely that CYLD negatively regulates a further upstream component in the TCR signaling pathway. Indeed, our data suggest that CYLD directly targets Tak1 and inhibits Tak1 ubiquitination. In keeping with a previous finding that Tak1 ubiquitination mediates its autoactivation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), we have shown that CYLD potently inhibits the catalytic activity of Tak1 in transfected cells. Thus, CYLD has a pivotal role in preventing the spontaneous activation of Tak1 and its downstream kinases JNK and IKK.</p>
      <p>Previous studies suggest that A20 is a DUB that functions to prevent the prolonged activation of IKK in innate immune cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>â<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). To understand the functional difference between CYLD with A20, we examined whether CYLD regulates the kinetics or magnitude of the signal-induced activation of IKKÎ² in innate immune cells. Surprisingly, the loss of CYLD did not result in the basal activation of IKKÎ² or Tak1 in macrophages (Fig. S3, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1</ext-link>). This result suggests a cell typeâspecific function of CYLD or functional redundancy of CYLD with other DUBs in certain cell types such as macrophages. The <italic>Cyld</italic> deficiency also did not alter the level of the LPS-stimulated activation of IKKÎ² or prolong the activation of IKKÎ² after an extended time course of LPS stimulation (Fig. S3 C). Thus, unlike A20 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), CYLD does not play an essential role in controlling the basal or inducible activation of IKKÎ² in macrophages. Another major difference between CYLD and A20 is that CYLD does not seem to play a role in turning off the inducible IKK activation. Despite its essential role in suppressing the constitutive activity of IKKÎ² in T cells, the loss of CYLD in Jurkat T cells did not appreciably prolong the IKK activation induced by TNF-Î± or mitogens (Fig. S4 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1</ext-link>). Consistently, the level of CYLD protein was not enhanced by the mitogens (Fig. S4 B) or TNF-Î± (not depicted). Thus, whereas A20 regulates the kinetics of inducible IKK activation in innate immune cells, CYLD is critical for regulating the spontaneous (and probably initially inducible) activation of Tak1 and IKK in T cells.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that CYLD positively regulates the late stage of thymocyte development (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). CYLD physically interacts with LCK and facilitates the binding of active LCK to its target ZAP-70, thereby enhancing the TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70. We found in this study that the naive <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> peripheral T cells did not show a defect in TCR-proximal signaling. This finding is consistent with a previous study that LCK is required for thymocyte development but is largely dispensable for peripheral T cell activation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, the constitutive activation of Tak1 coupled with the diminished effect of CYLD on TCR-proximal signaling contributes to the hyperresponsive phenotype of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells. Because Tak1 is also activated in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> thymocytes, a question is raised with regard to its effect on thymocyte development. Based on the results of Tak1 knockout studies (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the activation of Tak1 should promote thymocyte development. However, the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice even produce reduced numbers of mature thymocytes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although this phenotype is clearly caused by the attenuation of LCK function and TCR-proximal signaling, it is also likely that the constitutive activation of Tak1 may contribute to the thymocyte defect by causing excessive negative selection. Future studies will examine this possibility by crossing <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice with TCR transgenic mice.</p>
      <p>One surprising finding with the Tak1 conditional knockout mice (Tak1<sup>flox/flox</sup>) was their spontaneous development of intestinal inflammation at old ages despite the critical role for Tak1 in NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, this phenotype has been attributed to the requirement of Tak1 in regulatory T cell (T reg cell) development. The Tak1<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice produce a scarce number of peripheral T cells, which turn out to be leaked cells that have escaped from Cre-mediated Tak1 locus deletion (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Thus, the effector T cells that mediate inflammation are actually Tak1-expressing cells activated as a result of the lack of T reg cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In contrast, the T cell abnormality of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice is intrinsic to the mainstream (responder) T cells. Both naive and memory <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> T cells are hyperresponsive to TCR/CD28 stimulation, and the adoptively transferred T cells mediate colitis in <italic>RAG1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice. Furthermore, our preliminary studies did not detect any defect in T reg cell development in <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice (unpublished data). Thus, the loss of T reg cell function or abnormality in responder T cells may contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation.</p>
      <p>The spontaneous development of the colonic inflammation of <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice suggests the intriguing possibility that CYLD may serve as an important regulator of IBD. A recent study reveals that <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice are also more sensitive to dextran sodium sulfateâinduced colitis (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition to colonic inflammation, we have shown that the <italic>Cyld<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice display other features of IBD, such as weight loss, lymphocyte infiltration into the liver, and early onset of inflammatory symptoms. In concert with the animal studies, the <italic>Cyld</italic> gene is located within a major IBD susceptibility locus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). This locus, IBD-1, also contains the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene that encodes an intracellular pattern recognition molecule that is known to mediate NF-ÎºB activation in macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Genetic mutations of the human <italic>NOD2</italic> gene increase the risk of, but are insufficient for, developing IBD (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Consistently, ablation or mutation of the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene in mice does not cause spontaneous intestinal inflammation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), although the <italic>NOD2</italic> mutation sensitizes mice to dextran sodium sulfateâinduced intestinal inflammation (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). These findings suggest the involvement of specific environmental factors or secondary genetic factors for the development of IBD in patients carrying the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene mutations.</p>
      <p>Notably, the <italic>Cyld</italic> gene is located adjacent to the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). At least in mice, the loss of CYLD has no effect on the expression of NOD2 (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20062694/DC1</ext-link>). It remains to be examined whether mutations in the <italic>Cyld</italic> gene occur in some of the IBD patients who are epidemiologically linked with the IBD1 locus. Because the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene is located immediately upstream of the <italic>Cyld</italic> gene, it is also possible that certain genetic mutations located at the 3â² region of the <italic>NOD2</italic> gene may affect the expression of the <italic>Cyld</italic> gene. Although these possibilities need to be examined by further studies, a recent study does suggest the association of human IBD with the reduced expression of CYLD (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Given that NOD2 and CYLD regulate the innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively, it is intriguing to examine whether the combined genetic mutations of these two genes have a synergistic effect on the development of colitis in mice.</p>
