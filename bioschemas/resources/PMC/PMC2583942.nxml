          <title>BACKGROUND</title>
          <p>Estrogen receptor related beta (ERRÎ², <italic>ESRRB/NR3B2</italic>) is an orphan receptor that shares significant sequence homology with estrogen receptors ERÎ± and ERÎ². ERR family members are reported to exhibit constitutive transcriptional activity; however, little is known about the biological function of ERRÎ². In an attempt to delineate its role, we examined expression of ERRÎ² in normal human endometrium, a tissue that undergoes cyclic remodelling under the influence of estrogen and progesterone.</p>

          <title>METHODS</title>
          <p>Well-characterized endometrial tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 31), including full-thickness biopsies, was obtained from women with regular menstrual cycles. RTâPCR was used to measure mRNA encoding ERRÎ², the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivators (PGC)-1Î± and Î² and to determine whether ERRÎ² splice variant mRNAs were expressed. ERRÎ² was immunolocalized using both single and double antibody immunohistochemistry.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>RESULTS</title>
          <p>Total ERRÎ² mRNA appeared higher in proliferative phase samples but results did not reach significance. Transcripts corresponding to the long- and short-splice variants of ERRÎ² as well as PGC1Î± and Î² were detected but ERRÎ²Î10 was absent. ERRÎ² protein was localized to cell nuclei within multiple endometrial cell types including the glands, stroma, endothelium and immune cells, including uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and macrophages. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry revealed that some cells co-expressed ERRÎ² and ERÎ± or ERÎ², for example, endothelial and uNK cells were ERRÎ²+/ERÎ²+.</p>

          <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
          <p>ERRÎ² mRNA and protein are expressed in healthy human endometrium. Further studies are warranted to characterize the functional impact of ERRÎ² on endometrial biology.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear receptors (NR) act as ligand-activated transcription factors and affect tissue homeostasis in response to a range of signals, including steroid hormones and various endogenous and exogenous molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C2">Aranda and Pascual, 2001</xref>); some NR superfamily members are reported to act in the absence of a cognate ligand. These orphan receptors include the NR3B subfamily, named estrogen receptor related (ERR) owing to their sequence homology to the estrogen receptors (ERÎ±/<italic>ESR1</italic> and ERÎ²/<italic>ESR2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C8">Giguere, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C9">Giguere, 2002</xref>). Three ERR genes have been cloned (ERRÎ±/<italic>ESRRA</italic>, Î²/<italic>ESRRB</italic> and Î³/<italic>ESRRG</italic>). ERRs are reported to constitutively modulate transcription via estrogen response elements (ERE) or steroidogenic factor-1 response elements (SFRE/ERRE) in the regulatory regions of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C9">Giguere, 2002</xref>). Initial research was aimed at establishing whether ERRs can stimulate the expression of genes in estrogen responsive tissues. For instance, it was reported that the osteopontin and pS2 gene promoters could be activated either by ERRÎ± or by ERRÎ² in a ligand-independent manner via interactions with ERE sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C38">Vanacker, <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C19">Lu, <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Conversely, reporter gene assays also suggested that ligand-activated ERÎ± (but not ERÎ²) can activate the osteopontin promoter via an ERRE sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C38">Vanacker, <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). These studies pointed towards an interplay between ERs and ERRs in modulating gene expression of the same target genes.</p><p>In common with ERÎ± and ERÎ², ERRs can be activated through post-translational modifications including phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C6">Driggers and Segars, 2002</xref>), which may be induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C3">Barry and Giguere, 2005</xref>). In addition, their function is also regulated by the NR coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators 1Î± and 1Î² (PGC1Î±/<italic>PPARGC1A</italic> and PGC1Î²/<italic>PPARGC1B</italic>). These proteins are widely expressed, and they are thought to play a key role in the regulation of energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C15">Kamei, <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C28">Puigserver and Spiegelman, 2003</xref>). Cell-based studies have shown that PGC1Î± enhances ERRÎ± expression and ERRÎ± transcriptional activity via direct interaction between the coactivator and the NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C30">Schreiber <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Finally, these coregulators are themselves post-translationally regulated in response to stimuli such as dietary signals or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C28">Puigserver and Spiegelman, 2003</xref>), adding an additional layer of control to transcriptional regulation of ERR target genes and further flexibility to the phenotypic adaptation of cells to their environment.</p><p>The human endometrium undergoes cyclic remodelling under the influence of sequential exposure to the ovarian steroids estradiol and progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C14">Jabbour <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). As each cycle progresses, component cells of the endometrium serially proliferate and differentiate in preparation for implantation of the conceptus; in the absence of pregnancy, the upper functional layer is shed (menses). A complex series of biological processes is involved in these pivotal reproductive events, including the regulation of cell division, the metabolism of several biochemical mediators and the inflammatory response. Although the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms by which steroid hormones promote uterine receptivity are still the subject of intensive investigation, it is generally accepted that estradiol and progesterone, acting via their cognate receptors, ensure a pattern of gene expression that facilitates implantation and the early stages of pregnancy. Dysfunctional regulation of these events may result in subfertility and various reproductive tract pathologies, including implantation failure and aberrations of menstrual bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C14">Jabbour <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C35">Talbi, <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C1">Aghajanova, <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The processes that regulate endometrial function need to be controlled both temporally and spatially, thereby making the study of transcriptional regulators paramount in our understanding of endometrial biology. The pattern of expression of ER subtypes in the endometrium has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C4">Critchley <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C5">2002</xref>). We have also documented the pattern of expression of NR in the uterine natural killer cells (uNK), which represent a major fraction of the endometrial immune cell population, especially in the luteal phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C25">Moffett and Loke, 2006</xref>) and demonstrated that these cells express ERÎ² and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but not ERÎ± or the progesterone receptor (PR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C11">Henderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). As an extension of these investigations and because ERRs and ERs appear to be functionally connected, we initiated a study to determine if ERRÎ² was also expressed in the endometrium. While this work was being carried out, a paper was published describing three ERRÎ² splice variants: a long form consisting of 11 exons, a short form lacking exons 10 and 11 and a form missing exon 10 (ERRÎ²Î10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). It was reported that none of these variants was expressed in three human samples described as âuterusâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In the present paper, we report that both ERRÎ² short- and long-form mRNAs are expressed in the normal human endometrium, that total transcript levels do not appear to vary significantly over the span of the endometrial cycle, although there appeared to a trend for them to be higher during the proliferative phase, and that the protein can be detected in the nuclei of multiple cells types, including immune and endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Endometrial biopsies were collected at different stages of the menstrual cycle with either an endometrial suction curette (Pipelle, Laboratoire CCD, Paris, France) or a full-thickness sample (surface epithelium to endometrialâmyometrial junction) from women attending the gynaecological services at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, UK. All women from whom endometrial tissue was collected provided written informed consent for biopsy collection, and there was institutional ethical approval. Subjects were of reproductive age (median 40 years; range 30â48 years) and all described regular menstrual cycles (25â35 days length). Endometrial tissue was collected from women at the time of hysterectomy, laparoscopic sterilization or hysteroscopy. At the time of recruitment, no subject was known to have endometriosis or submucus fibroids. No subject had taken a sex steroid hormonal preparation during the 3 months prior to biopsy collection. Endometrial tissue was fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4Â°C before being routinely wax embedded for immunohistochemical assessment. In addition, endometrial tissue was either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or placed in RNA Later (Ambion) overnight at 4Â°C for subsequent RNA extraction. Histological dating of the samples was performed according to the criteria of Noyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C27">Noyes <italic>et al</italic>., 1950</xref>). Serum samples collected at the time of endometrial biopsy were used for determination of circulating estradiol and progesterone concentrations by radioimmunoassay (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DEN298TB1">I</xref>). These were consistent with the patientâs reported last menstrual period and a histological dating assessment that was undertaken by an expert histologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C4">Critchley <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C5">2002</xref>).

The function of NR is modulated by receptor coactivators, it was therefore important that we were also able to demonstrate expression of mRNAs for PGC1Î± and Î². ERRÎ² protein was detected in immune cells including macrophages and uNK cells as well as in endothelial cells where it was co-expressed with ERÎ².</p><p>The total amount of ERRÎ² mRNA was low compared with that for ERÎ± and, together with a certain amount of inter-individual variability, this may explain why a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) failed to detect expression in uterine RNA samples of commercial origin, using identical PCR cycling conditions. Although the results did not reach significance using both semi-quantitative and qRTâPCR, there was a trend for ERRÎ² mRNAs to be higher in samples from the proliferative phase. In preliminary experiments, we have failed to detect any consistent change in expression following treatment of epithelial and stromal endometrial cell lines with either estradiol or progestagen; however, bioinformatic analysis has revealed the presence of putative PR binding sites in the 5â² region of the ERRÎ² gene (unpublished observation). In ERRÎ± knockout mice, kidney ERRÎ² mRNA levels were reduced compared with those in wild-type littermates, suggesting that the amount of ERRÎ± might influence expression of ERRÎ² in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C21">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Data showing that expression of ERRÎ± is up-regulated by estradiol treatment in the mouse uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C31">Shigeta <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), the HEC-1 human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C17">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) have been published. These authors reported that the estrogenic response was mediated by a 34 bp DNA element containing multiple steroid hormone response element half-sites that are conserved between the human and mouse ERRÎ± gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C17">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). However, when we carried out sequence alignment analysis of 10 kb in the 5â² region of ERRÎ± and Î², we failed to detect this response element in the ERRÎ² promoter and further studies are needed to establish the role played, if any, by steroid hormones in regulating ERRÎ² mRNA expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to a previous paper that reported that ERRÎ² was immunolocalized within the cytoplasmic compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C7">Gao <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>, we consistently detected the protein in the nuclear compartment, a finding that is in agreement with nuclear localization of fluorescent protein tagged constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C43">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and our unpublished data]. The commercial antibody we used was directed against a peptide present in both long and short forms of ERRÎ², and although the results of our RTâPCR studies would suggest that both forms were expressed in the same samples, this would need to be elucidated using a new antibody specific to the C-terminal domain of the ERRÎ² long-form protein.</p><p>NR coactivators have an important impact on NR signalling, through remodelling of the local chromatin environment and recruitment of the transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C23">McKenna <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).

Dysregulation of NR coactivators has been reported to occur in the endometrium of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C10">Gregory <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Although the PGC-1 family of NR coactivators is reported to interact with several different NR, they appear to be critical regulators of ERR protein activity and are considered to act as âprotein ligandsâ for this class of orphan receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C12">Huss <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C15">Kamei <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). PGC1Î± binds to ERRÎ± via a specific leucine-rich domain that is distinct from the region involved in binding to other NR, including ERÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C12">Huss <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Results from <italic>in vitro</italic> transactivation assays suggest that ERRÎ² can also be regulated by PGC1Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C15">Kamei <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> comparisons between ERRÎ± and ERRÎ² protein sequences (our unpublished observation) reveal that the region associated with binding to PGC1Î± is conserved between the proteins.</p><p>The endometrium contains a diverse population of immune cells that play a vital role in maintaining a balance between protecting the tissue from pathogenic attacks and tolerating the allogeneic sperm and trophoblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C16">Lea and Sandra, 2007</xref>). In the present study, we have demonstrated that ERRÎ² can be immunolocalized to uNK cells, macrophages and leukocytes within the functional layer of the endometrium and to aggregates of cells within the basal compartment that we also believe to be immune cells. uNK cells have a unique phenotype (CD56 <sup>bright</sup>, CD16<sup>â</sup> and CD3<sup>â</sup>), distinguishing them from peripheral blood NK cells (CD56 <sup>dim</sup>, CD16 <sup>bright</sup> and CD3<sup>â</sup>). They are the major immune cell population in the late secretory phase and early pregnancy, and they play a key role in implantation and early placentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C25">Moffett and Loke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C16">Lea and Sandra, 2007</xref>). The cyclical change in uNK cell number in the endometrium suggests that this cell type may be regulated by changes in the amounts of sex steroid hormones. We have previously demonstrated that uNK express ERÎ² and GR but not ERÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C11">Henderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) and recently discovered that they also express ERRÎ± (unpublished observations). The function of uterine macrophages is less clearly defined, but we speculate that they may be involved in clearing extracellular components from degraded cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C29">Repnik <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Studies in mice lacking ERRÎ± demonstrate that it is required for induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in macrophages, a response that was also dependent upon PGC-1Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C34">Sonoda <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). We believe that our data are the first to demonstrate expression of ERRÎ² in immune cells within endometrium and further studies are therefore required to determine the significance of this result.</p><p>Since ERRÎ² and the ERR coactivators PGC1Î± and Î² are all expressed in the human endometrium, it is appropriate to consider how the protein might influence endometrial function. On the basis of the available literature on the function(s) of ERRs, we speculate that ERRÎ² might have an impact on ER signalling, influence expression of previously identified ERR target genes and/or influence cell differentiation. The evidence for each of these functions is considered below.</p><p>In the current study, we found that immunoexpression of ERRÎ² in normal endometrium occurred in multiple cell populations within the normal endometrium. Although some cells appeared to express ERRÎ² alone (e.g. immune aggregates), in other cell types, the receptor was co-expressed with ERÎ± (e.g. epithelial cells in the proliferative phase) or ERÎ² (e.g. endothelial cells, uNK cells). We have also detected expression of ERRÎ² in stage 1 endometrial cancers (unpublished observations), and it is notable that expression of ERRÎ± also occurs in endometrial cancers where it has been suggested that it may be linked to dysregulation of estrogen signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C39">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Experiments support the idea that ERRÎ± and ERRÎ² proteins both have the ability to bind to identical ERE and ERRE sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C38">Vanacker <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Genes expressed in the human endometrium that contain promoters reported to be regulated by ERRÎ± include lactotransferin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C40">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), thyroid hormone receptor Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C36">Vanacker <italic>et al</italic>., 1998a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C37">b</xref>), osteopontin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C36">Vanacker <italic>et al</italic>., 1998a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C37">b</xref>), aromatase (CYP19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C41">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>) and monoamine oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C42">Zhan <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>); therefore, our data showing expression of ERRÎ² raises the possibility that this protein may also influence expression of the same set of genes.</p><p>There is an emerging consensus that ERRs play a key role in regulating genes involved in energy homeostasis, including fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C33">Sladek <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). For example, transgenic mice lacking ERRÎ± have a reduced fat mass and are resistant to diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C21">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). To date, there is no data to support a similar role for ERRÎ² and this therefore requires further study. Finally, a number of recent papers report a role for ERRÎ² with the regulation of stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C13">Ivanova <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C18">Loh <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In murine embryonic stem cells, ERRÎ² is not only a direct target of the stem cell regulator Oct4, but also acts as a transcription factor regulating Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C44">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Studies in ERRÎ² knock-out animals have revealed problems with differentiation of trophoblast, and viable knock-out animals can only be generated by aggregating mutant embryos with wild-type cells which can then develop a functional placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C20">Luo <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Additionally, ERRÎ² is expressed in primordial germ cells during embryonic life and gene deficiency leads to a reduction in the number of differentiated germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEN298C24">Mitsunaga <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>); therefore, we propose that ERRÎ² may also have an impact on endometrial cell differentiation.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that ERRÎ² short and long splice variant mRNAs are both expressed in the human endometrium. ERRÎ² protein is expressed within the cell nuclei of epithelial, stromal, immune and endothelial cells. Expression of the protein partially overlaps with that of ERÎ± and ERÎ². We speculate that ERRÎ² may play a role in endometrial cell fate determination and in regulating factors important for endometrial function and receptivity, including osteopontin. Clearly, further studies are required to uncover the full impact of expression of ERRÎ² in endometrial biology and investigate whether there are differences in the functional effects of the splice variant isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>Studies were supported by <grant-sponsor>MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit</grant-sponsor> funding to PTKS (<grant-num>U1276.00.002.00005.01</grant-num>) and a <grant-sponsor>MRC programme grant</grant-sponsor> to HODC (<grant-num>G0500047</grant-num>).</p></sec>
