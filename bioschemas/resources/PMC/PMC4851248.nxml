      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) that has broad roles in RNA biology<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A along mRNAs leaves relatively less methylation in the 5â² untranslated region (5â²UTR) compared to other regions<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. However, whether and how 5â²UTR methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the 5â²UTR in translation initiation, very little is known whether m<sup>6</sup>A modification influences mRNA translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, m<sup>6</sup>A is preferentially deposited to the 5â²UTR of newly transcribed mRNAs. We found that the dynamic 5â²UTR methylation is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization of YTHDF2, a well characterized m<sup>6</sup>A âreaderâ. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear YTHDF2 preserves 5â²UTR methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the m<sup>6</sup>A âeraserâ FTO from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased 5â²UTR methylation in the form of m<sup>6</sup>A promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for selective mRNA translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 mRNA as an example, we demonstrate that a single site m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5â²UTR enables translation initiation independent of the 5â² end m<sup>7</sup>G cap. The elucidation of the dynamic feature of 5â²UTR methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of physiological roles of m<sup>6</sup>A, but also uncovers a previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock response.</p>

    <p id="P2">Given the reversible nature of m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, we sought to assess the potential impact of heat shock stress on m<sup>6</sup>A modification of eukaryotic mRNAs. Using immunofluorescence staining, we first examined the subcellular localization of the entire m<sup>6</sup>A machinery in a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line before and after heat shock stress. It is believed that m<sup>6</sup>A modification occurs primarily at nuclear speckles, whereas its functionality takes place in the cytosol (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Consistent with this notion, both the m<sup>6</sup>A âwritersâ (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP) and the âeraserâ FTO were predominantly present in the nucleus, whereas the majority of the âreaderâ YTHDF2 resided in the cytosol (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). In response to heat shock stress, neither the âwritersâ nor the âeraserâ changed their nuclear localization (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Surprisingly, nearly all of the YTHDF2 molecules were relocated into the nucleus from the cytosol upon heat shock stress (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The same phenomenon holds true in HeLa cells. Intriguingly, the protein level of YTHDF2 was also markedly increased after heat shock stress in a manner similar to Hsp70 induction (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, neither the m<sup>6</sup>A âwritersâ nor the âeraserâ showed any differences in protein levels upon stress. Supporting the stress-induced transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>YTHDF2</italic>, real-time PCR revealed a nearly 4-fold increase of mRNA abundance after heat shock stress (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). The increased <italic>YTHDF2</italic> abundance was not due to altered mRNA degradation since heat shock stress had negligible effects on mRNA stability (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Notably, <italic>YTHDF2</italic> exhibited a relatively short half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub> &lt;1 h) in cells, supporting the importance of stress-induced transcriptional up-regulation. Genes encoding other YTH domain family proteins like <italic>YTHDF1</italic> and <italic>YTHDF3</italic> also showed up-regulation, although to a lesser extent (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Using a mouse fibroblast cell line lacking the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we confirmed that <italic>YTHDF2</italic> is subject to regulation by HSF1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). The unexpected stress inducible feature of YTHDF2 suggests a potential role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in heat shock response.</p>
    <p id="P3">Although YTHDF2 primarily serves as the âreaderâ of m<sup>6</sup>A, recent proteomic data revealed that YTHDF2 has an extensive physical interaction with the components of m<sup>6</sup>A âwritersâ<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Given their co-localization upon heat shock stress, we postulated that the nuclear presence of YTHDF2 could influence the m<sup>6</sup>A modification and alter the landscape of mRNA methylomes. Using an optimized MeRIP-seq procedure<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, we sequenced the entire methylated RNA species purified from MEF cells with or without heat shock stress. From a total of 15,454 putative methylation sites, we confirmed the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence motif as GG<underline>A</underline>C (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref> and Table 1). Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, the majority of m<sup>6</sup>A sites are enriched in the vicinity of the stop codon and in the 3â²UTR (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Unexpectedly, heat shock stress led to an elevated m<sup>6</sup>A peak in the 5â²UTR but not other regions. Reasoning that only a handful of genes undergo up-regulation as a result of heat shock response<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, we compared the levels of m<sup>6</sup>A modification between stress-inducible and non-inducible transcripts defined by RNA-seq. It is clear that the up-regulated transcripts showed greater m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5â²UTR than the transcripts down-regulated upon stress (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). We next stratified transcripts based on differential changes of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5â²UTR. While transcripts with elevated 5â²UTR methylation are mostly up-regulated in response to stress, transcripts exhibiting decreased 5â²UTR methylation are largely down-regulated (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney Test). One particular example of stress-induced transcripts is the Hsp70 gene <italic>HSPA1A</italic>, which not only showed a 90-fold increase of mRNA levels after heat shock, but also displayed a prominent m<sup>6</sup>A peak in the 5â²UTR (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). By contrast, the constitutively expressed Hsc70 gene <italic>HSPA8</italic> showed only minor increase in both the mRNA level and the m<sup>6</sup>A modification in response to heat shock stress (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). These results suggest that the increased 5â²UTR methylation selectively occurs on the stress-inducible mRNAs.</p>
    <p id="P4">To examine whether the elevated 5â²UTR methylation upon heat shock stress is a result of nuclear localization of YTHDF2, we silenced YTHDF2 in MEF cells using shRNA-expressing lentiviruses. Remarkably, MEF cells lacking YTHDF2 demonstrated a substantial loss of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5â²UTR (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Upon heat shock stress, these cells no longer showed the elevated 5â²UTR methylation as seen in control cells. The abolished 5â²UTR methylation in the absence of YTHDF2 was clearly exemplified in <italic>HSPA1A</italic> that exhibited only background m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5â²UTR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). This result indicates a novel function of YTHDF2 in heat shock response by promoting 5â²UTR methylation on mRNAs transcribed during stress.</p>
    <p id="P5">YTHDF2 is not a methytransferase <italic>per se</italic>, and does not bind to mRNAs without prior m<sup>6</sup>A modification<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. How does the nuclear presence of YTHDF2 promote selective methylation in the 5â²UTR? One possibility is that YTHDF2 protects the pre-existing m<sup>6</sup>A from FTO-mediated demethylation. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear localization of YTHDF2 likely limits the accessibility of FTO to newly minted m<sup>6</sup>A sites, thereby tilting the equilibrium towards methylation. Indeed, an <italic>in vitro</italic> m<sup>6</sup>A binding and demethylation assay confirmed direct competition between FTO and YTHDF2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). To demonstrate whether FTO preferentially removes m<sup>6</sup>A modification from the 5â²UTR, we knocked down FTO from MEF cells and examined the m<sup>6</sup>A distribution across the entire transcriptome. Interestingly, only the 5â²UTR region showed an increase of m<sup>6</sup>A density in cells lacking FTO (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Additionally, the 5â²UTR methylation showed no further increase upon heat shock stress in the absence of FTO.</p>
    <p id="P6">The 5â²UTR is crucial in mediating translation initiation of eukaryotic mRNAs<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Under stress conditions, the cap-dependent translation is generally suppressed. However, subsets of transcripts are selectively translated via a poorly understood cap-independent mechanism<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. To investigate whether differential methylation of 5â²UTR influences the translational status of these mRNAs, we conducted ribosome profiling of MEF cells with or without heat shock stress. Among the genes undergoing stress-induced transcriptional up-regulation, many of them not only showed elevated m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the 5â²UTR, but also demonstrated increased ribosome occupancy in the coding region (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Several prominent examples are genes encoding heat shock proteins, in particular Hsp70 (Extended Data Table 2). Therefore, the coordinated up-regulation of transcription and 5â²UTR methylation is coupled with robust translation in response to heat shock stress.</p>
    <p id="P7">To validate the causal relationship between stress-induced 5â²UTR methylation and selective translation, we examined Hsp70 synthesis in cells with differential m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Knocking down YTHDF2 leads to depleted 5â²UTR methylation as revealed by MeRIP-seq (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Indeed, direct m<sup>6</sup>A blotting of <italic>HSPA1A</italic> purified from heat shock stressed MEFs confirmed the marked reduction of methylation in cells lacking YTHDF2 (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Remarkably, the heat shock-induced Hsp70 synthesis was substantially dampened in the absence of YTHDF2 (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The comparable Hsp70 mRNA levels in cells with or without YTHDF2 knockdown indicate that the reduced Hsp70 synthesis is a result of translational deficiency (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Further supporting this notion, the Hsp70 transcript but not GAPDH showed much less enrichment in the polysomes of MEF cells lacking YTHDF2 (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">Reasoning that YTHDF2 competes with FTO in preserving 5â²UTR m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we speculated that FTO knockdown would increase the 5â²UTR methylation as well as the translation efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA. This was indeed the case. Direct m<sup>6</sup>A blotting of <italic>HSPA1A</italic> purified from stressed MEFs lacking FTO revealed a clear increase of methylation when compared to the scramble control (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Importantly, FTO knockdown potentiated the synthesis of Hsp70 after heat shock stress. Collectively, these results established the functional connection between dynamic 5â²UTR methylation and selective mRNA translation during stress.</p>
    <p id="P9">It is commonly believed that the 5â²UTR of Hsp70 mRNA recruits the translational machinery via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, conflicting results exist and the exact cap-independent translation-promoting determinants remain elusive<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Given the fact that the normal 5â² end cap structure is a methylated purine (<italic>N</italic><sup>7</sup>-methylguanosine, m<sup>7</sup>G), we hypothesize that the stress-induced m<sup>6</sup>A in the 5â²UTR enables selective translation by acting as a functional cap substitute. To test this hypothesis, we performed a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter assay in MEF cells by transfecting mRNAs synthesized in the absence or presence of m<sup>6</sup>A (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). For the messenger without 5â²UTR, random incorporation of m<sup>6</sup>A slightly reduced the Fluc activity after mRNA transfection. In the presence of 5â²UTR from Hsp70, but not tubulin, the incorporation of m<sup>6</sup>A markedly increased the Fluc activity in transfected MEF cells. Notably, m<sup>6</sup>A incorporation does not affect the stability of the synthesized mRNAs in transfected cells (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). We next replaced the 5â² end m<sup>7</sup>G cap with a non-functional cap analog A<sub>ppp</sub>G. As expected, the resultant mRNA did not support translation in the absence of 5â²UTR or in the presence of tubulin 5â²UTR (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). Only when the Hsp70 5â²UTR was present, was the translating-promoting feature clearly manifested after m<sup>6</sup>A incorporation, in particular under stress conditions (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). This effect is specific to m<sup>6</sup>A modification but not m<sup>6</sup>Am because ribose methylation in the form of 2â²-<italic>O</italic>-MeA suppressed translation of the Fluc reporter bearing Hsp70 5â²UTR (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Therefore, methylation of Hsp70 5â²UTR in the form of m<sup>6</sup>A promotes cap-independent translation.</p>
    <p id="P10">To further demonstrate the 5â²UTR specificity in m<sup>6</sup>A-facilitated cap-independent translation, we examined 5â²UTRs from a constitutively expressed chaperone Hsc70 (<italic>HSPA8</italic>) and another stress-inducible chaperone Hsp105 (<italic>HSPH1</italic>) (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Only the 5â²UTR of Hsp105 enhanced translation of the non-capped message after m<sup>6</sup>A incorporation (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). This result is consistent with the selective 5â²UTR methylation of stress-inducible transcripts upon heat shock stress.</p>
    <p id="P11">5â²UTR contains multiple As although not all of them are methylated. Based on the predicted m<sup>6</sup>A sequence motif, the A residue at the 103 position of Hsp70 mRNA is likely to be methylated. Using a single nucleotide m<sup>6</sup>A detection method<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, we confirmed the methylation event at this position upon heat shock stress (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). To demonstrate the significance of methylation at this single site, we introduced an A103C mutation into the Hsp70 5â²UTR. Remarkably, m<sup>6</sup>A incorporation no longer promoted translation of the Fluc reporter in transfected cells (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). To directly demonstrate the importance of single site m<sup>6</sup>A without changing nucleotide, we employed a sequential RNA splint ligation strategy to construct a Fluc reporter bearing Hsp70 5â²UTR with or without A103 methylation (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system, the Fluc reporter containing the single m<sup>6</sup>A at the 103 position showed about 50% increase in translation efficiency in comparison to the one with normal A (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Notably, both messages showed comparable turnover during the entire course of <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>). Collectively, these results firmly established a crucial role of 5â²UTR m<sup>6</sup>A modification in non-canonical translation initiation.</p>
    <p id="P12">Much of our current understanding of cap-independent translation is limited to IRES<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. However, beyond a few examples, many cellular genes capable of cap-independent translation do not seem to contain any IRES elements. The results presented here demonstrate a surprising role of m<sup>6</sup>A in mediating mRNA translation initiation independent of the normal m<sup>7</sup>G cap. How exactly the methylated adenosine recruits the translation machinery merits further investigation. m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been shown to alter RNA secondary structures<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. It is possible that distinct translation initiation factors are recruited to the methylatd 5â²UTR, thereby facilitating cap-independent translation.</p>
    <p id="P13">In contrast to the wide belief that m<sup>6</sup>A modification is static on mRNAs, we found that 5â²UTR methylation in the form of m<sup>6</sup>A is dynamic. Methylation often serves as a mark to distinguish self and foreign DNAs or parental and daughter DNA strands<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The stress-inducible mRNA 5â²UTR methylation permits ribosomes to distinguish nascent transcripts from pre-existing messages, thereby achieving selective mRNA translation (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The unexpected stress-inducible feature of YTHDF2 offers an elegant mechanism for temporal control of m<sup>6</sup>A modification on subsets of mRNAs. The mechanistic connection between 5â²UTR methylation and cap-independent translation solves the central puzzle how selective translation is achieved when global translation is suppressed in responding to stress.</p>

The same mapping procedure was applied to RNA-seq and m<sup>6</sup>A-seq. For Ribo-seq, the 13<sup>th</sup> position (12nt offset from the 5â² end) of the uniquely mapped read was defined as the ribosome âP-siteâ position. The RPF density was computed after mapping uniquely mapped reads to each individual mRNA transcript according to the NCBI Refseq gene annotation. Uniquely mapped reads of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in the mRNA coding region were used to calculate the RPKM values for estimating mRNA expression and translation levels respectively.

In brief, for NCBI RefSeq genes whose maximal read coverage are greater than 15 in the input (RNA-seq), a sliding window of 80 nucleotides with step size of 40 nucleotides was employed to scanning the longest isoform (based on CDS length; in the case of equal CDS, the isoform with longer 5â² UTR was selected). For each window, a Peak-Over-Median score (POM) was derived by calculating the ratio of mean read coverage in the window to the median read coverage of the whole gene body. Windows scoring higher than 3 in the IP sample were obtained and all the resultant overlapping m<sup>6</sup>A peak windows in the IP sample were iteratively clustered to infer the boundary of m<sup>6</sup>A enriched region as well as peak position with maximal read coverage. Finally, a Peak-Over-Input (POI) score was assigned to each m<sup>6</sup>A enriched region by calculating the ratio of POM in the IP sample to that in the input sample. A putative m<sup>6</sup>A site was defined if the POI score was higher than 3. The peak position of each m<sup>6</sup>A site was classified into five mutually exclusive mRNA structural regions including TSS (the first 200 nucleotides of mRNA), 5â² UTR, CDS, stop codon (a 400 nt window flanking mRNA stop codon) and 3â² UTR.</p>

        <title>Selective 5â²UTR m<sup>6</sup>A modification mediates cap-independent translation</title>
        <p><bold>a,</bold> MEF cells transfected with Fluc mRNA reporters were subject to heat shock treatment and the Fluc activity was measured by real-time luminometry. Fluc activities were quantified and normalized to the one containing normal As. <bold>b</bold>, Constructs expressing Fluc reporter with Hsp70 5â²UTR or the one with A103C mutation are depicted on the top. Fluc activities in transfected MEF cells were quantified and normalized to the control containing normal A without stress. <bold>c</bold>, Fluc mRNAs bearing Hsp70 5â²UTR with a single m<sup>6</sup>A site were constructed using sequential splint ligation. After <italic>in vitro</italic> translation in rabbit reticulate lysates, Fluc activities were quantified and normalized to the control lacking m<sup>6</sup>A.

Under the normal growth condition, nuclear FTO demethylates the 5â²UTR m<sup>6</sup>A from nascent transcripts and the matured transcripts are translated via a cap-dependent mechanism. Under stress conditions, nuclear localization of YTHDF2 protects the 5â²UTR of stress-induced transcripts from demethylation. With enhanced 5â²UTR methylation, these transcripts are selectively translated via a cap-independent mechanism.</p>
