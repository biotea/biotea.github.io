      <abstract>
        <p>Cofilin mediates lamellipodium extension and polarized cell migration by stimulating actin filament dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells. Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 and reactivated by cofilin-phosphatase Slingshot-1L (SSH1L). Little is known of signaling mechanisms of cofilin activation and how this activation is spatially regulated. Here, we show that cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L increases â¼10-fold by association with actin filaments, which indicates that actin assembly at the leading edge per se triggers local activation of SSH1L and thereby stimulates cofilin-mediated actin turnover in lamellipodia. We also provide evidence that 14-3-3 proteins inhibit SSH1L activity, dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser-937 and Ser-978 of SSH1L. Stimulation of cells with neuregulin-1Î² induced Ser-978 dephosphorylation, translocation of SSH1L onto F-actinârich lamellipodia, and cofilin dephosphorylation. These findings suggest that SSH1L is locally activated by translocation to and association with F-actin in lamellipodia in response to neuregulin-1Î² and 14-3-3 proteins negatively regulate SSH1L activity by sequestering it in the cytoplasm.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>For cells to migrate, an F-actinârich lamellipodial membrane protrusion is first established in the direction of cell movement and is maintained at the leading edge throughout the migration (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>). Rapid turnover of actin filaments is essential to maintain and extend the lamellipodium for cell migration (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). Cofilin stimulates disassembly and severance of actin filaments at or near the pointed ends and thereby actin monomers are continuously supplied for polymerization and rapid turnover of actin filaments is given support (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the activation of cofilin seems to play an essential role in maintaining and protruding lamellipodia at the leading edge of migrating cells.</p>
      <p>Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 by LIM-kinase (LIMK; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). Suppression of cofilin activity by LIMK overexpression abolished lamellipodium formation and polarized cell migration, which implicates cofilin in cell polarity formation and migration (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Zebda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dawe et al., 2003</xref>). Slingshot-1L (SSH1L) is a member of a Slingshot phosphatase family that dephosphorylates and reactivates an inactive Ser-3âphosphorylated cofilin (P-cofilin; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Niwa et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies showed that cofilin is dephosphorylated in response to various external stimuli that alter cell motility and morphology (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Moon and Drubin, 1995</xref>). However, mechanisms that regulate SSH activity and cofilin dephosphorylation in response to external cues are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that SSH1L is locally activated in lamellipodia by associating with actin filaments and 14-3-3 proteins negatively regulate this activation by sequestering it in the cytoplasm.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>Neuregulin-1Î² (NRG) triggers lamellipodium formation and polarized cell migration of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Spencer et al., 2000</xref>). To investigate mechanisms that regulate cofilin activity, we first determined if NRG stimulation would alter the level of P-cofilin. Using an antiâP-cofilin antibody, we found that NRG induced cofilin dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). During the time of cofilin dephosphorylation, actin remodeling continuously occurred and the cells altered their shapes to form a widespread lamellipodium (Fig. S1 and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>). Expression of dominant-negative Rac (RacN17) or phosphatase-dead SSH1L (SSH1L[CS]) blocked NRG-induced cofilin dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), suggesting that both Rac and SSH1L are involved in NRG-induced cofilin dephosphorylation.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Next, we examined the distribution of SSH1L before and after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). In the absence of NRG, CFP-tagged SSH1L was diffusely distributed in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, after exposure to NRG, CFP-SSH1L accumulated onto the F-actinârich lamellipodium. Immunostaining with anticofilin antibody revealed that cofilin distributed uniformly in nonstimulated cells but accumulated in the lamellipodium after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). In contrast, P-cofilin diffusely distributed before and after NRG stimulation and the level of P-cofilin decreased after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). Thus, nonphosphorylated (active) cofilin is the major component of cofilin signals which accumulate in the lamellipodium. Distribution of cofilin, but not P-cofilin, in lamellipodia was also noted for migrating fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dawe et al., 2003</xref>). Together, these results suggest that SSH1L is recruited to the lamellipodium after NRG stimulation and is involved in the local activation of cofilin.</p>
      <p>Pretreatment of cells with latrunculin-A (Lat-A), an inhibitor of actin assembly, blocked NRG-induced lamellipodium formation and SSH1L accumulation (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>). Lat-A increased the basal level of P-cofilin in MCF-7 cells and inhibited NRG-induced cofilin dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F), which indicates that actin filament assembly is required for cofilin dephosphorylation. NRG induced Rac activation but this was not affected by Lat-A treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F). Expression of SSH1L induced cofilin dephosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but treatment of the cells with Lat-A suppressed SSH1L-induced cofilin dephosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> G), which suggests that cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L depends on actin filament assembly.</p>
      <p>As SSH1L has the potential to bind to F-actin (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Niwa et al., 2002</xref>), we examined if actin filaments would directly control SSH1L activity. In vitro cofilin-phosphatase assays revealed that SSH1L activity was remarkably enhanced in the presence of F-actin, but not G-actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). F-actin alone had no apparent effect. As reported previously (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2003</xref>), full-length SSH1L and an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal NP fragment have the potential to dephosphorylate P-cofilin, but a COOH-terminal PC fragment did not do so (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Addition of F-actin enhanced cofilin-phosphatase activity of full-length SSH1L, but not either the activity of NP or PC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Kinetic analysis revealed that F-actin increased â¼10-fold the cofilin-phosphatase activity of full-length SSH1L, whereas it had no apparent effect on the activity of NP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Because NP scarcely binds to F-actin (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2003</xref>), SSH1L is likely activated by F-actin binding to the COOH-terminal region.</p>

      <p>As SSH1L accumulates onto the lamellipodia after NRG stimulation, we assumed that in nonstimulated cells SSH1L might be sequestered in the cytoplasm in a dormant form. To examine this possibility, we attempted to purify cytosolic proteins that interact with SSH1L. (Myc+His)-tagged SSH1L was expressed in COS-7 cells and the coprecipitating proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). The proteins (28â30 kD) that specifically bind to SSH1L (WT and CS) were identified as 14-3-3Î³, Ï, and Î¶ isoforms using mass spectrometry. Yeast two-hybrid screening also identified 14-3-3Î² as an SSH1L-binding protein (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>). In vitro pull-down assay revealed that full-length SSH1L efficiently bound to GST-14-3-3Î² but a truncated mutant Î1 only weakly and Î2 and Î3 to an even lesser extent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B), thus indicating that regions (961â1049) and (897â960) of SSH1L are responsible for the binding to 14-3-3Î². Phosphatase treatment abrogated SSH1L binding to 14-3-3Î² (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that the interaction depends on the phosphorylation. SSH1L contains the sequences RSSS<sup>937</sup> and RSHS<sup>978</sup>, which accord with the 14-3-3âbinding motif RSXpS (pS, phospho-Ser; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Tzivion and Avruch, 2002</xref>). Therefore, we constructed point mutants of SSH1L (S937A, S978A and 2SA), in which either Ser-937 or Ser-978 or both were replaced by alanine. Pull-down assays revealed that 2SA mutant failed to bind to 14-3-3Î² and S978A and S937A mutants significantly reduced the binding ability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). In addition, (Myc+His)-SSH1L point mutants expressed in COS cells scarcely coprecipitated 14-3-3 proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). These findings suggest that SSH1L interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a manner dependent on Ser-978 and Ser-937 phosphorylation. Decrease in the 14-3-3 binding potential of S978A and S937A mutants suggests that phosphorylation of both of these two sites is important for stable binding of the dimeric form of 14-3-3 proteins (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Tzivion and Avruch, 2002</xref>).</p>

      <p>To examine the effect of 14-3-3 on SSH1L activity, SSH1L and its 2SA mutant expressed in 293T cells were immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro cofilin-phosphatase assays. As expected, endogenous 14-3-3 proteins were coprecipitated with SSH1L(WT), but not with its 2SA mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D). Addition of recombinant 14-3-3Î³ to the reaction mixture significantly suppressed the activity of SSH1L(WT), but not that of SSH1L(2SA) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D). Thus, 14-3-3Î³ inhibits the phosphatase activity of SSH1L by binding to the sequences surrounding pS937/978. Next, we asked if 14-3-3Î³ could protect SSH1L from F-actinâinduced activation. SSH1L in MCF-7 cells was precipitated by GST-14-3-3Î³ and subjected to in vitro phosphatase assay with or without F-actin. SSH1L bound to GST-14-3-3Î³ was not activated by F-actin, whereas control SSH1L, which was precipitated with an anti-SSH1L antibody, was activated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E). Thus, 14-3-3 proteins have the potential to prevent F-actinâinduced activation of SSH1L.</p>
      <p>Next, we examined the effects of 14-3-3Î³ expression on the P-cofilin level in cells. Overexpression of 14-3-3Î³ increased â¼1.2-fold the cellular P-cofilin level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F), which could be explained by 14-3-3Î³ inhibition of the cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L in the cells. Expression of SSH1L(WT) or SSH1L(2SA) in COS cells resulted in a decrease in the cellular P-cofilin level. Coexpression of 14-3-3Î³ suppressed the cofilin dephosphorylation caused by SSH1L(WT) but not that by SSH1L(2SA) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F), which strongly suggests that 14-3-3Î³ increased the cellular P-cofilin level by binding to and inhibiting SSH1L. Recently, it was reported that 14-3-3Î¶ interacts with P-cofilin and thereby protects P-cofilin from dephosphorylation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Gohla and Bokoch, 2002</xref>). However, we were unable to detect the specific interaction between P-cofilin (or cofilin) and 14-3-3Î¶ (or Î² or Î³ isoform) in our assay system (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>). LIMK1 was also reported to bind to 14-3-3Î¶ (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Birkenfeld et al., 2003</xref>), but we detected no interaction between LIMK1 and 14-3-3Î² under the conditions in which SSH1L and TESK1 (another cofilin kinase reported to bind to 14-3-3Î²; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Toshima et al., 2001b</xref>) tightly bound to 14-3-3Î² (Fig. S5).</p>
      <p>SSH1L accumulates in lamellipodia after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). To examine the role of 14-3-3 for SSH1L localization, MCF-7 cells were coexpressed with 14-3-3Î³ and CFP-SSH1L. Expression of 14-3-3Î³ significantly suppressed NRG-induced lamellipodium formation and SSH1L accumulation to the lamellipodium (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A with <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). When a 2SA mutant was expressed, it colocalized with F-actin before and after NRG stimulation and accumulated in lamellipodia after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Coexpression of 14-3-3Î³ had no apparent effect on SSH1L(2SA) accumulation in lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). These results suggest that 14-3-3Î³ suppresses SSH1L translocation to the lamellipodium, in a manner dependent on Ser-937/978 phosphorylation. We also examined the effects of 14-3-3Î³ on the level and localization of cofilin/P-cofilin in MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). Expression of 14-3-3Î³ suppressed both cofilin accumulation in the lamellipodium and reduction in the P-cofilin level after NRG stimulation. Thus, 14-3-3 seems to inhibit SSH1L translocation to the lamellipodium and thereby suppress cofilin dephosphorylation in this region.</p>

      <p>To quantitate the distribution of SSH1L before and after NRG stimulation, cell lysates were fractionated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions. The ratio of SSH1L and actin in the insoluble fraction increased after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A), which indicates that NRG induces actin assembly and translocation of SSH1L from cytosol to actin cytoskeletal fraction, as seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D. Lat-A treatment drastically reduced the amounts of SSH1L and actin in the insoluble fraction. When Myc-SSH1L was expressed in cells, the ratio of Myc-SSH1L in the insoluble fraction (58%) was much higher than that of endogenous SSH1L (16%), but was significantly decreased by coexpression of 14-3-3Î³ (18%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B), which suggests that excess amounts of Myc-SSH1L (over the content of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins) localize onto the cytoskeletal fraction and 14-3-3Î³ can sequester overexpressed Myc-SSH1L in the soluble fraction. Myc-SSH1L in the insoluble fraction slightly increased after NRG stimulation, but coexpression of 14-3-3Î³ suppressed NRG-induced translocation of SSH1L into the insoluble fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). In addition, the ratio of SSH1L(2SA) in the insoluble fraction was extremely high (82%) and was not decreased by coexpression of 14-3-3Î³ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Thus, 14-3-3 proteins appear to regulate subcellular distribution of SSH1L by associating with it through pS937/978 and thereby protecting it from translocation to the actin cytoskeleton. To determine if NRG induces dephosphorylation of SSH1L at Ser-978, we prepared an anti-pS978 antibody specific to Ser-978âphosphorylated SSH1L (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>). The level of Ser-978 phosphorylation significantly decreased after NRG stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C). Accordingly, NRG-induced translocation of SSH1L appears to be regulated by dephosphorylation of Ser-978.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Based on our observations, we propose a likely scenario for NRG-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation as follows (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D): (a) NRG stimulates F-actin assembly to form a lamellipodial extension (through Rac activation); (b) NRG concomitantly induces SSH1L dephosphorylation at Ser-978 and/or Ser-937 and its dissociation from 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm; (c) SSH1L released from 14-3-3 is translocated to the F-actinârich lamellipodium and is activated by F-actin in this region; and (d) activated SSH1L induces cofilin dephosphorylation and thereby local activation of cofilin in the lamellipodium. Because the localization and activity of SSH1L are regulated by 14-3-3 binding, identification of protein kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) that control the SSH1Lâ14-3-3 interaction will be important. Furthermore, it must be answered how SSH1L is dephosphorylated when it is bound to 14-3-3.</p>
      <p>During cell migration, the cell is polarized to form an F-actinârich lamellipodial extension in the direction of cell movement. In our model, once the F-actinârich structure is established in the front of migrating cells, SSH1L is recruited and activated in this region and supports local activation of cofilin in the lamellipodium. Given the essential role of cofilin in actin filament turnover, spatially restricted activation of SSH1L by F-actin will be an important mechanism for maintaining and extending lamellipodia in the front of the cell and sustaining polarized cell migration.</p>
      <p>In addition, LIMK1 was also activated by NRG stimulation (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200401136/DC1</ext-link>), as reported previously (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Vadlamudi et al., 2002</xref>). Previous studies showed that LIMK1 is required for lamellipodium formation and cell migration (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Nishita et al., 2002</xref>). LIMK1 may play a role in the establishment of lamellipodia by transiently inactivating cofilin and inducing actin polymerization. LIMK1 may also contribute to stimulate actin turnover in lamellipodia by releasing free actin and cofilin from an actinâcofilin complex, which is produced from the pointed end of actin filaments by the action of cofilin (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Rosenblatt and Mitchison, 1998</xref>). Because the released P-cofilin can be reused after dephosphorylation by SSH1L, coordinated activation of LIMK1 and SSH1L can accelerate the recycling of cofilin and thereby promote actin turnover. In contrast to the accumulation of SSH1L in lamellipodia after NRG stimulation, LIMK1 localizes diffusely in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the spatially distinct distribution of LIMK1 and SSH1L can generate the polarized pattern of cofilin activation and may contribute to polarized cell migration.</p>
