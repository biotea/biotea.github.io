      <abstract>
        <p>Activation of Akt-mediated signaling pathways is crucial for survival, differentiation, and regeneration of muscle cells. A proteomic-based search for novel substrates of Akt was therefore undertaken in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> murine muscle cells exploiting protein characterization databases in combination with an antiâphospho-Akt substrate antibody. A Scansite database search predicted Ankrd2 (Ankyrin repeat domain protein 2, also known as ARPP) as a novel substrate of Akt. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that Akt phosphorylates Ankrd2 at Ser-99. Moreover, by kinase assay with recombinant Akt1 and Akt2, as well as by single-isoform silencing, we demonstrated that Ankrd2 is a specific substrate of Akt2. Ankrd2 is typically found in skeletal muscle cells, where it mediates the transcriptional response to stress conditions. In an attempt to investigate the physiological implications of Ankrd2 phosphorylation by Akt2, we found that oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> triggers this phosphorylation. Moreover, the forced expression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant form of Ankrd2 in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts promoted a faster differentiation program, implicating Akt-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-99 in the negative regulation of myogenesis in response to stress conditions.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The 67-kDa serine/threonine kinase Akt was originally identified as the cellular homologue of the v-<italic>akt</italic> oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bellacosa <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is an essential enzyme in all eukaryotes and is involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, cell survival, differentiation, glucose mobilization, homeostasis, cell migration, and apoptosis.</p><p>Three isoforms of Akt exist, namely Akt1/PKBÎ±, Akt2/PKBÎ², and Akt3/PKBÎ³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Brazil <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), sharing a high degree of amino acid identity and the same ways of activation. Once activated, Akt is distributed in all cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Andjelkovic <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), where it phosphorylates its substrates. Groundbreaking experiments conducted in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alessi <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>) with peptides containing variants of the first direct target of Akt, identified on a specific residue of the GSK3 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Cross <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>), defined the minimal recognition motif of Akt as R-X-R-X-X-pS/T-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alessi <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), where R is an arginine, X is any amino acid, and B represents bulky hydrophobic residues.</p><p>Akt-phosphorylated substrates are involved in a variety of cellular functions spanning from cell growth and survival (modulating proapoptotic and antiapoptotic transcription factors) to cell migration and invasion, from cellular metabolism to angiogenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). By using a functional proteomic approach, recently our laboratory identified Lamin A/C as a novel Akt nuclear substrate, implicating the phosphorylation of Lamin A/C by Akt in the correct functioning of the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cenni <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Skeletal muscle is a tissue highly responsive to Akt: Akt action has been linked to skeletal muscle development, regeneration, and hypertrophy through several pathways that culminate in stimulation of protein synthesis, inhibition of atrophy, and prevention of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Glass, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hoffman and Nader, 2004</xref>). The function of the single Akt isoforms has been extensively studied in skeletal muscle also. This tissue revealed specialized roles for IRS-1/Akt2 and IRS-2/Akt1 in glucose and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bouzakri <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). In 2002, Sumitani and colleagues demonstrated that Akt1 and Akt2 differently regulate muscle creatine kinase and myogenin gene transcription in differentiating C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Sumitani <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Later, by a small RNA interfering approach, Heron-Milhavet reached the conclusions that Akt1 only stimulates cell proliferation, whereas Akt2 appears to be involved in cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Heron-Milhavet <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This result had been extensively supported by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Vandromme <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Al-Khalili <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Rochat <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). More recently, however, Wilson and colleagues have demonstrated that both Akts are necessary for full myoblast differentiation and maturation. In particular, in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts, the loss of Akt1 blocked muscular differentiation at its earliest stages, preventing induction of muscle-specific proteins and inhibiting formation of multinucleated myofibers. On the contrary, myoblasts lacking Akt2 differentiated normally, although resultant myofibers were thinner and incorporated fewer nuclei than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wilson and Rotwein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Rotwein and Wilson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The MARP (muscle ankyrin repeat protein) family consists of three proteins, namely Ankrd1 also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein, expressed in cardiac muscle, Ankrd2, also called ARPP expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and Ankrd23 or DARP which is found in both skeletal and cardiac muscle but is also up-regulated in type 2 diabetes. All MARPs are primarily involved in the defense of the cells against injuries, following a prolonged muscle exercise, in response to acute exercise, or during work overload hypertrophy. A role for these proteins also has been described in pathological conditions, including tumors, diabetes, or a number of muscular dystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Our data establish Ankrd2 as a new signaling target of Akt2, and indicate this phosphorylation to be involved in muscle differentiation following oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of Ankrd2/ARPP as an Akt substrate in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> muscle cells</title><p>To identify muscular proteins phosphorylated by Akt, crude lysates from C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts at different days of myogenic differentiation (from day 0 to day 7) were assayed with an antibody specifically raised against the Akt consensus phosphorylation motif, the specificity of which has been widely demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alessi <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Through this biochemical approach, several differentiation-responsive proteins were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>); however, we focused on proteins phosphorylated during the earliest stages of muscle differentiation, when the outcome of the entire differentiation process may be most affected. Indeed, it was especially during this stage that the highest activation of Akt was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; WB: antiâphospho-Akt substrates). In particular, at day 1 (d1), 11 proteins were evidently phosphorylated. Starting from the average molecular weight assigned to each of these phosphoproteins (calculated as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) a Scansite analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scansite.mit.edu/dbsequence_one.html">http://scansite.mit.edu/dbsequence_one.html</ext-link>) was performed. The search was carried out on a SWISS-PROT database specific for both <italic>mus musculus</italic> and muscular tissue proteins, querying the presence of a high-stringency Akt consensus phosphorylation motif, that is, [R][A-Z][R][A-Z][A-Z][S/T], phosphorylated at serine or threonine. This study resulted in a short list of potential Akt substrates, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Akt phosphorylates Ankrd2.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, the use of the Akt broad inhibitors perifosine and Akt inhibitor IV completely prevented Ankrd2 phosphorylation. Conversely, the MEK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD-98059 did not interfere with Ankrd2 phosphorylation by Akt (unpublished data). Moreover p70 S6 kinase-1, an AGC kinase downstream of PI3K, which shares the Akt consensus phosphorylation motif, did not signal to Ankrd2, because treatment with rapamycin (a specific inhibitor of the S6K upstream kinase, mTORC1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hong <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), had no effect on Ankrd2 phosphorylation after insulin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To get more insight into the Akt isoform specificity of Ankrd2 phosphorylation, additional experiments were performed with specific inhibitors. Flag-Ankrd2âexpressing HEK 293T cells were treated with Akt1/2 or Akt2 selective inhibitors (respectively, Akt inhibitors VIII and XII) and were stimulated with insulin. Then lysates were probed for phosphorylated Ankrd2.

Therefore, based on these and on our observation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effect on cyclin D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, anti-cyclin D3), we analyzed whether Ankrd2 phosphorylation at Ser- 99 affects the outcome of muscle differentiation.</p><p>Differentiating C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> cells were transfected with empty vector and WT or Ser99Ala Ankrd2.

It plays both structural and regulatory roles. Indeed, in mature muscle, Ankrd2, which is mainly localized in the I-band of the fibers, physically interacts with many structural proteins as titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Miller <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), myopalladin (a nebulin-anchoring protein+, and telethonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kojic <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). It has also been reported, however, that Ankrd2 can interact with regulatory nuclear proteins as promyelocytic leukemia protein, p53, and with transcription factor YB-1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kojic <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In muscle stressed by cardiotoxin injection or by dry ice, Ankrd2 accumulates in the nuclei of sarcomere-damaged myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Tsukamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Consistent with Ankrd2 nuclear accumulation in euchromatin, where genes are activated, and with its binding to transcription factors, it has been suggested that Ankrd2 may act as a transcriptional regulator in the nuclei of injured muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Tsukamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Of note, Ankrd2 transcripts and protein increase in response to muscle injury, lengthening contractions, and after physical exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Barash <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lehti <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), underscoring the importance of the role of Ankrd2 in the rescue of stressed or damaged muscle cells.</p><p>A recent study, performed on C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts, suggests that Ankrd2 contributes to the proliferation and apoptosis machinery during myogenic differentiation mainly through the p53 network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bean <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these data suggest a dual role for Ankrd2: During muscle differentiation, Ankrd2 contributes to regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of differentiating myoblasts and stabilizes forming myotubes; in addition, Ankrd2 participates in the machinery that regulates protection of fibers after muscle injury.</p><p>By using a proteomic approach, we have identified Ankrd2 as a novel Akt substrate in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> muscle cells. Running the human Ankrd2 sequence into the Scansite database predicted Ser-99 to be a putative, high-stringency site for Akt phosphorylation. This serine lies in a canonical Akt phosphorylation motif, highly conserved in all Ankrd2 sequences cloned so far. Indeed, Ser-99 of Ankrd2 is one of the more than 500 phospho-Akt motif sites identified in a recent large-scale phosphoproteomic analysis, using the phospho-Akt substrate antibody to capture peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Moritz <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). By mutational analysis and in vitro kinase assays, we show here that Ankrd2 is selectively phosphorylated by Akt at Ser-99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Akt1 and Akt2 are closely related protein kinases with a conserved phosphorylation motif. They are all activated through similar mechanisms involving upstream kinases PI3K and PDK1. The function of each Akt isoform has been studied in knockout mice as well as in isoform-specific knockdowns in cell cultures by specific siRNA. These studies reveal the existence of both redundant and distinct functions of Akt isoforms. In particular, recent findings demonstrated that Akt1 and Akt2 can even have opposing roles. There is little information, however, about the isoform-specific downstream substrates of Akt. Interestingly, our model provides a further confirmation of the existence of distinct substrates for Akt1 and Akt2. Indeed, by both in vitro kinase assays using recombinant active Akt1 or Akt2, and by targeting each isoform with siRNAs, we demonstrated that Ankrd2 is an Akt2 selective substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These findings are in good agreement with the stronger binding affinity shown by Ankrd2 toward Akt2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), with respect to Akt1 (lower) or Akt3 (absent); moreover, Akt2 activity is a requisite for its binding to Ankrd2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Similar results were obtained by means of Akt inhibitors VIII and XII (selective for Akt1/2 and Akt2, respectively) both in HEK 293T cells stimulated with insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), and in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). All in all, these data represent new, important advances in the issue of Akt substrate isoform specificity as they establish Akt2 as the Ser99-Ankrd2 kinase. This conclusion does not exclude the possibility, however, that other AGC kinases, with similar substrate specificity, such as SGK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Brunet <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), might phosphorylate Ankrd2 at Ser-99 or at a different epitope, possibly in a different subcellular compartment or in varied biological conditions.</p><p>A large body of evidence supports the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling axis upon the arrival of ROS in several cellular models, as fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Shaw <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ushio-Fukai <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), and rat primary astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Salsman <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway might have a pivotal role in controlling several downstream antiapoptotic and prosurvival cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Mercurio and Manning, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Storz and Toker, 2003</xref>). Here we demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway is also activated by stress in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts. Moreover, in differentiating C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub>, stress promotes Ankrd2 phosphorylation by Akt and binding to the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, B and C</xref>). In muscle cells, ROS release occurs in response to mechanical stress, contraction, and, after a prolonged muscle exercise, as a consequence of aging and pathological conditions, as primary or secondary myopathies. Oxidative stress activates various signal transduction pathways, culminating with the activation of transcription factors nuclear factor ÎºB and Jun N-terminal kinase. Through these pathways, ROS stimuli lead to the expression of proteins involved in the detoxification of ROS themselves, driving in turn to the rescue of the cells. As the stress becomes too long or too intense, however, cells respond by triggering protein damage, peroxidation of lipids and nucleotides, membranes break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Konat, 2003</xref>), and eventually apoptosis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Oldham and Bowen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Orzechowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In our model, we report that short-term H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stimulation triggers a down-regulation of cyclin D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), confirming that oxidative stress can delay muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Langen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Ardite <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zaccagnini <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>What is more, the forced expression of an Akt-phosphorylationâdefective Ankrd2 mutant in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> cells, induced to differentiate, robustly increased both myotube formation (as assessed by multinucleated cell counting, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the amount of differentiation and muscle specific markers as cyclin A, cyclin D3, and myogenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ankrd2 at Ser-99 can hamper expression of genes essential for myogenic differentiation. Altogether, we conclude that Akt-phosphorylated Ankrd2 contributes to the oxidative stressâdependent slackening of muscle differentiation.</p><p>In unstimulated conditions, Ankrd2 is prominently located in the cytoplasm of differentiating cells. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, however, induces Ankrd2 to massively redistribute into the nuclear compartment, where its binding partners are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kojic <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Conversely, the phosphorylation-defective form of Ankrd2 is unable to relocalize into the nucleus upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, indicating that Ankrd2 phosphorylation regulates its cellular distribution and, in turn, modulates Ankrd2 binding to target proteins, including transcription factors implicated in muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kojic <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Possibly, upon the arrival of the stimulus, following Ankrd2 binding to Akt and its subsequent phosphorylation, Ankrd2 dissociates from this complex to migrate to the nucleus and interact with its effectors. Indeed, although a small amount of Akt resides in the nucleus and responds to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stimulation similarly to its cytosolic counterpart, our results demonstrate that Ankrd2 associates to Akt in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, AâC</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S1).</p><p>All together, Ankrd2 phosphorylation by Akt should be considered a limiting factor to muscle differentiation pathways. Indeed, the basal phosphorylation of Ankrd2 in unstimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) might concur to control muscle differentiation rate, ensuring the time needed to allow proper assembly of the whole differentiation machinery. Similarly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced Ankrd2 phosphorylation negatively interferes with muscle differentiation pathways. Therefore, during stress, differentiating myoblasts might sense the extent of the stress and exploit the negative effects of phospho-Ankrd2 to decide whether to drive apoptotic or rescue pathways. A model for this mechanism has been proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7:</label><caption><p>Model for inhibition of myogenesis following Ankrd2 phosphorylation by Akt2 induced by stress conditions.

Under stressful conditions that trigger the production of ROS as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Akt2 induces a huge increase in Ankrd2 phosphorylation at Ser-99, inducing its nuclear translocation and resulting in a negative regulation of muscle differentiation pathways.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2946fig7"/></fig><p>As recently another MARP, Ankrd1, has been identified to be point mutated in four different dilated cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Arimura <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Moulik <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), it will be interesting in the future to check the phosphorylation of Ser-99 in patients affected by different types of musculoskeletal pathologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> mouse myoblasts and HEK 293T cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose (InvitrogenâLife Technologies, Groningen, The Netherlands) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (EuroClone, Leeds, UK) at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
