        <p id="P1">Somatic mutations of FLT3 involving internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domainor point mutations in the kinase domain (TKD) appear to activate FLT3 in a FLT3 ligand (FL) - independent manner. To determine whether or not FLT3 mutants respond to FL for their activation, a FL-deficient (FL<sup>â/â</sup>) murine embryo fibroblast cell line (MEF) was established. Expression of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutations in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells resulted in low levels of constitutive phosphorylation of FLT3.However, a more than 4-fold increase of FLT3 autophosphorylation was induced by exogenous FL. Rescue of endogenous FL expression in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells expressing FLT3 mutants led to more than a 3-fold increase of FLT3 phosphorylation. FL addition led to further activation of the FLT3 receptors and enhanced survival and/or decreased apoptosis in leukemia-derived cell lines and primary leukemic cells expressing FLT3 mutations. Functional studies revealed that exogenous FL promoted the colony-forming and recloning abilities of FLT3 mutant transduced primary bone marrow cells derived from FL<sup>â/â</sup> mice. Endogenous FL contributes <italic>in vivo</italic> to functional signaling through FLT3 as noted by the decreased survival of FL<sup>+/+</sup>ITD<sup>+/+</sup> mice compared with FL<sup>â/â</sup>ITD<sup>+/+</sup> mice. These data suggest that FL leads to further activation of FLT3 mutants and is especially important in light of recent findings of elevated FL levels in AML patients in response to chemotherapy.</p>

      <p id="P2">FLT3 is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gilliland and Griffin, 2002</xref>). It is normally expressed by CD34 <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, dendritic cells, brain, placenta and gonads (Gilliland and Griffin). In leukemia, FLT3 expression is observed at the cells of most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), blast crisis chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), and a smaller percentage of patients with T-ALL (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Birg <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Drexler <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Carow <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). The ligand for FLT3 receptor is expressed by most leukemia/lymphoma-derived cell lines and primary AML cells (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Drexler <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Meierhoff <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brasel <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Interaction of wtFLT3 with FL causes receptor dimerization, leading to the activation of its tyrosine kinase domain and autophosphorylation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Lyman <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). Activated FLT3 transduces signals through phosphorylation of phospholipase C; casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL); Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphotase 2 (SHP2); Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP); signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5); and the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3 kinase pathways (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dosil, <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Rosnet <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Lavagna-Sevenier <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Marchetto <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Activation of FLT3 by exogenous FL stimulates the proliferation of primary AML blasts (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Lisovsky <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). FL also induces autocrine signaling in AML (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P3">FLT3/ITD mutations are present in approximately 24% of patients with AML, while mutations in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) occurs in about 8% of patients with AML (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Gilliland and Griffin, 2002</xref>). Both types of mutations have been reported to lead to constitutive activation of FLT3 in a ligand-independent manner with resultant transformation of hematopoietic cell lines (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fenski <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>.,2001</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Tse <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). FLT3/ITD mutations are associated with leukocytosis in AML and with leukemic transformation of myelodysplasia (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Kiyoi <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Horrike <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Meshinchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The FLT3/ITD mutations, in particular, are associated with poor prognosis in patients with AML (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Iwai <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Kiyoi <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P4">The current body of data regarding the FL-independent activation of FLT3 receptors by FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutations is derived from transfection of these mutant receptors into cell lines, most of which express FL. To investigate whether FL plays a role in the activation of FLT3 mutant receptors, we established FL deficient MEF cells from FL knockout mice. FLT3 mutants and wtFLT3 were introduced into the FL<sup>â/â</sup>cells to enable us to test the effects of FL on the different type of FLT3 receptors. FL addition augmented phosphorylation of FLT3 mutants and some downstream signaling proteins. FL stimulation also led to increased survival and anti-apoptosis in these cells. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> data, FL<sup>+/+</sup>ITD<sup>+/+</sup> mice have decreased survival compared with FL<sup>â/â</sup>ITD<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Recent studies have demonstrated several log induction of FL levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy for AML (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that FL augments the activation of FLT3 mutants, which is associated with increased proliferation and prolonged survival.</p>

        <title>FL addition leads to increased phosphorylation of FLT3 in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells expressing wtFLT3, FLT3/ITD, and FLT3/TKD mutants</title>
        <p id="P5">Most of the previously published data establishing the paradigm that FLT3 mutants cause activation of FLT3 receptors in a ligand-independent manner were derived from experiments using cell lines expressing FL. In addition, all the experiments were performed in culture medium with serum which contains FL. This leaves open the possibilities that either ligand expressed by these cells could be having an effect through autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine activation of FLT3 mutants or that ligand in the serum could contribute to the activation of the mutant receptors. To eliminate the complicating factor of autocrine, paracrine, and intracrine FL expression on mutant FLT3 activation, FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells were established from FL<sup>â/â</sup> mice. The FL deficiency in the established FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF bulk cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Absence of murine wtFLT3 expression was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). The FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells were then transduced by a lentiviral vector containing the wt, ITD or TKD forms of FLT3 and clones were selected by limited dilution. Stable expression was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Cells were then cultured in serum-free medium (to eliminate the effect of FL contained in serum) for 16 hours before stimulation with and without FL. The addition of FL induced more than a 4-fold increase in FLT3 phosphorylation in FL<sup>â/â</sup>MEF-FLT3, FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-ITD, and FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-TKD cells [quantitated by GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad)] (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 4, 6, and 8 versus lanes 3, 5, and 7). There was no phosphorylation of FLT3 in FL<sup>â/â</sup>MEF-FLT3 and the phosphorylation of the FLT3 mutants in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells was significantly less in the absence of FL stimulation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 3, 5, and 7). Similar results were obtained from experiments using both bulk cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) and additional clones (data not shown). These data suggest that the addition of FL leads to increased activation of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD receptors.</p>
        <p id="P6">We next studied the effect of endogenous FL expression on the activation of FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutant receptors. FL was introduced into different clones of FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-FLT3, FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-ITD, and FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-TKD cells by lentiviral transduction to simulate FL expression by leukemia blasts and cell lines. The expression of FL was assessed by the detection of the secreted form of FL in the cell culture supernatant. The level of secreted FL was comparable in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-FLT3, FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-ITD, and FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-TKD cells expressing FL (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These cells were cultured in serum-free medium followed by stimulation with and without FL. Endogenous expression of FL resulted in a more than 3-fold increase in FLT3 phosphorylation in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-FLT3, FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-ITD, and FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-TKD cells in the absence of exogenous FL (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, lanes 3, 7, and 11 vs 1, 5, and 9). The addition of exogenous FL (100ng/mL) did not further augment FLT3 phosphorylation in FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-FLT3, FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-ITD, or FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF-TKD cells expressing endogenous FL (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, lanes 4, 8, and 12 vs lanes 3, 7, and 11). These results strongly suggest that endogenous FL expression strongly contributes to the observed activation of mutant FLT3 receptors.</p>

        <title>Exogenous FL augments the phosphorylation of FLT3 and enhances survival and resistance to apoptosis in cell lines expressing FLT3 mutants</title>
        <p id="P7">The possibility of further activation of FLT3 mutant receptors by exogenous FL was also tested in cell lines in which FL autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine stimulation of FLT3 receptor might exist. TF1 cells that do not express FLT3 receptor were transfected with constructs containing mutant forms of FLT3. TF1 cells expressing FLT3 mutant receptors were starved for 16 hours in serum-free medium and washed once with PBS to deplete soluble FL (either produced by the cells or contained in the serum). These cells were then stimulated with exogenous FL for 15 minutes. More than 2-fold enhancement of FLT3 phosphorylation was detected in both TF1/ITD and TF1/TKD cell lines (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Slightly increased STAT5 phosphorylation (1.8-fold increase in both TF1/ITD and TF1/TKD), AKT phosphorylation, and AKT protein expression was also observed after FL stimulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). To assess the functional effect of exogenous FL, TF1/ITD and TF1/TKD cells were cultured in serum-free medium in the absence and presence of FL for 48 hours. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V and 7AAD staining followed by FACS analysis. The presence of FL decreased the apoptotic population from 61.27% to 49.54% and from 40.2% to 31.63% in TF1/ITD and TF1/TKD cells, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). There was no change of cell cycle status in response to FL in these cells (data not shown). Survival assays performed by counting viable cell numbers revealed that exogenous FL increased the survival of TF1/ITD cells cultured in serum free medium (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, P&lt;0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in TF1/TKD cells in the presence and absence of FL (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). This data suggests that the presence of FL augments the activation of FLT3/ITD mutant receptors and can contribute to resistance to apoptosis.</p>
        <p id="P8">BaF3 is another cell line lacking expression of endogenous FLT3. BaF3 cells transfected with mutant forms of FLT3 were starved in serum-free medium for 16 hours and washed with PBS before FL stimulation. The addition of FL increased FLT3 phosphorylation in both BaF3/ITD and BaF3/TKD cells. An increase of MAPK phosphorylation was also observed (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In both BaF3/ITD and BaF3/TKD cells, exogenous FL also led to slightly increased phosphorylation of AKT (1.3 and 2.2-fold increase in BaF3/ITD and BaF3/TKD, respectively, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Changes of other FLT3 downstream signals were not observed. An MTT survival assay was performed in BaF3/ITD and BaF3/TKD cells cultured in serum-free medium in the presence and absence of FL for 4 days. FL addition resulted in increased survival of BaF3/ITD and BaF3/TKD cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, P &lt; 0.05). The effect was also confirmed by counting viable cell numbers by trypan blue exclusion (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, P&lt;0.05). These findings suggest that FL stimulation prolongs the survival of cells expressing FLT3 mutants.</p>
        <p id="P9">The MV411 cell line is a human leukemia-derived cell line expressing a FLT3/ITD mutation and has lost the wild-type allele. In agreement with the results seen in TF1 and BaF3 transfectants, exogenous FL resulted in increased phosphorylation of FLT3 in MV411 cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Slightly enhanced phosphorylation of FLT3 downstream signaling, including STAT5 and AKT, was also detected after FL stimulation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). MV411 cells express endogenous FL that might diminish the degree of the effect of exogenous FL on FLT3/ITD mutant receptor. To evaluate the effect of FL on the survival of MV411 cells, MV411 cells were cultured in serum-free medium in the presence and absence of FL for 4 days. FL addition led to prolonged survival of MV411 cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>, P &lt; 0.05).</p>

        <title>FL addition results in increased phosphorylation of mutant FLT3 receptors and prolongs survival of primary AML blasts expressing homozygous FLT3/ITD mutations</title>
        <p id="P10">To study whether further activation of mutant FLT3 receptors in response to FL also occurs in primary cells, experiments were carried on primary AML blasts expressing homozygous FLT3/ITD mutations (i.e., no detectable wild type FLT3 by PCR). The rate of homozygous FLT3/ITD mutations is very low (&lt;3% of AML cases) and we had access to only 4 samples that were in sufficient quantities to thaw with adequate viability and recovery of sufficient protein to carry out the Western blots. The blasts were stimulated with 100 ng/mL FL. Consistent with what we observed in the FLT3 mutant cell lines, exogenous FL caused enhanced FLT3 phosphorylation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Increased MAPK phosphorylation was also detected in two out of four samples (patient #1 and 2). The survival of AML blasts was assessed by culturing them in complete medium with and without FL for 4 days. The presence of FL increased the survival of AML blasts derived from three of four patient samples (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, P &lt; 0.05 in patient #2, 3 and 4). Possible mutations involving genes other than FLT3 could occur in patient #1 and overshadow the biologic effect of FL. Relatively high level expression of endogenous FL might be another possibility that could diminish the effect of added FL.</p>

        <title>FL stimulation increases the clonogenic potential of FL<sup>â/â</sup> primary hematopoietic cells expressing FLT3/ITD or FLT3/TKD mutations</title>
        <p id="P11">To evaluate the effect of FL stimulation on primary hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing FLT3 mutants, lineage negative progenitors were harvested from FL<sup>â/â</sup>mice and transduced with FLT3/ITD-GFP, FLT3/TKD-GFP, or GFP control lentivirus. GFP-positive cells were selected by FACS, cultured in methylcellulose with and without FL, and the colony numbers were counted after 9 days. The number of firstâgeneration colonies did not differ significantly between ITD, TKD and control vector transduced bone marrow (BM) cells when cultured in the absence of FL stimulation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Exogenous FL slightly increased the number of first-generation colonies derived from BM cells transduced with FLT3 mutants (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">After colonies were counted, all of the cells in each culture dish were harvested from the methylcellulose, washed and re-plated in fresh methylcellulose medium to examine their potential to form colonies upon secondary plating; this process was repeated for two more passages to determine the frequency of tertiary and quaternary colonies. Control FL<sup>â/â</sup> BM cells transduced with GFP control vector alone cultured in the absence and presence of FL exhausted virtually all of their proliferative potential by the fourth passage (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Upon serial re-plating, the number of colonies from FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD transduced FL<sup>â/â</sup> BM cells cultured in the absence of FL also decreased with each passage (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). In contrast, BM cells from FL<sup>â/â</sup> mice transduced with FLT3 mutants and cultured in the presence of FL retained their re-plating activity and continued to produce colonies despite repeated passages (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, P &lt; 0.05).

        <p id="P14">The work by Li, et al demonstrated that FLT3/ITD knock-in mice developed myeloproliferative disease (MPD) which eventually progressed to mortality by 6 to 20 months (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P15">The biochemical characteristics of FLT3/ITD mutations were initially investigated by expressing FLT3/ITD mutations in Cos7 cells (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Kiyoi <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). These initial studies suggested that FLT3/ITD receptors dimerize in a ligand-independent manner, leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor through constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domain. FL-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of FLT3 was also observed in Cos7 and 32D cells transfected with FLT3/TKD mutations (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). However, most cell lines express FL and thus the possible contribution of their endogenous FL expression to the activation of FLT3 mutant receptors was not clear. It was previously shown that autophosphorylation of wtFLT3 receptors can occur without exogenous FL stimulation in 32D and BaF3 cells expressing wtFLT3 (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>.,2002</xref>). FL has been shown to stimulate autocrine signaling in primary AML blasts expressing wtFLT3 (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>.,2004</xref>). In the present study, our use of FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells eliminated the possibility of autocrine, paracrine, or intracrine stimulation of FLT3 receptors by FL. FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells transduced with FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutants were further cultured in serum-free medium before addition of FL to exclude the possible effect of FL contained in the serum. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD receptors in response to FL addition was observed, thus indicating that activation was augmented by FL. Furthermore, when endogenous FL expression was rescued in these cell lines by retroviral transduction, there was no further enhancement of FLT3 phosphorylation by added exogenous FL, implying that autocrine, paracrine, and/or intracrine FL may lead to complete activation of mutant FLT3 receptors. We also saw evidence, in TF1 cells expressing FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD mutants, MV4-11 cells and primary AML samples with homozygous FLT3/ITD mutations, that maximal activation of FLT3 mutant receptors was only observed in response to addition of FL. The effect of concurrent stimulation of wtFLT3 receptors was excluded because these cells exclusively express mutant versions of FLT3. The fact that these cell lines did not show full activation by endogenous FL, in contrast to the FL transfected FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cell lines, could be reflective of the higher level of FL expression driven by the retroviral promoter. The average FL level was approximately 6000 pg/mL in the FL transfected FL<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cell lines (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), which is similar to the significant surge of FL in plasma measured in patients with AML after chemotherapy. The surge of FL results in a blunting of the inhibitory activity of FLT3 kinase inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P16">Thus, it seems likely that part of the phosphorylation of FLT3 mutants observed in Cos7 and 32D cells is at least partially explained by autocrine, paracrine, and/or intracrine FL stimulation and/or stimulation by FL contained in the serum. This hypothesis is further supported by the findings that an anti-FLT3 antibody that blocks FL binding to the receptors is able to at least partially block the phosphorylation of FLT3 mutants along with its downstream signaling in BaF3 and 32D cells (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Piloto <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Our findings suggest that FL might be required for complete activation of FLT3 mutants. As to the mechanism that explains this observed stimulation, the possibility that increased stability and/or decreased turnover of phosphorylated forms in response to FL addition was raised. However, the possibility of decreased turnover is less likely since the FL stimulation was for a short period (15 minutes) in our experiments. Further studies will be required to investigate the exact mechanism.</p>
      <p id="P17">Our data suggests that FLT3 mutant receptors still respond to FL with further activation. However, the increase of activation of downstream signaling of FLT3 in response to FL addition is relatively modest in comparison to that of the FLT3 mutant receptor itself. Whether FL mediated activation of FLT3 mutant receptors induces activation of other unknown signaling pathways requires further investigation. The functional effect (survival and apoptosis) of exogenous FL on FLT3 mutant receptors is of modest effect in the experiment with some of the cell lines and one of four primary AML samples. One possible explanation is the minimization of further effect of added FL by the presence of endogenous FL expression.</p>
      <p id="P18">In this report, we demonstrate that FL stimulation of mutants of FLT3 contributes to the immortalization and proliferation of FL<sup>â/â</sup> primary hematopoietic progenitors. In addition, FL promoted increased survival of TF1 and BaF3 cells expressing FLT3 mutants as well as MV411 cells. FL also prolonged the survival of primary AML blasts expressing homozygous FLT3/ITD mutations. Further evidence also comes from an anti-FLT3 antibody that blocks FL binding to FLT3. This antibody partially inhibits the proliferation of BaF3/ITD cells (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Finally, endogenous FL decreased the survival of homozygous ITD mice (FL<sup>+/+</sup> ITD<sup>+/+</sup>) compared with FL knock-out mice (FL<sup>â/â</sup> ITD<sup>+/+</sup>). Thus, FL plays a role in survival and proliferative signaling mediated by FLT3 mutants. The role of FL in stimulating FLT3 mutants is also consistent with a recent report showing FL shifts the dose-response of FLT3/ITD mutants in response to a number of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), many of which are currently in clinical trials (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). It is noted that FL levels are induced by &gt;50 folds in patients undergoing chemotherapy for AML (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Levis M, 2011</xref>). The induction of high levels of ligand and resultant stimulation of mutant receptors might also account for the failure to achieve thorough inhibition of FLT3 signaling in some FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor clinical trials. As FLT3/ITD and TKD mutants have been identified in approximately 24% and 8%of AML patients, respectively, FL mediated activation of FLT3 mutant receptors might be contributing to FLT3-mediated leukemogenesis (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Nakao <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Yokota <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Stirewalt <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Duhier <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). For all of the above reasons, FL targeted therapy, either antibodies against FL itself or those that would block the ability of FL to activate FLT3, may be indicated as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of FLT3 mutant AML.</p>
      <p id="P19">These findings also potentially have important implications regarding other growth factor receptor pathways. Autostimulated growth of leukemia cells has been associated with expression of GM-CSF, SCF, and VEGF (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Freedman <italic>et al</italic>.,1993</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Pietsch, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Rogers <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bellamy <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Ligand-independent activation of the KIT tyrosine kinase domain induced by the KIT G560 and KIT V816 activating mutations has been reported (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Furitsu <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). EGFR kinase domain mutations resulting in constitutive phosphorylation and activation of EGFR have been identified in lung cancer (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Pao and Miller, 2005</xref>). Based on the data presented here, it is possible that the activation of these KIT and EGFR mutant receptors still respond to SCF and EGF, respectively, to some degree. Generation of SCF and EGF deficient cell lines with expression of KIT and EGFR mutants, respectively, would shed light on the generality of these findings.</p>
