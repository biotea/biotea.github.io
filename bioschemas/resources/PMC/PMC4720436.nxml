  <body>
    <p id="P2">Vertebrates have a unique 3D body shape in which correct tissue/organ shape and alignment are essential for function. For example, vision requires the lens to be centred in the eye cup which must in turn be correctly positioned in the head<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Tissue morphogenesis depends on force generation, force transmission through the tissue, and response of tissues and extracellular matrix (ECM) to force<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Although a century ago D'Arcy Thompson postulated that terrestrial animal body shapes are conditioned by gravity<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, there has been no animal model directly demonstrating how the aforementioned mechano-morphogenetic processes are coordinated to generate a body shape that withstands gravity. Here, we report a unique medaka mutant, <italic>hirame</italic> (<italic>hir</italic>), which is sensitive to deformation by gravity. <italic>hir</italic> embryos display a markedly flattened body caused by mutation of YAP, a nuclear executor of Hippo-signaling that regulates cell proliferation. We show that actomyosin-mediated tissue tension is reduced in <italic>hir</italic> embryos, leading to tissue flattening and misalignment, both of which contribute to body flattening. By analyzing YAP function in 3D-spheroids of human cells, we identify the RhoGAP ARHGAP18 as an effector of YAP in controlling tissue tension. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of YAP in regulating tissue shape and alignment required for proper 3D body shape. Understanding this morphogenetic function of YAP could facilitate the use of embryonic stem cells to generate complex organs requiring correct alignment of multiple tissues.</p>
    <p id="P3">Via exhaustive mutant screening in medaka and zebrafish<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, we identified medaka <italic>hir</italic> mutants displaying pronounced body flattening around stage (st.) 25-28 (50-64 hours post fertilization, hpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Although general development was not delayed, <italic>hir</italic> mutants exhibited delayed blastopore closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>) and progressive body collapse from mid-neurulation (st.20, 31 hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), surviving until just before hatching (6 days post-fertilization, dpf). During body collapse, tissues and organs including neural tube and somites gradually became flattened and improperly aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Lenses were misaligned outside the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a2, 2'</xref>). Mutant lens placodes expressing <italic>sox3</italic> normally formed adjacent to the retina up to st.20, but then became fragmented and detached from the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e1â, 2â</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig.1a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">2</xref>). These fragments gradually rounded up with some re-attaching to the retina to form ectopic lenses that were not incorporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Thus, tissue flattening and misalignment defects are associated with the flattened mutant phenotype.</p>
    <p id="P4">Positional cloning identified a mutation of <sup>164</sup>Leu (TTG to TAG) in the WW1 domain of YAP in <italic>hir</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c, d</xref>). YAP is the nuclear executor of the Hippo pathway and regulates organ growth via stimulation of cell proliferation<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In wild type (WT) embryos, YAP transcripts are ubiquitous throughout normal development<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Medaka maternal <italic>YAP</italic> mRNA was present at st.10 in <italic>hir</italic> before onset of zygotic gene expression but undetectable after st.18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Morpholino (MO) YAP knock-down (KD) in WT embryos recapitulated the <italic>hir</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1, 2</xref>), and ubiquitous recombinant YAP mRNA expression rescued the <italic>hir</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). In addition, perturbation of maternal <italic>YAP</italic> mRNA translation in <italic>hir</italic> mutant embryos by YAP translation-blocking (TB) MO (mYAP KD <italic>hir</italic> embryos) elicited a more severe blastopore closure and body flattening phenotype than in <italic>hir</italic> zygotic YAP mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b3, 3â, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Blastopore closure defects, but not flattening, have been reported in YAP KD zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Since TAZ is a functional paralog of YAP<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, we evaluated its contribution to the YAP KD phenotype in zebrafish. YAP;TAZ double KD zebrafish embryos exhibited more pronounced blastopore closure defects than YAP KD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d-h</xref>). YAP-4SA, which lacks four serines and predominantly localizes to the nucleus<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, rescued the <italic>hir</italic> phenotype more efficiently than WT YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>hir</italic> phenotype depends on nuclear YAP. The main nuclear function of YAP is to promote proliferation and inhibit cell death<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. <italic>hir</italic> embryos had increased cell death from st.22 to 26 after body flattening had initiated (increased cell death <italic>per se</italic> does not lead to body flattening<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>). Cell proliferation remained close to normal in <italic>hir</italic> embryos but was strongly suppressed in TAZ KD (and YAP/TAZ double KD) medaka embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2i, j</xref>). Thus, in medaka, cell proliferation is mainly regulated by TAZ, while YAP is predominantly required for 3D body shape.</p>
    <p id="P5">3 dpf <italic>hir</italic> mutants showed different orientations of body flattening. We therefore examined whether collapse correlated with the direction of gravity. Mutant embryos maintained either right-side or left-side down relative to the earth collapsed towards the earth as indicated by the ventricle tangent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Average collapse angle, <bold>Î¸</bold>, in mutant embryos was 17.3Â±10.7Â° (<italic>n</italic>=14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) compared to 5.6Â±3.3Â° (<italic>n</italic>=26, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.01) in WT. Mutant embryos maintained dorsal side down exhibited apparently uniform dorso-ventral compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a2, 2'</xref>). Thus, flattening in <italic>hir</italic> embryos reflects an inability to withstand external forces (i.e. gravity), suggesting reduced tissue tension.</p>

During WT organogenesis, global levels of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (pMRLC), indicative of actomyosin activity, increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), whilst in <italic>hir</italic> mutants they began decreasing as the blastopore closes (st.17, 25 hpf), and continued decreasing coinciding with tissue collapse and body flattening. To assess tissue tension during blastopore closure, we analyzed a surface epithelial cell layer, the enveloping layer (EVL)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a1</xref>). Comparison of EVL shape anisotropy between WT and <italic>hir</italic> embryos suggested that tissue tension in <italic>hir</italic> is reduced within the EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a, b</xref>). We also quantified actomyosin network tension within the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) of zebrafish embryos with compromised YAP function expressing EGFP myosin light chain protein, Tg(<italic>actb1:myl12.1-eGFP</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The YSL actomyosin network close to the EVL margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, AR) was cut along a 20 Î¼m-long line perpendicular to the margin to reveal circumferential tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Recoil velocities were significantly reduced in YAP;TAZ KD (n=50) compared to control KD embryos (n=40; 11.2Â±0.8 Î¼m/min <italic>vs</italic> 23.8Â±2.3 Î¼m/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f-h</xref>), suggesting reduced actomyosin network tension. Consistent with this, epiboly movements in YAP;TAZ double KD zebrafish embryos were significantly reduced (KD embryos: 53.63Â±3.93%; control embryos: 70.0Â±2.18% deep cell epiboly). To test whether reduced actomyosin network tension is also responsible for neural tube tissue flattening in <italic>hir</italic>, we performed micropipette aspiration experiments<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. <italic>hir</italic> neural explants were significantly less resistant to external forces applied by aspiration than WT, indicating reduced neural tube tissue tension. The higher deformability of <italic>hir</italic> neural tube tissue was paralleled when myosin activity was reduced by ROCK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i-k</xref>). Together, these analyses indicate that YAP is required for actomyosin-mediated tissue tension in medaka and zebrafish.</p>
    <p id="P7">Single cell tracking analysis of the growing neural tube in <italic>hir</italic> showed that tissue flattening was associated with failure to stack cells and increase in cells slipping to one side after perpendicular cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">5</xref>).

The formation of lens-retina filopodia requires fibronectin (FN)-integrin signaling and contractile actomyosin<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. While st.22 WT embryos had elongated thin FN fibrils between invaginating lens and retina, <italic>hir</italic> retina showed punctate FN patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b1â, 2â</xref>), suggesting defective FN fibril formation. In addition, large ectopic FN deposits were found on the retina in <italic>hir</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b2â</xref>). Similar loss of normal FN fibrils and large FN deposits were observed throughout <italic>hir</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b4â, 3b5â</xref>). Furthermore, integrin Î²1 accumulation between lens and retina was lost in <italic>hir</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). In contrast, cell-cell adhesion and apical markers, including pan-cadherin, atypical PKC (aPKC) and ZO-1, were unaltered in <italic>hir</italic> (data not shown). Mosaic expression of YAP in <italic>hir</italic> and transplantation experiments both showed that the <italic>hir</italic> mutation acts in a non-cell autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). For instance, in invaginated <italic>hir</italic> lens rescued by mosaic expression of YAP, non-YAP expressing <italic>hir</italic> cells recovered filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">6b</xref>). These data suggest that YAP functions in tissue alignment by regulating FN assembly.</p>
    <p id="P8">To identify downstream YAP effectors regulating tissue tension, we used a human 3D spheroid <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system employing the human retina pigmented epithelial cell line hTERT-RPE1 (RPE1), which displayed a relatively mild proliferation defect upon YAP KD. YAP KD spheroids collapsed upon exposure to external forces by slow centrifugation, unlike normal spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). pMRLC levels were reduced in YAP KD spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), as in <italic>hir</italic>, suggesting that YAP maintains tissue tension also in human 3D tissues. YAP KD spheroids also lacked the typical beehive-like pattern of FN fibrils and, instead, contained large FN deposits, reminiscent of the <italic>hir</italic> retina phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Cortical actomyosin contraction is required for polymerizing FN monomers to form fibrils<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Consistently, FN fibril formation on the basal surface of control spheroids coincided with cortical F-actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In contrast, loss of normal FN fibrils in YAP KD spheroids was associated with marked reduction of cortical F-actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d and f</xref>). Instead, we observed F-actin aggregates, some of which were associated with large FN deposits suggesting that they have increased local tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). A similar distribution of F-actin and FN was observed in <italic>hir</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). Gene expression profiling of YAP KD spheroids identified only forty genes with reduced expression (see Methods), including <italic>ARHGAP18</italic>, encoding a RhoGAP that suppresses F-actin polymerization by inhibiting Rho<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. <italic>ARHGAP18</italic> transcripts and protein levels were reduced in YAP KD spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), and ARHGAP18 KD spheroids exhibited a similar phenotype to YAP KD spheroids, including reduced pMRLC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), and aberrant F-actin and FN assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This suggests that both disruption of cortical F-actin bundles and ectopic F-actin aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) arise from F-actin over-polymerization in YAP KD spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>) and ARHGAP18 KD cells. Together, these results suggest that ARHGAP18 acts downstream of YAP and is required for cortical actomyosin network formation and tissue tension.</p>
    <p id="P9">To analyze the contribution of actomyosin tension-mediated FN assembly defects to the <italic>hir</italic> eye phenotype, we blocked FN assembly to a similar extent to that in <italic>hir</italic> by overexpressing 70kDa N-terminal FN1a and 1b fragments in WT embryos<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b3â, 3â</xref>); this caused near dislocation of the lens and fewer filopodia between lens and retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b3</xref>). <italic>hir</italic> mutants had fewer filopodia than FN assembly blocked embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>), suggesting that contractile actomyosin defects in <italic>hir</italic> exacerbate the incomplete lens dislocation caused by FN assembly defects. In contrast, FN assembly blocked embryos did not exhibit flattened tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b1-3</xref>). Furthermore, the medaka FN1 mutant <italic>fukuwarai</italic> (<italic>fku</italic>) also exhibited lens mislocation but not tissue flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>), suggesting that FN is specifically required for tissue alignment, but not generally for YAP-dependent tissue shape. ARHGAP18 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in <italic>hir</italic>, and mRNA injection of plasma membrane-targeted myristoylated ARHGAP18 (<italic>myrARHGAP18</italic>) into <italic>hir</italic> substantially rescued FN assembly defects, lens invagination and body flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a, b</xref>). In contrast, inactivation of ARHGAP18 alone was insufficient to produce a recognizable phenotype (data not shown), suggesting that multiple ARHGAP18 related genes function downstream of YAP. Consistently, siRNA knock-down screening in human cells identified five ARHGAP genes with similar functions to ARHGAP18, homologs of which are conserved in medaka and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9c, d</xref>). These results suggest that ARHGAP18-related genes function as effectors of YAP essential for both tissue shape and FN-dependent tissue alignment. The <italic>hir</italic> phenotype is not simply due to reduced myosin contraction, because injecting mRNA of an activated form of MRLC-DD<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> did not rescue the <italic>hir</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a6, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">8d</xref>). Similarly, injection of dominant negative MRLC-AA<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> in WT embryos failed to fully phenocopy the <italic>hir</italic> tissue or body flattening phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figs. 3a5, b</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that YAP function in 3D tissue shape and FN assembly is conserved in human cells and is at least partly mediated by ARHGAP18-related genes.</p>
    <p id="P10">We propose that YAP is essential for tissue tension, acting through ARHGAP18 and related genes to regulate cortical actomyosin network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). YAP-dependent actomyosin network tension is required for both proper tissue shape and alignment to ensure organ/body shape. Several upstream regulators of YAP-mediated cell proliferation have been identified, including cellular environment stiffness, suggesting YAP can function as a mechanosensor<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Our data show that YAP also functions as a mechanoregulator of tissue tension. Reduced cortical actomyosin tension is the most probable cause of attenuated tissue tension in <italic>hir</italic> mutants. F-actin over-polymerization perturbs F-actin turnover required for actomyosin contraction in the cytokinetic ring<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Our finding that ARHGAP18, a suppressor of F-actin polymerization, functions downstream of YAP further supports a critical role of F-actin polymerization in contractile actomyosin network formation. YAP is required for basal-level actomyosin activity, consistent with ubiquitous expression of actin modulator ARHGAP18<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, additional to which spatiotemporal modulation of actomyosin activity defines tissue shape. Since ARHGAP18 suppresses actin polymerization, which in turn reduces nuclear localization of YAP<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, ARHGAP18 might suppress YAP activity via a negative feedback mechanism. This points to a possible mechanical feedback loop where tissue tension controls YAP, and YAP in turn is required for tissue tension.</p>
    <p id="P11">Actomyosin contraction promotes FN assembly<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. The tissue misalignment phenotype in <italic>hir</italic> is most likely due to failure of YAP-dependent actomyosin contractility in controlling FN assembly. Since FN initiates ECM organization<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, actomyosin contraction-mediated FN assembly could be a critical <italic>in vivo</italic> mechanism that integrates mechanical signals (e.g. tension generated by actomyosin) with biochemical signals (e.g. integrin signaling). Notably, the phenotype of YAP KO mouse embryos resembles that of FN KO mouse embryos<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, suggesting that YAP and FN have similar functions in mouse development. Interestingly, while YAP in medaka is predominantly required for tissue tension, its paralog TAZ appears to be required for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Given the high degree of conservation of YAP and other Hippo pathway components across metazoa<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, it will be worth investigating whether the extent of tissue three-dimensionality and alignment correlate with the emergence of YAP-mediated resistance to gravity at the evolutionary transition from uni- to multi-cellular organisms. Generation of 3D eye cups from iPS/ES cells depends on tissue self-organization involving mechanical processes of which the mechanism remains elusive<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>; since YAP-dependent force-mediated morphogenesis could be involved in tissue self-organization, our findings could help in making more complex organs.</p>

Aspiration was imaged at 500 msec intervals by a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope using a Leica 20X, 0.7 NA objective. Temperature in the dish was kept constant at 28Â°C by a heated sample holder. Measuring the tongue length of the tissue within the micropipette using FIJI software over time yielded the characteristic tissue flow curves during aspiration for WT and <italic>hir</italic> mutant neural tube explants. To reduce cortical tension WT neural tube explants were treated with ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (250 Î¼M dissolved in water) for 15 minutes before performing the micropipette aspiration experiment.</p>

        <p id="P26">For the Oligo DNA microarray analysis, total RNA samples were collected from hTERT-RPE1 multicellular spheroids. 3D-Gene Human Oligo chip 25k (TORAY) was used. Total RNA of YAP siRNA-transfected spheroids and that of negative control siRNA were labeled with Cy3- or Cy5- using the Amino Allyl MessageAMP II aRNA Amplification Kit (Life Technologies), respectively. The Cy3- or Cy5-labeled aRNA pools and hybridization buffer were mixed, and hybridized for 16 h at 37Â°C. The hybridization was performed using the supplier's protocols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.3d-gene.com">www.3d-gene.com</ext-link>). Hybridization signals were scanned using a 3D-Gene Scanner 3000 (TORAY). Detected signals for each gene were normalized by a global normalization method (Cy3/Cy5 ratio median = 1). Genes with Cy3/Cy5 normalized ratios greater than 2.0 or less than 0.5 were defined, respectively, as commonly up- or down-regulated genes. The results were deposited at GEO under the accession number GSE54146.</p>

Arrowheads indicate cortical F-actin and FN fibrils in WT and corresponding region in <italic>hir</italic> (3, 4, 3â, 4â); arrows show ectopic F-actin aggregates and aberrant FN fibrils in (3â, 4â). <bold>b</bold>, Immunostaining of 2D cultured RPE1 cells transfected with control (Cont, n=21) and YAP siRNAs (n=19) stained with Phalloidin (1, 1â), Î²-catenin (2, 2â) and merged with DAPI (3, 3â); Phalloidin (4, 4â), FN (5, 5â) and merged with DAPI (6, 6â). In marked contrast to the 3D spheroids, FN deposits were not altered in YAP KD cells (5, 5â) despite of increased F-actin stress fibers (1, 1â and 4, 4â). <bold>c</bold>, The medaka <italic>fku</italic> mutants exhibit lens mislocation (arrows). Live dorsal view of the head of (1) WT, (2) <italic>fku</italic> and (3) <italic>hir</italic> mutant embryos at st.24. (4) The <italic>fku</italic> mutation was mapped to LG21 to the region encompassing the FN1 gene (0 recombinants/1130 meiosis). Positional cloning identified a non-sense mutation of <sup>593</sup>Glu (GAA to TAA) in FN1 (2503 amino acids). FN1 morpholino KD in WT embryos mimicked the <italic>fku</italic> mutant phenotype. <bold>d</bold>, Constitutive-active MRLC-DD mRNA markedly increased body thickness of WT embryos, but did not rescue the flattened body (brackets in lower panels) and dislocated lens phenotypes of <italic>hir</italic> (n=48). Upper panels, live lateral view (insets, dorsal views of left eyes); lower panels, frontal sections stained with Phalloidin (red) and TO-PRO-3 (blue) at st.25.
