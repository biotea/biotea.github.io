        <p>The mRNA export complex TREX (TREX) is known to contain Aly, UAP56, Tex1 and the THO complex, among which UAP56 is required for TREX assembly. Here, we systematically investigated the role of each human TREX component in TREX assembly and its association with the mRNA. We found that Tex1 is essentially a subunit of the THO complex. Aly, THO and UAP56 are all required for assembly of TREX, in which Aly directly interacts with THO subunits Thoc2 and Thoc5. Both Aly and THO function in linking UAP56 to the cap-binding protein CBP80. Interestingly, association of UAP56 with the spliced mRNA, but not with the pre-mRNA, requires Aly and THO. Unexpectedly, we found that Aly and THO require each other to associate with the spliced mRNA. Consistent with these biochemical results, similar to Aly and UAP56, THO plays critical roles in mRNA export. Together, we propose that Aly, THO and UAP56 form a highly integrated unit to associate with the spliced mRNA and function in mRNA export.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The highly conserved TREX complex (TREX) plays key roles in mRNA export. The human TREX contains the multi-subunit THO complex (THO) as well as proteins UAP56, Aly and Tex1 (known as THO, Sub2, Yra1 and Tex1, respectively, in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B1 gks1188-B2 gks1188-B3">1â3</xref>). In recent studies, DDX39 and CIP29 were also reported to be putative new human TREX components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>). The yeast THO complex contains Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1 and Thp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B6">6</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human THO complexes contain homologs of yeast Tho2 and Hpr1 (Thoc2 and Thoc1), as well as Thoc5, Thoc6 and Thoc7 that do not have apparent counterparts in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B7">7</xref>). THO subunits tightly bind with one another. In humans, Thoc2 immunodepletion led to co-depletion of the whole THO complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>). Moreover, in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, THO proteins require one another for maintaining their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B8">8</xref>). Although Tex1 is known to be an independent TREX component parallel to THO, Aly and UAP56, in both yeast and humans, stable association of Tex1 with THO has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B3">3</xref>). In yeast, a most recent study revealed that Tex1 is co-purified with THO even in 500 mM salt condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B9">9</xref>). In humans, Tex1 is always present in stoichiometric amount with other THO subunits in immunoprecipitates by THO antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies in humans showed that UAP56, which is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, binds directly with Aly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B10 gks1188-B11 gks1188-B12">10â12</xref>). More recent studies revealed that UAP56 interacts with Aly in an ATP-dependent manner, and the ATPase activity of UAP56 is stimulated by Aly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B13">13</xref>). These studies suggest that Aly might play a regulatory role in TREX formation. Moreover, UAP56 was shown to be required for the interaction between Aly and THO, leading to the view that UAP56 is the core component of TREX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>). Consistent with this view, Aly and THO associate with different regions of UAP56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>). However, it remains to be investigated whether Aly and THO function in TREX assembly.</p><p>Despite the high conservation in constitution and function of TREX, recent studies revealed that it is linked to different machineries in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B14">14</xref>). The yeast THO associates with transcription machinery and consequently recruits and transfers Yra1 and Sub2 to nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B15 gks1188-B16 gks1188-B17 gks1188-B18 gks1188-B19">15â19</xref>). A more recent study reported an alternative model for TREX recruitment in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B20">20</xref>). In this model, Yra1 is recruited by Pcf11, which is a component of CF1A complex, and is transferred to Sub2 and THO already associated with the mRNA. In both models, the yeast TREX is thought to be recruited in a stepwise way co-transcriptionally. In humans, the entire TREX is connected to the splicing machinery and is recruited to mRNA in a splicing-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B22">22</xref>). In addition to splicing, our previous study revealed that the 5â²-cap is required for TREX recruitment and mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). The cap-binding protein CBP80 associates with TREX and this association was thought to be mediated by the interaction between Aly and CBP80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Aly is required for efficient recruitment of TREX to the spliced mRNA. However, this possibility has not been investigated and the role of THO in recruitment of TREX remains to be determined.</p><p>In this study, we sought to investigate how each human TREX component functions in assembly of the complex and in association of TREX with the mRNA. We found that Tex1, a previously reported independent TREX component, is essentially a subunit of the THO sub-complex. Significantly, similar to UAP56, Aly and THO are also critical for TREX assembly. Moreover, both Aly and THO function in linking TREX to nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) and are required for binding of TREX components with the spliced mRNA. Consistent with these roles of THO, we found that THO is required for the export of total mRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Plasmids encoding AdML and Ftz pre-mRNA, GST-Aly, His-UAP56, GST-AlyÎC, GST-UAP56 and GST-eIF4A3 were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B24 gks1188-B25 gks1188-B26">24â26</xref>). Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged Aly, UAP56, Tex1, Thoc6 and Thoc7 plasmids were constructed by inserting the corresponding coding sequence into pMAL-c2X plasmid. To construct His-Aly and His-AlyÎC plasmids, NcoIâBamHI fragment from GST-Aly and BamHIâSacI fragment from GST-AlyÎC were inserted into the same sites of pET 9d and pRSET A plasmids, respectively. The rabbit polyclonal Tex1 antibody was raised against MBP-Tex1 and affinity purified. Aly, UAP56, Thoc7 and Thoc2 antibodies were raised against full-length GST-Aly, GST-UAP56, MBP-Thoc7 and C-terminal part of Thoc2, respectively. Antibodies to Thoc5, CBP80 and eIF4A3 were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). The negative control antibody used for immunoprecipitations (IPs) is against fSAP130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B27">27</xref>). Tubulin and SC35 antibodies were purchased from Sigma.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and RNAi</title><p>HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom). For shRNA-mediated knockdown, pLKO.1 plasmid inserted with DNA oligonucleotide that encodes shRNA was introduced into 293 FT cells together with packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD 2.G. After 48 h, the medium containing lentiviruses was filtered and added to HeLa cells. Two microgram per milliliter of puromycin (Sigma) was added to the medium after 24 h. Cells were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), western and reverse transcriptaseâpolymerase chain reaction (RTâPCR) analyses after another 72 h. The shRNAs targeting sequences are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel filtration</title><p>Gel filtration was performed on a 1.5-cm/50-cm Sephacryl S-500 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The gel filtration buffer contains 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM KCl, 2.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1% Triton and 0.01% sodium azide. 250 Î¼l of HeLa nuclear extract was mixed with the same volume of splicing dilution buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6 and 100 mM KCl) and loaded onto the column. Samples were separated at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min and each 1 ml fraction was collected and analyzed by western analyses. The column was calibrated with Gel Filtration Calibration Kit HMW (GE healthcare). The void volume was 23 ml.</p></sec><sec><title>FISH and immunofluorescence</title><p>FISH was preformed as previously described using a high performance liquid chromatography-purified Alexa 548-conjugated oligo dT (70) probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>). Immunofluorescence was performed by incubating fixed cells with the SC35 antibody 1:200 diluted in blocking buffer (1Ã phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Triton and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at the room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS for 5 min each and incubated with the Alexa-488-labeled anti-mouse antibody 1:2000 diluted in blocking buffer for another 30 min at the room temperature, followed by DAPI staining and three washes in PBS for 10 min each.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunodepletions and protein IPs</title><p>For immunodepletions, antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4:1 ratio (crude serum volume:packed beads volume) using dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma). One milliliter of high salt HeLa nuclear extract (350 mM) was mixed with 250 Î¼l of beads and rotated for 1.5 h at 4Â°C. The procedure was repeated for three times to deplete Aly and THO, and for seven times to deplete UAP56. For protein IPs, antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein A beads at 1:2 ratio (crude serum volume:packed beads volume). Seventy-five microliter of HeLa nuclear extract was incubated under splicing condition for 20 min in the presence of 50 ng/Âµl RNase A. The mixture was combined with 125 Âµl of IP buffer (1Ã PBS, 0.1% Triton, 0.2 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor) and 20 Âµl of beads cross-linked with antibodies. The mixtures were rotated overnight at 4Â°C, followed by six washes with 1.5 ml of IP buffer. Proteins were eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer and separated by SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA IPs</title><p>RNA IPs were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). Pre-mRNAs were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract for indicated times under splicing condition. Five microliters of splicing reaction and 100 Âµl of binding buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.9, 200 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton, 2.5 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT) were mixed with 10 Âµl of protein A Sepharose beads coupled with 5 Âµl of antibodies. IPs were performed at 4Â°C for 2 h, followed by six washes with 1.5 ml of binding buffer. RNAs were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA was analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by PhosphorImager. One-fourth of the input was loaded.</p></sec><sec><title>GST and MBP Pull downs</title><p>For each pull down, 8 Âµg of purified GST- or MBP-tagged proteins bound to 20 Âµl of Glutathione Sepharose 4B or Amylose resins were used. For pull downs from insect cell lysates, High Five cell lysate containing overexpressed THO proteins were mixed together with protein-bound beads in pull down buffer (1Ã PBS with 0.1% Triton, 0.2 mM PMSF, 50 ng/Âµl RNase A and protease inhibitor). The mixtures were rotated overnight at 4Â°C and beads were washed for five times. Proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer, separated by SDSâPAGE, followed by western analyses. GST pull down for <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated proteins was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). To pull down purified Thoc6, Thoc7 or Tex1, 8 Âµg of proteins were mixed with 20 Âµl of protein-bound beads in 1Ã PBS with 0.1% Triton, 0.2 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor. The mixtures were rotated overnight at 4Â°C and beads were washed with 1Ã PBS/0.1% Triton for five times and eluted with SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDSâPAGE and stained with Coomassie blue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Tex1 is a subunit of the THO complex</title><p>Tex1 is known to be a TREX component independent of Aly, THO and UAP56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>). To study the interactions between Tex1 and other TREX components, we raised an antibody to Tex1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F1">Figure 1</xref>A, this antibody detected a band of the appropriate size for Tex1 (39 kDa) in HeLa nuclear extract. We then examined whether Tex1 is immunoprecipitated (IPâd) from RNased HeLa nuclear extract by Aly, THO and UAP56 antibodies in normal and high salt conditions. In normal salt condition, as previously reported, Aly, UAP56 and Thoc2 were co-IPâd with one another, and Tex1 was also co-IPâd with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F1">Figure 1</xref>B, 90 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>). In contrast, in high salt condition, only Tex1âThoc2 interaction remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F1">Figure 1</xref>B, 350 mM). The control antibody to eIF4A3, which is a component of the exonâjunction complex, did not IP any TREX protein under either salt condition. These results indicate that Tex1 tightly associates with THO. Consistent with these results, when the nuclear extract was size fractionated by gel filtration under high salt condition (500 mM), Tex1 was present in the same fractions as THO subunits that peaked in fractions (52 and 55) containing larger complexes. In contrast, Aly, UAP56 as well as CBP80 were eluted later from the gel filtration column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F1">Figure 1</xref>C). We next examined whether Tex1 is co-immunodepleted with THO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F1">Figure 1</xref>D, in the control ÎAly extract, Aly was absent without reducing the levels of other TREX proteins. In contrast, in ÎTHO extract, which was prepared with the Thoc2 antibody, neither THO proteins nor Tex1 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F1">Figure 1</xref>D). These results demonstrate that Tex1 is co-depleted with THO. Together, these data indicate that Tex1 forms a salt-stable complex with THO in nuclear extract and raise the possibility that Tex1 might be a subunit of THO.

However, it remains unclear whether Aly directly interacts with other THO proteins and whether UAP56 makes direct contact with THO. To investigate these questions, we systematically examined whether Aly and UAP56 pull down each THO protein. As Thoc1, Thoc2 and Thoc5 were difficult to express using prokaryotic expression system in our hands, these proteins were expressed in insect cells. However, only Thoc2 and Thoc5 were soluble. When insect cell lysate containing overexpressed Thoc2 was used for pull down, MBP-Aly, but not equal amount of MBP-tagged UAP56 or the control protein, pulled down Thoc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Insect cell-expressed Thoc5 was not pulled down by GST-UAP56, whereas it was pulled down by GST-Aly as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F3">Figure 3</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B28">28</xref>). The presence of UAP56, but not the control protein, in the pull down reaction reproducibly slightly inhibited the AlyâThoc5 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F3">Figure 3</xref>B, left panel). One possible explanation of this inhibition is that UAP56 and Thoc5 share multiple binding sites on Aly. Consistent with this possibility, GST-UAP56 efficiently pulled down Thoc5 when Aly was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F3">Figure 3</xref>B, right panel). Together, these results indicate that Aly directly interacts with Thoc2 and Thoc5. It was also possible that these interactions we observed were results of chimeric THO complexes formed by human and insect proteins. To investigate this possibility, we used insect cell lysates containing overexpressed Tex1 (shown in below not to interact with Aly directly) as a control. Significantly, GST-Aly pulled down Thoc5, but not Tex1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>).

The finding that Aly, but not UAP56, directly interacts with CBC led to the view that Aly is the TREX component linking TREX to CBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). However, it remains to be investigated whether Aly is the sole TREX component mediating TREXâCBC interaction. To investigate this, we performed IPs with TREX antibodies from RNased ÎAly, ÎTHO, ÎUAP56 and Mock extracts, followed by western analysis with the CBP80 antibody. As expected, CBP80 was present in the immunoprecipitates of CBP80, UAP56, Aly and Thoc2 antibodies in Mock extract, and UAP56 depletion did not affect the amount of CBP80 IPâd by Aly and Thoc2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F4">Figure 4</xref>A, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B23">23</xref>). In contrast, in ÎAly extract, CBP80 was not IPâd by the UAP56 antibody, and the amount of CBP80 IPâd by the Thoc2 antibody was reduced to â¼75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F4">Figure 4</xref>A, middle panel and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).

These results indicate that UAP56 requires Aly for interacting with CBP80, whereas THO can interact with CBP80 independent of Aly. In ÎTHO extract, CBP80 was not co-IPâd with UAP56, whereas the amount of that co-IPâd with Aly was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F4">Figure 4</xref>A, right panel), indicating that THO is required for UAP56, but not for Aly, to interact with CBP80. These results are consistent with our data that Aly and THO depletions impaired the stable association of UAP56 with THO and Aly, respectively, as otherwise these associations would link UAP56 to CBC. Together, we conclude that both Aly and THO function in mediating TREXâCBC interaction (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F4">Figure 4</xref>B).

To test this possibility, we examined the effects of Aly and THO immunodepletions on association of UAP56 with the mRNA. First, we spliced AdML pre-mRNA in Mock and ÎAly extracts and used the spliced mRNA for IPs with antibodies to TREX components. eIF4A3 antibody was used as a control. In Mock extract, AdML spliced mRNA was efficiently IPâd by antibodies to eIF4A3, Aly, Thoc2 and UAP56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 1â6). In striking contrast, in ÎAly and ÎTHO extracts, although AdML mRNA was efficiently IPâd by the eIF4A3 antibody, the amount of that associated with UAP56 significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D, lanes 6 and 12).

These results indicate that both Aly and THO play key roles in stable binding of TREX components with AdML spliced mRNA. To investigate whether these roles of Aly and THO are general, we used Ftz pre-mRNA for the same experiment and obtained similar results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). We also sought to determine whether UAP56 is involved in association of TREX components with the spliced mRNA. However, to deplete UAP56, we had to carry out many rounds of depletion that destroyed the splicing activity of both Mock and ÎUAP56 extracts (Wang,Q. and Cheng,H., unpublished data).

However, it is not clear whether UAP56 associates with pre-mRNAs and whether this association requires Aly and THO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>). To investigate this, we performed mRNA IPs along a splicing time course. <italic>In vitro</italic>-transcribed Ftz pre-mRNA was spliced for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, followed by IPs with antibodies to UAP56, Aly and Thoc5. As controls, antibodies to U2AF35 and an irrelevant protein were also used for IPs. Ftz spliced mRNA started to accumulate at 60 min and at 120 min most pre-mRNA has been spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The U2AF35 antibody IPâd the pre-mRNA at 30 min, and IPâd both pre-mRNA and spliced mRNA at later time points with similar efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 5â8).

In contrast, UAP56 associated with the pre-mRNA at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 13).

This increase is consistent with our observation that UAP56 associates with spliced mRNA more efficiently than with pre-mRNA.

Our finding that THO is required for stable binding of Aly and UAP56 with spliced mRNAs raises the possibility that THO plays key roles in general mRNA export pathway. To investigate this possibility, we knocked down all THO subunits and examined the effects on the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA. Significantly, Thoc2, Thoc1 and Thoc7 knockdown led to severe polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA export block, whereas Thoc5, Thoc6 and Tex1 knockdown only had mild effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F6">Figure 6</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). We next investigated whether these various effects resulted from different knockdown and co-knockdown efficiencies of THO subunits. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F6">Figure 6</xref>B, all THO subunits were efficiently knocked down by the corresponding shRNA. Significantly, Thoc2, Thoc1 and Thoc7 knockdowns, which resulted in severe export block, all led to significant decrease in levels of Thoc2, Thoc7 and Tex1, suggesting that one of these THO proteins might be the determinant factor for mRNA export function of THO. The fact that Tex1 knockdown barely affects mRNA export excludes the Tex1 possibility. Similarly, the possibility for Thoc7 was ruled out by the data showing that although Thoc5 knockdown led to apparent co-knockdown of Thoc7, it only had mild effect on mRNA export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Thus, these results suggest Thoc2 might be the determinant factor for THO functioning in mRNA export.

Consistent with these roles of THO, it is required for efficient export of both polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA and spliced reporter mRNA.</p><sec><title>Models for TREX recruitment</title><p>Two possible models for recruitment of the human TREX are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F7">Figure 7</xref>. Pre-mRNA is capped at the 5â²-end and associates with the nuclear CBC, which is not available for binding with Aly and THO on pre-mRNAs. During an early stage of splicing, UAP56 is recruited to pre-mRNAs and functions in splicing. During a late step of splicing, some changes occur to CBC and it now can interact with Aly and THO. In one model, upon completion of splicing, UAP56 might be released from the mRNA and subsequently Aly, THO and UAP56 are recruited to the spliced mRNA as a pre-formed particle. In an alternative model, UAP56 associating with the pre-mRNA might be transferred to the spliced mRNA and interacts with Aly and THO recruited by CBC. Aly, THO and UAP56 stabilize one another on the spliced mRNA.
<fig id="gks1188-F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Models for TREX recruitment. In model (I), UAP56 recruited to the pre-mRNA is released upon completion of splicing. Subsequently, Aly, UAP56 and THO are recruited to the spliced mRNA as a preformed particle. In model (II), UAP56 recruited to the pre-mRNA is transferred to the spliced mRNA, where it forms TREX together with Aly and THO recruited by CBC. See âDiscussionâ section for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks1188f7p"/></fig></p><p>In a previous study, all eight TREX components were found to be present in the same fraction in gel filtration of TREX pulled down from RNased nuclear extract, indicating that TREX exists as a preformed particle in the nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B2">2</xref>). Our data indicating that Aly, UAP56 and THO associate with one another in an interdependent manner further support that TREX is a highly integrated particle in the nuclear extract. Based on these data, it is puzzling how UAP56 associates with the pre-mRNA independent of other TREX components. One possibility is that UAP56 associated with the pre-mRNA is distinct from that binding with the spliced mRNA. Our data showing that even in low salt condition (60 mM), only a small portion of UAP56 co-migrates with THO indicates that in the nuclear extract, most UAP56 exists free from TREX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>). It is possible that this TREX-free UAP56 is recruited to the pre-mRNA and functions in splicing. These are consistent with the former model. However, other possibilities remain. For example, it is known that UAP56 associates with many splicing factors including U2AF65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B25">25</xref>). It is possible that on the pre-mRNA, these splicing factors interact with UAP56 and exclude Aly for binding. Upon completion of splicing, these factors are released and UAP56 is transferred to the spliced mRNA where its binding site for Aly is exposed. Thus, recruitment of UAP56 to the pre-mRNA is a prerequisite for its association with the spliced mRNA. This possibility is consistent with the latter model that explains the splicing-dependent TREX recruitment. Nevertheless, in both models, Aly, UAP56 and THO associate with the spliced mRNA as a highly integrated particle and play critical roles in mRNA export as a functional unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Formation of the TREX complex</title><p>In a recent study, UAP56 has been proposed to be the core component of TREX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>). Here, we found that Aly is required for the interaction between UAP56 and THO, and conversely THO is also needed for stable AlyâUAP56 interaction. These results together indicate that interactions between Aly, UAP56 and THO are interdependent. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> pull down data show that Aly, but not UAP56, directly interacts with Thoc2 and Thoc5. This bypassed requirement of UAP56 for AlyâThoc2/Thoc5 interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> might result from mixing excess amount of recombinant proteins together. In agreement with this possibility, although stable AlyâUAP56 interaction in the nuclear extract requires THO, when excess amount of Aly and UAP56 are mixed together, they strongly interact with each other independent of THO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1188-F3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B11">11</xref>). Based on our data and previous reports, Aly seems to exist in the center of TREX interacting directly with both UAP56 and THO. The mechanism underlying TREX assembly remains to be determined. One possibility is that some conformational changes might occur to each component when they interact with one another. UAP56 is an ATP-dependent helicase, and a recent study reported that Aly interacts with UAP56 in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B12">12</xref>). It is possible that Aly and THO are both required for stimulating the helicase activity of UAP56, which in turn induces conformational changes of Aly and THO, resulting in assembly of TREX. Structural insights of Aly, THO and UAP56 individually and collectively would be required to understand the mechanism for TREX assembly. It would also be interesting to investigate how TREX components interact with one another in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>A role for THO in mRNA export</title><p>Up to date, the role of mammalian THO in mRNA export has been unclear, and different conclusions have been reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B28 gks1188-B29 gks1188-B30">28â30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B33">33</xref>). We found that knockdown of Thoc2, Thoc1 and Thoc7 had dramatic effects on mRNA export, whereas Thoc5, Thoc6 and Tex1 only had minor effects. Our data demonstrate that the extent of mRNA export blockage positively correlates with the knockdown/co-knockdown efficiency of Thoc2. Thus, it seems that Thoc2 is the determinant factor for the role of THO in mRNA export. In a previous study, the unaffected bulk mRNA export by Thoc5 knockdown was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B28">28</xref>). In the same report, it was shown that the level of Thoc1 was not affected in Thoc5 knockdown cells. This negative result might result from the relatively low knockdown efficiency of Thoc5. Consistent with this possibility, our result as well as a more recent study indicate that Thoc1 requires Thoc5 for its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B8">8</xref>). Our data indicating that Thoc2 is the determinant THO protein for its role in mRNA export are consistent with our finding that Thoc2 directly interacts with Aly. It is possible that although both Thoc2 and Thoc5 directly interact with Aly, Thoc2 might play a dominant role in mediating AlyâTHO interaction. The yeast Thoc2 was recently shown to be the THO protein making direct contact with the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B9">9</xref>). It is possible that this property of THO is conserved in humans and thus Thoc2 is critical for mRNA export. Thoc5 has been reported to be an alternative mRNA export adaptor and in a most recent study, Thoc5 together with Aly was shown to induce the conformational change of TAP required for mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B34">34</xref>). The direct interaction between Aly and Thoc5 might provide the binding scaffold for TAP.</p><p>Similar to Aly and UAP56 knockdown, in THO knockdown, the nuclear-retained polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA was also accumulated in nuclear speckle domains, indicating that THO is also involved in release of mRNA from these domains. Our biochemical results demonstrating that THO is required for stable association of Aly and UAP56 with the spliced mRNA indicate that THO functions in mRNA export by ensuring efficient association of Aly and UAP56 with the spliced mRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks1188/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figures 1â6, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks1188-B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Ministry of Science and Technology</funding-source> 973 project [<award-id>2011CB811304</award-id> and <award-id>2013CB910402</award-id>]; <funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source> [<award-id>30970583</award-id>]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [<award-id>09PJ1411300</award-id>] and <funding-source>Chinese Academy of Sciences</funding-source> [<award-id>2008OHTP03</award-id>].
