      <abstract>
        <p>Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, made up of 13 subunits encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Subunit 4 (COX4), a key regulatory subunit, exists as two isoforms, the ubiquitous isoform 1 and the tissue-specific (predominantly lung) isoform 2 (<italic>COX4I2</italic>). COX4I2 renders lung COX about 2-fold more active compared with liver COX, which lacks COX4I2. We previously identified a highly conserved 13-bp sequence in the proximal promoter of <italic>COX4I2</italic> that functions as an oxygen responsive element (ORE), maximally active at a 4% oxygen concentration. Here, we have identified three transcription factors that bind this conserved ORE, namely recombination signal sequenceâbinding protein JÎº (RBPJ), coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain 2 (CHCHD2) and CXXC finger protein 5 (CXXC5). We demonstrate that RBPJ and CHCHD2 function towards activating the ORE at 4% oxygen, whereas CXXC5 functions as an inhibitor. To validate results derived from cultured cells, we show using RNA interference a similar effect of these transcription factors in the gene regulation of <italic>COX4I2</italic> in primary pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Depending on the oxygen tension, a concerted action of the three transcription factors regulates the expression of <italic>COX4I2</italic> that, as we discuss, could augment both COX activity and its ability to cope with altered cellular energy requirements.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX, complex IV) is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain (ETC) and couples electron transfer, from cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to oxygen, to the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane during oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). COX is composed of 13 subunits, three encoded in the mitochondria and the remaining 10 in the nucleus. The largest of the nuclear encoded subunits, COX4, is known to function as an allosteric subunit, inhibiting the enzyme at high adenosine triphosphate concentrations (<xref rid="gks1454-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This property of COX4 places it in a pivotal physiological position to adjust cellular energy production to demand.</p><p>COX4 genes exist as isoform 1 (<italic>COX4I1</italic>), whose precursor protein is 169 amino acids long, and isoform 2 (<italic>COX4I2</italic>), which has 171 amino acids. <italic>COX4I1</italic> is ubiquitous in its expression, whereas <italic>COX4I2</italic> is tissue-specific and highly expressed in lung, trachea and placenta, but can also be detected at low levels in heart and brain (<xref rid="gks1454-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>We recently performed a comprehensive investigation on the role of COX4I2, and analysed the effect of <italic>Cox4i2</italic> gene knockout in mice (<xref rid="gks1454-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In lung, <italic>Cox4i2</italic> knockout reduces COX activity to 50%, despite the presence of the ubiquitously expressed subunit isoform, Cox4i1. Knockout mice show a considerable (â¼30%) reduction in lung energy levels. As a consequence, and because airway constriction (as occurs, for instance, during asthma) requires energy, knockout mice showed significantly reduced airway responsiveness. Furthermore, the knockout mice developed severe lung pathology and presented with CharcotâLeyden crystals (<xref rid="gks1454-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), which are also seen in patients with chronic lung diseases. Apparently, increased COX activity mediated through COX4I2 is essential for normal function of the lung, a tissue that has the lowest mitochondrial content compared with other tissues, such as heart, liver and brain (<xref rid="gks1454-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>At the gene level, a distinct feature of <italic>COX4I2</italic> is its responsiveness to cellular oxygen tension. Its expression is stimulated under low oxygen conditions. Our labs have previously attributed this to the presence of a 24 base pair conserved sequence in the proximal promoter of <italic>COX4I2</italic> that contains an Sp1 element plus the 13-bp sequence analyzed here and termed the oxygen responsive element (ORE) (<xref rid="gks1454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This ORE is highly conserved in <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoters among rat, mouse, cow and human. To further investigate promoter regulation of <italic>COX4I2</italic> in response to varying oxygen concentrations, we carried out a one-hybrid screen with the ORE as bait. We identified three transcription factors, two of which had not previously been associated with the ETC. These are recombination signal sequenceâbinding protein JÎº (RBPJ), CXXC5 and coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain 2 (CHCHD2).</p><p>RBPJ is a key player in the evolutionarily conserved NOTCH signaling pathway and was first isolated as a DNA binding protein from murine B-cells (<xref rid="gks1454-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). CXXC5 is a nuclear zinc-finger protein that is not well characterized. CHCHD2 was identified as one of the genes that were co-expressed with other genes of the OxPhos pathway using a computational expression screening technique (<xref rid="gks1454-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In this study, we show their binding to the ORE of the <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoter and their interaction with each other in regulating the <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoter under the influence of the oxygen concentration. Finally, we discuss these findings with respect to the role of <italic>COX4I2</italic> in the functioning and regulation of OxPhos related to clinical syndromes resulting from hypoxic [We use the term hypoxia, without pathological implication, to indicate a decrease in the availability of oxygen and normoxia, a return to ambient levels. Specifically, we refer to 4% as hypoxia and atmospheric 20â21% as normoxia. In general, 4% oxygen in cells is within normal levels or can be compensated by physiological adaptations (<xref rid="gks1454-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)] stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (293 cells) were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA); 293-RBPJ-KD and 293-CHCHD2-KD are 293 cells with a stable knockdown of RBPJ and CHCHD2, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Effector and reporter plasmids</title><p>The minimal 118-bp <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoter luciferase reporter plasmid has been described previously (<xref rid="gks1454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and harbors the conserved ORE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F2">Figure 2</xref>A). A mutant reporter plasmid used in this study has a 3-bp mutation in the conserved ORE of the <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The proteins RBPJ and CXXC5 were expressed from the pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). These expression plasmids were constructed to express a (HIS)<sub>6</sub>-tag at the C-terminus of the expressed protein. The CHCHD2 expression plasmid was cloned in the pCI-Neo vector with a C-terminal (FLAG)<sub>3</sub> epitope. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± was purchased from DNASU Plasmid Repository, Tempe, AZ, USA, clone ID: HsCD00074691. pCMX-RBPJ-VP16, from Dr T. Honjo (Kyoto University, Japan), expresses a transcriptionally active form of RBPJ (<xref rid="gks1454-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). All expression plasmids were purified using the EndoFree plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfection of 293 cells</title><p>The 293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were plated onto 12-well culture plates at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well a day before transfection. On the day of transfection, the TransFast reagent was mixed with the indicated concentrations (Âµg) of DNA at a ratio of 3:1 in serum- and antibiotic-free medium. Following incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the mixture was overlaid onto the cells. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C, and the cells were transferred to complete medium for further incubation.</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase reporter assays</title><p>Luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were lysed using 250 Âµl of 1Ã Passive Lysis Buffer per well and incubated on a shaker for 15 min. The lysate was then transferred to a tube and spun down at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was analysed for luciferase levels using an Optocomp 1 luminometer (MGM instruments, Sparks, NV, USA). Transfection efficiency was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-SV40; a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid was co-transfected with the reporter construct).</p></sec><sec><title>Normoxia and hypoxia experiments</title><p>For these experiments, cells were incubated for the indicated times under 20% oxygen (traditionally referred to as normoxia) or 4% oxygen (representing hypoxia relative to 20%). To achieve hypoxic conditions, the incubation chamber was placed at 37Â°C and infused with CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. The gas flow was controlled with a proOX110 gas controller (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY, USA) to achieve 4% oxygen and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Oxygen equilibration time (3â4 h) was accounted for in the hypoxia experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAi assays</title><p>The 293-RBPJ-KD and 293-CHCHD2-KD were generated by transfecting 293 cells with an shRNA plasmid (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by selection of antibiotic resistant clones. Luciferase levels are presented as the ratio observed in the knockdown cells compared with wild-type.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturerâs instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the ProtoScript Mu-MLV first strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). Transcript levels were measured by real time PCR using SYBR-green on an ABI7500 system. Real time analysis was performed by the ÎÎCt method. The primer sequences (5â²<bold>â</bold>3â²) used were as follows (F, forward; R, reverse). RBPJ (F-TGCATTGCCTCAGGAACAAAGGTG, R-CCACTGCTGTGAACTGGCATGAAA), CXXC5 (F-AACCCAGGCCTCTTCATTATGACC, R-TTCCTACAACTGCTGCACTGCT), CHCHD2 (F-CACACATTGGGTCACGCCATTACT, R-TTCTGGGCACACTCCAGAAACTGT) and 18SrRNA (F-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA, R-GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>Immunoblotting using equal protein concentrations was performed as described previously (<xref rid="gks1454-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Unless specified otherwise, the indicated primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000, whereas the secondary antibodies were at 1:5000. For co-immunoprecipitation, the immunoprecipitating antibody was complexed to the immunoprecipitating matrix (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a micro-centrifuge tube by incubating the mixture overnight at 4Â°C on a shaker. For immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged proteins, ANTI-FLAG M2âAgarose (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used. The cell lysate was incubated with the matrixâantibody complex overnight at 4Â°C on a shaking platform. The matrix was pelleted and washed using phosphate buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by resuspending the matrix in 2Ã electrophoresis sample buffer followed by boiling for 2â3 min. After a brief spin, the supernatants were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using the indicated antibody. The immunoprecipitated protein was also probed as a loading control.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding assay</title><p>DNA binding assays were performed as described (<xref rid="gks1454-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), with a few modifications. The 293 cells were co-transfected in six-well plates with 100 ng of the 2.8-kb reporter gene construct (<xref rid="gks1454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), a non-specific control plasmid and 1 Âµg of RBPJ, CXXC5 or CHCHD2 expression plasmid. After incubation, 1% formaldehyde (v/v) was added for 10 min to induce cross-linking. The reaction was halted with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were collected and washed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold swelling buffer and kept on ice for 10 min. Plasmid DNA was fragmented by incubation with 500 U each of Mbo I and Dpn I for 16 h at 37Â°C. Nuclei were lysed in lysis buffer on ice for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, the antibodyâmatrix complex was prepared as described under co-immunoprecipitation. Tag-specific antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. The nuclear lysate was diluted 1:10 with dilution buffer, and an aliquot of the antibodyâmatrix complex was added. The mixture was shaken overnight at 4Â°C. A small fraction of the nuclear lysate was saved as the input fraction. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed sequentially at 4Â°C on a shaker for 5 min, once each using low-salt wash buffer, high-salt wash buffer and LiCl wash buffer, and then twice in Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The immunoprecipitated protein was eluted twice with elution buffer for 15 min each on a shaker at 65Â°C. Cross-linking was reversed by incubating the elution fraction with 200 mM NaCl at 65Â°C for 5 h. Proteins were digested using Proteinase K. The precipitated DNA was purified using the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen) and amplified with primers encompassing the segment harboring the ORE. The control primers amplified a segment of the co-transfected non-specific plasmid. The input fraction was also purified and amplified using the ORE and control primers.</p></sec><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The anti-CHCHD2, DRBP76 and the anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Proteintech Group Inc (Chicago, IL, USA) and Sigma Aldrich, respectively. COX4I2 (monoclonal) and Î²-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Abnova (Taipei City, Taiwan) and Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA), respectively. The COX1 antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast one-hybrid screen</title><p>The bait sequence with a 3xORE [ATAAGAATGCGGCCGC 3X(GCAGGACGTTCCCACGCT) ACTAGTCCA] was cloned into pHIS3NB, constructed as described (<xref rid="gks1454-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), driving the <italic>HIS3</italic> selection gene. A HeLa cell cDNA library (<xref rid="gks1454-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) in the pB42A vector was used to analyse the interactions. Positive clones were selected for growth on medium lacking histidine.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of rat pulmonary smooth muscle cells and siRNA treatment</title><p>Smooth muscle cells were isolated from pulmonary precapillary arteries and cultured as described previously (<xref rid="gks1454-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Briefly, rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally using ketamine (50 mg/kg) and medetomidin (100 Âµg/kg, Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany). Lungs were filled with a mixture of 5 mg/ml glow melting point agarose and 5 mg/ml Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> in medium M199 (Invitrogen) through the pulmonary artery. A magnetic holder collected pulmonary arteries containing the iron particles and agarose. Fibroblasts were disrupted by incubation at 37Â°C for 60 min with 80 U/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich). The medial layer of the pulmonary artery attached to iron particles was suspended in M199 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany), transferred to T75 culture flasks, and incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air for 4â5 days. On reaching 80% confluence, cells were trypsinized and divided into fresh T75 culture flasks. PASMC were verified by co-staining with alpha-smooth muscle actin and von Willebrand factor. Rat PASMC were used to conduct the experiments after 1â2 passages.</p><p>Selective targeting of CXXC5, RBPJ and CHCHD2 was performed using a pool of specific siRNAs. As a control, scrambled siRNA was used that do not target any gene in the rat and mouse genome. The siRNAs were commercially purchased from Invitrogen and Thermo Scientific. Transfection of siRNAs was performed in low-serum and antibiotic-free medium [1% (v/v) FCS in M199]. siRNAs (100 nM CHCHD2, CXXC5 and 200 nM RBPJ) were transfected using 1 Âµl X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) per cm<sup>2</sup> of the well. Both siRNAs and the transfection reagent were diluted in OPTI-MEM medium (Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany). After 6 h of transfection, the medium was changed to 10% FCS M199 containing antibiotics [1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin]. After 36 h of incubation, PASMC were transferred to a 4% O<sub>2</sub> cell incubator (Thermo Scientific) for 36 h. A normoxic control was maintained at 21% O<sub>2</sub>.

On binding the intracellular domain of NOTCH (NOTCH ICD), RBPJ recruits co-activators to cause transcriptional activation at promoters. Hence, a constitutively active version of RBPJ, RBPJ-VP16 was used. The chimeric protein enhanced the level of activation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions to about 3- and 5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We tested whether the activation of RBPJ-VP16 was sensitive to CXXC5 under hypoxia as is RBPJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F2">Figure 2</xref>C) and observed reduction in the activation levels of RBPJ-VP16 in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F3">Figure 3</xref>B), suggesting the mechanism of RBPJ-VP16 activation at the ORE is similar to that of RBPJ, albeit at a stronger level. A major portion of the ORE is the consensus RBPJ binding sequence. To further test the role of RBPJ on the <italic>COX4I2</italic> ORE, we generated a cell line that stably knocks down RBPJ. In these cells under hypoxia, the minimal reporter shows an â¼50% reduction in luciferase activity compared with wild-type cells. Overexpressing CHCHD2 in these cells fails to overcome the repressive effect on the promoter. Further, overexpressing CXXC5 in these cells causes a reduction in transcriptional activation of the ORE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F3">Figure 3</xref>C). A stable knockdown of CHCHD2 also reduces the reporter activity under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F3">Figure 3</xref>D). In these cells, overexpression of RBPJ failed to reverse transcriptional suppression of the reporter. Taken together, the results suggest RBPJ and CHCHD2 function as transcriptional activators, and CXXC5 functions as a repressor. Both RNA and protein levels of RBPJ and CHCHD2 are knocked down in shRNA transfected versus control cells, indicating a robust effect at both the transcript and protein level (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gks1454/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>).

Regulatory systems that can sense and respond to varying oxygen levels are of great interest, as oxygen availability, delivery and utilization are among the most basic functions in which multicellular animals engage and depend on. Much attention has focused on HIF and its network but less is known about other systems. Lung is an organ in which the need for oxygen regulation is distinct compared with other organs, as the pulmonary tissues are exposed to a significantly higher oxygen tension than others such as heart, liver, spleen, brain and the lymphatic system. The oxygen concentration of air that reaches the upper respiratory tract is â¼20 kPa (â¼20% oxygen), and oxygen levels at the alveolar surface are â¼13 kPa. In contrast, tissues such as spleen, brain and the lymph nodes are exposed to an oxygen tension of â¼â¤2% (<xref rid="gks1454-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, certain pathophysiological conditions exists in which lungs experience oxygen tensions that significantly deviate from the normal values. For example, under physiological conditions in early development, lungs are exposed to 3â5% oxygen during embryogenesis, called physiologic hypoxia, which is necessary for normal development of mammalian embryos (<xref rid="gks1454-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, lungs have been shown to experience oxygen levels as low as 3â5% at high altitudes (<xref rid="gks1454-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Pathological conditions often also cause alveolar hypoxia as seen, for example, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref rid="gks1454-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified an isoform of COX subunit 4, <italic>COX4I2</italic>, with highest expression in the bronchial and arterial smooth muscle of the lung, whose promoter is transcriptionally responsive to oxygen and shows maximum response at 4% oxygen (<xref rid="gks1454-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We have also shown that lung COX exhibits a 2â2.5 times higher activity compared with its liver counterpart that does not express <italic>COX4I2</italic> (<xref rid="gks1454-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This allowed us to attribute the increase in enzyme activity to the presence of COX4I2 protein. Here, we identified three proteins that bind the conserved ORE in the <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoter upstream of exon I, namely RBPJ, CXXC5 and CHCHD2. Each of the proteins binds the <italic>COX4I2</italic> promoter at or in the vicinity of the ORE to regulate the response of the promoter to changes in oxygen tension.</p><p>Relatively little is currently known about the three transcription factors we identified. Only RBPJ, which plays a dual role as a transcription factor (activator and repressor) in the NOTCH signaling pathway, has previously received much attention (<xref rid="gks1454-B21" ref-type="bibr">21â24</xref>). Hypoxia is a crucial factor in the regulation of the NOTCH signaling pathway, including stabilizing and enhancing the activity of the NOTCH ICD (<xref rid="gks1454-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). CXXC5 was initially identified on genomic screens of modulators of Wnt (<xref rid="gks1454-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), NFÎºB (<xref rid="gks1454-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and retinoic-acid receptor signaling pathways (<xref rid="gks1454-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Andersson <italic>et al.</italic> have shown CXXC5 to be a downstream effector of bone morphogenic protein 4 that belongs to the transforming growth factor beta family of signaling proteins. For CHCHD2, its silencing in a human fibroblast cell line decreased the oxygen consumption rate by â¼50% and significantly reduced the activity of COX, indicating an important role of CHCHD2 in the regulation of OxPhos (<xref rid="gks1454-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A homolog of CHCHD2, called MRP10, is present in yeast and serves the function of translating mitochondrial genes (<xref rid="gks1454-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It is also up-regulated in breast cancer cells exposed to estrogen and hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="gks1454-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that RBPJ and CHCHD2 act in concert at the ORE to enhance the hypoxic activation of <italic>COX4I2</italic>. CXXC5, in contrast, could act by itself as an ORE repressor, an effect that was enhanced under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The knockdown of RBPJ attenuated the activation by CHCHD2 under hypoxic conditions and vice versa, suggesting that both RBPJ and CHCHD2 are necessary for optimal hypoxic regulation of <italic>COX4I2</italic>. However, knockdown of neither RBPJ nor CHCHD2 affect the inhibitory function of CXXC5.</p><p>Protein levels for CHCHD2 were only higher at 4% oxygen compared with 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Under normoxic conditions, only overexpression of CXXC5 results in a significant change (â¼40% reduction) in reporter activity, showing the ORE is negatively regulated by the action of CXXC5. Under reduced oxygen tension, however, there is an enhanced expression of the activator CHCHD2 that appears to overcome the inhibitory effect of CXXC5 on the ORE. Furthermore, masking of the inhibitory effect of CXXC5 is also seen by the additional activation when CHCHD2 is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F6">Figure 6</xref>D).</p><p>To validate our findings from cell culture experiments, we used rat lung primary cells in which <italic>COX4I2</italic> is endogenously expressed. We found that primary cells incubated under low oxygen tension (4%) showed enhanced expression of <italic>COX4I2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, on knocking down CHCHD2 or RBPJ, reduced <italic>COX4I2</italic> expression was observed at 4% oxygen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1454-F7">Figure 7</xref>E depicts a model for the regulation of the <italic>COX4I2</italic> ORE. At 20% oxygen, CXXC5 is bound to the promoter to cause a repressive effect that is reversed at 4% by an increased expression of CHCHD2 that displaces CXXC5.</p><p>Under conditions of low oxygen, the transcriptional regulator HIF plays a critical role in the regulation of hypoxic genes. The genes regulated by HIFs include <italic>GLUT1</italic>, <italic>iNOS</italic>, <italic>VEGF</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic> and <italic>ETS1</italic> (<xref rid="gks1454-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which are up-regulated at oxygen tensions lower than 1% where HIFs are stable and bind the hypoxia responsive elements in their promoters (<xref rid="gks1454-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, a study by Elvidge <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="gks1454-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) points out the possibility of hypoxic gene regulation independent of HIFs. Furthermore, one of the oxygen sensors for the regulation of <italic>ATF4</italic> was found to be PHD3 (<xref rid="gks1454-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Similarly, the hypoxic induction of ATF3 is independent of HIF-1 (<xref rid="gks1454-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The hypoxic regulation of NFÎºB also occurs via reduced hydroxylation of the IÎºB Kinases (IKKs) (<xref rid="gks1454-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), suggesting the presence of an alternative regulatory systems. Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="gks1454-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) have shown that hypoxia, in addition to enhancing the expression of <italic>COX4I2</italic>, also increases the expression of the mitochondrial protease LON, which causes the degradation of <italic>COX4I1</italic>. They identified two sequences in the <italic>COX4I2</italic> gene, present in the human promoter but not conserved in other mammalian species, that bind HIFs to regulate <italic>COX4I2</italic> activity under oxygen tensions as low as 1%. However, the role of HIFs in <italic>COX4I2</italic> regulation under physiological conditions is not fully clear because 1% oxygen is not typical in normal lung<italic>.</italic> As an extreme example, the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of subjects at the summit of Mt. Everest was found to be â¼35 torr (â¼4â7% oxygen) (<xref rid="gks1454-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), a level of oxygen used in the current study. Results from a study using a HIF-luciferase reporter construct harboring three HIF binding sites indicated that HIF is not significantly induced at 4% oxygen (<xref rid="gks1454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It should be noted that the minimal 118 bp-ORE-luciferase promoter construct used in this study does not contain any HIF binding sites. Nevertheless, a role for HIFs in the regulation of <italic>COX4I2</italic> could be possible at lower oxygen tension (â¤1%) found under pathological conditions.</p><p>Expression of <italic>COX4I2</italic> is essential for normal lung function because knockout of the gene causes severe lung pathology (<xref rid="gks1454-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Our previous finding that COX4I2-containing cytochrome oxidase is at least twice as active as the more common COX4I1-containing holoenzyme (<xref rid="gks1454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) suggests that the COX4I2 subunit might be expressed in environments where increased activity is needed to satisfy other constraints. Lung, a fibrous tissue with relatively few mitochondria, may need the ability to prevent physiological hypoxia from descending into pathological hypoxia, as occurs, for example, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Brain, also reported to express some <italic>COX4I2</italic> (<xref rid="gks1454-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), may need a more active enzyme under reduced blood oxygen supply and/or increased workload to supplement the physiological responses of increased blood flow and increased cerebral blood volume (<xref rid="gks1454-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="gks1454-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have characterized a novel and conserved HIF-1-independent ORE in the promoter of <italic>COX4I2</italic> that responds to physiological hypoxia via the action of at least three cellular proteinsâRBPJ, CXXC5 and CHCHD2âto regulate the expression of <italic>COX4I2</italic> and thereby the activity of COX to adapt to cellular energy requirements under varying oxygen concentrations. Other transcription factors are likely to be involved in <italic>COX4I2</italic> regulation because tissue specificity is not present in the ones so far identified.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gks1454/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Figure 1.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: Henry L.
