Congenital myopathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of muscle disorders characterized by congenital or early-onset hypotonia and muscle weakness, and specific pathological features on muscle biopsy. The phenotype ranges from foetal akinesia resulting in
<italic>in utero</italic>
or neonatal mortality, to milder disorders that are not life-limiting. Over the past decade, more than 20 new congenital myopathy genes have been identified. Most encode proteins involved in muscle contraction; however, mutations in ion channel-encoding genes are increasingly being recognized as a cause of this group of disorders.
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
encodes the Î±-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel (Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4). This channel is essential for the generation and propagation of the muscle action potential crucial to muscle contraction. Dominant
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
gain-of-function mutations are a well-established cause of myotonia and periodic paralysis. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations in a cohort of 11 individuals from six unrelated kindreds with congenital myopathy. Affected members developed
<italic>in utero</italic>
- or neonatal-onset muscle weakness of variable severity. In seven cases, severe muscle weakness resulted in death during the third trimester or shortly after birth. The remaining four cases had marked congenital or neonatal-onset hypotonia and weakness associated with mild-to-moderate facial and neck weakness, significant neonatal-onset respiratory and swallowing difficulties and childhood-onset spinal deformities. All four surviving cohort members experienced clinical improvement in the first decade of life. Muscle biopsies showed myopathic features including fibre size variability, presence of fibrofatty tissue of varying severity, without specific structural abnormalities. Electrophysiology suggested a myopathic process, without myotonia.
<italic>In vitro</italic>
functional assessment in HEK293 cells of the impact of the identified
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations showed loss-of-function of the mutant Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channels. All, apart from one, of the mutations either caused fully non-functional channels, or resulted in a reduced channel activity. Each of the affected cases carried at least one full loss-of-function mutation. In five out of six families, a second loss-of-function mutation was present on the trans allele. These functional results provide convincing evidence for the pathogenicity of the identified mutations and suggest that different degrees of loss-of-function in mutant Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channels are associated with attenuation of the skeletal muscle action potential amplitude to a level insufficient to support normal muscle function. The results demonstrate that recessive loss-of-function
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations should be considered in patients with a congenital myopathy.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
Congenital myopathies are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorders often characterized by specific structural abnormalities in muscle biopsies. The degree of severity varies widely from profound muscle weakness leading to
<italic>in utero</italic>
or neonatal lethality, to less severe infant- or childhood-onset weakness, which results in a much milder clinical course (
<xref rid="awv352-B27" ref-type="bibr">Wallgren-Pettersson and Laing, 2010</xref>
). Common features are prominent facial muscle weakness with or without ptosis and proximal predominant limb muscle weakness.
</p>
      <p>
Congenital myopathies demonstrate a considerable degree of locus and allelic heterogeneity. Mutations in different genes can cause the same pathology, and mutations in the same gene can lead to different types of muscle pathology. This indicates that disruption of a common pathway, rather than a strict gene-pathology relationship, determines the disease pathogenesis (

). In the past decade, whole exome sequencing has contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital myopathies, by facilitating the identification of novel disease-causing genes and by broadening our understanding of the range of phenotypes associated with known causative genes.
</p>
      <p>
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
encodes the Î±-subunit of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel (Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4) mainly expressed in skeletal muscle. The tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel (
<xref rid="awv352-B24" ref-type="bibr">
Trimmer
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 1989
</xref>
;
<xref rid="awv352-B30" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Hoffman, 1994</xref>
) is essential for the generation and propagation of the muscle action potential crucial for skeletal muscle contraction. Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 is a large protein composed of four homologous domains (DIâDIV) each consisting of six transmembrane segments (S1âS6). Segments S5 and S6 of each domain form the single ion-conducting pore, while S1âS4 form the voltage sensing domains. The four positively charged S4 segments function as voltage sensors regulating the opening and closing of the pore (

).
</p>
      <p>
Dominant gain-of-function mutations in
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
are a well-established cause of disorders collectively termed sodium channelopathies. The range of phenotypes associated with sodium channelopathies includes episodes of muscle stiffness (potassium-aggravated myotonia), episodes of paralytic attacks associated with reduced serum potassium levels (hypokalaemic periodic paralysis) or combination of attacks of both myotonia and periodic paralysis in the same patient (paramyotonia congenita, hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis) (

</xref>
;
<xref rid="awv352-B3" ref-type="bibr">
Corrochano
<italic>et al.</italic>

</xref>
). Attacks can be triggered by changes in temperature or ion concentration and can last from minutes to days. In myotonia, the mutated Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 causes sarcolemmal hyperexcitability and delayed muscle relaxation after contraction, while in periodic paralysis a prolonged sodium current (hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis) or an aberrant gating pore current through Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 (hypokalaemic periodic paralysis type 2) results in membrane depolarization and inexcitability (
<xref rid="awv352-B23" ref-type="bibr">
Suetterlin
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2014
</xref>
). Neonatal hypotonia with variable feeding and respiratory difficulty has also been rarely reported in the sodium channelopathies. This is a transient phenomenon, however, which improves spontaneously (
<xref rid="awv352-B13" ref-type="bibr">
Matthews
<italic>et al.</italic>

).
</p>
      <p>
Recessive loss-of-function
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations are rare and have been described in only two patients with congenital myasthenic syndrome. Two heteroallelic missense
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations were detected in a patient with neonatal onset of fatigable generalized weakness and recurrent attacks of respiratory and bulbar paralysis (
<xref rid="awv352-B25" ref-type="bibr">
Tsujino
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2003
</xref>
). In the second patient, the onset was â¼12 years of age with episodic generalized weakness lasting for hours and resulting in muscle fatigue later in life (
<xref rid="awv352-B1" ref-type="bibr">
Arnold
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2015
</xref>
). A homozygous missense mutation in
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
was identified in this patient, while the heterozygous parents were asymptomatic. In both patients, the mutant Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channels had enhanced fast inactivation, constituting a loss-of-function effect.
</p>
      <p>
Here, we describe homozygous or compound heterozygous
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations in 11 individuals from six unrelated families with congenital myopathy. The affected cases had clinical phenotypes ranging from severe foetal hypokinesia resulting in early lethality to âclassicalâ congenital myopathy that improved clinically over time. Functional assessment of the mutant Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channels in HEK293 cells revealed full and partial loss-of-function effects constituting a novel molecular pathomechanism associated with
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations.

Identification of
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations in the congenital myopathy patients
</title>
        <p>
Whole exome sequencing was carried out in the proband from Family 1 as part of the European Commission funded NeurOmics project. Following a filtering procedure (
<xref rid="awv352-B4" ref-type="bibr">
de Ligt
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2012
</xref>
) and assuming a recessive mode of inheritance, we were left with eight high quality variants (
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>
). Only the two heterozygous variants in
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
were not present in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database and were predicted to be pathogenic and thus were considered as the disease-causing mutations. Segregation analysis showed that the compound heterozygous
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
c.311G&gt;A (p.R104H) and c.3403C&gt;T (p.R1135C) mutations detected in the proband had been inherited from the unaffected mother and father, respectively.
</p>
        <p>
Through an international collaborative effort we identified 10 additional cases with congenital myopathy from five unrelated families (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv352-F1">Fig. 1</xref>
). The affected cases carried homozygous or compound heterozygous
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
variants that were predicted to be pathogenic. All 11
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations identified in the cohort members are described in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv352-F2">Fig. 2</xref>
. The
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing and segregation consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was confirmed in all six families. The location of the mutations relative to the domains of the Na

We detected a continuum of clinical severity ranging from severe foetal hypokinesia resulting in early lethality in seven cases, to a milder congenital myopathy phenotype in four surviving individuals. Phenotypic features of the cohort are summarized in
<xref rid="awv352-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
and clinical data are detailed in

history
</title>
            <p>
The seven most severely affected cohort members developed marked foetal hypokinesia from 19 to 32 weeks gestation. All seven also developed
<italic>in utero</italic>
-onset limb contractures and/or talipes, which were first detected at 19 to 31 weeks
<italic>.</italic>
Talipes was the most common limb deformity (seen on ultrasound in 5/7 severely affected infants; first detected between 19 to 27 weeks). Additional lower limb joint contractures were noted prior to delivery in five of the infants.
<italic>In utero</italic>
-onset upper limb and/or finger contractures were detected on ultrasound in four cases, sometimes in combination with lower limb contractures (three cases). Almost all severely affected cohort members also developed features suggestive of hydrops (present in 6/7; evident from 20 to 31 weeks). The mothers of all seven severely affected cohort members developed polyhydramnios (onset 20 to 31 weeks), which typically developed in parallel with hypokinesia and foetal limb contractures. Decompression procedures to reduce liquor volume were required in two cases.

            <title>Prematurity and early death</title>
            <p>One severely affected infant was born at term but died at 5 h of age from respiratory complications. The other six severely affected infants died at or before 36 weeks gestation: two infants died spontaneously prior to delivery (at 29 and 31 weeks gestation), one died during delivery (at 36 weeks), two died within 8 h of their premature delivery due to severe respiratory insufficiency (at 32 and 33 weeks), and one pregnancy was terminated at 28 weeks gestation due to recurrence of features seen in two severely affected pregnancies.</p>
            <p>
All seven cohort members who did not survive beyond the first day of life had at least one sign of
<italic>in utero</italic>
involvement (e.g. hypokinesia, limb contractures or talipes) by 32 weeks gestation, and in 4/7 cases at least one abnormality was evident by 20 weeks.
</p>

          <sec>
            <title>External examination and autopsy findings</title>
            <p>
External examination was undertaken in all seven infants who died prematurely or at term. Six also underwent autopsy. Marked muscle hypoplasia was present in all seven. Hydrops was confirmed in six cases. External and autopsy examination revealed features associated with hydrops (e.g. pericardial and pleural effusions, ascites and/or hepatomegaly), in addition to the features associated with severe foetal hypokinesia (a small thorax, pulmonary hypoplasia, limb contractures and fractures). In addition to talipes (present in 6/7 cases), four had lower limb contractures; typically bilateral hip flexion contractures (3/4) with or without additional external rotation, and knee extension contractures (4/4). Five had upper limb contractures (finger flexion in 4/7, wrist 1/7, elbow flexion 2/7, shoulder flexion 1/7). In general, lower limb contractures were more marked than upper limb contractures. Limb fractures were present in 2/7 cases (left humerus and right mid-femur). Thin gracile ribs and/or thin long bones were noted in at least 2/7 cases. Several infants had additional facial features that were not shared by other family members. This included plagiocephaly (1/7), frontal bossing (2/7), deep set eyes (2/7 cases), downward-sloping lateral orbital ridges (1/7), a flattened nose (3/7), ear abnormalities (3/7), retrognathia and/or micrognathia (3/7), and/or a small triangular or tented mouth (2/7). A subset of these (e.g. multiple joint contractures, hydrops/oedema, pulmonary hypoplasia, and retromicrognathia) are well-known features of foetal akinesia deformation sequence (

          <title>Clinical features in surviving cohort members with âclassicalâ congenital myopathy</title>
          <p>The four surviving cohort members are currently aged 2.5, 8, 14 and 35 years, and all have features consistent with âclassicalâ congenital myopathy.</p>

features were generally less marked than in severe foetal hypokinesia cases; however, at least one abnormality (hypokinesia, polyhydramnios or talipes) was present in three of the four cases. Foetal hypokinesia was noted during the pregnancies of two of the four surviving cohort members (onset at 20 and 31 weeks, respectively), but appears to have been less marked than in more severely affected cohort members. Polyhydramnios complicated the pregnancies of 2/4 surviving cohort members and was first noted slightly later (31 to 40 weeks). None of the surviving cohort members had limb contractures or talipes detected on prenatal ultrasound, or a history of hydrops. All four were born at or close to term. Breech presentation, or transverse lie, complicated delivery of three of these four affected individuals. One required resuscitation following delivery.

            <title>Congenital features</title>
            <p>All four surviving cohort members had moderate-to-severe hypotonia and facial, neck, axial and limb weakness, which was either present at birth (3/4) or developed within the first few days of life (as was the case for the proband from Family 3). A weak cry, a generalized reduction in muscle bulk, and reduced or absent limb reflexes were also each noted in two or more surviving infants. Talipes was present in only one of the four, and this was not detected until delivery. Another child had mild bilateral hip contractures first noted at birth, which resolved with stretching exercises.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec>
            <title>Bulbar involvement</title>
            <p>Swallowing difficulties, severe enough to warrant supplemental tube and/or parenteral gastrostomy (PEG) feeding, were present from birth in 3/4 surviving cohort members. Reliance on supplemental feeding typically declined over time, and ceased during infancy or early childhood. The two youngest cohort members (now aged 2.5 and 8 years) have evidence of persisting oromotor weakness and expressive language delay suggestive of ongoing bulbar involvement, however both have experienced improvement in their feeding and language status, over time.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec>
            <title>Pattern of muscle involvement and contractures</title>
            <p>All surviving cohort members had mild-to-moderate upper and lower limb weakness, which was typically more marked proximally (3/4 cases). Hip extension and abduction were the weakest manoeuvres in 2/4 cases. Neck weakness was universal (4/4), and typically more pronounced than limb weakness. Neck flexion was usually weaker than extension. Shoulder, neck and truncal muscle atrophy was often more marked than limb muscle atrophy. Muscle hypertrophy, muscle pain and fasciculations were not present in any cohort member.</p>
            <p>Postnatal-onset lower limb contractures were noted in only 1/4 surviving cohort member. Abnormal foot positioning was noted in 2/4 (pes planus in 1/4, hindfoot valgus/forefoot pronation deformities in 1/4).</p>
            <p>Progression in axial weakness was documented in at least one surviving cohort member. This resulted in the development of respiratory insufficiency severe enough to warrant institution of non-invasive nocturnal ventilation at age 6 years. Two of the four surviving cohort members needed non-invasive respiratory support at or soon after birth, and a third required invasive ventilation. The duration of support varied; however, two were weaned from respiratory intervention by the age of 2 years. The third remains reliant on nocturnal BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) at age 2.5.</p>
            <p>Postnatal-onset scoliosis, kyphosis and spinal rigidity each were also reported in at least one additional case.</p>

          <sec>
            <title>Facial and eye involvement</title>
            <p>
Mild-to-moderate facial weakness and myopathic facial features including an elongated face and/or a high arched palate were present in all four cases (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv352-F3">Fig. 3</xref>
). Additional dysmorphisms noted in at least 1/4 included dolichocephaly, synophrys, proptosis, large down-slanting palpebral fissures, and a broad nasal root and bridge. A subset of the dysmorphic facial features noted in cohort members with severe foetal hypokinesia, including deep set eyes, frontal bossing and micrognathia were present in at least one surviving individual. Mild weakness of up-gaze developed in one child at age 3 years. Generalized ophthalmoplegia was noted in a second affected individual. Ptosis was not present in any cohort member.

            <title>Functional abilities</title>
            <p>Delay in early motor milestones was universal. Age when independent ambulation was first achieved ranged from 18 months to 2 years 9 months. At least two cohort members were eventually able to run, albeit slowly and with difficulty. Gait was typically broad-based, slow, and waddling. Two of four used assistive devices (splints and/or frame), and 2/4 used a wheelchair. At least two cohort members had additional fine motor delay. All four experienced clearly documented improvements in strength and motor skills over time. All three that achieved independent ambulation remain able to walk. The youngest (2.5 years old) member is making good progress towards walking independently.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec>
            <title>Additional features</title>
            <p>
Other features noted in two or more affected individuals included chest wall deformities (2/4), generalized joint hypermobility (at least 2/4), unilateral or bilateral scapular winging (one case each) (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv352-F3">Fig. 3</xref>
). One surviving cohort member had tricuspid insufficiency at birth, which resolved with time. No cardiac defects were present in the other three individuals, and none have developed additional cardiac complications over time.

          <sec>
            <title>Intermittent exacerbations in muscle weakness and increased fatigability</title>
            <p>Marked fatigability with walking and/or writing was a feature in at least 3/4 of the surviving cohort members.</p>
            <p>The proband from Family 1 (carrying heterozygous p.R1135C), who is now 14 years of age, began to experience exercise- and illness-associated exacerbations in her level of muscle weakness from the age of 12, and an activity-limiting increase in her fatigability from age 13. These episodes can last a few minutes and while they could be considered reminiscent of periodic paralysis, her repetitive stimulation and single fibre EMG results were normal, with no evidence of alteration of the amplitude or the total area of the compound muscle action potential during exercise test performed after cooling or after a long exercise test.</p>
            <p>
The oldest cohort member (now aged 35) has experienced a deterioration in her strength and motor abilities, and increase in fatigability over the past 5 years. She also has an abnormal repetitive stimulation test result suggestive of an additional neuromuscular junction abnormality (
<xref rid="awv352-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
), which may be contributing to her fatigability. One of her mutations was reported previously in a family with autosomal dominant non-dystrophic myotonia (
<xref rid="awv352-B12" ref-type="bibr">
Lee
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2009

); however, myotonia was notably absent in this and all other cohort members.

Segregation studies confirmed that all 12 parents, and one unaffected sibling (from Family 4) were carriers of one
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutation. Eight parents (from Families 1, 4, 5 and 6) and the sibling carrier were examined by an experienced neurologist and/or clinical geneticist and showed no evidence of myopathy, myotonia or other abnormal neurological features. This included the paternal carrier of p.R1135C mutation (previously reported in an unusual recessive form of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis). The remaining four parents were unavailable for formal examination but by report, had no neurological symptoms or signs. This included the maternal carrier of the p.R225W mutation (previously reported in dominant non-dystrophic myotonia).

            <p>Neurophysiology testing was undertaken in all four cohort members who survived infancy. EMG findings were normal in 2/4. Mild abnormalities were present in 1/4. In Patient II.1 from Family 4, there were widespread myopathic changes in all four limbs at age 14 months, however on repeat testing at age 6 years all abnormalities had normalized, in parallel with a gradual improvement in strength and motor abilities. Single fibre EMG was normal in one cohort member. Repetitive stimulation testing was undertaken in two cohort members. Neither had a positive decrement at 3 Hz. In the oldest cohort member there was, however, a 60% decrement at 10 Hz.</p>
            <p>Nerve conduction velocities were normal in 2/4 members. Testing undertaken in the oldest cohort member, at age 35 years, showed reduced motor amplitudes.

Post-mortem muscle samples were taken from all foetal hypokinesia affected cohort members: Patient II.2 Family 4 (gestational age 40/40); Family 5 Patient II.1 (33/40), Patient II.2 (31/40), and Patient II.3 (36/40); and Family 6 Patient II.1 (29/40), Patient II.2 (32/40), and Patient II.3 (28/40). Muscle histopathology findings included abnormal fibre size variation with a mixture of small and large fibres across fascicles without overt grouping. Presence of fibrofatty tissue, which was particularly severe in Patient II.1 Family 6, was noted in all cases (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv352-F4">Fig. 4</xref>
AâC). Necrosis and regeneration were not seen. Rods, other inclusions, cores or other structural abnormalities were absent (

Haematoxylin and eosin staining performed in the muscle samples taken from the foetal hypokinesia cases showed abnormal fibre size variation (

). Marked end-stage presence of fibrofatty tissue was seen in the post-mortem sections from Patient II.1 Family 6 (

<bold>E</bold>
). Rods or other inclusions were also absent in Patient II.2 from Family 5 (

<bold>G</bold>
â
<bold>I</bold>
). Mild fibrofatty replacement was present in the quadriceps biopsy taken from Patient II.1 Family 1 (age 2 years) (

<bold>H</bold>

Quadriceps muscle biopsies taken from the congenital myopathy cohort members showed milder myopathic features (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awv352-F4">Fig. 4</xref>

</p>
            <p>Where fibre typing data were available, muscle samples in the foetal hypokinesia cohort showed fast predominance, probably related to immaturity, while mild to marked slow predominance was observed in the biopsies from the congenital myopathy cohort.</p>

nonsense, essential splice site and frameshift mutations alter essential functional domains of the Na

1.4 channel
</title>
        <p>
The truncating mutations p.Q470X and p.Y1593X would delete 1366 and 240 amino acids, respectively from the C-terminal end of the Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 protein. They would result in nonsense-mediated decay of the
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
transcript or if translated in non-functional channels.
</p>
        <p>
To investigate the effect of the c.3145-2A&gt;C mutation on
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mRNA splicing, we performed reverse transcription PCR in peripheral blood cells from the proband, mother and father from Family 4. Using primers flanking exon 15â17, two distinct fragments were amplified. A smaller fragment was obtained in all three samples while a larger fragment was only present in the index case and the father. Sanger sequencing demonstrated the smaller to be a 424 bp fragment corresponding to the wild-type
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
transcript of exons 15â17. The larger 971 bp fragment contained exons 15â17 and an additional 547 bp of intron 16 (
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>
). The retained intron 16 sequence introduces a stop codon in the
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mRNA coding sequence at amino acid position 1099 (p.A1049VfsX50) that would generate a truncated Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 protein. The deletion of 738 C-terminal amino acids is predicted to induce complete loss of Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel function.
</p>
        <p>The frameshift p.H1782Qfs65 located at the channel C-terminus caused by c.5345 duplication generates a protein that is nine amino acids longer than the wild-type. The mutated channels would have C-terminal sequence that is completely altered compared to wild-type channels. The effect of C-terminus frameshift mutations is largely unknown and therefore p.H1782Qfs65 was included in the functional analyses.</p>

1.4 channel function properties upon heterologous expression. Neither the peak current density, the voltage dependencies of the channel activation, fast- or slow inactivation, nor the time courses of onset or recovery from fast inactivation were significantly different from wild-type channels (

<xref rid="awv352-B7" ref-type="bibr">
Groome
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2014
</xref>
). It causes loss of channel function by enhancing fast inactivation of the channel. In addition it causes gating pore currents, which are typical for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis mutant channel. We studied the gating pore currents of the p.R1135C channels using
<italic>X. laevis</italic>
oocyte expression system. We found that the gating pore current of the rat Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4-R1128C orthologue is active at hyperpolarized resting voltages even when the holding voltage is hyperpolarized (

Using whole exome sequencing, we ascertained a cohort of 11 individuals from six unrelated and ethnically distinct kindreds with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
. Affected individuals presented with congenital myopathy of variable severity. All had
<italic>in utero</italic>
- or neonatal-onset muscle weakness resulting in reduced foetal movements. Patients at the severe end of the spectrum had clinical features associated with foetal hypokinesia (maternal polyhydramnios,
<italic>in utero</italic>
upper/lower limb contractures, talipes and hydrops) resulting in intrauterine or early postnatal death. The patients at the less severe end of the spectrum presented with generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth or within the first few days of life. This was typically associated with mild-to-moderate facial muscle weakness without ptosis, and significant early respiratory and feeding difficulties. Surviving individuals had delayed motor milestones and achieved independent ambulation before the age of 3 years. Consistent with many forms of âclassicalâ congenital myopathy, all cohort members who survived infancy experienced improvement in their strength and motor skills over time, and concomitant resolution of early respiratory and feeding difficulties.
</p>
      <p>
The phenotype of the cohort members described in this study differs from that of other sodium channelopathies (e.g. autosomal dominant myotonia and autosomal dominant periodic paralysis), and from the two reported
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
-related congenital myasthenia cases. In stark contrast to other sodium channelopathies, the congenital myopathy cohort members had
<italic>in utero</italic>
- or neonatal-onset permanent muscle weakness, rather than later-onset episodic muscle weakness. Although individuals with periodic paralysis and, in rare instances, paramyotonia congenita, sometimes develop permanent proximal muscle weakness (
<xref rid="awv352-B23" ref-type="bibr">
Suetterlin
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2014)
</xref>
, this is typically a late complication of the condition and not a presenting feature. In addition, none of the patients had the typical features of weakness aggravated by specific factors (cold, special food and exercise) that trigger a worsening of stiffness and/or weakness in
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
-related myotonia or periodic paralysis (
<xref rid="awv352-B2" ref-type="bibr">Cannon, 2015</xref>
). While in one teenaged patient excessive muscle activity was associated with marked increase in fatigue, detailed electrophysiology examination failed to demonstrate neuromuscular junction defects or aspects evocative of periodic paralysis.
</p>
      <p>Other characteristic features of our patient cohort were the association with abnormal muscle histopathological features, and a selective pattern of muscle involvement on muscle MRI.</p>
      <p>
The majority of
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations associated with periodic paralysis and myotonia are dominantly inherited and cause gain-of-function predominantly by enhancing channel activation, attenuating fast inactivation or by inducing gating pore currents. Mild enhancement of fast inactivation leading to a loss-of-function effect has been reported for some Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 mutations in hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. Thus far, there are only two reports of loss of Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel function and recessive inheritance of
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations in congenital myasthenic syndrome (
<xref rid="awv352-B25" ref-type="bibr">
Tsujino
<italic>et al.</italic>

</xref>
;
<xref rid="awv352-B1" ref-type="bibr">
Arnold
<italic>et al.</italic>

). The loss-of-function effects were caused by enhanced fast inactivation in both cases.

Recessive loss-of-function Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 mutations as a pathomechanism of congenital myopathy
</title>
        <p>
In this study, we establish that recessive
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
loss-of-function mutations are the underlying pathomechanism in patients affected by a novel form of congenital myopathy.
</p>
        <p>
All 12 parents and one unaffected sibling were confirmed to be carriers of one
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutation but were unaffected clinically, based on formal examination in nine cases, and on history and verbal report in the other four. The absence of clinical findings in confirmed carriers suggests that the loss of function in only one allele is insufficient to cause a clinical phenotype, and further suggest an autosomal recessive mechanism of inheritance.
</p>
        <p>
The inheritance of full loss-of-function mutations on both alleles appears to cause a particularly severe phenotype resulting in early lethality, evidenced by the homozygous p.P382T mutation detected in the three affected individuals from Family 5. This suggests that muscles without functional Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channels are unable to support life.
</p>
        <p>
The remaining cohort members carried compound heterozygous
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations. All had one mutation that resulted in a completely non-functional channel, either as a consequence of Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 protein truncation or as a result of a mutation that led to a complete abolition of the sodium flux through the channel (p.R104H, p.C1209F, p.Q470X, p.A1049VfsX50, p.Y1593X in Families 1â4 and 6, respectively). Affected individuals from four of the five families with compound heterozygous mutations had a second mutation, in the
<italic>trans</italic>
allele, which resulted in partial Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 loss-of-function mainly by attenuating channel activation (p.R225W, p.D1069N and p.M203K, Families 2, 4 and 6, respectively) or by enhancing channel inactivation (p.R1135C, Family 1). In Family 3, there were no detectable loss-of-function properties in HEK293 cells for one of the Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 variants (discussed below).
</p>
        <p>
Some of the affected individuals with compound heterozygous mutations (Families 6 and 4) also died
<italic>in utero</italic>
, or at birth, implying that some combinations of complete loss-of-function/partial loss-of-function mutations also result in a severe clinical phenotype. Interfamilial variability was, however, also clearly evident. This is best demonstrated in Family 4, where one affected infant developed severe
<italic>in utero</italic>
-onset hypokinesia and died within a few hours of birth. The other affected infant survived infancy albeit with significant feeding, and respiratory support. She is now 8 years of age, has a phenotype consistent with âclassicalâ congenital myopathy and continues to improve clinically over time, a feature often associated with âclassicalâ congenital myopathies. Further studies in a large cohort of patients are required to delineate more precise correlation of functional and clinical expression of
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations.
</p>
        <p>
One of the mutations present in the 2.5-year-old male cohort member from Family 3 (p.H1782Qfs65) did not result in loss of channel function when studied in HEK293 cells. This child has a similar clinical phenotype to other cohort members. He was born following a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios (first noted at delivery), had marked neonatal-onset weakness and hypotonia associated with facial weakness, required significant feeding and respiratory support from birth, but continues to improve clinically. The frameshift mutation is predicted to alter the C-terminal of the protein and extends it by nine residues compared to the wild-type channel. Our analysis suggests that in HEK293 cells, Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel C-terminus has no detectable effects on the biophysical properties of the channel. This is in agreement with previous data showing that a deletion of the C-terminal 100 residues has no effect on channel gating (
<xref rid="awv352-B10" ref-type="bibr">
Herzog
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2003
</xref>
). However, it is possible that the frameshift mutation disrupts channel function in a tissue-specific manner, which cannot be detected in a heterologous expression system, or it might cause loss-of-function effect not elicited by the functional analyses undertaken in this study. For example, the last five C-terminal amino acid residues play an important role in the interaction of Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 with the PDZ domain of syntrophin (
<xref rid="awv352-B20" ref-type="bibr">
Schultz
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 1998
</xref>
), a scaffold protein that is a part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex and has a vital role in the maintenance of muscle integrity (
<xref rid="awv352-B5" ref-type="bibr">
Ehmsen
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2002
</xref>
). Alterations of the sequence of the C-terminus may also disrupt signals responsible for channel trafficking, targeting, activity or stability. Additional studies are required to further investigate these possibilities.
</p>
        <p>
Interestingly, we identified compound heterozygosity for p.R1135C and a full loss-of-function mutation in a 14-year-old girl with a âclassicalâ congenital myopathy phenotype. Homozygous p.R1135C has been previously described in a patient with an unusual recessive form of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (
<xref rid="awv352-B7" ref-type="bibr">
Groome
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2014
</xref>
). Consistent for periodic paralysis, the mutant channels display gating pore currents. The mutation also causes loss-of-function effects on the main pore current by enhancing fast inactivation, which results in reduced channel availability. However, the heterozygous carrier of this mutation in our family had no periodic weakness. Furthermore the muscle weakness of the proband, carrying a heterozygous p.R1135C and a full loss-of-function
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutation in trans, has been permanent rather that periodic, suggesting that the reduced main pore sodium current is the likely pathomechanism of the myopathy. Although this patient, who is now 14 years old, has started to complain of recurrent brief episodes of increased muscle weakness, a detailed electrophysiological study failed to identify any abnormalities typical of periodic paralysis, myotonia or neuromuscular junction abnormalities, but only demonstrated myopathic features.
</p>
        <p>
Our findings are in agreement with Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 being the main skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channel isoform, including the foetal and neonatal muscle, critical to muscle function (
<xref rid="awv352-B30" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Hoffman, 1994</xref>
). Expression of a second isoform, Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.5, which is tetrodotoxin resistant, has been shown in developing and denervated muscle (
<xref rid="awv352-B9" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Thesleff, 1971</xref>
;
<xref rid="awv352-B28" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Horn, 1986</xref>
). The tetrodotoxin resistant sodium current may be able to generate action potentials in muscle of newborn rats (
<xref rid="awv352-B8" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Marshall, 1973</xref>
). However, these action potentials are defective and disappear soon after birth, confirming a key role for tetrodotoxin sensitive currents in generating skeletal muscle action potentials. Possible differences in Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.5 expression in foetal muscle may, however, contribute to the variable clinical presentation in the myopathy cohort. No mutations in our cohort were detected in
<italic>SCN5A</italic>
that encodes Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.5, the principal sodium channel responsible for the initiation of the cardiac action potential (
<xref rid="awv352-B6" ref-type="bibr">
George
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 1995
</xref>
). This is consistent with the lack of cardiac involvement in the cohort members.
</p>
        <p>
In conclusion, we have identified homozygous or compound heterozygous recessive mutations in
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
in six congenital myopathy families. At least one of the mutations in each patient renders the Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel fully non-functional. The mutation on the second allele resulted in full or partial loss of Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel function in five out of six families. This constitutes the first report describing full loss-of-function
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
mutations as associated with a clinical phenotype.
</p>
        <p>
The Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channel is crucial for the initiation and propagation of the muscle action potential. The link between the depolarization of the membrane and the Ca
<sup>2+</sup>
release triggering the muscle contraction is mediated by the interaction between the voltage-sensing DHPR and the Ca
<sup>2+</sup>
release channel RYR1, main components of the excitationâcontraction coupling. Mutations in
<italic>RYR1</italic>
are an established cause of several types of congenital myopathy (
<xref rid="awv352-B29" ref-type="bibr">
Zhang
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 1993
</xref>
;
<xref rid="awv352-B11" ref-type="bibr">
Jungbluth
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2002
</xref>
;
<xref rid="awv352-B14" ref-type="bibr">
Monnier
<italic>et al.</italic>
, 2003
</xref>
). Here, we propose that the combined effects of two loss-of-function mutant Na
<sub>v</sub>
1.4 channels, one of which is a full loss-of-function, attenuates the action potential amplitude in skeletal muscle to a level insufficient to sustain normal muscle force.
</p>
        <p>
These findings have important implications for genetic diagnosis as they confirm a new form of recessive
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
-related congenital myopathy, a discovery which will undoubtedly result in improved genetic diagnosis rates in patients with this group of disorders. Furthermore, this study indicates that
<italic>SCN4A</italic>
is another example of a growing number of genes encoding for ion channels recently found to be involved in congenital myopathies. Our study also opens research avenues aimed at improving the therapeutic management of these patients.
