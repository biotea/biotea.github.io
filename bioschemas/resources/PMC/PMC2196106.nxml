      <abstract>
        <p>Quiescent endothelial cells (EC) regulate blood flow and prevent intravascular thrombosis. This latter effect is mediated in a number of ways, including expression by EC of thrombomodulin and heparan sulfate, both of which are lost from the EC surface as part of the activation response to proinflammatory cytokines. Loss of these anticoagulant molecules potentiates the procoagulant properties of the injured vasculature. An additional thromboregulatory factor, ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase; designated as EC 3.6.1.5) is also expressed by quiescent EC, and has the capacity to degrade the extracellular inflammatory mediators ATP and ADP to AMP, thereby inhibiting platelet activation and modulating vascular thrombosis. We describe here that the antithrombotic effects of the ATPDase, like heparan sulfate and thrombomodulin, are lost after EC activation, both in vitro and in vivo. Because platelet activation and aggregation are important components of the hemostatic changes that accompany inflammatory diseases, we suggest that the loss of vascular ATPDase may be crucial for the progression of vascular injury.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Quiescent vascular endothelial cells (EC)<sup>1</sup>, as they normally exist in vivo, function primarily to regulate blood flow and hemostasis by the maintenance of a nonthrombogenic surface (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). These effects are mediated largely by protease inhibitors such as antithrombin, which interacts with glycosaminoglycans, including heparan sulfate (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); concurrently, there is also expression of thrombomodulin that binds thrombin and induces the protein C/protein S anticoagulant pathway (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Activation of EC promotes vascular thrombosis by the simultaneous induction of procoagulant activity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and the suppression of anticoagulant properties (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In particular, both heparan sulfate (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and thrombomodulin (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) are rapidly lost from the surface of the EC.</p>
    <p>Platelet activation and aggregation are important factors in the mediation of vascular inflammation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and are specifically associated with the rejection of discordant xenografts, even in the absence of complement activation in a process termed delayed xenograft rejection (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Progression of platelet recruitment in association with activation is enhanced by adenosine nucleotides, which are released from damaged endothelium or other vascular cells, and are secreted in high concentrations by platelets in response to exogenous ADP, collagen, thrombin, or activated complement components. This provides an important positive feedback mechanism (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A critical regulatory element in the control of platelet thrombus formation may be the expression on endothelium of an ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Enzymatic degradation of extracellular ATP and ADP to AMP by this ecto-enzyme would transform and reverse the proinflammatory environment brought about by interaction with purinergic receptors on platelets and vascular endothelium. The ultimate generation of adenosine results in a platelet anti-aggregatory signal and downregulation of vascular inflammation in conjunction with production of prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> and nitric oxide (NO) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
    <p>Our interest in platelet activation in the setting of discordant xenograft rejection (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) has led us to study the extent to which vascular ATPDase is modulated by EC activation and inflammatory mediators. Here, we show that the antithrombotic effect of the ATPDase, like heparan sulfate and thrombomodulin, is lost following EC activation, both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
    <p>We speculate that this loss, and the resultant decreased capacity to degrade ADP, could play a significant role in the extensive platelet activation and vascular inflammation seen in reperfusion processes, xenograft rejection, and other forms of vascular injury. We have recently shown common identity between CD39 and the vascular EC ATPDase (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We propose that the now feasible expression of the CD39/ ATPDase in a form that is not inhibited during EC activation, as done for thrombomodulin (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), may find therapeutic application as a valuable and novel antithrombotic agent.</p>

        <p>Platelet aggregation and ATP release tests used a two sample, four channel, Whole Blood Lumi-Aggregometer (560 Ca; ChronoLog Corp.). Platelets (2 Ã 10<sup>8</sup>) and EC (10<sup>6</sup>) were preincubated in siliconized cuvettes containing stirring bars at 37Â°C in the aggregometer. Control cuvettes contained equal numbers of human and porcine EC and the plateletâEC combinations, to correct for light absorption by the nonaggregating EC. Platelets were activated by ADP (1â5 Î¼M), equine collagen (1â5 Î¼g/ml) (ChronoLog Corporation), or human thrombin (0.1 U/ml). Platelet aggregation was determined by increased light transmission (changes in OD representing aggregation), and by release of ATP (luminometry) following manufacturer's instructions (Chrono-Log Corp.).</p>

        <p>The influence of prostenoids and NO was determined by evaluating pEC inhibitory responses in the presence of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (aspirin and indomethacin) and scavengers of NO (hemoglobin), or by methylene blue that prevents effects of NO by inhibiting soluble guanylate cyclase (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Specifically, platelet donors had blood drawn 12 h after taking 650 mg aspirin, and EC cultures were treated with 1 mM acetyl salicylic acid for 30 min under standard culture conditions. After resuspension, 10 Î¼M indomethacin was added before study. A final concentration of 10 Î¼M methylene blue was added to the platelets and incubated at room temperature for 30 min followed by a 15 min centrifuge at 1,450 <italic>g</italic> at 4Â°C before resuspension. Oxyhemoglobin was prepared from bovine hemoglobin according to the method described by Martin et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and added to EC suspensions at 25 Î¼M. The effects of an ATPDase resistant nonmetabolizable ADP analog (ADP-Î²-S) on platelet aggregation in the presence of EC was also studied.</p>

        <p>EC were exposed to TNFÎ±, to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 Î¼M), or xanthine oxidase (100 mU/ml) and xanthine (50â200 Î¼M), the latter combination created to directly generate oxidative stress with all appropriate controls before determination of EC ATPDase activity (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p>
        <p>The relative role of each oxidant was determined by performing parallel experiments in the presence of one of the following individual agents: superoxide radical scavenger SOD (Cu-Zn form, from bovine erythrocytes, specific activity 3,570 U/mg of protein used at 330 U/ml), the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase (from bovine liver, specific activity 40,000 U/mg of protein used at 1,000 U/ml), the 21-aminosteroid des-methyl tirilazad (final concentration 5 Î¼M, an effective inhibitor of membrane peroxidation), and the iron chelator deferoxamine (100 Î¼M). In associated experiments, the effect on activated EC ATPDase activity of the addition of Î²-mercaptoethanol (5 and 10 Î¼M) was studied. The extent of lipid peroxidation was confirmed by determination of levels of malonaldehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals in cell lysates by a colorimetric assay kit (Calbiochem Corp.).</p>

Cryostat sections were treated according to the cerium based method as previously described (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

        <title>Quiescent Aortic Endothelial Cells (pEC and hEC) Exert an Inhibitory Effect on Human Platelet Aggregation Responses In Vitro.</title>
        <p>When control platelets were stimulated with standard agonists, aggregation was a consistent event. However, in the presence of both pEC and hEC, the aggregation of washed, gel filtered platelets in response to ADP, collagen, and low doses of thrombin was totally inhibited in a manner consistent with abrogation of aggregation responses. The EC-associated factor(s) that blocked human platelet aggregation were found to be cell associated, and could not be detected in pEC or hEC culture supernatants, confirming the previously published data on HUVEC by Marcus et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This inhibitory factor completely blocked purified human platelet responses to the agonists in the presence of pEC in monolayer on the cuvettes, or on bead cultures of pEC placed into the cuvette in addition to the EC suspensions as tested above (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Combinations of human platelet rich plasma and pEC resulted in a rapid and spontaneous aggregation response. This was observed to be a xenogeneic phenomenon, as no platelet aggregation was noted with either hEC or HUVEC when tested with human platelet rich plasma. This mode of platelet activation was found to be a result of extensive complement activation on the xenogeneic EC and thrombin generation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>

        <title>Characteristics of the EC-associated Inhibitor.</title>
        <p>We tested four of the putative systems associated with EC that block platelet aggregation for their involvement in the inhibitory process. Incubation of pEC treated with acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin with platelets taken from donors who had ingested aspirin, did not influence the inhibitory properties of the EC. These data suggested that the cell-associated inhibitor was âaspirin insensitiveâ i.e., did not represent prostenoids and were in accordance with previously published findings (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additionally, the inhibitory effect of EC on human platelets appeared not to be influenced by known modulators of NO; hemoglobin, which scavenges NO, and methylene blue, which inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase, had no discernible effects on the inhibitory potential of pEC and hEC.</p>
        <p>EC-associated thrombomodulin, because of its anticoagulant potential, was considered to be a potential inhibitor of thrombin-induced platelet responses in the pEC and platelet combinations tested. Supernatants which were taken from pEC and platelets incubated with thrombin (0.1 U/ml) still contained thrombin, and induced aggregation when added to platelets alone. These observations indicated that the interaction of thrombomodulin with thrombin was not responsible for the observed inhibitory effect of pEC on platelets (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Because of the importance of ADP as an agonist that amplifies and propagates platelet activation induced by itself or other agents (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), experiments were carried out to determine whether the inhibitory capacity of the xeno- and allogeneic aortic EC was dependent upon cellular ATPDase activity. To this end, ADP-Î²-S, a structural analog of ADP (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) that can activate platelet receptors but is not hydrolyzed by the ATPDase, was used to induce aggregation of platelets, both alone and in combination with pEC or hEC. The profound inhibitory effect of these EC on platelet aggregation was noted when ADP was used as the platelet agonist. However, this pattern of inhibition of platelet aggregation by EC was not observed when ADP-Î²-S was used as the agonist (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These data suggest that hydrolysis of ADP by ATPDase was responsible, at least in part, for the inhibitory potential of the EC.</p>

        <title>Characteristics of EC-associated ATPDase.</title>
        <p>The EC associated ATPDase activity was determined by biochemical and functional parameters. The vascular ecto-enzyme was confirmed to have E-type ATPDase activity as suggested by Plesner (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) based on identical substrate specificity for ATP and ADP, the strict Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence, and the patterns of ecto-enzymatic inactivation with various defined inhibitors (22; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The inhibitors for P-type plasma membrane ATPase (ouabain) and alkaline phosphatases (levamisole) had little effect on ATPDase enzymatic function, whereas sodium azide could block approximately half the activity. All enzymatic activities reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> are derived by subtracting values obtained with EGTA from those with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. </p>
        <p>The hydrolysis of radiolabeled ADP to AMP and consequent catalysis to adenosine by confluent, intact pEC was measured by TLC. ADP was rapidly degraded by the ectoenzyme associated with EC. AMP, and then adenosine, were generated during 30 min incubation with dipyridamole (10 Î¼M; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Adenosine appearance was probably associated with 5â² nucleotidase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These kinetic determinations were in concordance with those stated for the pEC ecto-enzyme as determined by another methodology (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>

        <title>Modulation of EC ATPDase Activity By TNFÎ± In Vitro.</title>
        <p>Activation of 10â50 ng/ml pEC or hEC by human recombinant TNFÎ± from 1 to 8 h, resulted in rapid loss of the EC antiaggregatory phenotype and the development of a permissive environment for platelet activation in response to the standard agonists in vitro (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). ATPDase activity, as determined by both [<sup>14</sup>C]ADP hydrolysis and inorganic phosphate release from ATP and ADP, showed comparable patterns of inhibition at the time intervals examined. A trend towards inhibition was observed as early as 30 to 60 min after TNFÎ± activation, and was maximal by 4 h; statistically significant differences between the ATPDase activities of the quiescent and TNFÎ± stimulated EC at 2 and 4 h were confirmed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p>
        <p>The reconstitution of EC antiplatelet aggregatory properties (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), observed after 18 h of TNFÎ± stimulation, was paralleled by ATPDase enzymatic activity to levels not statistically different to those in quiescent EC (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Expression of EC ATPDase after Cellular Activation In Vitro.</title>
        <p>The polyclonal antibody directed to peptide sequences from porcine aortic ATPDase did not react with ATPDase antigen as expressed by intact EC by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). However, this antibody did recognize denatured ATPDase from human EC lysates from quiescent and TNFÎ± stimulated cells analyzed by Western blotting. Using this technique, we did not observe either diminution of ATPDase antigen expression, or evidence for protein degradation, despite the reduction in enzyme activity in EC stimulated with TNFÎ± at 2 h. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>

        <p>Surface expression of CD39/ATPDase was confirmed by cytofluorometric analysis of human EC with antiâCD39 mAb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>b</italic>) in concordance with the surface biochemical activity demonstrated earlier (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). After stimulation of EC with TNFÎ± (10 ng/ml), the expression of CD39 epitopes, as determined by immunocytofluorometric analysis between 2 and 4 h, was largely unaltered. There were also no changes observed in the levels of surface CD39 staining when TNFÎ± activated EC were examined by immunocytochemistry (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Endogenous xanthine oxidase and other enzyme systems in pEC (e.g., NADPH oxidase) elaborate significant levels of reactive oxygen intermediates after cellular activation. For example, the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by pEC after activation with cytokines, such as TNFÎ±, is 0.015 nmol/min/10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In light of the patterns of ATPDase functional inhibition in the setting of pEC activation and the parallels with the modulation of thrombomodulin (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), we further evaluated the effects of exogenous oxidative stress on cellassociated ATPDase expression in vitro. As demonstrated by flow cytometry, the exposure of HUVEC to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 Î¼M) for 2 h did not alter the surface expression of CD39 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>

        <title>Effect of Oxidative Stress on pEC ATPDase Activity In Vitro.</title>
        <p>Although no differences in cell surface expression of CD39 were observed by flow cytometry following HUVEC activation, we tested the hypothesis that ATPDase enzymatic function could be inhibited by direct exposure to reactive oxygen intermediates. We observed that exogenous systems that generated oxidative stress and resulted in EC membrane lipid peroxidation (data not shown) could, in turn, significantly inhibit ATPDase activity in vitro. The reduced capacity of EC directly perturbed by oxidative stress to express ATPDase activity was demonstrated by both TLC analysis of radiolabeled ADP hydrolysis and by estimation of phosphate release from supplemental ADP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>a</italic>; Mann Whitney Rank Sum Test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Further, impressive evidence for the loss of ATPDase functional activity was also derived from the demonstration that EC exposed to oxidative stress rapidly became unable to inhibit platelet responses to ADP in vitro (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>

        <p>We next evaluated whether effective combinations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, or more novel antioxidants such as 21-amino-steroids (des-methyl tirilazad) could protect EC against TNFÎ±-mediated changes in ATPDase activity in vitro. The inhibition of ATPDase activity following TNFÎ± activation was consistently abrogated by the selected antioxidants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). SOD and catalase were also able to preserve pEC ATPDase activity following the addition of the exogenous oxidant systems (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>

        <p>In parallel experiments, the effect of a reducing agent, Î²-mercaptoethanol (5 and 10 Î¼M) on ATPDase activity was studied after TNFÎ± stimulation of pEC. Supplementation of pEC cultures with Î²-mercaptoethanol, before cellular activation, was as effective at maintaining enzyme activity as the antioxidant combinations.</p>

After 1 h of ischemia and 1 h of subsequent reperfusion, a marked reduction in staining was noted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>). In parallel, corresponding light microscopy showed that control glomeruli lacked neutrophils, whereas a considerable number of neutrophils associated with platelet deposits were noted after the episode of ischemia-reperfusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that the vascular ATPDase regulates both allogeneic and xenogeneic platelet aggregation in vitro, and that this activity is inhibited by EC activation and oxidant exposure. These processes are linked with ischemiareperfusion vascular injury. The modulation of ATPDase activity is observed with cytokine-mediated EC activation and the associated elaboration of oxidants, or may occur after direct cellular perturbation with reactive oxygen intermediates. Inhibition of ATPDase was abrogated, at least in part, by pharmacologically effective levels of the antioxidant agents tested. Similar beneficial effects on the maintenance of EC enzymatic activity were observed with the reducing agent Î²-mercaptoethanol. Comparable results have been described for nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase isozymes from the parasitic protozoan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> where enzyme activity has been found to be activated by dithiothreitol (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). From evaluating the experimental conditions, we have postulated that the observed inhibition of EC ATPDase functional activities could be directly linked to oxidative stress.</p>
      <p>Our observations regarding the ATPDase are comparable to those relating to the other antithrombotic molecules, the activity of which is lost from the surface of the EC after exposure to proinflammatory mediators. Thrombomodulin activity associated with the EC surface is inhibited following similar activation responses (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Additionally, oxidative injury in xenograft rejection has been shown to exacerbate the loss of heparan sulfate, observed after the activation of pEC by xenoreactive antibody and complement (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p>
      <p>Acetylhydrolase, the plasma enzyme that degrades platelet activation factor (PAF), is also rapidly inactivated by oxygen radicals (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, platelet activation, in the setting of oxidant stress, would be facilitated by the loss of EC ATPDase and would be further promoted by increased PAF. Both increased levels of PAF and the loss of the biological functions of ATPDase would tend to potentiate injury during vascular inflammatory events.</p>
      <p>ATPDases may be considered sensitive to oxidative stress reactions because of their localization within cellular membranes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The documented inhibition of vascular ATPDase activity after adriamycin-mediated injury to rat glomerular endothelium in vivo (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) could represent sensitivity of the ecto-enzyme to oxidative reactions. Further, the exposure of HUVEC to reactive oxygen metabolites has been shown to result in depletion of intracellular ATP; this effect was considered to result from the interference with extracellular catabolism of adenine nucleotides and reduced adenosine entry into cells, although mechanisms were not directly examined (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>
      <p>We were not able to demonstrate any changes in the levels of surface expressed CD39/ATPDase after either cytokine activation or oxidant perturbation of human EC where loss of ATPDase function had been demonstrated in parallel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). Additionally, no changes were observed in the ATPDase antigen levels in TNFÎ±-activated EC with the polyclonal antibody that was shown to recognize denatured protein of the same molecular size as the native ATPDase in Western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the early decrease in ATPDase activity is related to oxidative damage, and thus, inactivation of the ATPDase without apparent proteolytic degradation or immediate loss from the surface membrane of the EC.</p>
      <p>Several of our in vitro findings have been paralleled by in vivo observations. We have observed the loss of the vascular ATPDase activity following reperfusion type injury in rat kidneys where oxidative reactions are of central import. The process of vascular injury with organ reperfusion or during xenograft rejection (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) will result in the release of ATP and ADP from platelets and subendothelium (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Both ATP and ADP may activate neutrophils via purinergic type P<sub>2y</sub> receptors, while ADP triggers platelets through type P<sub>2t</sub> receptors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). ATPDase activity results in hydrolysis of these nucleotides to AMP, which is further degraded to adenosine. The latter modulates both platelet and neutrophil function through adenosine type 2 receptors. ATP and ADP also trigger PGI<sub>2</sub> and NO release via P<sub>2y</sub> receptors on the endothelium. ATP predominantly stimulates neutrophils via P<sub>2y</sub> receptors, and results in the increased release of reactive oxygen intermediates, which may have profound effects on platelet reactivity as mediated through PAF and NO (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In addition, such induction of oxidative stress by the neutrophils could result in the further inhibition of the ATPDases blocking the sequential degradation of ATP and ADP, and potentiating inflammation in the setting of EC activation.</p>
      <p>We have already confirmed that the vascular ATPDase has common identity with the previously described B cell activation marker designated as CD39 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); others have recently shown that CD39 has apyrase activity (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This membrane protein, CD39, has several potential targets for oxidative damage since the protein is rich in cysteine, methionine, and tyrosine residues (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
      <p>The direct relevance of CD39/ATPDase in transplantation biology and in other inflammatory vascular conditions must remain speculative at this time. It is our belief that rapid loss of ATPDase activity has an important pathogenetic role in the platelet deposition that occurs in the setting of graft preservation injury and with the repeated vascular insults associated with organ transplantation. The awareness that CD39 encodes the vascular ATPDase, and our findings above, may allow us to express CD39/ATPDase in such a manner that activity is not lost in an inflammatory environment.</p>

        <p>Effect of pEC on platelet aggregation induced by ADP and ADP-Î²-S (an ADP analog resistant to ATPDase activity). Platelets underwent comparable aggregation responses after stimulation with 1 Î¼M ADP and 5 Î¼M ADP-Î²-S. Addition of pEC abrogated platelet responses to ADP alone, but had minimal effects on ADP-Î²-S stimulated platelet aggregation. These data indicate a functional ATPDase associated with EC is responsible, at least in part, for the inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation in vitro.</p>

Activation of quiescent porcine EC by 10 ng/ml human recombinant TNFÎ± from 1 to 8 h in vitro resulted in rapid loss of the activated EC antiaggregatory phenotype at the time of testing. This was noted by the development of a permissive environment for platelet activation in response to 5 Î¼M ADP in vitro.
