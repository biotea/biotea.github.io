        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Protein N-glycosylation is a widespread post-translationalÂ modification. The first committed step in this process is catalysed by dolichyl-phosphateÂ N-acetylglucosamine-phosphotransferase DPAGT1 (GPT/E.C. 2.7.8.15). Missense DPAGT1 variants cause congenital myasthenic syndrome and disorders of glycosylation. In addition, naturally-occurring bactericidal nucleoside analogues such as tunicamycin are toxic to eukaryotes due to DPAGT1 inhibition, preventing their clinical use. Our structures of DPAGT1 with the substrate UDP-GlcNAc and tunicamycin reveal substrate binding modes, suggest a mechanism of catalysis, provide an understanding of how mutations modulate activity (thus causing disease) and allow design of non-toxic âlipid-alteredâ tunicamycins. The structure-tuned activity of these analogues against several bacterial targets allowed the design of potent antibiotics for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, enabling treatment <italic>inÂ vitro</italic>, <italic>in cellulo</italic> and <italic>inÂ vivo,</italic> providing a promising new class of antimicrobial drug.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0030">N-glycosylation of asparagine residues is a common post-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins, required for protein stability, processing, and function. Many diseases are associated with incorrect glycosylation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Freeze etÂ al., 2012</xref>). This process requires dolichol-PP-oligosaccharides that provide the oligosaccharides that are transferred (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>). The first step in dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide production involves the ER integral membrane enzyme dolichyl-phosphate alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-phosphotransferase (DPAGT1, E.C. 2.7.8.15, also known as GlcNAc-1-P Transferase [GPT]). It catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphoryl unit (GlcNAc-1-P) from UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) onto dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Heifetz and Elbein, 1977</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lehrman, 1991</xref>). The product GlcNAc-PP-Dol is anchored to the ER membrane by its dolichyl moiety and then monosaccharide units are added sequentially to build the N-glycan that is then transferred.<fig id="fig1"><label>FigureÂ 1</label><caption><p>Structural Features of DPAGT1</p><p>(A) Cartoon of DPAGT1 reaction.</p><p>(B) Michaelis-Menten kinetics, non-titrated substrate at 200Â Î¼M.

      <p id="p0035">Mutations in DPAGT1 impair protein N-glycosylation, leading to at least two syndromes, depending on the extent of loss of activity. Congenital myasthenic syndrome (DPAGT1-CMS OMIM ref: 614750) is a neuromuscular transmission disorder characterized by fatigable weakness of proximal muscles (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basiri etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belaya etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Iqbal etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Reduced endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and abnormal synaptic structure may be the result of incorrect glycosylation of AChR and other proteins. Mutations in DPAGT1 also cause congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ij (CDG-Ij, OMIM ref: 608093) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carrera etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Selcen etÂ al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wu etÂ al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">WÃ¼rde etÂ al., 2012</xref>), a more severe multisystem syndrome that can cause intellectual disability, epilepsy, microcephaly, severe hypotonia and structural brain anomalies.</p>
      <p id="p0040">Inhibition of polyisoprenyl-phosphate N-acetylaminosugar-1-phosphoryl transferases (PNPTs) such as DPAGT1 and the bacterial enzyme MraY, is lethally toxic to many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. <italic>Streptomyces</italic> bacteria exploit this toxicity by producing the PNPT inhibitor tunicamycin, which blocks MraY, a critical enzyme in biosynthesis of cell walls in many bacterial pathogens (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dini, 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, it also inhibits eukaryotic PNPTs, such as DPAGT1 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heifetz etÂ al., 1979</xref>) causing severe toxicity in eukaryotic cells. However, although bacterial (e.g., MraY) and human (e.g., DPAGT1) PNPTs are similar, it should be possible to design synthetically-altered tunicamycin analogues that specifically inhibit bacterial proteins.<fig id="figs1"><label>FigureÂ S1</label><caption><p>Biochemical and Biophysical Characterization of DPAGT1, Related to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref></p><p>(A) Cartoon of DPAGT1 showing the reaction it performs.</p><p>(B) Cartoon of MraY showing the reaction it performs.</p><p>(C) The identity of the substrate Dol-P and the product, GlcNAc-PP-Dol, was confirmed by mass spectrometry.

      <p id="p0045">Here we present structures of human DPAGT1 with and without ligands. The protein production methods, structures, assays and complexes are components of a âtarget enabling packageâ developed at the Structural Genomics Consortium (released June 2017, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thesgc.org/tep/DPAGT1" id="intref0010">http://www.thesgc.org/tep/DPAGT1</ext-link>), which has already been used by others (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yoo etÂ al., 2018</xref>). These structures, combined with mutagenesis and activity analysis, reveal both the mechanism of catalysis by DPAGT1 and the molecular basis of DPAGT1-related diseases. To improve the effectiveness of tunicamycin as a drug, we modified its core scaffold, <bold>TUN</bold>, using a scalable, semi-syntheticÂ strategy that enabled selective lipid chain addition. These analogues show nanomolar antimicrobial potency, ablated inhibition of DPAGT1, much reduced toxicity, allowed effective treatment of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) in mammals, providing leads for tuberculosis (TB) antibiotic development.</p>

        <title>DPAGT1 Activity and Architecture</title>
        <p id="p0050">To determine the structure of DPAGT1, we expressed both full-length wild-type (WT) DPAGT1 and the missense mutant Val264Gly in the baculovirus/insect cell system. The Val264Gly mutation is a variant found in some CMS patients (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belaya etÂ al., 2012</xref>), which improved crystallization behavior compared to WT. We tested the enzymatic activity of WT and Val264Gly DPAGT1 to confirm that the protein was functional. Product GlcNAc-PP-Dol was confirmed by mass spectrometry (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>C). WT DPAGT1 has an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 4.5 Â± 0.8Â Î¼M and a k<sub>cat</sub> of 0.21 Â± 0.007Â min<sup>-1</sup> towards UDP-GlcNAc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B, <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>); Dol-P displayed an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 36.3 Â± 7.2Â Î¼M and a k<sub>cat</sub> of 0.20 Â± 0.012Â min<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B). The Val264Gly mutant showed 2.5-fold higher activity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>D) and similar thermostability to WT protein (Tm<sub>1/2</sub> of 51.7 Â± 0.2 Â°C for WT and 50.4 Â± 0.3 Â°C for mutant, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>E, <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>, <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Adding the product analogue GlcNAc-PP-Und (equimolar to Dol-P and UDP-GlcNAc) reduced activity 3-fold, the addition of the other product, UMP, had no effect (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>F). Tunicamycin fully inhibited at 1:1 molar ratio with DPAGT1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>G). While both substrates thermostabilized WT and mutant DPAGT1 by 3â7 Â°C, tunicamycin thermostabilized both by more than 30 Â°C (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>E). Interestingly, phosphatidylglycerol co-purified with DPAGT1, even when not added to the purification, suggesting a role for phosphatidylglycerol in the stability of DPAGT1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>H and S1I).</p>
        <p id="p0055">The crystal structures of the WT DPAGT1 and Val264Gly mutant were solved by X-ray crystallography using molecular replacement with the bacterial homologue MraY (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chung etÂ al., 2013</xref>, PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4J72" id="intref0015">4J72</ext-link>, 19% identity) as an initial model (<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). The apo WT- and Val264Gly-DPAGT1 proteins gave structures to 3.6Â Ã and 3.2Â Ã resolution (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Complexes with UDP-GlcNAc and tunicamycin gave data to 3.1Â Ã and 3.4Â Ã resolution, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>AâS2E and <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). In the crystals DPAGT1 is a dimer formed through a crystallographic 2-fold axis (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>F), with an 1850Â Ã<sup>2</sup> interaction surface. The interface observed is similar to that seen in the <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yoo etÂ al., 2018</xref> structures, although in that case the crystals show a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Interestingly, comparison with the dimeric bacterial homologue MraY, showed that the surface that forms the dimer interface differs between DPAGT1 and MraY (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>G) (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yoo etÂ al., 2018</xref>). In solution, DPAGT1 exists predominantly as a dimer, as shown by native mass spectrometry, although the monomer was also detected (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>H and S2I). A Leu103Phe mutation introduced at the dimer interface to disrupt this interaction gave unstable protein, suggesting that DPAGT1 dimerization plays a role in stability. In the dimer interface the sidechains of Cys106 are adjacent, but no intermolecular disulfide bond was observed in our electron density maps (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>J). To assess the presence of this potential disulfide, DPAGT1 was purified without reducing agents and its mass matched only monomer (<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). No covalent, disulfide-bonded dimer was observed. We concluded that DPAGT1 exists predominantly as a non-covalent dimer in solution and that dimerization is important for its stability.<fig id="figs2"><label>FigureÂ S2</label><caption><p>Electron Density Maps, Heavy Atom Phasing and Dimer Interface Analysis for the Structure of Dimeric WT and Gly264Val Mutant of DPAGT1 Solved at Resolutions up to 3.2Â Ã, Related to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref></p><p>(A) Hg bound sites from a soaked crystal. 6Â Ã anomalous difference Fourier map calculated from a dataset collected from a crystal soaked with EMTS is contoured at 5Ï (purple) and 3Ï (magenta mesh) and overlaid on the final model.

        <p id="p0060">The DPAGT1 structure (as reported here and by <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yoo etÂ al., 2018</xref>) consists of 10 transmembrane helices (TMH1 to 10), with both termini in the ER lumen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D). Five loops connect the TMHs on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (CL1, -3, -5, -7, and -9), which form the active site, 3 loops on the ER side of the membrane (EL2, -4, -6) and one (EL8) embedded in the membrane on the ER side. DPAGT1 has a similar overall fold to MraY (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chung etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yoo etÂ al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E). A feature of the eukaryotic DPAGT1 PNPT family not found in prokaryotic PNPTs is a 52-residue insertion between Arg306-Cys358 in CL9, following TMH9. This motif adopts a mixed Î±/Î² fold with an extended structure with 2 Î²-hairpins, a 3-stranded Î²-sheet (CÎ²5-CÎ²7) and two amphipathic Î±-helices (CH2/CH3). This CL9 domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F) forms part of the substrate recognition site in human DPAGT1 but not in bacterial MraY (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>G).</p>
        <p id="p0065">The active site is on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, formed by the 4 cytoplasmic loops between the TMHs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). The long CL1 loop forms the âback wallâ; CL5 and CL7 form the base and the âside wallsâ are formed by TMH3-CL3-TMH4, TMH9b and the extended loop at the start of the CL9 domain (Ile297-Pro305). The entrance to the catalytic site, between TMH4 and TMH9b, is open and accessible from the lipid bilayer via a 10Â Ã wide cleft. Within the membrane, adjacent to the active site, there is a hydrophobic concave region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B), created by a 60<sup>Â°</sup> bend in TMH9 midway through the bilayer, which creates a groove in the DPAGT1 surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D).<fig id="fig2"><label>FigureÂ 2</label><caption><p>DPAGT1 Active Site</p><p>(A) The loops that form the active site; UDP-GlcNAc in magenta.</p><p>(B) Sliced molecular surface showing occluded active site cleft and putative Dol-P recognition groove.

        <title>Binding Mode for UDP-GlcNAc and Metal Ion</title>
        <p id="p0070">The structure of the DPAGT1/UDP-GlcNAc complex reveals an overall stabilization of the active site, due to movements of CL1 and CL9, and the N terminus of TMH4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C), without any global changes in conformation. The C-terminal end of TMH9b and the following loop region (Phe286-Ile304) display the largest conformational change with an induced fit around the GlcNAc-PP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p id="p0075">The uridyl moiety of UDP-GlcNAc lies in a narrow cleft at the back of the active site formed by CL5 and CL7. The uracil ring is sandwiched between Gly189 and Phe249 with additional recognition conferred by hydrogen bonds between the Leu46 backbone amide, the Asn191 sidechain to the uracil carbonyls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E) and an extensive hydrogen bond network involving two waters links the uracil ring to five residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E). Hydrogen-bonding of the ribosyl hydroxyls to the Gln44 mainchain carbonyl and Glu56 sidechain carboxylate complete the recognition of the uridyl nucleotide.</p>
        <p id="p0080">The pyrophosphate bridge is stabilized by interactions with Arg301 and by the catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). The Arg301 sidechain coordinates one pair of Î± and Î² phosphate oxygen atoms, whilst the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is chelated by the second pair of Î± and Î² phosphate oxygens. Each oxygen atom is thus singly coordinated in an Arg-Mg<sup>2+</sup>-âpyrophosphate pincer.â The octahedral coordination of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is completed by the sidechains of conserved residues Asn185 and Asp252, and 2 water molecules. Data from DPAGT1 co-crystallized with UDP-GlcNAc and Mn<sup>2+</sup> gave a single anomalous difference peak at the metal ion binding site, confirming the presence of a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the active site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). The position of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion differs by 4Â Ã from that observed in MraY unliganded structure and the co-ordination differs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chung etÂ al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0085">The GlcNAc moiety-binding site is formed by the CL9 domain and the CL5 loop, although all the direct hydrogen bond interactions are with the CL9 domain. The OH3 and OH4 hydroxyls of GlcNAc form hydrogen bonds with the sidechain of His302 and the mainchain amide of Arg303, respectively. The mainchain of residues 300â303 and the sidechain of Arg303 define the GlcNAc recognition pocket by specifically recognizing the N-acetyl substituent, forming a wall to the sugar-recognition pocket thatÂ appears intolerant of larger substituents, thereby âgatingâ substrate. This structure is absent in MraY, which has a much smaller CL9 loop.</p>
        <p id="p0090">Surprisingly, this structure does not support prior predictions that the highly conserved âaspartate richâ D<sup>115</sup>Dxx(D/N/E)<sup>119</sup> motif is directly involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding and/or catalysis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd etÂ al., 2004</xref>). This sequence is adjacent to the active site, but these residues do not directly coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup> or substrate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). Instead, Asp115 is hydrogen-bonded to Lys125 and Tyr256. Lys125 lies adjacent to the phosphates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D) and has been implicated in catalysis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Dabbagh etÂ al., 2008</xref>). Asp116 forms hydrogen bonds to Ser57 and Thr253 and N-caps TMH8, thus stabilizing residues that interact with the UDP ribosyl moiety (Glu56) and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Asp252). DPAGT1 with residues Asp115 and Asp116 mutated to Asn, Glu, or Ala retained at least 10% of WT activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A), suggesting they are not essential for catalysis. The third residue in this motif,Â Asn119, makes no significant interactions. Thus, 2 of theÂ 3 conserved residues perform structural roles; none are directly involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding or catalysis.<fig id="fig3"><label>FigureÂ 3</label><caption><p>Proposed DPAGT1 Catalytic Mechanism</p><p>(A) Relative activity of active site mutant residues; (n=9).</p><p>(B) UDP-GlcNAc complex active site structure with Dol-P modelled based on tunicamycin complex lipid chain position.</p><p>(C) Proposed DPAGT1 catalytic mechanism.</p><p>For all panels, data presented are means Â± SD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p>

The uridyl and GlcNAc moieties in tunicamycin and UDP-GlcNAc occupy essentially identical sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and 2H). In tunicamycin the pyrophosphate of UDP-GlcNAc is replaced by a galactosaminyl moiety, which displaces the Mg<sup>2+</sup> and interacts with the sidechains of Arg301, Asp252, and Asn185.</p>
        <p id="p0100">Tunicamycinâs mimicry of Dol-P also gave critical insight into the potential binding of co-substrate Dol-P. The lipid chain of tunicamycin occupies the concave groove that runs along TMH5, between helices TMH4 and TMH9a (see above). The sidechain of Trp122 pivots around its CÎ²âCÎ³ bond to lie over the lipid chain, trapping it in a tunnel. The surface beyond this hydrophobic tunnel, up to the EL4 loop on the ER lumen face of the membrane is highly conserved, so it is likely that the Dol-P lipid moiety could bind to this surface. At the other end of the tunicamycin lipid moiety, the amide forms polar interactions with Asn185 and lies close to Lys125, suggesting that the amide moiety partially mimics the phosphate head-group of Dol-P (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and 2H).</p>

        <title>The DPAGT1 Catalytic Mechanism</title>
        <p id="p0105">Alternative mechanisms have been proposed for the PNPT family including one-step, nucleophilic attack (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Dabbagh etÂ al., 2008</xref>) or two-step, double displacement via a covalent intermediate (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd etÂ al., 2004</xref>). We did not observe any covalent modification of DPAGT1 in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc, nor did we see release of UMP in the absence of Dol-P as might be predicted for a two-step mechanism. Also, the active site lacks suitably placed residues that could act as a nucleophile. Therefore the most probable mechanism involves direct nucleophilic attack by Dol-P phosphate oxygen atom on the phosphorus atom of the Î²-phosphate of UDP-GlcNAc, causing phosphate inversion and loss of UMP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C).</p>
        <p id="p0110">When bound to DPAGT1, UDP-GlcNAc adopts a bent-back conformation, with the donor sugar lying below the phosphates, rotated towards the uridine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). The pyranose ring is inclined so that the O6 hydroxyl of the GlcNAc is within 3.1Â Ã of the O5B atom of the Î±-phosphate. This orientation presents the Î²-phosphate of the UDP-GlcNAc to the position that would be occupied by the phosphate of the Dol-P, exposing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of its Î²-phosphate electrophile for reaction with the Dol-P phosphate <italic>O</italic>-nucleophile (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C).</p>
        <p id="p0115">Providing the correct geometry for this one-step phosphoryl transfer appears to be key to catalysis. Analyses of other enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions suggest that a bridging Arg (in a very similar position to Arg301) and bridging metals (in a very similar position to the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion) do not tighten the transition state but instead provide binding energy that optimizes geometry and alignment for attack (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lassila etÂ al., 2011</xref>). They may also preferentially favor the formation of trigonal bipyramidal geometry during nucleophilic attack. Similarly, despite classical emphasis on reducing electrostatic repulsions between anionic nucleophiles with anionic electrophiles, such as those present in phosphoryl transfer (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Westheimer, 1987</xref>), such effects are small in model systems (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lassila etÂ al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the role of Lys125, which would be close to the phosphate oxygens in Dol-P, would be mainly to guide the phosphate into position. The correct alignment of Dol-P for attack would be further facilitated by the âgripâ provided by Trp122 holding the Dol-chain into the tunnel observed in the tunicamycinâDPAGT1 complex.</p>
        <p id="p0120">Representative residues proposed to bind Dol-P, sugar and pyrophosphate were probed by mutagenesis. Mutation of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-chelating residues to Ala (Asn185Ala and Asp252Ala) reduced DPAGT1 activity to 1.2% and 7%, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). A conservative Asn185Asp mutation, expected to retain Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding activity, also ablated activity (0.7% of WT) suggesting an additional role for Asn185 in catalysis. The amide group of Asn185 lies withinÂ 4Â Ã of the predicted Dol-P phosphate-binding site, forming hydrogen bonds with the nucleophilic oxygen of Dol-P to guide itÂ towards the Î²-phosphate. Lys125 Mutations (Lys125Ala, Lys125Glu, and Lys125Gln) near the Dol-P phosphate binding site, all reduced the activity to below 2.2%, consistent with it playing a critical guiding role. Interestingly, an Asp252Asn mutation increased activity 5-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). This mutation removes a coordinating negative charge from the Mg<sup>2+</sup>, making it more electropositive and the Î²-phosphorus more electrophilic, potentially increasing its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack.</p>
        <p id="p0125">Mutation of His302, which hydrogen bonds to the O4 oxygen of GlcNAc in UDP-GlcNAc to hold it in its bent-back conformation, caused 98% loss of activity, consistent with it playing a role in aligning the nucleophile to attach the Î²-phosphate. Finally, mutations of Arg301, found in patients with CDG-Ij (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Imtiaz etÂ al., 2012</xref>), that is part of the âpyrophosphate pincerâ caused â¼95% loss of activity.</p>

        <p id="p0135">Many CMS patients have compound heterozygous mutations, and in general one allele had a much greater impact on DPAGT1 function, with either loss of at least 75% of the WT catalytic activity (Leu120Met, Gly192Ser, Met108Ile, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A, <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) or protein quantity (e.g., truncation: Thr234Hisfs<sup>â</sup>116, (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belaya etÂ al., 2012</xref>); low protein yield: Ile29Phe (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Klein etÂ al., 2015</xref>); exon skipping: Leu120Leu (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Selcen etÂ al., 2014</xref>). However, expressed protein from the second allele had 50% or more WT catalytic activity (Val117Ile, Pro30Ser, Val264Met) or even increased activity (Val264Gly and Gly160Ser, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belaya etÂ al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B, <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">TableÂ S1</xref>). The only homozygous CMS mutation, Arg218Trp (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basiri etÂ al., 2013</xref>), gave protein that was too unstable to purify. Patients with the more severe CDG-Ij disease often had significant loss of function for both alleles, with less than 25% activity (Leu168Pro, Tyr170Cys, Arg301His, Arg301Cys), low protein yield/stability (Ile29Phe), or disrupted splicing (with WT activity and thermostability for the purified protein, e.g., Ala114Gly, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">WÃ¼rde etÂ al., 2012</xref>). The Leu385Arg (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carrera etÂ al., 2012</xref>) and Ile69Asn (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Timal etÂ al., 2012</xref>) mutations are unusual in that they did not show loss of stability or activity, suggesting that splicing changes should be investigated.</p>
        <p id="p0140">As expected, mutations with less than 25% activity generally lie in or near the substrate-binding regions. In two variants found in patients with CDG-Ij (Arg301His and Arg301Cys, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carrera etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Imtiaz etÂ al., 2012</xref>), the Arg301 that âpincersâ the UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphates is mutated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2F) and these mutations gave reduced thermostabilization by UDP-GlcNAc (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D), confirming a role in UDP-GlcNAc binding. Similarly, the CMS variant Leu120Met lies close to the Dol-P/UDP-GlcNAc interface on the critical CL3 loop that forms one side of the active site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E) and the variant Gly192Ser (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belaya etÂ al., 2012</xref>) lies within the highly conserved CL5 loop in the uridyl recognition pocket (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E) where it would disruptÂ substrate binding. Two CDG-Ij mutations (Leu168Pro and Tyr170Cys, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Iqbal etÂ al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wu etÂ al., 2003</xref>) are of particular interest as they lie on the ER side of the membrane, at the top of the predicted Dol-P binding site, an extensive, conserved intramembrane groove between TMH4, TMH5, and TMH9, below the EL4 loop (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>F). Both mutations cause a reduction in thermostabilization by Dol-P, confirming their involvement in Dol-P binding. The Met108Leu mutation lies within a hydrophobic cluster in the core of DPAGT1 where a mutation would disrupt the positions of TMH4 and TMH5, which form the back of the Dol-P binding site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>F). Conversely, many of the mutations that maintain at least 50% of WT activity lie on the protein surface (e.g., Pro30Ser, Ala114Gly, Val117Ile) and involve small sidechain changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p id="p0145">Given that DPAGT1-CMS is a recessive disorder, we were surprised to find an increased enzymatic activity with the Val264Gly and Gly160Ser variants. Val264 is mutated to either Gly or Met (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Selcen etÂ al., 2014</xref>), giving either a 2.5-fold increase or a slight (18%) decrease in catalytic activity. Val264 is located on TMH8 in the core of the protein adjacent to TMH3/4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>G). Comparing the WT and Val264Gly structures showed a small (1â1.5Â Ã) movement at the C-terminal end of TMH4b towards TMH8 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>G), which would affect both the dimer interface and the exact position of EL4, which forms the top of the Dol-P lipid-binding site. Conversely, the Val264Met variant would be poorly accommodated at this buried site. As the Gly160Ser mutation lies in the disordered EL4 luminal loop (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>F), it is unclear why the activity increases. Since these missense variants cause an unexpected increase in enzyme activity, we explored other causes of pathogenicity. Tissue from muscle biopsies were unavailable, so we used the âexon trapâ system to detect abnormal RNA splicing. Both mutations, c.478G&gt;A, p.Gly160Ser, and c.791T&gt;G, p.Val264Gly, gave rise to abnormal RNA splicing of their respective RNA transcripts (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>), thus explaining the pathogenicity of these variants.</p>

          <title>A Molecular Explanation for Differences in TUN-X,X Analogue Binding to DPAGT1 and MraY</title>

The MraY tunicamycin binding site has a more open, shallow surface than in DPAGT1; in the latter the lipid tail is completely enclosed by Trp122 adjacent to the active site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>G). The MraY binding site has a disordered loop CL1, a longer TMH9 and a relatively short CL9 region, with only one short Î±-helix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>G). In contrast, DPAGT1 has an ordered CL1 which folds over the UDP-binding site. It has a shorter TMH9, followed by a loop and extended strand (residues Gln292 to Arg306) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F), which fold over tunicamycin, forming numerous interactions, (e.g., with Arg301, His302, Arg303, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and 2H). This extended structure is stabilized by its interactions with the rest of the CL9 domain, a feature found only in eukaryotes.</p>
          <p id="p0205">The N2â²â² in GlcNAc is the attachment site of the second lipid chain in <bold>TUN-X,X</bold> analoguesâit occupies distinct environments in the two proteins.

By contrast, in MraY, there is a 10Â Ã gap between Pro108 on TMH4a and Val272 on TMH9, providing ample space for more than one lipid chain to be attached to the amines in <bold>TUN-X,X</bold> analogues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>G and 6H).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0220">Structures of DPAGT1 allowed us to explain the mechanism of this key enzyme in protein N-glycosylation. We showed that missense variants in DPAGT1 associated with CMS and CDG-Ij alter DPAGT1 function via diverse mechanisms. For many cases of milder CMS disease, severely reduced activity from one allele is combined with an allele with partial activity. In two cases, Val264Gly and Gly160Ser, it appeared that errors in splicing reduced the levels of correct mRNA were partially compensated by 2-fold increases in enzymatic activity. In CDG-Ij, either one allele produces protein with 20% activity or, alternatively, two alleles producing 5%â10% activity, leading to much greater disease severity. In all cases some active protein is present, with a threshold of symptoms and increasing disease severity between no disease at 50% activity and severe disease withÂ 5%â10% of activity. It is significant that DPAGT1 activity can be increased by point mutations at single sites, suggesting it may be possible to increase enzymatic activity and/or modulate stability with small molecules, e.g., pharmacological chaperones (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Convertino etÂ al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¡nchez-FernÃ¡ndez etÂ al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0225">DPAGT1 is an âoff-targetâ for the natural bactericidal tunicamycin. Comparison of the human PNPT DPAGT1 and bacterial PNPT MraY structures revealed a gating loop (residues Cys299-Arg303) in DPAGT1 next to where the N-2â²â² atom of tunicamycin binds, that is absent in the more open structure ofÂ MraY. This difference allowed design of analogues <bold>TUN-X,X</bold> with two lipid chains targeted to bind MraY, but not DPAGT1. This circumvented the toxicity problem normally observed with tunicamycin. Additive modes of action against other carbohydrate-processing enzymes, such as <italic>Mtb</italic> WecA or TagO/TarO (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ishizaki etÂ al., 2013</xref>); (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Santa Maria etÂ al., 2014</xref>), may also be important for the effects of the analogues.</p>
      <p id="p0230"><italic>Mtb</italic> is responsible for â¼1.3 million deaths per annum with increasing spread of drug resistant strains requiring new strategies (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Young etÂ al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Zumla etÂ al., 2013</xref>). We have shown that the <bold>TUN-X,X</bold> lipid analogues have much lower toxicity than tunicamycin itself, are effective in killing <italic>Mtb inÂ vitro, in cellulo</italic>, and <italic>inÂ vivo</italic>. The analogues did show some toxicity in mice after more than 2Â weeks in diseased (but not healthy) animals, yet they are still much less toxic than tunicamycin. While these lead versions of the <bold>TUN-X,X</bold> lipid analogues are not as effective as the frontline drugs rifampicin and isoniazid in macrophages and in mice <italic>inÂ vivo</italic>, details of the effects in mice are often not recapitulated in humans. In addition, we do not yet have data on intracellular uptake in animals, which may be affecting the outcome.

          <p id="p0280">DPAGT1 point mutations were generated using three different methods. The CMS causing mutations were created using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to manufacturerâs instructions; the CDG-Ij causing mutations were generated using the two-step overlap extension PCR method, and the mechanistic mutations were created using the Megaprimer method of site-directed mutagenesis. In the first step of the two-step overlap extension PCR method, the 5â and 3â portions of DPAGT1 were amplified in separate reactions using LIC-adapted external primers with internal mutagenic primers. In the second step, the first round products were combined with the LIC-adapted primers to amplify the complete DPAGT1 gene, including the desired mutations. The Megaprimer method uses a single oligonucleotide primer containing each desired mutation was synthesized (Eurofins Genomics). A touchdown polymerase chain reaction, using the mutagenic internal primer and either a 5â or 3â external primer, was used to generate a âmegaprimerâ: a truncated gene fragment that contains the mutation. A second PCR reaction, using the megaprimer and the opposite external primer, was performed to generate the full-length mutated DPAGT1. The PCR products generated from the 3 different methods were then cloned into the pFB-LIC-Bse expression vector via ligase-independent cloning.

          <title>Purification of DPAGT1 protein for structural and functional studies</title>
          <p id="p0285">Cell pellets from 1 litre of insect cell culture were resuspended in 40ml in lysis buffer (50Â mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5Â mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200Â mM NaCl, 5Â mM imidazole, 2Â mM TCEP (added fresh), 5% glycerol, Roche protease inhibitors (1 tablet per 40ml buffer, added on day of use) in warm water, mixing constantly to keep the sample cold. Cells were lysed by two passes through an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Aventin). Protein was extracted from cell membranes by incubation of the crude cell lysate with 1% (w/v) OGNG and 0.1% (w/v) CHS for 1Â h at 4Â°C on a rotator. Cell debris and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 35,000Â g for 45Â mins. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography was then used to purify the detergent-solubilized His-tagged protein by batch binding to Co<sup>2+</sup> charged TALON resin (Clontech) at 4 Â°C for 1 h. The resin was then washed with wash buffer (WB: 50Â mM HEPES (pHÂ 7.5), 5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10Â mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 200Â mM NaCl, 2Â mM TCEP (added fresh), 5% Glycerol, 0.18% OGNG, 0.01 8% CHS, 0.0036% cardiolipin) and the protein was eluted with WB supplemented with 250Â mM imidazole (pH 8.0). The eluted protein was desalted using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (GFB: 20Â mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5Â mM MgCl2, 200Â mM NaCl, 2Â mM TCEP, 0.12% OGNG, 0.012% CHS, 0.0024% cardiolipin). Desalted protein was subsequently treated with 10:1 TEV protease (w:w, protein:enzyme) overnight at 4 Â°C. The TEV protease treated protein was separated from the 6-His-tagged enzymes and uncleaved DPAGT1 by incubation for 1Â h with Talon resin (prepared as described above) at 4 Â°C for 1h. The resin was collected in a column, the flowthrough collected and the protein sample was centrifuged at 21,500Â rpm in a Beckman TA25.5 rotor for 10Â min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was then concentrated to 0.5Â ml using a 30Â kDa cutoff PES concentrator (Corning), with mixing every 5Â mins during concentration. The concentrated protein was then centrifugated at 20,000Â g for 10Â min, then further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Sepharose S200 column (GE Healthcare) in GFB. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Sartorius 2ml PES 50Â kDa concentrator (pre-equilibrated with GFB without detergent), atÂ 3220 g. The protein was centrifuged at 20,000g for 15Â mins, then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The final concentration was 20-30Â mg/ml. Denaturing LC-MS was performed on purified protein obtained from each purification as described below. A mass of 46177Â Da was obtained for the WT protein, which matches the DPAGT1 monomer (with an additional N-terminal Serine residue from the TEV cleavage site). Similarly the Val264Gly mutated protein gave a mass of 46135 Da. Each mutated gene was sequenced and the purified protein was subjected to denaturing, intact mass spectrometry. In each case the predicted sequence and mass was observed for the mutated gene and protein. In all cases the monomer mass was observed, and there was no evidence for covalent, disulphide-linked dimers. When DPAGT1 was purified in the absence of reducing agents, the same monomer mass was observed. InÂ no case did we observe a peak with the mass of a covalent, disulphide-bonded dimer.</p>

Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water; solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade methanol (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). Initial conditions were 30% B at 0.5Â ml/min. After 1Â min a methanol gradient was applied from 30% to 95% over 7Â min. Elution was then isocratic at 95% B for 2Â min, followed by a further 2Â min equilibration at 30% B. Complete separation was achieved between detergent (elution 6.2-8.0Â min) and protein (elution 8.2-9.5Â min). The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion, 2 GHz detector mode. Source parameters were drying gas 350 Â°C, flow 12 l/min, nebulizer 60 psi, capillary 4000 V. Fragmentor was 250 V, collision energy 0Â V and data acquired from 100-3200 m/z.

          <p id="p0315">All data were collected at Diamond Light Source (beamlines I24, I04-1 and I04) to resolutions between 3.2-3.6Â Ã based on CC<sub>1/2</sub>=0.5 criteria. Data were processed, reduced and scaled using XDS (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and AIMLESS (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). All crystals belong to space group <italic>P</italic>6<sub>5</sub>22 and contain a single DPAGT1 monomer in the asymmetric unit with 70% solvent. Initial phase estimates were obtained using molecular replacement (MR). Briefly, an initial search model was built automatically using the PHYRE2 web server (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kelley etÂ al., 2015</xref>) based on the coordinates of the bacterial homolog MraY (19% sequence identity; PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4J72" id="intref0120">4J72</ext-link>). However, this simple homology model failed to produce any meaningful MR solutions when used in isolation in PHASER (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">McCoy etÂ al., 2007</xref>). The PHYRE model was then subjected to model pre-refinement using the procedures implemented in MR-ROSETTA in PHENIX (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Terwilliger etÂ al., 2012</xref>) and the resultant five best-scoring output models were trimmed at their termini and in the TMH9/TMH10 cytoplasmic loop region and superposed for use as an ensemble search model in PHASER. A marginal but consistent solution was obtained that exhibited sensible crystal packing in space group <italic>P</italic>6<sub>5</sub>22 but both the initial maps and model refinement were inconclusive. The model positioned using PHASER was converted to a poly-alanine trace and recycled into MR-ROSETTA, using model_already_placed=True option. The resultant MR-ROSETTA output model had an R/Rfree of 42/46 and the electron density maps showed new features not present in the input coordinates that indicated that the structure had been successfully phased.</p>
          <p id="p0320">Using the MR-ROSETTA solution as a starting point, the remaining regions of the DPAGT1 structure could be built manually using COOT (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Emsley etÂ al., 2010</xref>) using the WT 3.6Â Ã native data. However, the novel 52 amino acid cytoplasmic insertion domain between TMH9 and TMH10 was poorly ordered and proved difficult to trace. This region was primarily traced using the electron density maps for the UDP-GlcNAc complex as substrate binding results in partial stabilization of the TMH9/10 insertion domain. All electron density maps were sharpened in COOT to aid model building using a <italic>B</italic>-factor of -100Â Ã<sup>2</sup>. Sequence assignment was aided by using both mercury labelling of cysteines (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>A) and the sulphur anomalous signal from a dataset collected from UDP-GlcNAc complexes crystals at a wavelength of 1.7Â Ã (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>B). Anomalous difference maps, combined with anomalous substructure completion using PHASER-EP, clearly revealed the location of 18 of the expected 22 sulphur positions and helped to confirm the sequence register (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>B). Additional experimental phasing information was provided by a Pr<sup>3+</sup> derivative. The resultant model for the entire chain was then refined against both the unbound Val264Gly (3.2Â Ã), Val264Gly UDP-GlcNAc (3.1Â Ã), Val264Gly tunicamycin (3.4Â Ã) as well as the WT unbound (3.6Â Ã) data using BUSTER v2.10.2 / v2.10.3 and REFMAC (UDP-GlcNAc complex â final cycle only). All data were mildly anisotropic but were used in BUSTER without truncation apart from the unbound Val264Gly dataset which was anisotropically truncated with STARANISO using default cutoffs. Reference model restraints improved the refinement behavior for the 3.6Â Ã unbound WT structure (using the unbound Val264Gly model as the reference model). Ligand restraints were generated using the GRADE webserver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grade.globalphasing.org" id="intref0125">http://grade.globalphasing.org</ext-link>) and a single TLS group encompassing the entire protein chain was used in refinement. The presence of a single magnesium ion in the UDP-GlcNAc complex was verified using the anomalous signal from a dataset collected at 1.82Â Ã from a crystal grown in the presence of MnCl<sub>2</sub>. A single peak (19Ï) was observed in an anomalous difference Fourier map calculated at 4Â Ã adjacent to UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphate; the next highest peak corresponded to various sulphur atoms (5Ï). A second putative Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> site was identified between E94 and H270 on the luminal face (peak height 4.3Ï). Elongated lipidâlike density on the TMH1/6/7/10 face of DPAGT1 was modelled as a dioleoylphosphoglycerol (DOPG) lipid. This lipid feature was present in both the electron density maps of the WT structure (purified with DOPG added) and the various Val264Gly mutant structures (purified with cardiolipin). The presence of DOPG in the purified protein samples used for crystallization was detected by mass spectrometry (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>I). Lipid-like density was also present in the concave putative Dol-P groove adjacent to the EL4 luminal hairpin and has been modelled as unknown lipid/alkyl chains (UNL) in both the UDP-GlcNAc and TUN complexes. An additional persistent feature in all structures was electron density at the mouth of the active site adjacent to Trp122 (TMH4) and Leu293 (TMH9), presumably arising from a co-purified lipid that mimics the Dol-P substrate binding. However, the density was poorly resolved and no attempt was made to interpret this feature in the final models. The commercial preparation of TUN used for co-crystallization in this study is a natural product and contains a range of different aliphatic chain lengths (n=8-11). A chain length of n=9 was chosen for the modelled TUN as this appeared to most consistent with the observed electron density (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>E).</p>
          <p id="p0325">The representative final model comprises the entire polypeptide chain between residues Leu7 and Gln400 apart from the flexible EL2 loop connecting TMH2 and TMH3 and part of the poorly-ordered EL4 luminal hairpin (residue 152-161).</p>
