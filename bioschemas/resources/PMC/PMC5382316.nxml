      <abstract>
        <p>Human actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3), required for actin filament branching, has two ARPC1 component isoforms, with ARPC1B prominently expressed in blood cells. Here we show in a child with microthrombocytopenia, eosinophilia and inflammatory disease, a homozygous frameshift mutation in <italic>ARPC1B</italic> (p.Val91Trpfs*30). Platelet lysates reveal no ARPC1B protein and greatly reduced Arp2/3 complex. Missense <italic>ARPC1B</italic> mutations are identified in an unrelated patient with similar symptoms and ARPC1B deficiency. ARPC1B-deficient platelets are microthrombocytes similar to those seen in WiskottâAldrich syndrome that show aberrant spreading consistent with loss of Arp2/3 function. Knockout of <italic>ARPC1B</italic> in megakaryocytic cells results in decreased proplatelet formation, and as observed in platelets from patients, increased ARPC1A expression. Thus loss of ARPC1B produces a unique set of platelet abnormalities, and is associated with haematopoietic/immune symptoms affecting cell lineages where this isoform predominates. In agreement with recent experimental studies, our findings suggest that ARPC1 isoforms are not functionally interchangeable.</p>

  <body>
    <p>In eukaryotic cells, the monomeric ATP-binding protein globular actin (G-actin) is assembled into dynamic filamentous actin (F-actin) in cytoskeletal structures. This process involves a variety of actin-binding proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> that sequester/deliver actin monomers and facilitate the nucleation, elongation, capping, severing, depolymerization and crosslinking of F-actin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Disruption of these processes can result in dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is associated with metastatic cancer, autoimmune disorders and congenital defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In WiskottâAldrich syndrome (WAS) and X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), mutations in <italic>WAS</italic> (encoding WASP) cause microthrombocytopenia (that is, reduced numbers and size of blood platelets), immunodeficiency, eczema, increased malignancies and autoimmune symptoms including vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. WASP is one of several nucleation promoting factors that can promote branching of F-actin via the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3), which plays a central role in cell migration, endocytosis, vesicular trafficking and cytokinesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Cytoplasmic WASP has an auto-inhibited conformation that is activated due to phosphorylation of tyrosine 291 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) by the Rho family GTPases CDC42 (cell division cycle 42) and NCK1 (non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase 1). Activated WASP binds Arp2/3 with 2:1 stoichiometry by interacting with the ARP2, ARP3 and ARPC1 subunits, inducing conformational changes that facilitate binding of actin monomers and daughter filament growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
    <p>The mammalian Arp2/3 complex contains five unique components: ARP2, ARP3, ARPC2, ARPC3 and ARPC4, together with one molecule each of the isoform pairs ARPC1A and ARPC1B, and ARPC5A and ARPC5B. <italic>ARPC1A</italic> and <italic>ARPC1B</italic> are located in tandem on human Ch.7 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The isoforms they encode have 68% amino acid sequence identity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and both have six WD40 domain repeats predicted to form a Î²-propeller-fold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. ARPC1A has been implicated as a regulator of cell migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, while increased ARPC1B has been linked to oral squamous cell carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Independent of its function in Arp2/3, ARPC1B has also been identified as a centrosomal protein involved in mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Total loss of Arp2/3 function is embryonic lethal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, while its inhibition within cells blocks lamellipodia formation and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. To our knowledge no inherited human deficiency of ARPC1B or other Arp2/3 components has been previously reported.</p>
    <p>Here we describe three individuals from two families with homozygous mutations in <italic>ARPC1B.</italic> Patient 1 with p.Val91Trpfs*30 <italic>ARPC1B</italic> mutation that results in complete loss of ARPC1B protein and decreased Arp2/3 complex in platelets, leading to microthrombocytopenia, decreased platelet dense granules, defective platelet spreading with prominent filopodia but limited lammellipodia. The patient also has had repeated invasive infections, inflammatory bowel disease, leukocytoclastic vasculitis and eosinophilia. Patients 2 and 3 with a p.Ala105Val <italic>ARPC1B</italic> mutation that results in minimal ARPC1B protein in their platelets that are microthrombocytes with dense granule deficiencies and similar spreading abnormalities. Patient 2 has leukocytoclastic vasculitis and Patient 3 had intermittent eczematous-like rashes and both have eosinophilia. Thus ARPC1B deficiency in humans results in defective Arp2/3 actin filament branching that is associated with multisystem disease including platelet abnormalities, cutaneous vasculitis, eosinophilia and predisposition to inflammatory diseases.</p>

        <p>We investigated two independent families where patients presented early in life with failure to thrive, platelet abnormalities, eosinophilia, small vessel vasculitis, eczema and other indicators of inflammatory/immune disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâd</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, Clinical information). Whole exome sequencing (WES) of Patient 1 and his parents revealed homozygosity for a novel <italic>ARPC1B</italic> variant c.269_270dupCT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). This 2 base pair duplication produces a frame shift in exon 4, resulting in a premature stop codon predicted to truncate ARPC1B at amino acid 119. This would yield a product lacking five of the six WD40 repeat domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>) that form a Î²-propeller required for interaction of ARPC1B with mother actin filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. WES of Patient 2 and his parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>) identified homozygosity for two missense <italic>ARPC1B</italic> variants (c.314C&gt;T and c.712G&gt;A encoding p.Ala105Val and p.Ala238Thr) in this patient and a sibling (Patient 3). Both variants affect WD40 domains; c.314C&gt;T is novel and predicted to be deleterious while c.712G&gt;A is predicted to be neutral (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Patient 1's parents are consanguineous; thus we focused our initial genetic analysis on Mendelian autosomal recessive mutations. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data</xref>, there were no homozygous mutations in any known genes associated with primary immune deficiency, including WASP and WASP interacting protein (WIP), or platelet disorders that could explain the complex phenotype observed in Patient 1. Furthermore, we identified no overlapping compound heterozygous, X-linked, or<italic>de novo</italic> mutations shared between Patients 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We then focused on novel genes and examined known biological function, known diseases associated with genes, gene expression profiles and available animal models of the candidates described in the Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>. The critical role of ARPC1B in Arp2/3 function made <italic>ARPC1B</italic> a viable candidate for the WAS-like disease phenotype observed in both patients, and <italic>ARPC1B</italic> was the only mutated gene they had in common (see Methods, Identification of ARPC1B mutations). Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy of skin and intestinal biopsies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) indicated loss/reduction of ARPC1B expression in patients. Expression of ARPC1B and other Arp2/3 components in these patients was further studied in a readily accessible cell source provided by blood platelets.</p>

        <title>ARPC1B expression and Arp2/3 complex in platelets</title>
        <p>Expression of Arp2/3 components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) was examined in normal, unaffected family members and patient platelet lysates via immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3aâc</xref>), which showed the absence of ARPC1B in Patient 1, and greatly reduced levels in Patients 2 and 3. Platelet levels of other Arp2/3 components (ARP2, ARP3, ARPC2, ARPC3 and ARPC5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) were normal in all patients, and also in unaffected family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Recent proteomics data indicate that ARPC1A is present at &lt;6% of the level of ARPC1B in normal platelets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), with isoform levels and ratios differing considerably among cell/tissue types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We observed low expression of ARPC1A relative to ARPC1B in normal platelets, and increased ARPC1A in ARPC1B-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Since platelets lack nuclei, this indicates upregulation of ARPC1A in ARPC1B-deficient platelet precursor megakaryocytes (MKs). This parallels the reported upregulation of ARPC1B when siRNA was used to suppress expression of ARPC1A in HeLa cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The same study also reported, as we saw, that there was no effect of loss of ARPC1B on the expression of other Arp2/3 components.</p>
        <p>Native gel electrophoresis, which allows multiprotein complexes to be separated under non-denaturing conditions, was used to assess the presence of Arp2/3 in platelet cell lysates. Immunoblotting (IB) detected a band corresponding to Arp2/3 via probing for ARPC1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), ARP3 or ARPC5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). ARP3, ARP2 and ARPC2 were detected with ARPC1B when the Arp2/3 gel band was removed, resolved via denaturing SDSâPAGE, blotted and sequentially probed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, native gel electrophoresis of ARPC1B-null platelet lysate showed barely detectable Arp2/3 (detected via ARPC5 probing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, left panel). While ARPC1A was not detectable in Arp2/3 from normal platelets, it was detected in the low levels of Arp2/3 present in ARPC1B-null platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, right panel).</p>

        <title>Morphology of ARPC1B-deficient platelets</title>
        <p>Abnormally small platelets (microthrombocytes) in humans have previously only been observed in patients with WAS with complete loss of WASP expression, or in patients with XLT where WASP expression is impaired but not abolished<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. While both conditions are accompanied by thrombocytopenia and bleeding, XLT is associated with minimal or no immunodeficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Features of WAS including thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections and eczema were also observed in a patient with loss of WIP, where platelet volume was normal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. <italic>WAS</italic> knockout mice have moderate thrombocytopenia and normal-sized platelets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> while microthrombocytes are observed in mice with MK-specific knockout of the actin-binding protein profilin1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thin section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine platelets from the ARPC1B-null patient, a WASP-null patient and a normal donor. All had platelets containing typical cellular structures including mitochondria and Î±-granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). ARPC1B-null and WASP-null platelets showed a propensity towards small size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), and examination via IF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) confirmed these platelets to be small and dysmorphic compared to normal. A comparison of circumferential tubulin ring diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) confirmed that both ARPC1B-null and WASP-null platelets are significantly smaller than normal, and do not differ significantly from each other. ARPC1B-null platelets can thus be classified as microthrombocytes, as can ARPC1B-deficient platelets from Patients 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). A significant proportion (â¼20%) of ARPC1B-null platelets shared dysmorphic features with WASP-null platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>) that included odd shapes, collapse/loss of circumferential microtubule coils and highly variable P-selectin and thrombospondin-1 content (both indicators of Î±-granules). As has been reported for WAS platelets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, whole-mount TEM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> revealed a reduction/absence of calcium-rich platelet dense granules in ARPC1B-null and -deficient platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Clinical lumi-aggregometry analysis of platelets from Patients 1 and 2 confirmed decreased dense granule ATP release (0.16 and 0.19ânmol respectively; normal range 0.29â1.93ânmol). Platelet aggregation investigations with collagen, SFLLRN, arachidonic acid, ristocetin and ADP were normal for both patients.</p>

        <title>Spreading behaviour of ARPC1B-deficient platelets</title>
        <p>Actin rearrangements within cells can produce several types of membrane protrusions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Spindle-like filopodia are driven outwards by parallel actin filaments generated by formin protein family members<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, while broad lamellipodia involve branching of actin networks and elongation of filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Platelets spreading on a surface typically extend filopodia before producing lamellipodia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This process proceeds normally in WASP-deficient platelets, because the nucleation promoting factor required for activating Arp2/3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) during lamellipodia formation is WAVE/SCAR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> rather than WASP.</p>
        <p>We examined the consequences of ARPC1B deficiency for platelet spreading on fibrinogen-treated surfaces using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to monitor cell morphology and intracellular localization/distribution of tubulin, F-actin and Arp2/3 components. Comparisons of both washed platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) and platelets in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>) showed that maximally spread cells from normal donors formed typical near-circular lamellipodia. As expected from experimental observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, normal platelet lamellipodia had peripheral localization of F-actin and ARPC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), and also displayed prominent F-actin stress fibres and podosome-like nodules. In contrast, maximally spread ARPC1B-null and ARPC1B-deficient platelets typically formed spiky structures with tubulin-rich tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>) that contained fewer and often elongated F-actin fibres and showed little evidence of podosome-like nodule formation. The spread platelet surface area was significantly reduced in ARPC1B-null and -deficient platelets compared to normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Allowing ARPC1B-null and -deficient platelets more time to spread did not alter their observed behaviour. These observations indicate a profound loss of actin branching required for lamellipodia formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> in ARPC1B-deficient platelets, despite their increased ARPC1A content. This is consistent with experimental observations that isoforms of Arp2/3 containing ARPC1B are significantly better than complexes containing ARPC1A at promoting the rapid assembly of stable branched actin networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>

        <title>Proplatelet formation in ARPC1B knockout megakaryocytic cells</title>
        <p>The formation of proplatelets by MKs is a key stage in platelet development, which can only proceed to completion in the presence of shear flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The actin cytoskeleton has been linked to the adhesion of proplatelet-forming MKs to the extracellular matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and in the bifurcation of proplatelets, which increases the number of tips that give rise to platelets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Reduced platelet size and thrombocytopenia are the most common findings in WAS and XLT patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The cellular mechanisms of WAS-associated microthrombocytopenia are not fully understood. Bone marrow MK numbers are normal in most WAS patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, but proplatelet formation may occur prematurely, hampering platelet release into the bloodstream<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Peripheral destruction of platelets in the spleen may also be involved, since splenectomy can correct platelet count and size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p>
        <p>We observed adequate MK numbers and normal morphology in a bone marrow biopsy sample from Patient 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). This indicates that MK depletion is not a cause of thrombocytopenia, although the possibility of abnormal proplatelet formation cannot be ruled out. Platelet counts were always low in Patient 1, low (for example, 79 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>âl<sup>â1</sup>) to normal in Patient 2, and normal in Patient 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The microthrombocytes we observed in all three patients suggest that decreased ARPC1B in MKs affects the cytoskeletal dynamics of platelet formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> sufficiently to influence platelet size. The thrombocytopenia observed in Patient 1 indicates that total loss of ARPC1B leads to depression of platelet production and/or increased clearance.</p>
        <p>To explore the potential impacts of loss of ARPC1B expression on platelet production by ARPC1B-null MKs, we used imMKCL cells, a stable immortalized MK progenitor. Unlike most megakaryocytic cells, imMKCL cells can be stimulated by thrombopoietin to generate proplatelet-producing cells in culture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. imMKCL lines lacking functional <italic>ARPC1B</italic> were made using CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletion. Loss of ARPC1B expression in an <italic>ARPC1B</italic> knockout line was confirmed via IB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>), which also detected increased ARPC1A expression relative to wild-type cells, paralleling our observations in ARPC1B-null platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We examined the abilities of thrombopoietin-induced wild-type and ARPC1B-null imMKCL cells to form proplatelet-like extensions in culture, and observed that ARPC1B knockout cells formed proplatelets much less frequently than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>). In addition, while some wild-type imMKCL cells were observed to form multiple proplatelets containing tubulin and branched actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>), this was not seen in ARPC1B-null cells.</p>
        <p>It is likely that the decreased ability of ARPC1B-null imMKCL cells to form proplatelets in culture reflects a similar phenotype in ARPC1B-null MKs, resulting in the thrombocytopenia seen in Patient 1. Since the generation of normal platelets cannot be studied in culture, as the bloodstream is required for final maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions from this experiment regarding the presence of small platelets with structural abnormalities observed in our patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). It is reasonable to propose that MKs with altered actin dynamics produce small and dysmorphic platelets, and/or that platelets with altered actin dynamics have increased susceptibility to deformation as they circulate. Our results indicate that, as we observed with platelet spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>), upregulation of ARPC1A in ARPC1B-null imMKCL cells had little or no effect on restoring Arp2/3 functions required for proplatelet formation. This is in keeping with what we would expect to see in proplatelet formation in the absence of ARPC1B.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The Arp2/3 complex is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and essential for the survival of multicellular organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. It has been reported that ARPC1B is both an activator and substrate of Aurora A kinase which is critical in the maintenance of mitotic integrity in mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Our results indicate that near-complete loss of ARPC1B expression results in platelet abnormalities including microthrombocytes and spreading defects, and also eczema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, eosinophilia and elevated IgA and IgE. Elevated IgE levels are also seen in hyper IgE immune deficiency syndrome patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, where the pathological effects of elevated IgE are poorly understood but likely involve several immune pathways, including increased Th2 cytokine production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. ARPC1B-deficient Patients 2 and 3 have normal platelet numbers, while ARPC1B-null Patient 1 has persistent thrombocytopenia. Our experiments with imMKCL cells indicate that this is likely linked to decreased proplatelet production by ARPC1B-null MKs. It may also be that these patients have increased rates of peripheral platelet clearance as observed in WAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, which may be associated with their elevated IgA levels. If so, this would exacerbate the consequences of low platelet production by ARPC1B-null MKs.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that ARPC1B deficiency is associated with severe multisystem disease including recurrent infections, inflammatory changes in the intestine (crypt distortion with severe eosinophilic infiltration) and elevated autoimmunity markers (anti-nuclear and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This multi-system pathology is similar to that produced by complete loss of WASP expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and it is consistent with the predominant expression of ARPC1B in haematopoietic/immune cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These include B- and T-lymphocytes (including T-regulatory cells and natural killer cells), antigen-presenting dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. All of these cells require coordinated actin dynamics for development, migration, recruitment, signalling and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.</p>
      <p>We observed considerable heterogeneity in the manifestation of disease among the patients we studied. All three had failure to thrive, platelet abnormalities, eosinophilia, eczema and other indicators of inflammatory/immune disease including elevated IgA and IgE, and anti-neutrophil autoantibodies. Only Patient 1 had chronic infections and colitis. Patient 3 had a history of eczema-like rash from birth, although not severe enough to be biopsied, and it is unclear if underlying vasculitis is associated with this rash, as was seen in Patients 1 and 2. In addition to <italic>ARPC1B</italic> mutations, there are likely to be other genetic and/or environmental factors associated with the different disease phenotypes observed among patients. It is nevertheless tempting to propose that as with thrombocytopenia, the milder immune manifestations observed in Patients 2 and 3 may be attributable to their residual ARPC1B expression compared to Patient 1. This would parallel the milder phenotype observed in XLT that is attributed to residual WASP expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
      <p>As with WAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, many questions remain regarding the mechanisms associated with the abnormalities we have observed in patients with absent/reduced ARPC1B expression. Our observations that the loss of ARPC1B has profound consequences for platelet spreading, and most likely for MK proplatelet production, are consistent with cellular phenotypes that would be expected with the loss of Arp2/3 function in these cells. The effects of ARPC1B loss would presumably be most severe in cells/tissues where it is the predominant isoform present in functional Arp2/3, since as we observed in platelets and MKs, compensatory upregulation of ARPC1A has little effect. This is likely due to cell lineage-specific variations in Arp2/3 assembly and/or function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
      <p>While it is difficult to connect our experimental observations to the entire spectrum of disease observed in ARPC1B-deficient patients, Arp2/3-driven actin polymerization has recently been reported to be essential for several relevant cellular, physiological and developmental processes. These include cell secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, phagocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, haptotaxis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>, focal adhesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> and intracellular tight junctions required for epidermal barrier formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>, vesicle trafficking and transcytosis in the small intestine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. With regards to immunity and inflammation, Arp2/3 function has been reported to be critical for the formation of immune cell synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> and T-regulatory cell function, which is aberrant in WAS patients leading to a high susceptibility to develop Th2-mediated food allergies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Genetic correction of induced pluripotential stem cells from WAS patients demonstrated the restoration of defective natural killer and T-lymphoid cell development and function, confirming the critical role of WASP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Given the central role that Arp2/3 plays in so many processes, it is reasonable to expect that ARPC1B deficiency may be associated with a broad range of developmental and immune defects. Our results also point to the possibility that gene variants affecting other Arp2/3 components may be associated with human disease.</p>

Exome library preparation was performed using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq RDY Exome Kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. In brief, 100âng of DNA quantified by Qubit DNA HS or BR assay was used in the target amplification under the following conditions: 99âÂ°C for 2âmin, followed by ten cycles at 95âÂ°C for 15âs and 60âÂ°C for 16âmin, and final hold at 10âÂ°C.

The <italic>ARPC1B</italic> variant for which Patient 1 is homozygous is a two base pair duplication (c.269_270dupCT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>) causing a frame shift in exon 4 at position 91 and a premature stop codon, with a predicted truncated 119 amino acid protein lacking five of the six WD40 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>) required for formation of the functional p40/ARPC1 Î²-propeller<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. c.269_270dupCT is a novel variant and the only one predicted to cause loss of function by RefSeq version 105v2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>); it was validated by Sanger sequencing and independent WES.</p>
        <p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. WES of Patient 2 and parents resulted in the identification of 51,866 variants. In all, 35,114 were considered high quality, passing thresholds for genotype quality and read depth. A total of 1,704 were considered rare variants with a minor allelic frequency less than 1% (MAF&lt;0.01; see above). In all, 676 variants were predicted to be damaging as they were classified as missense mutations or caused loss of function. From this list we identified nine non-synonymous homozygous variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data</xref>) inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Two homozygous <italic>ARPC1B</italic> missense variants were found near the same region of the mutation identified in Patient 1 (c.314C&gt;T and c.712G&gt;A encoding p.Ala105Val and p.Ala238Thr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Analysis using the ExAC, NHLBI, ESP and 1,000 Genomes databases revealed the c.712G&gt;A variant to be rare and predicted to be benign, while c.314C&gt;T is novel and predicted to be damaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), disrupting the second ARPC1B WD40 domain and thus the p40/ARPC1 Î²-propeller. Both variants were validated using Sanger sequencing.</p>
        <p>Patient 1's parents are consanguineous, and he has a very severe and complex disease. Therefore we focused our initial genetic analysis on Mendelian autosomal recessive mutations with a homozygous inheritance pattern that could explain his disease. As shown in Supplementary Data no homozygous mutations were detected in predicted pathogenic variants for known genes associated with immune deficiency (including WASP and WIP) or platelet disorders. Also, no overlapping compound heterozygote mutations, X-linked mutations, or <italic>de novo</italic> mutations were shared by Patient 1 and Patient 2. We then focused on novel genes and examined known biological function, known diseases associated with genes, gene expression profiles and available animal models of the candidates outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>. The only gene that fit the disease profile observed in Patient 1 was <italic>ARPC1B,</italic> since the role of ARPC1B as the WASP-binding component of the Arp2/3 complex pointed to a WAS-like phenotype. In Patient 2, with a similar spectrum of disease, WES also identified <italic>ARPC1B</italic> as the only viable candidate, and this was the only gene found to be mutated in both Patients 1 and 2 (see Venn diagram <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Vasculitis pathology and description of <italic>ARPC1B</italic> variants in patients.</title>
        <p>Patient 1 (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>c</bold>) and Patient 2 (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) developed skin lesions associated with small vessel vasculitis. Patient 1 (<bold>a</bold>) had a complicated ulcerating lesion after a skin biopsy preceded by the more typical skin lesions seen in Patient 2 (<bold>b</bold>). Images <bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold> are not included in the Creative Commons license for the article. Small vessel vasculitis was confirmed by skin biopsies (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>); arrowheads indicate: (1) epidermis, (2) dermalâepidermal junctions, (3) dermis. At low magnification (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>, left panels) areas of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (4) were evident, which at higher magnification (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>, right panels) showed vessel wall destruction (5) and neutrophil infiltration (6). (<bold>e</bold>) <italic>ARPC1B</italic> is located on Chromosome 7 (position numbering relative to GRCh37), immediately preceded by <italic>ARPC1A</italic>. (<bold>f</bold>) Nucleotide positions of identified mutations (black arrows) relative to <italic>ARPC1B</italic> coding exons (accession #: NM_005720.3). Patient 1 is homozygous for c.269_270dupCT, Patient 2 is homozygous for two missense variants (c.314C&gt;T and c.712G&gt;A). (<bold>g</bold>) ARPC1B has 6 WD40 repeat domains forming a Î²-propeller required for Arp2/3 complex function. The amino acid change caused by the mutation in Patient 1 causes a frame shift predicted to yield a protein lacking the last five WD40 domains; both mutations carried by Patient 2 affect WD40 domains.

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) A comparison of platelet circumferential ring diameter distributions for all three ARPC1B mutant patients (P1, P2, P3) and a WASP-null patient (WAS) shows that all are significantly smaller (that is, microthrombocytes) compared to platelets from a normal donor (NC; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>n</italic>=57 platelets, means and 95% confidence intervals shown by bars). No significant differences were observed among patients.

        <title>Abnormal spreading of ARPC1B-deficient platelets on fibrinogen.</title>
        <p>Washed platelets were allowed to spread on fibrinogen-treated coverslips for 45âmin prior to fixation and imaging by SEM (right column; bars=2âÎ¼m), or by spinning disc laser fluorescence confocal microscopy (left columns; 3D renders of deconvolved z-series, bars=1âÎ¼m) after surface staining with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; red), staining for F-actin with phalloidin (green) and immunostaining for alpha tubulin (magenta). Maximally spread platelets from a normal donor (top row) typically show fully formed lamellipodia with thin tubulin filaments and multiple F-actin filaments intersecting with podosome-like actin nodules. In contrast, maximally spread platelets from both ARPC1B-null (middle row) and ARPC1B-deficient (bottom row) patients tend to form spiky filopodial-lamellipodial structures lacking podosomes that sometimes show elongated actin filaments (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

        <p>Platelets in platelet-rich plasma were allowed to spread on fibrinogen for 30âmin before fixation, staining and imaging by laser fluorescence structured illumination microscopy. (<bold>a</bold>) Each set of panels shows a wide field image (bars=5âÎ¼m) and (<bold>b</bold>) higher magnification images of representative spread platelets stained for CD61/fibrinogen receptor (red), ARPC5 (green) and F-actin (magenta; bars=2âÎ¼m). Most normal platelets show circular lamellipodia, peripheral ARPC5 and F-actin present at the lamellipodial edge and in stress fibres and nodules (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, at his time point many ARPC1B-null platelets (from Patient 1) have not spread, or show abnormal shapes and subcellular distributions of ARPC5 and F-actin (note: close up panels are collages necessitated by the sparse distribution of spread platelets; all others are cropped fields). ARPC1B-deficient platelets (from Patient 2) also show limited spreading and unusual spread morphologies, including extremely long filopodia containing long unbranched actin fibres.</p>
