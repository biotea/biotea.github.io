<italic>O</italic>-linked N-acetylglucosamine glycosylations (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc) and <italic>O</italic>-linked phosphorylations (<italic>O</italic>-phosphate), as two important types of post-translational modifications, often occur on the same protein and bear a reciprocal relationship. In addition to the well documented phosphorylations that control Akt activity, Akt also undergoes <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, but the interplay between these two modifications and the biological significance remain unclear, largely due to the technique challenges. Here, we applied a two-step analytic approach composed of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc immunoenrichment and subsequent <italic>O</italic>-phosphate immunodetection. Such an easy method enabled us to visualize endogenous glycosylated and phosphorylated Akt subpopulations in parallel and observed the inhibitory effect of Akt <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations on its phosphorylation. Further studies utilizing mass spectrometry and mutagenesis approaches showed that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations at Thr 305 and Thr 312 inhibited Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 via disrupting the interaction between Akt and PDK1. The impaired Akt activation in turn resulted in the compromised biological functions of Akt, as evidenced by suppressed cell proliferation and migration capabilities. Together, this study revealed an extensive crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt and demonstrated <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation as a new regulatory modification for Akt signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is a central node in cell signaling downstream of growth factors, and regulates diverse cellular biological functions including cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Aberrant loss or gain of Akt activation underlies a variety of human diseases, including diabetes and cancer <xref rid="pone.0037427-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037427-DeBerardinis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Because of the important roles of Akt signaling in cancer, this pathway has been an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer drugs. However, as Akt signal is also important for normal cell functions, targeting Akt is likely to raise serious side effect. Thus, the comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanism of Akt signaling will be of importance to design better therapeutic strategies <xref rid="pone.0037427-Hennessy1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Posttranslational modifications (PTM) often play important roles in regulating protein functions <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-SimsRJ1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In response to growth factor stimulation, Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane, and phosphorylated at Thr 308 by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) <xref rid="pone.0037427-Alessi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and Ser 473 by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) <xref rid="pone.0037427-Alessi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Sarbassov1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, respectively. The two phosphorylations are required for the full activation of Akt <xref rid="pone.0037427-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Conversely, the dephosphorylation leads to the termination of Akt activity. The Thr308 phosphorylation is dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) <xref rid="pone.0037427-Millward1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Arroyo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and the Ser473 phosphorylation is removed by the PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) <xref rid="pone.0037427-Brognard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To date, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanism has been thought to primarily control Akt signaling, but other posttranslational modifications associated with Akt activity remain poorly known. Until recently, two new modifications of Akt, monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination, were reported, which were related to the activation and degradation of Akt, respectively <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Suizu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Protein <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic posttranslational modification at serine or threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, and competes with phosphorylation at the same or proximal sites. The interplay between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and <italic>O</italic>-phosphate has been implicated in regulating protein function and plays an important role in the aetiology of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cancer <xref rid="pone.0037427-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037427-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition to phosphorylations, Akt also undergoes <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification <xref rid="pone.0037427-Vosseller1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since its discovery almost one decade ago, Akt has become one of the most frequently investigated <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated target proteins. In spite of the extensive studies, the relationship between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt appears controversial <xref rid="pone.0037427-Vosseller1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037427-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For instance, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc treatment suppressed the phosphorylation at Thr 308 <xref rid="pone.0037427-Vosseller1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which, however, failed to be recapitulated by other two selective <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcase inhibitor, NButGT and 6-Ac-Cas <xref rid="pone.0037427-Macauley1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Macauley2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These discrepancies indicate that caution should be taken when cells are treated with <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcase inhibitors or subjected to OGT overexpression, because ambiguous results might be obtained and may complicate analyses of the crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. <xref rid="pone.0037427-Slawson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037427-Kohler1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A recent report described a mass-tagging strategy using polyethylene glycol tag for <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc study, and showed that the difference of the phosphorylation level between the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of a given protein could reflect the impact of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation on phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0037427-Rexach1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Based on this conceptual breakthrough, we designed a new antibody-based approach to directly investigate this crosstalk independent of the chemical labels. Using this method in combination with mass spectrometry and Tyr residue simulated <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications, we revealed an extensive and complex crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt, showing that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations of Akt at Thr 305 and 312 inhibited its phosphorylation at Thr 308 by disrupting the interaction between Akt and PDK1. Our data suggest that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation represents a new regulator for Akt.</p>

        <p>To investigate the interplay between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and <italic>O</italic>-phosphate modifications of Akt, we applied a two-step analytic approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g001">

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the method for characterization of the interplay between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and <italic>O</italic>-phosphate of Akt. The proteins in the cell are first divided into two pools by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc immunoprecipitation: the un-GlcNAcylated and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated proteins subpopulations.

<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations at Thr 305/312 Suppress Akt Phosphorylation at Thr 308 via Disrupting its Interaction with PDK1</title>
        <p>Distinct from other post-modifications like phosphorylation, methylation and acetylation, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation presents a large volume of modification. The presence of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations has been known to generate the bulky steric hindrance and result in the alteration of local conformation. We reasoned that substitution of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-modified Thr residue with amino acids with the relatively large volume of side chain, e.g. Tyr, would likely simulate the inhibitory effect of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation. To test the possibility of this hypothesis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the two <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification sites at Thr 305 and 312 substituted by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc or Tyr residue, based on the X-ray crystal structure of AKT1 <xref rid="pone.0037427-Lippa1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. For <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications, the MD simulations suggested that the interactions between the phosphothreonine and His194 in the Î±C helix, Arg 273 in the catalytic loop and Lys 297 in the activation loop (A loop) were not preserved any more in both <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-modified Akt, as compared to wild-type Akt. Meanwhile, the Î±C helix rotated outward and the A loop refolded in the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications, partially similar to the dephosphorylated conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g003">
<bold>Fig.3A and B</bold>
</xref> in green). For Tyr substitutions, the modeling results indicated that Tyr 305 H-bonded with Asp325, and Tyr312 H-bonded with Asp 274 and Lys 276, similar to the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g003">
<bold>Fig. 3A and B</bold>
</xref> in pink). Therefore, these results indicated that it was possible that the local conformational alterations caused by Tyr substitutions were similar to that caused by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications and the steric hindrance effect of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations at Thr 305 and 312 could, to some extent, be mimicked by Tyr residue.</p>

We observed that all the mutants and wild-type Akt translocated to the plasma membrane within 15 min after IGF-1 stimulation. Indeed, we detected the increased membrane localization of both T305Y and T312Y mutants compared to wild-type Akt and the T305A and T312A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g004">

        <p>Next we investigated whether <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations at Thr 305 and 312 affected the interaction between PDK1 and Akt. The coimmunoprecipitation results showed that T305Y and T312Y mutants had the considerably decreased interaction with PDK1 compared to wild-type Akt, T305A and T312A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g004">

Thus, these studies suggested that the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations at Thr 305 and Thr 312 likely blocked the access of PDK1 to Thr 308 of Akt and suppressed the subsequent phosphorylation at Thr 308. Together, these results suggested that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications at Thr 305 and 312 were associated with the inhibition of the Thr308 phosphorylation through disrupting the interaction between Akt and PDK1.</p>

</xref>). Thus, it was likely that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations at Thr 305 and 312 could directly regulate the biological functions of Akt. Together, our results indicated that abnormal <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications at Thr 305 and Thr 312 could down-regulate the normal activity and functions of Akt.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although the crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation is getting increasing attention as an important regulatory mechanism, the progress in understanding this crosstalk has been highly hindered by the technique challenges. Here, we provided a useful approach for decoding this important interplay of an endogenous protein. While our strategy, to some extent, echoed a recent work by Rexach <italic>et al</italic>, which successfully visualized the interplay of a specific protein by introducing a chemical mass tag <xref rid="pone.0037427-Rexach1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, our method exhibited two evident features. Firstly, it was more simplified by employing only commercially available antibodies and routine laboratory techniques, independent of techniquely-challenging manipulations such as chemical synthesis and mass spectrometry; Secondly, the immuno-enrichment application using an <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody allowed us to analyze <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated proteins in a very low abundance. This feature became essential in the case of Akt where only a very small portion of Akt got <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcated, as consistently observed in this study and previous reports <xref rid="pone.0037427-Vosseller1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, it was also deserved to be emphasized that the same level of total Akt between the glycosylated and unglycosylated fractions was determined prior to the comparison of the phosphorylation levels, as it made the accurate and straightforward comparison afterwards become possible. In addition to <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, crosstalks between different types of PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation have been widely observed as the regulatory mechanism of PTMs <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang5" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037427-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We believe our approach provides a simple and effective technique option for understanding these processes by solely applying the different pan- or specific- antibodies.</p>
      <p>In this study, we applied a tyrosine residue with large volume of side chain to simulate the bulky steric hindrance of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, which enabled us to explore the interplay between the site-specific <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations. Such a strategy was supported by our molecular modeling analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g003">
<bold>Fig. 3</bold>
</xref>), showing that substitution of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-modified Thr residues with Tyr would likely simulate the steric hindrance of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, though we have been aware of the structural difference between Tyr and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc. It is conceivable that this strategy is particularly useful to study the impact of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations on other modifications occurring on the adjacent residues. Importantly, we have validated this strategy by testing the two reported <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated proteins, p53 <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang6" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and Snail1 <xref rid="pone.0037427-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The Tyr mutants at <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation sites of both p53 and Snail1 showed significantly reduced phosphorylation occurring on adjacent residues, as compared to wild type (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037427.s001">Fig. S1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037427.s001">S1B</xref></bold>). By using T305Y and T312Y mutants of Akt, we observed that the two mutants reduced phosphorylation levels at Akt Thr 308, consistent with the findings of endogenous <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-modified Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037427-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1</bold>
</xref>), further strengthening the credibility of the Tyr mutation strategy in this scenario. Although well-validated in our study, caution should be taken when applying this approach to study the functions of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modifications in a broader context.</p>
      <p>Termination of a signal transduction is as essential as the activation for all signaling pathways, since the sustained hyperactivation will be detrimental to the normal physiological function <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In response to growth factor stimulation, Akt is activated and the phosphorylated Akt translocates to multiple subcellular organelles and interacts with over 130 substrates of Akt to transduce the signal to a variety of cellular processes <xref rid="pone.0037427-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Accordingly, the organisms have evolved multiple regulatory mechanisms to terminate the signal transduction of Akt, mainly including dephosphorylation by phosphatases <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037427-Brognard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and degradation by proteasome <xref rid="pone.0037427-Suizu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Here, we demonstrated <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification as a new regulatory mechanism for attenuating Akt activity and functions, which advanced our understanding of the Akt pathway. Our studies uncovered an extensive and complex crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt. We employed the new antibody-based approach in combination with mass spectrometry and showed that Akt <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations could affect almost all the phosphorylations of Akt, including Ser 126, Ser 129, Thr 308 and Ser 473. Moreover, the crosstalk between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt was more complex than the âyin-yang hypothesisâ <xref rid="pone.0037427-Zachara1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, i.e. this interplay was not the simple binary model with reciprocal on or off status. On the one hand, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations of Akt could remarkably inhibit the phosphorylations of Akt, likely as the major role of Akt <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations. On the other hand, Akt could simultaneously possess <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations, similar to IRS-1 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations <xref rid="pone.0037427-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Although it is still very difficult to elucidate the combinational effect of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylation using the existing technologies, the presence of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations will likely affect the biological functions of the adjacent phosphorylation. Together, our findings have shown that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is a new regulator for Akt, with the broader roles in regulating Akt activity than previously speculated. The combinations of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations will markedly increase molecular diversity of Akt <xref rid="pone.0037427-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These PTMs of Akt (either single PTM or PTMs in combination) will generate an array of binding surfaces for effector molecules and the downstream substrates to mediate the specific biological functions of Akt <xref rid="pone.0037427-SimsRJ1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>What is the functional contribution of the inhibitory <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations to normal Akt signaling? It has been reported that Akt, PDK1 and OGT co-localize to the plasma membrane upon the activation of Akt signaling <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, where Akt is phosphorylated at Thr 308 by PDK1 and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylated by OGT. In line with these previous reports, we identified the constitutive <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations of Akt in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Further, these <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations under normal conditions inhibited the phosphorylations of Akt. The level of Akt activity at steady state should be the result of a balance between activation and inhibition events. The <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation levels of Akt under normal physiological conditions may confer the optimal status for Akt signal transduction <xref rid="pone.0037427-Yang4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, these observations suggested that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc was necessary for normal Akt signaling. On the other hand, we utilized Tyr mutation to simulate the inhibition effect of <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation. These mutants that represented an abnormal state of Akt <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations, displayed the markedly reduced kinase activity, and in turn resulted in the significant loss of Akt normal biological functions. These findings indicated that the aberrant change of the balance between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and <italic>O</italic>-phosphate of Akt would compromise the normal biological functions of Akt. Therefore, our studies open up a new avenue to understand Akt signal transduction through elucidation of the interaction between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have developed a pair of new strategies to advance our understanding of the relationship between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc and <italic>O</italic>-phosphate of a given protein in complex biological systems. Our studies reveal an extensive and complex interplay between <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations and phosphorylations of Akt and demonstrate <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylations as a new regulatory modification for Akt. These findings may have a direct implication in the regulatory mechanism of Akt signaling.</p>
