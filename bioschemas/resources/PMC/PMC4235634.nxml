        <p>Kitamura et al. identify NLRC4 as causing familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome using whole exome sequencing on a family with multiple affected family members. They identify a mutation in the NOD domain and show that the mutant protein increases Nlrc4 oligomerization and is associated with increased IL-1Î². Transgenic mice with the same NLRC4 mutation are shown to develop a similar FCAS-like syndrome.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Autoinflammatory syndromes cause sterile inflammation in the absence of any signs of autoimmune responses. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is characterized by intermittent episodes of rash, arthralgia, and fever after exposure to cold stimuli. We have identified a missense mutation in the <italic>NLRC4</italic> gene in patients with FCAS. NLRC4 has been known as a crucial sensor for several Gram-negative intracellular bacteria. The mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> in FCAS patients promoted the formation of NLRC4-containing inflammasomes that cleave procaspase-1 and increase production of IL-1Î². Transgenic mice that expressed mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> under the invariant chain promoter developed dermatitis and arthritis. Inflammation within tissues depended on IL-1Î²âmediated production of IL-17A from neutrophils but not from T cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between <italic>NLRC4</italic> and a hereditary autoinflammatory disease and highlight the importance of <italic>NLRC4</italic> not only in the innate immune response to bacterial infections but also in the genesis of inflammatory diseases.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Autoinflammatory syndrome is characterized by inflammatory responses in the absence of autoimmunity or infections, and it is generally caused by hyperactivation of innate immune cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and NuÃ±ez, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies, including those from our group, have identified the causative genes for familial autoinflammatory syndromes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">McDermott et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">JÃ©ru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Masters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kitamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Among these genes, mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> cause autoinflammatory syndromes, including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">JÃ©ru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Masters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aksentijevich and Kastner, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2012</xref>). These diseases are named cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). FCAS, the mildest of the CAPS, is characterized by rash, fever, and arthralgia by exposure to cold stimuli. Patients with MWS have more frequent inflammatory episodes and they frequently develop progressive sensorineural hearing loss and systemic amyloidosis. NOMID is the most severe of the three syndromes and is characterized by severe chronic inflammation involving the joints and nervous system. However, there are still significant numbers of CAPS without any mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aksentijevich et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>Heterozygous mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> result in overactivation of caspase 1. This enzyme cleaves the precursors of IL-1Î² and IL-18 (members of the IL-1 family of cytokines) into their active forms (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Masters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aksentijevich and Kastner, 2011</xref>). The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, canakinumab, and the IL-1 receptor type I fusion protein rilonacept have induced clinical response in CAPS, demonstrating that signaling via the IL-1 receptor is crucial for the pathogenesis of CAPS (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aksentijevich and Kastner, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dinarello and van der Meer, 2013</xref>). Recent studies have provided evidence that heterozygous mutations in <italic>NLRP12</italic> cause FCAS-like symptoms (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">JÃ©ru et al., 2008</xref>). The mutations are reported to inhibit NF-ÎºB or activate caspase 1, depending on the genetic variation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">JÃ©ru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">JÃ©ru et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the current study, we used exome resequencing to analyze candidate genes of patients in one Japanese family with cold-induced urticaria and arthritis but without mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> or <italic>NLRP12.</italic> We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic>. The mutant NLRC4 activates caspase-1 and this activation results in increased production of IL-1Î². Expression of the mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> in mice causes severe dermatitis, arthritis, and splenomegaly with augmented infiltration of neutrophils as well as cold-induced exanthema. The inflammation depended on IL-1Î² and IL-17A produced by neutrophils but not T cells. These data indicate that <italic>NLRC4</italic> is a causative gene for this disease and highlight the crucial roles of NLRC4 not only in the innate immune response to bacterial infections but also in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory diseases.</p>

        <title>Linkage and exome analyses of a Japanese family with a history of FCAS revealed a missense mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic></title>
        <p>Members of a non-consanguineous Japanese family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>) experienced episodes of high fever, urticarial-like rash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>), and arthralgia that began at â¼2â3 mo of age. These symptoms have frequently been induced by exposure to cold stimuli, and the urticarial-like rash after cold exposure has not been accompanied by itching. Such patients have not developed splenomegaly or bone erosion. In most cases, the symptoms have been resolved without treatment in this family, although patients have taken nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce joint pain. The laboratory findings of patient 3, from whom a blood sample was obtained during an episode of urticarial-like rash when he was 7 mo old, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. We undertook SNP array and linkage analyses to identify the causal gene. Parametric linkage analysis of five affected and two unaffected family members was performed. A maximum LOD score of 1.143 was obtained throughout the whole genome, with a total critical region of 243 Mbp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), but an LOD score &gt;2.3 was not detected.</p>

        <p>To identify the critical gene, genomic DNA of the family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>; five patients and two healthy family members) was evaluated by whole exome sequencing. A total of 3.7 Gbp of sequences was aligned to the exome target. DNA variants were filtered against the dbSNP build 134, the 1000 genomes project, the NHLBI Exome Sequencing project, and then classified by the predicted function to include all missense, nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site alleles. Exome analysis on linkage analysisâbased 243 Mbp candidate regions identified three rare changes in <italic>NLRC4</italic>, <italic>ALK</italic>, and <italic>DTNB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). We did not detect any mutations or mosaicism in the exon or exon-intron boundary region of <italic>NLRP3</italic>. The variation in <italic>NLRC4</italic>, but not those in <italic>ALK</italic> and <italic>DTNB</italic>, was located in a region that is conserved among species and that encodes a functional domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Furthermore, after additional testing of 200 genomes obtained from healthy Japanese donors, we detected the same variations in <italic>ALK</italic> and <italic>DTNB</italic> (allele frequency 1/100 in both genes; unpublished data). Those data strongly suggested that <italic>NLRC4</italic> was the causative gene for FCAS in this family.</p>

        <p>The mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> was heterozygous in all of the patients we studied. It caused an A&gt;C transversion at nucleotide 1589 in exon 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>) and changed the predicted amino acid from a histidine to a proline at position 443 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>). The missense mutation was detected in all affected patients but not in healthy members of the family.

        <title>The mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> increased its oligomerization and resulted in hyperactivation of caspase-1</title>
        <p>We first asked if the mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> affected the expression of NLRC4 protein. The 3Ã Flag-tagged cDNA of wild-type or mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> was transfected into 293T cells and the lysates from those transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The expression levels of wild-type and mutant NLRC4 proteins were similar; this finding suggested that the missense mutation did not affect the expression of NLRC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). As the activation of NLRC4 induces its oligomerization (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kofoed and Vance, 2011</xref>), we wished to determine if the missense mutation increased this process. The 3Ã Flag-tagged cDNA of wild-type or mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> was transfected into 293T cells and the lysates from those transfected cells were subjected to Blue Native-PAGE. A marked shift of wild-type NLRC4 to an oligomeric complex (â¼1,000 kD) was detected in cells transfected with mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic>, whereas the monomeric form predominated in cells transfected with wild-type <italic>NLRC4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). These data indicated that the missense mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> facilitated the formation of oligomers.</p>

        <p>To determine if the missense mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> resulted in increased cleavage of procaspase-1, a vector expressing either the wild-type or mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> and a <italic>CASP1</italic> expression vector were transfected into 293T cells. Cells transfected with wild-type <italic>NLRC4</italic> contained less of the 10 kD species (active form of caspase-1) than those transfected with mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> contained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). Because the cleavage of procaspase-1 is required for the production of IL-1Î², we measured IL-1Î² production in 293T cells transfected with vectors expressing wild-type or mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> and <italic>CASP1</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic>. Cells overexpressing mutant NLRC4 secreted significantly more IL-1Î² than did cells overexpressing wild-type NLRC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). This finding indicated that the missense mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> augmented cleavage of procaspase-1 and as a result, the secretion of IL-1Î² was increased.</p>
        <p>NLRC4 is activated in response to bacterial type III secretory systems, including PrgI (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Rayamajhi et al., 2013</xref>). We transfected PrgI in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FCAS patient and a healthy donor and evaluated the production of IL-1Î². The production of IL-1Î² was higher in FCAS patients compared with the healthy donor-derived cells at three different concentrations of PrgI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>).</p>

        <title>The mutation in <italic>Nlrc4</italic> caused an autoinflammatory syndrome in mice</title>
        <p>We next sought to assess if the equivalent of the <italic>NLRC4</italic> 1589A&gt;C mutation caused FCAS-like inflammatory responses in mice. First, we tested if the equivalent mutation in mouse <italic>Nlrc4</italic> also augmented IL-1Î² secretion. BM-derived macrophages (BMMCs) transfected with a control vector or with a vector encoding wild-type or mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> were stimulated with LPS and the secretion of IL-1Î² was measured. BMMCs that expressed the mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> produced a greater amount of IL-1Î² than did those transfected with the wild-type <italic>Nlrc4</italic> vector or the control vector. In addition, the production of IL-1Î² was inhibited by the addition of a caspase-1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, the amount of IL-6 secreted by LPS-stimulated BMMCs overexpressing mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> was similar to that of cells overexpressing wild-type <italic>Nlrc4</italic>, and the secretion of IL-6 was not inhibited by treatment with a caspase-1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). These data indicated that the mutant NLRC4 affected the secretion of IL-1Î² and that this activity depended on the cleavage of caspase-1.</p>

        <p>We next compared the production of cytokines in the spleens of mu-Nlrc4 and control mice. Splenocytes of mu-Nlrc4 mice produced IL-1Î² when stimulated with LPS, whereas the production of IL-1Î² by splenocytes of control mice was limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>). The serum levels of IL-1Î², IL-17A, and G-CSF were much higher in mu-Nlrc4 mice than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 b</xref>). To determine whether the overexpression of wild-type Nlrc4 might also up-regulate proinflammatory cytokines, we transplanted BM cells transduced with the wild-type or the mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> gene into irradiated recipient mice. The number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen and peritoneal cavity was higher in mutant Nlrc4 chimeras than in control chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>).

        <title>Cold exposure of mu-Nlrc4 mice increased autoinflammation</title>
        <p>To determine if mu-Nlrc4 mice exposed to cold stimuli would exhibit a heightened inflammatory response, the right feet of mu-Nlrc4 mice were cooled for 5 min and then the thickness of the footpads was evaluated. Cooling the footpads of control mice did not change their color or thickness, but the footpads of mu-Nlrc4 mice increased in thickness and displayed an exanthema-like color change after being cooled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 a</xref>). The foot pad swelled more in C57BL/6 mice reconstituted with mutant Nlrc4-transduced BM cells than in those with wild-type Nlrc4- or control virus-transduced BM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 b</xref>). In addition, cooling of the whole body of the mice at 4Â°C for 1 min increased IL-1Î² in mu-Nlrc4 but not control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 c</xref>). As for cell level assay, LPS-stimulated MC/9 cells overexpressing mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> or 293T cells overexpressing mutant <italic>NLRC4</italic> produced more IL-1Î² when cultured at 32Â°C than at 37Â°C, whereas MC/9 cells overexpressing wild-type <italic>Nlrc4</italic> or 293T cells overexpressing wild-type <italic>NLRC4</italic> did not increase IL-1Î² in response to 32Â°C stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 d</xref>). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an FCAS patient produced IL-1Î² in response to 32Â°C stimulation, whereas control cells did not increase IL-1Î² production in response to 32Â°C stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 e</xref>). The induction of IL-1Î² by cold stimuli was inhibited by the addition of caspase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 e</xref>). These data demonstrated that cells harboring mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> activated <italic>Nlrc4</italic>-dependant inflammasomes upon exposure to cold stimuli, and this activation resulted in tissue inflammation.</p>

        <p>Th17 cells that produce IL-17A contribute to various inflammatory disorders (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Korn et al., 2009</xref>).

        <p>To determine which cells were responsible for IL-17A production in mu-Nlrc4 mice, we depleted CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, Thy1.2<sup>+</sup>, or Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells. The depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, or Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> cells did not affect the IL-17A level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 b</xref>), although the depletion of CD8<sup>â</sup>TCR-Î²<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>â</sup>TCR-Î²<sup>+</sup>, or CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>TCR-Î²<sup>+</sup> cells was efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 c</xref>). However depletion of Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells and suppression of antiâIL-1Î² reduced the IL-17A level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 b</xref>), suggesting that IL-1Î² was required for IL-17A production and neutrophils were major producers of IL-17A in mu-Nlrc4 mice. We then treated mu-Nlrc4 mice with antiâIL-1Î², antiâIL-17A, or antiâIL-1Î² plus antiâIL-17A antibody to evaluate which cytokine was involved in neutrophil accumulation. The number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells in mu-Nlrc4 mice was decreased by treating the mice with antiâIL-1Î² or antiâIL-17A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 d</xref>). The combination of antiâIL-1Î² and antiâIL-17A further decreased the number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 d</xref>).</p>
        <p>To evaluate which cells or cytokines contributed to inflammation in mu-Nlrc4 mice, the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injections of anti-CD4<sup>+</sup>, anti-CD8<sup>+</sup>, anti-Thy1.2<sup>+</sup>, or anti-Gr1<sup>+</sup> antibodies. Alternatively, intraperitoneal injections contained antiâIL-1Î², antiâIL-17A, or antiâIL-1Î² plus antiâIL-17A antibodies. Footpad swelling after antibody treatment was subsequently measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 a</xref>). The depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, or Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> cells did not affect swelling. In contrast, depletion of Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells suppressed the footpad swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 a</xref>). Footpad swelling in mu-Nlrc4 mice was inhibited by treating the mice with antiâIL-1Î² or antiâIL-17A, and the combination of antiâIL-1Î² plus antiâIL-17A further decreased the number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 a</xref>). The treatment of mu-Nlrc4 mice with antiâIL-6 or TNF did not inhibit footpad swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 b</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Previous studies have identified mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> and <italic>NLRP12</italic> in patients with FCAS (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">JÃ©ru et al., 2008</xref>). However, not all patients with FCAS carry mutations in these two genes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aksentijevich et al., 2007</xref>). In the current study, we used linkage and exome resequencing to analyze genetic variations in patients with FCAS in one Japanese family and discovered a missense mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic>, a gene which has been known as a crucial sensor for several Gram-negative intracellular bacteria (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kofoed and Vance, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lamkanfi, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). The mutant NLRC4 activated caspase-1 and this activation resulted in increased secretion of IL-1Î². Transgenic mice that express the mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> develop dermatitis and arthritis accompanied by bone erosion. The inflammatory responses induced by the mutant Nlrc4 protein depend on IL-1Î² and IL-17A acting in concert with neutrophil infiltration, and the production of IL-17A depends on neutrophils but not on T cells. These findings highlight the roles of NLRC4 not only in innate responses to bacterial infections but also in autoinflammatory responses.</p>
      <p>The NLRC4 inflammasome is crucial for the responses to several Gram-negative intracellular bacteria including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Miao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kofoed and Vance, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). NLRC4 can be activated by the flagellin protein expressed by these bacteria and by the basal body rod component of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> type III secretion system (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Franchi et al., 2012</xref>). The recognition of flagellin or basal body rod component requires proteins of the NAIP family (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kofoed and Vance, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Rayamajhi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Our present data show that a mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> increased the formation of NLRC4 inflammasomes in the absence of flagellin or basal body rod component-mediated stimulation. As the mutation is located in the NOD domain, it might increase oligomerization of NLRC4 by increasing the binding affinity for other NLRC4 monomers. Indeed, we detected increased oligomerization of the mutant NLRC4 without any exogenous stimuli in addition to increased production of IL-1Î² from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FCAS patients than those from control in response to bacterial product. An interesting question is whether intrinsic ligands are required for the oligomerization of mutant NLRC4 or whether there are intrinsic ligands that are able to activate wild-type NLRC4. These questions could be at least partly addressed by comparing the abilities of wild-type and mutant NLRC4 proteins to self-assemble in a cell-free system. In addition, a recent study has revealed the structure of NLRC4 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, a comparison of the structures of the wild-type and mutant NLRC4 proteins might help reveal the activation mechanisms for mutant NLRC4 as well as wild-type NLRC4.</p>
      <p>The mu-Nlrc4 mice developed severe arthritis with bone erosion, dermatitis, and splenomegaly together with an increased number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> neutrophil and activated T cells. Although mu-Nlrc4 mice developed an urticarial-like dermatitis upon exposure to a cold stimulus, it is important to note that these mice spontaneously developed an inflammatory syndrome even without exposure to cold stimuli. Previous studies have reported that mice harboring a mutation in NLRP3 also spontaneously develop an inflammatory disorder (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, these data suggest that a cold environment is one of the factors that trigger the appearance of the syndrome but also that it is not required to cause the disease. As for the mechanisms of autoinflammation in mu-Nlrc4 mice, neutrophil infiltration and footpad inflammation were suppressed by blocking the function of IL-1Î² and IL-17A or depleting neutrophils but not CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, or Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> cells. Furthermore, IL-17A production was inhibited by suppressing IL-1Î², or depleting neutrophils but not CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> or Thy1.2<sup>+</sup> cells. Collectively, those data suggest that increased production of IL-1Î² by the mutation in NLRC4 would up-regulate the production of IL-17A from neutrophils, which would further recruit neutrophils leading to progressive inflammation. The mice harboring a mutation in NLRP3 spontaneously develop an inflammatory disorder (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2009</xref>) that depends on Th17. Therefore, mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> and <italic>NLRC4</italic> likely lead to production of IL-17A through different molecular networks. Previous studies have not discovered mutations in <italic>NLRC4</italic> in American patients with CAPS who do not have mutations in <italic>NLRP3</italic> (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aksentijevich et al., 2007</xref>). Our discovery of a new mutation in <italic>NLRC4</italic> in one Japanese family will facilitate the screening of <italic>NLRC4</italic> in patients with CAPS. Furthermore, the finding that expression of the mutant <italic>Nlrc4</italic> in mice gives rise to spontaneous and severe autoinflammatory symptoms, including splenomegaly and infiltration of neutrophils into the joints, suggests that NLRC4 may be involved in non-FCAS types of autoinflammatory syndromes that are currently not associated with known genetic mutations. In addition, two recent papers reported that the heterozygous mutation in NLRC4 causes macrophage activation syndrome or neonatal-onset enterocolitis, periodic fever, and fatal or near-fatal episodes of autoinflammation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Canna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Romberg et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that polymorphisms of <italic>NLRC4</italic> are associated with atopic dermatitis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Macaluso et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, it will be important to characterize the <italic>NLRC4</italic> genotypes/phenotypes association in patients with an autoinflammatory syndrome as well as in patients with inflammatory disorders. In conclusion, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between <italic>NLRC4</italic> and FCAS, and they highlight the importance of <italic>NLRC4</italic> not only in the innate immune response to bacterial infections but also in the genesis of inflammatory diseases.</p>
