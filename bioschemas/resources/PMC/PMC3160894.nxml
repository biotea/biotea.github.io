          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Among scorpion species, the Buthidae produce the most deadly and painful venoms. However, little is known regarding the venom components that cause pain and their mechanism of action. Using a paw-licking assay (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), this study compared the pain-inducing capabilities of venoms from two species of New World scorpion (<italic>Centruroides vittatus</italic>, <italic>C. exilicauda</italic>) belonging to the neurotoxin-producing family Buthidae with one species of non-neurotoxin producing scorpion (<italic>Vaejovis spinigerus</italic>) in the family Vaejovidae. A pain-inducing Î±-toxin (CvIV4) was isolated from the venom of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> and tested on five Na<sup>+</sup> channel isoforms.</p>

          <title>Principal Findings</title>
          <p>
<italic>C. vittatus</italic> and <italic>C. exilicauda</italic> venoms produced significantly more paw licking in <italic>Mus</italic> than <italic>V. spinigerus</italic> venom. CvIV4 produced paw licking in <italic>Mus</italic> equivalent to the effects of whole venom. CvIV4 slowed the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel expressed in peripheral pain-pathway neurons (nociceptors), but did not affect the Na<sub>v</sub>1.8-based sodium currents of these neurons. CvIV4 also slowed the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.4. The effects of CvIV4 are similar to Old World Î±-toxins that target Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (AahII, BmK MI, LqhIII, OD1), however the primary structure of CvIV4 is not similar to these toxins. Mutant Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels (D1586A and E1589Q, DIV S3âS4 linker) reduced but did not abolish the effects of CvIV4.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>This study: 1) agrees with anecdotal evidence suggesting that buthid venom is significantly more painful than non-neurotoxic venom; 2) demonstrates that New World buthids inflict painful stings via toxins that modulate Na<sup>+</sup> channels expressed in nociceptors; 3) reveals that Old and New World buthids employ similar mechanisms to produce pain. Old and New World Î±-toxins that target Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 have diverged in sequence, but the activity of these toxins is similar. Pain-inducing toxins may have evolved in a common ancestor. Alternatively, these toxins may be the product of convergent evolution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>For animals that lack the advantage of size, razor-like claws, speed, camouflage, etc. to overpower or outmaneuver their predators, painful venom can serve as a potent weapon. A diversity of animals including ants, wasps, bees, scorpions, spiders, snakes, jellyfish, stonefish, and stingrays employ painful venom to either deter their enemies or escape subjugation.</p>
      <p>Among all species of scorpion, those in the family Buthidae produce the world's most deadly venoms <xref rid="pone.0023520-Fet1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Buthid venom is a mixture of several peptides that bind different families of ion channels (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>â</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in excitable membranes of nerve and muscle <xref rid="pone.0023520-Couraud1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Simard1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Possani1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Possani2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The majority of toxins that have been described recognize either sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) or potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels. Toxins that bind Na<sup>+</sup> channels alter the gating mechanism, making the channel likely to open near the resting membrane potential and then inhibiting fast inactivation, thus prolonging the flow of Na<sup>+</sup> ions through the pore <xref rid="pone.0023520-RodriguezdelaVega1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Catterall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Toxins that bind K<sup>+</sup> channels block the flow of K<sup>+</sup> ions through the channel, preventing the membrane from returning to its resting potential after depolarization <xref rid="pone.0023520-RodriguezdelaVega2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Tytgat1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The synergistic effect of these toxins is hyper-excitability of nerve and muscle cells that can cause a wide range of physiological malfunction <xref rid="pone.0023520-BenAbraham1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-BogomolskiYahalom1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Sadeghian1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-AlAsmari1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Even when buthid stings are not fatal, humans report excruciating pain that may last from several hours to days. While the buthid toxins that cause seizures, paralysis and respiratory failure have been well studied, little is known regarding the venom components that cause pain and their mechanism of action.</p>
      <p>Animals sense pain when peripheral sensory neurons (nociceptors) are activated <xref rid="pone.0023520-Cummins1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-DibHajj1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and transmit information about noxious stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). The cell bodies of nociceptors are housed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), located just outside the spinal cord. A number of distinct DRG-expressed voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), primarily Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, Na<sub>v</sub>1.9, play a major role in transducing noxious stimuli in animals.</p>
      <p>Given that buthid scorpions produce toxins that bind Na<sup>+</sup> channels in excitable membranes, it is plausible that their venom induces pain by initiating action potentials in nociceptors. Because some human pain disorders involve Na<sup>+</sup> channels expressed in nociceptors <xref rid="pone.0023520-Cummins1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-DibHajj1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, there has been an effort, albeit limited, to determine the components in buthid venom that induce pain with the goal of isolating peptides that discriminate among the DRG-expressed VGSCs. For example, BmK I, isolated from the venom of <italic>Buthus martensii</italic> Karsch, an Old World buthid (species that originated in Africa and Asia), induces paw licking when injected into the hind paws of rats. BmK I modulates DRG-expressed Na<sup>+</sup> currents in rat, but the specific ion-channel target was not identified <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-ZhanTao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A separate study showed that BmK MI (synonym for BmK I) slows the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> ooctyes <xref rid="pone.0023520-Maertens1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Toxins isolated from the Old World buthids <italic>Odonthobuthus doriae</italic> (ODI), <italic>Androctonus australis</italic> Hector (AahII) and <italic>Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus</italic> (LqhIII) also slow the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 <xref rid="pone.0023520-Maertens1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, while the venoms of these three scorpions are reported to be painful, ODI, AahII and LqhIII were not tested for their ability to induce paw licking in a rodent model. Collectively, the results from these studies support the hypothesis that Old World buthids produce painful stings, in part, by toxins that modulate DRG-expressed Na<sup>+</sup> channels. New World buthids (species that originated in North and South America) are reported to produce intensely painful stings, however, to our knowledge no studies have identified pain-inducing components from the venoms of New World buthids.</p>
      <p>The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of how neurotoxic venom produced by buthid scorpions induces pain in mammals. Our objectives were to 1) establish in a mouse model whether venom produced by buthid scorpions is more painful than venom produced by scorpions from other families as anecdotally reported; 2) determine whether Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxins are involved in generating the intense pain produced by New World buthids, and if so, identify their ion-channel targets and mechanism of action; and 3) compare pain-inducing toxins from Old and New World buthids to determine whether they employ similar venom components to produce painful stings.</p>
      <p>To achieve these objectives, we measured the duration of paw licking by <italic>Mus musculus</italic> in response to injections of venom or venom fractions into their hind paws. While we do not know what mice perceive, we assume that mice lick their paws in response to pain. Thus, we will refer to the venom and toxins that produce paw licking as âpainfulâ or âpain inducing.â</p>

      <p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Texas at Austin, protocol number AUP-2009-00027, and the Indiana University School of Medicine, protocol number 3552. All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and to minimize the suffering of animals.</p>

        <title>Scorpion collection</title>
        <p>Specimens of <italic>C. exilicauda</italic> (synonym for <italic>C. sculpturatus</italic>) and <italic>V. spinigerus</italic> were collected from the foothills of the Santa Rita Mountains, AZ. Specimens of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> were collected from the foothills of the Organ Mountains, NM. Scorpions were collected at night using ultraviolet light and then placed in plastic bags for transport. Scorpions were housed in plastic containers (52 cm LÃ35 cm WÃ15.6 cm H) in a room with a 12/12 light cycle and daily temperature of 25â26Â°C. Aquarium gravel was used to line the containers and cardboard egg crates were added to provide the scorpions with a refuge. Scorpions were fed live crickets once a week and provided with water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>

        <title>Venom extraction and preparation</title>
        <p>Fresh venom was extracted from captive scorpions using electrical stimulation of the telson (terminal tail segment that houses the venom gland). The crude venom was dissolved in sterile water and centrifuged at 14,500 RPM, 4Â°C, for 15 minutes to remove insoluble components. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. For protocols isolating pain-inducing peptides from venom, aliquots of the supernatant were stored for a short period of time at â80Â° C and then thawed before applying the sample to the perfusion column. For behavioral assays to screen venom and venom fractions for pain-inducing capability, aliquots of soluble venom were lyophilized and maintained at â20Â° C until tested.</p>

        <title>Isolation of peptides that induce paw licking in mice</title>
        <p>Venom peptides were purified by tandem purification. Soluble, whole venom from <italic>C. vittatus</italic> was separated into fractions using perfusion chromatography (1 dimension). Aliquots of whole venom were injected into a POROS (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) R2 10 Âµm perfusion column (4.6 mm internal diameterÃ100 mm length). The perfusion column was connected to a Bio Rad (Hercules, CA) Biologic Duoflow Maximizer system with a Quad Tec UV-Vis detector. Fractions were separated using the following method: linear gradient with 0% to 4% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 2.0 ml; linear gradient with 8% to 38% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 80.0 ml; linear gradient with 44% to 100% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 10.0 ml; isocratic flow with 0% solvent A, 100% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 3.0 ml; linear gradient with 100% to 0% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 3.0 ml; isocratic flow with 100% solvent A, 0% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 4.0 ml (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in LC water; solvent B, acetonitrile). The elution of each fraction was monitored by following the UV trace at 214 nm and 280 nm. Fractions were collected manually and screened for their ability to produce pain using a behavioral assay (see below). Fractions that produced pain were further separated into individual peptides using a TARGA (Higgins Analytical, Inc., Mountain View, CA) reverse phase C<sub>18</sub> column (4.6 mm internal diameterÃ250 mm length) (2 dimension) and a different buffer system. Individual peptides were separated using the following method: linear gradient with 0% to 8% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 2.0 ml; linear gradient with 8% to 44% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 80.0 ml; linear gradient with 44% to 100% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 10.0 ml; isocratic flow with 0% solvent A, 100% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 3.0 ml; linear gradient with 100% to 0% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 3.0 ml; isocratic flow with 100% solvent A, 0% solvent B at 0.80 ml/min for 4.0 ml (solvent A, 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, in LC water; solvent B, acetonitrile). Peptides were collected manually by following the UV trace at 214 nm and 280 nm. The purity of peptides was confirmed using analytical HPLC (data not shown). Purified peptides were tested for their ability to induce pain using a behavioral assay. All peptides were further characterized using mass spectrometry.</p>

        <title>Behavioral assays</title>
        <p>Soluble venom, venom fractions and purified peptides were tested for their ability to produce pain using the paw-licking assay <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Inceoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. For all behavioral assays, lyophilized samples of venom or venom components were hydrated in sterile water to the final concentration and injected subcutaneously into the plantar region of the left hind paw of house mice (<italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>). To control for the pain of an injection, aliquots of an equal volume of sterile water were injected into the hind paw of an additional group of mice. Immediately following the injection, mice were placed in a Plexiglas container (8 cm WÃ38 cm LÃ26 cm H) and their response was videotaped using a digital video camcorder (Canon XL1 mini DV) equipped with a 3Ã wide-angle zoom lens (Canon XL 3.4â10.2 mm). The amount of time mice spent licking their paws was measured and used as an index of pain.</p>
        <p>In the first paw-licking assay comparing the pain-inducing capability of soluble venom from three different species of scorpion, samples of lyophilized venom were diluted to a concentration of 1.7 Âµg/Âµl. An aliquot of 10 Âµl was injected into the hind paw of male mice (strain CD-1, 37â40 g, nâ=â8 per treatment) and paw licking was recorded for 10 minutes. Data are reported as the mean values in seconds (s) Â±1 standard error of the mean (SE). A single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA, JMPÂ®8, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jmp.com">www.jmp.com</ext-link>) was used to test for significant effects across treatment groups. Planned orthogonal contrasts were used to test for differences between treatments.</p>
        <p>In the behavioral assays screening <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom fractions and purified peptides for pain-inducing ability, lyophilized venom fractions or peptides were diluted to a concentration of 2.0 Âµg/Âµl. A 10 Âµl sample was injected into the hind paw of female mice (strain CD-1, 20â24 g, nâ=â2â5 mice per treatment) and paw licking was recorded for 5 minutes. Paw licking values for <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom fractions are reported as the mean (s) Â±1 SE. A single factor ANOVA (JMPÂ®8, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jmp.com">www.jmp.com</ext-link>) was used to detect significant differences in paw licking across all treatment groups. A multiple comparisons test (Tukey's HSD) was used to identify venom fractions that produced as much paw licking as the sample of whole venom. In order to reduce the number of mice used to test samples and to conserve the limited supply of purified peptides, only two mice were used to test each individual peptide isolated from venom fractions. Measures of pain for purified peptides are shown as paw licking values (s) from each of two tests for each peptide.</p>

        <title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title>
        <p>The molecular mass of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom fractions and purified peptides were estimated using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF) technology. Mass spectrometry was performed using an Applied Biosystems (Fullerton, CA) Voyager Biospectrometry Workstation MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in the Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology Protein Microanalysis Facility of the University of Texas at Austin. Aliquots of peptide samples in aqueous solution or containing up to 50% acetonitrile were combined with freshly prepared matrix solution [saturated sinapinic acid dissolved in a mixture of 50 or 75% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.3% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and distilled water]. Mass spectral measurements were made with ratios of peptide solution to matrix solution ranging from 1â¶1 to 1â¶6. The optimum ratio was typically 1â¶4, thus, all reported spectra were made with a ratio of 1â¶4. Sample aliquots of 0.5 or 1.0 mL were spotted onto stainless steel sample plates and spectra were collected by averaging 10â20 laser shots. Samples were irradiated with a nitrogen laser (Laser Science Inc.) operated at 337 nm, attenuated and focused on the sample target using the built-in Perseptive GRAMS/386 software. Ions were accelerated with a deflection voltage of 30 kV and differentiated according to their m/z using a time-of-flight mass analyzer. Myoglobin (horse heart; Mr 16,950.7), insulin (Mr 5,733.5) and Bradykinin (Mr 1,060.2) were used as external standards to calibrate the spectra.</p>

        <title>Amino acid analysis (N-terminal Protein Sequencing)</title>
        <p>After confirming the purity of the peptides isolated from <italic>C. vittatus</italic>' venom, the N-terminal amino acid sequence for each peptide was determined using Edman degradation. Automated protein sequencing was performed on a 492A protein sequencer equipped with a 120A HPLC system (PE Applied Biosystems). All reagents and solvents used for the sequencer were obtained from PE Applied Biosystems. Aliquots of each peptide were reduced with DTT and chemically modified with iodoacetamide. Briefly, peptides were incubated with 100 mM DTT at 37Â°C for one hour followed by incubation with 120 mM iodoacetamide at 37Â°C for one hour. The peptides were then spotted onto either polybrene (Bioprene) treated glass fiber disks or PVDF membrane pieces (ca. 1Ã1 mm). PVDF membrane pieces were wetted with neat methanol and an aliquot of a 1 to 20 dilution of the Bioprene solution while glass fiber disks were treated only with the polybrene solution. Both the glass fiber disks and membrane pieces were dried under a stream of nitrogen and then loaded into the reaction cartridge for sequencing.</p>

          <p>The cDNA prepared from <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom gland RNA served as the template to amplify the gene that encodes CvIV4. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was used to amplify cDNA in three steps. In the first step, degenerate primers (1 and 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023520-t001">Table 1</xref>) were used to amplify the initial 148 nucleotides from the gene that correspond to the beginning of the mature toxin.

          <p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (â¼21Â°C) using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were acquired on a Pentium IV computer using the Pulse program (version 8.31; HEKA). Fire-polished electrodes were fabricated from 1.7-mm capillary glass (VWR, West Chester, PA) using a P-97 puller (Sutter, Novato, CA). The standard pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 CsF, 1 EGTA, 10 NaCl and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. The standard bathing solution was (in mM): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2 and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. After filling with pipette solution, the access resistance of electrode pipette ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 MÎ©. The liquid junction potential for these solutions was &lt;8 mV; data were not corrected to account for this offset. The offset potential was zeroed before contacting the cell. After establishing the whole-cell recording configuration, the resting potential was held at â100 mV for 5 min to allow adequate equilibration between the micropipette solution and the cell interior. Linear leak subtraction, based on resistance estimates from four to five hyperpolarizing pulses applied before the depolarizing test potential, was used for all voltage clamp recordings. Membrane currents were usually filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Voltage errors were minimized using 80% series resistance compensation, and the capacitance artifact was canceled using the computer-controlled circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier. The CvIV4 stock solution was made at 0.1 mM using bathing solution containing 1 mg/ml BSA, and aliquots were stored at â20Â°C. Before use, the solution was diluted to the desired concentration with fresh bathing solution. Toxin (30 Âµl) was added directly to the recording chamber (volume of 300 Âµl) and mixed by repeatedly pipetting to achieve the specified final concentration.</p>

        <title>Effects of scorpion venom on paw-licking behavior in <italic>Mus</italic>
</title>
        <p>Tests quantifying the effects of the venoms of three different species of scorpions on paw-licking behavior in <italic>M. musculus</italic> (strain CD-1) showed that scorpion venom induces pain-related behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The amount of time mice spent licking their paws in response to an injection of scorpion venom or water differed among treatment groups (for all treatment groups nâ=ânumber of mice; <italic>C. vittatus</italic>, 130.23 secÂ±22.08, nâ=â8; <italic>C. exilicauda</italic>, 100.53 secÂ±12.42, nâ=â8; <italic>V. spinigerus</italic>, 64.94 secÂ±8.14, nâ=â8; water, 4.36 secÂ±2.57, nâ=â8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). A single factor ANOVA showed a significant effect across treatment groups (Fâ=â16.40; dfâ=â3, 28; P&lt;0.0001). Planned orthogonal contrasts demonstrated that while the venom of all three species of scorpion produced significantly more paw licking in mice than the water control (Fâ=â37.25; dfâ=â1, 28; P&lt;0.0001), the venom of both species of <italic>Centruroides</italic> produced significantly more paw licking than <italic>V. spinigerus</italic> venom (Fâ=â9.49; dfâ=â1, 28; Pâ=â0.0046). Although the venom of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> induced more paw licking than that of <italic>C. exilicauda</italic>, the difference was not significant (Fâ=â2.47; dfâ=â1, 28; Pâ=â0.1275). These results indicate that scorpion venom, at least the venom of the three species we tested, is painful, not only to humans, but also rodents. Moreover, the results show differences in the pain-inducing capability of different species of scorpion, and they confirm anecdotal reports that the venom of <italic>Centruroides</italic> is especially painful, whereas that of <italic>V. spinigerus</italic> is much less so.</p>

        <p>Because the venom of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> produced more paw licking than that of <italic>C. exilicauda</italic>, we selected <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom for subsequent studies aimed at identifying the components in scorpion venom that cause pain.

        <p>Mass spectrometry analysis showed that P4 contained three to four different components (data not shown). HPLC separation of P4 produced four subfractions, P4-1âP4-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Samples of each subfraction were isolated and tested for pain in <italic>M. musculus</italic> using the paw licking assay. To reduce the amount of sample consumed and the number of mice used, only two tests were conducted per subfraction. Each sample was tested on two mice and each mouse was injected only once. The four subfractions differed dramatically in the duration of paw licking they produced. Results from the first and second tests showed that subfraction P4-1 had no effect on paw licking, P4-2 and P4-3 induced a brief amount of paw licking, and P4-4 produced the longest duration of paw licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). There also appear to be differences in the latency to induce paw licking in the three subfractions causing pain. For example, P4-2 produced paw licking in each of two test mice 15 seconds after injection of the sample. P4-3 produced paw licking 10 seconds and 30 seconds after injecting the sample into the first and second test mice, respectively. P4-4 produced paw licking at 60 seconds after injection into the first test mouse and 30 seconds after injection into the second test mouse. Paw licking increased during the second minute of the test and peaked from three to five minutes. Mice injected with P4-4 were still licking their paws at the end of the five-minute test period.</p>

        <title>Isolation of venom gland mRNA encoding CvIV4</title>
        <p>A comparison of the N-terminal sequence for CvIV4 with other scorpion Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxins revealed that CvIV4 has a primary structure similar to alpha (Î±) toxins. The first seven amino acid residues and the position of the first four cysteines are identical to a number of scorpion toxins classified as Î±-toxins. However, CvIV4 also contains sequence that is unique. Given that the number of amino acid residues identified from direct sequencing of a peptide is limited, we isolated mRNA from the venom gland and sequenced the cDNA that encodes CvIV4 so that we could compare its structure with other scorpion Î±-toxins. Total RNA was isolated from the venom gland of two specimens of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> and reverse transcribed to produce cDNA. The gene encoding CvIV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) was cloned and sequenced from this cDNA sample in three steps. In the first step, degenerate primers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0023520-t001">Table 1</xref> for all primer sequences) designed from scorpion Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxin sequences (NCBI) were used to amplify gene sequence corresponding to the initial 148 nucleotides of the mature toxin (approximately position 99-249, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the second step, nested gene-specific forward primers were designed from the nucleotide sequence obtained during the first step. These forward primers were paired with an anchored oligo d(T) reverse primer to amplify the gene from the middle of the toxin to the poly-A tail (approximately position 124 to 389, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In the third step, nested gene-specific reverse primers were designed from nucleotide sequence obtained during the first and second steps. Nested gene-specific reverse primers were paired with 5â² RACE forward primers to amplify the gene from the middle of the toxin to the 5â² UTR (approximately position 1 to 297, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
        <p>An alignment of the N-terminal sequence obtained from Edman degradation of the CvIV4 peptide with a translation of the nucleotide sequence obtained from <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom gland cDNA shows that we isolated the gene that encodes CvIV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Of the initial 40 amino acid residues from the peptide, 35 are identical to the gene translation (five residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide could not be identified using Edman degradation). In addition, the first four cysteines are located in the same positions in both the peptide and translated gene. BLAST (NCBI) searches using both the CvIV4 nucleotide sequence and translated protein identified similar Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxins from several other scorpion species. An alignment of the translated gene for CvIV4 with toxins from seven other species shows that CvIV4 is most similar to CeII8, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxin isolated from the venom of the Mexican scorpion <italic>Centruroides elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). CvIV4 and CeII8 share 64% of their amino acid residues. The first seven amino acids from both toxins are identical and seven of their eight cysteines (cysteines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) are located in the same positions. The location of cysteine 6 differs by only one residue position. Interestingly, CeII8 has a primary structure similar to other scorpion Î±-toxins, but is classified as a beta (Î²) toxin based on electrophysiological assays <xref rid="pone.0023520-Vandendriessche1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. CvIV4 shares over 50% of its amino acid residues with six additional scorpion Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The initial seven amino acid residues from these toxins are highly conserved and their eight cysteines are located in similar positions. Ts3 and TsV, isolated from the venom of the South American scorpion <italic>Tityus serrulatus</italic>, are classified as Î±-toxins based on electrophysiological data. Tst3 and TbTx5, isolated from the South American scorpions <italic>T. stigmurus</italic> and <italic>T. bahiensis</italic> respectively, are classified as Î±-toxins based solely on sequence similarity to other Î±-toxins.

Alignment is based on cysteine residue position (shaded background) and toxins are arranged in order of descending percent identity with respect to CvIV4. Percent identify (%ID) is estimated from the number of amino acids shared by two toxins (NCBI Protein BLAST). While CvIV4 (JF938594) and CeII8 (P0CH40) are structurally similar (64% ID), they are functionally different as CvIV4 is classified as an Î±-toxin and CeII8 as a Î²-toxin (classification based on electrophysiological recordings from Na<sup>+</sup> channel subtypes).

          <title>Effects of CvIV4 on Na<sup>+</sup> current</title>
          <p>CvIV4 induces pain in mammals. Pain sensation is regulated, in part, by three VGSC subtypes (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, Na<sub>v</sub>1.9) that are expressed in nociceptors. We tested CvIV4 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7 expressed in HEK cells and on dissociated rat DRG, which express all three subtypes. Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is tetrodotoxin sensitive (TTX-S) while Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 are tetrodotoxin resistant (TTX-R). Cells were depolarized to â10 mV from a holding potential of â100 mV and Na<sup>+</sup> current was measured before and after the application of CvIV4. A comparison of pre- and post-toxin current traces shows that CvIV4 slowed the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, prolonging Na<sup>+</sup> current through the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). However, CvIV4 had no effect on TTX-R current recorded from DRG. As Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 currents disappear very quickly under standard recording conditions in DRG neurons, the majority of the TTX-R current recorded from the DRG neurons reflects the activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 currents. We did not see evidence that CvIV4 enhanced Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 currents in the DRG neurons. Thus, the results identify Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 as the target of CvIV4, demonstrate that Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 is not a target and suggest that CvIV4 does not enhance activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 currents.</p>

Na<sup>+</sup> currents were measured before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) and after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>) the application of CvIV4. A comparison of current traces pre- and post-toxin showed that CvIV4 prolonged the flow of Na<sup>+</sup> current through the channel, but did not affect the peak amplitude of current. The fraction of peak current remaining at 5 ms was approximately 0.5 (I<sub>5 ms</sub>). A current-voltage (IâV) plot comparing peak currents pre- and post-toxin with the fraction of current remaining at 5 ms (post-toxin) showed differences in the amount of current remaining at different membrane potentials (data not shown). This suggested that there might be a voltage-dependent effect on toxin binding. To address this, we plotted the percentage increase in the fraction of current at 5 ms (post-toxin) vs. membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). The results showed that effects of the toxin increased from â60 mV to reach a peak at approximately â30 mV. The effects of the toxin began to decrease at 0 mV, reaching the lowest point around 100 mV. The results demonstrate that the toxin requires depolarizing potentials to slow channel inactivation, however, strong depolarizing potentials decrease the effects of the toxin.</p>

To localize the residues in the DIV S3âS4 loop that are critical for CvIV4 activity, we made two mutants of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels and expressed them in HEK cells. The acidic residue Asp (D, position 1586 in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7) is important for Î±-toxin activity. We substituted the negatively charged Asp with a neutral Ala (D1586A) and decreased the effect of CvIV4 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0023520-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>). The acidic residue Glu (E, position 1589 in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7) is also critical for Î±-toxin activity. Glu occurs at this same position in Na<sub>v</sub>1.3 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, also targets of CvIV4. However, in Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 (target of CvIV4) a Gln (Q) occurs at this position.

The results suggest that both Asp1586 and Glu1589 are important for the effects of CvIV4 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.7. However, while both substitutions reduced the effects of CvIV4 on Nav1.7, neither abolished the effects of this toxin, which suggests other residues in DIV S3âS4, or other channel regions, are necessary for the activity of CvIV4.</p>

        <title>Differences in the pain-inducing capability of venom</title>
        <p>Anecdotal reports suggest that the stings of buthid scorpions are intensely painful, more so than the stings of other scorpions. However, no studies have used a mouse model to quantify and compare the pain induced by buthid and non-buthid venoms <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Inceoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We found that the venom of one species of scorpion from the family Vaejovidae (<italic>V. spinigerus</italic>), whose sting is reported to be moderately painful in humans, caused significantly more paw licking in mice than did an injection of water. However, the venom of two buthid scorpions (<italic>C. vittatus</italic> and <italic>C. exilicauda</italic>) induced significantly more paw licking in mice than <italic>V. spinigerus</italic> venom. These results demonstrate that vaejovid venom is painful to mammals, however, the results agree with anecdotal reports that buthid venom is considerably more painful. The results also show that the sensation of pain produced by buthid stings is conserved across mammals. We also observed differences between the two species of <italic>Centruroides</italic> in their pain-inducing capability.

        <title>Pain-inducing components in C. vittatus venom (CvIV4)</title>
        <p>We screened fractions of <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom for pain-inducing capability and identified four fractions that produced paw licking in mice. One of those fractions (P4) caused a response in mice similar to the response induced by the whole venom. Fraction P4 contained four peptides, three of which produced paw licking. Of those three, P4-4 (CvIV4) produced more than twice as much paw licking as the other two peptides. While CvIV4 generated more paw licking than the other peptides, its effects were not immediate, but commenced between 30 and 60 seconds following an injection. Moreover, paw licking was sporadic during the first minute following the injection and did not reach a peak until the third and fourth minutes of the test. In contrast, injections of either whole venom or fraction P4 produced an immediate response. Humans report that <italic>Centruroides'</italic> stings produce immediate, intense pain. This suggests that other components in <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom may be necessary for producing an immediate response. While the other three peptides in fraction P4 (P4-1, P4-2, P4-3) did not generate as much paw licking as CvIV4, they may be responsible for initiating an immediate pain response. Fractions P1, P2 and P5 produced low to moderate amounts of paw licking, while fraction P3 failed to produce a response. It is possible that one or more of these fractions, either individually or in combination, are critical for initiating an immediate pain response in mammals.</p>

        <title>Structural characteristics of CvIV4</title>
        <p>The molecular mass and the initial 40 amino acids of the N-terminal sequence for CvIV4 are characteristic of scorpion toxins that bind Na<sup>+</sup> channels <xref rid="pone.0023520-RodriguezdelaVega1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Corona1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Scorpion toxins that bind voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels are polypeptides composed of a single strand of amino acids. The peptides range from 58 to 76 amino acids in length (6500â8500 amu) and they contain eight cysteines that form four disulfide bonds. The conserved structural scaffold of these peptides consists of one Î±-helix and two or three strands of Î²-sheet, typically arranged in the order Î²Î±Î²Î². We isolated cDNA clones from <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom gland mRNA and identified a clone whose translated nucleotide sequence matched the N-terminal amino acid sequence of CvIV4. A comparison of the translated cDNA with sequences from other scorpion toxins confirmed that CvIV4 is a Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxin.</p>
        <p>Na<sup>+</sup> channel toxins can be divided into two groups (alpha and beta) based on their functional effects <xref rid="pone.0023520-RodriguezdelaVega1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Catterall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Beta (Î²) toxins shift the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative potentials, making the channel more likely to open at membrane potentials where activation would normally not occur. Alpha (Î±) toxins inhibit the fast inactivation mechanism, prolonging Na<sup>+</sup> current through the channel. While Î±- and Î²-toxins are structurally conserved, they are not identical. A BLAST search (NCBI) revealed that the primary structure of CvIV4 is most similar to the structure of venom peptides classified as Î±-toxins <xref rid="pone.0023520-RodriguezdelaVega1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Bosmans1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Weinberger1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. CvIV4 contains eight cysteine residues whose pattern is highly similar to other scorpion Î±-toxins. In addition, the composition and location of amino acid residues corresponding to the Î±-helix and Î²-sheets conserved among Î±-toxins are also observed in CvIV4. The primary structure of CvIV4 is most similar to CeII8, a toxin recently isolated from the venom of <italic>Centruroides elegans</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0023520-Vandendriessche1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. CvIV4 and CeII8 share 64% of their amino acids, however, CeII8 is classified as a Î²-toxin based on its functional effects.</p>

        <title>Functional characteristics of CvIV4</title>
        <p>Noxious stimuli activate nociceptors located in the peripheral sensory pathway. Nociceptors express three different VGSC subtypes (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, Na<sub>v</sub>1.9) that play a role in regulating pain perception. We tested CvIV4 on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7 expressed in HEK cells and on whole cell Na<sup>+</sup> currents recorded from rat DRG. We found that the toxin slowed the fast inactivation of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.7, however, CvIV4 had no effect on TTX-R currents recorded from DRG. Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is TTX-S, while both Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 are TTX-R. Thus our findings demonstrate that CvIV4 targets Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 and not Na<sub>v</sub>1.8. Although the pharmacology of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 currents are harder to study due to pronounced current run-down, our data also suggest that CvIV4 does not enhance Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 currents. This suggests that CvIV4 induces pain in mammals by slowing the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7.</p>
        <p>By slowing the fast inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, CvIV4 induced a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, but did not change the peak amplitude of the current. The persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current could be abolished by strong depolarizing membrane potentials, which suggests that CvIV4 dissociates from its target at highly positive membrane potentials. CvIV4 had no effect on the voltage-dependence of inactivation and shifted the voltage-dependence of activation to the left by only 4 mV. All of these effects are characteristic of the activity reported for scorpion Î±-toxins <xref rid="pone.0023520-Catterall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Maertens1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Bosmans1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0023520-Gilles1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> confirming that CvIV4 functions as an Î±-toxin. Moreover, these findings provide a mechanism to explain how CvIV4 produces the sensation of pain in mammals. By prolonging Na<sup>+</sup> current in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, CvIV4 would cause nociceptors to become hyper-excitable, thus producing the sensation of pain.</p>
        <p>Purified samples of CvIV4 induced paw licking in mice, however, the response was delayed as compared to whole venom or fraction P4. It is possible that one of the other fractions or peptides isolated from <italic>C. vittatus</italic> venom is necessary for initiating immediate pain sensation. A recent study of <italic>Centruroides elegans</italic> venom components showed that CeII8 binds Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes <xref rid="pone.0023520-Vandendriessche1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In contrast to CvIV4, CeII8 acts as a Î²-toxin and shifts the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative potentials, making Na<sup>+</sup> channels more likely to open. Because Î²-toxins make Na<sup>+</sup> channels more likely to open at subthreshold membrane potentials, it is plausible that Î²-toxins are responsible for inducing the immediate sensation of pain associated with scorpion stings. However, the study of <italic>Centruroides elegans</italic> venom did not directly test whether CeII8 produces paw licking in mammals.</p>
        <p>Results from the electrophysiology data showed that micro-molar concentrations of CvIV4 were required to slow the inactivation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7. However, we do not know the concentration of CvIV4 delivered in a single sting. Nor do we know whether or how CvIV4 interacts with other toxins in the venom to produce the sensation of pain in rodents. Interestingly, a recent study in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes indicated that sodium channel Î² subunits can modulate the affinity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 channels for conotoxins <xref rid="pone.0023520-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Other studies have reported that Î² subunits do not alter the interaction of sodium channels with neurotoxins in mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0023520-Bonhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It is possible that specific Î²1â4 subunit combinations might alter the affinity of specific sodium channel isoforms for CvIV4. Unfortunately, it is not known which Î² subunits associate with Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in DRG neurons.</p>
        <p>CvIV4 also slowed the fast inactivation and produced a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current in rNa<sub>v</sub>1.2, rNa<sub>v</sub>1.3 and rNa<sub>v</sub>1.4. However, CvIV4 had a minimal affect on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.5. These findings show that CvIV4 is not selective for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, but instead binds several VGSC isoforms. This is in contrast to CeII8, which is selective for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 <xref rid="pone.0023520-Vandendriessche1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Given that CvIV4 and CeII8 are similar in structure but differ in function and isoform selectivity, a comparison of these two toxins should improve our understanding of the structural characteristics that determine New World scorpion toxin selectivity and function.</p>

However, eight cysteines and six hydrophobic amino acids that are critical for the structure and function of Î±-toxins are conserved between CvIV4 and these four toxins <xref rid="pone.0023520-Bosmans1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, CvIV4 shares a lysine residue with AahII that is important for the activity of AahII <xref rid="pone.0023520-Legros1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These results raise intriguing questions about the evolution of pain-inducing toxins in buthid scorpions. Old and New World scorpions diverged from a common ancestor approximately 150 million years ago <xref rid="pone.0023520-Froy1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It is possible that pain-inducing toxins evolved before the split between Old and New World scorpions, and were then conserved. Alternatively, pain-inducing toxins may have evolved separately in both groups since their divergence. Identification and comparison of additional pain-inducing toxins from both Old and New World scorpions would provide insight into the evolution of these toxins in Buthidae scorpions.</p>
        <p>For scorpions like <italic>C. vittatus</italic> that are small and have slender pincers, venom that induces pain may provide the opportunity to escape from potential predators. In a series of staged feeding trials, wild-caught grasshopper mice (<italic>Onychomys arenicola</italic>, <italic>O. torridus</italic>), voracious predators of scorpions, were fed a variety of their local prey items, including <italic>Centruroides</italic> spp., <italic>Vaejovis</italic> spp. and field crickets <xref rid="pone.0023520-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Both <italic>O. arenicola</italic> and <italic>O. torridus</italic> dropped <italic>C. vittatus</italic> and <italic>C. exilicauda</italic> (respectively) significantly more often than they dropped the <italic>Vaejovis</italic> species or the crickets. This suggests that CvIV4 may function as a defense against predators of <italic>C. vittatus</italic>.</p>
