          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Initiation, amplitude, duration and termination of transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) signaling via Smad proteins is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation. We previously reported that ADP-ribosylation of Smads by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) negatively influences Smad-mediated transcription. PARP-1 is known to functionally interact with PARP-2 in the nucleus and the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) can remove poly(ADP-ribose) chains from target proteins. Here we aimed at analyzing possible cooperation between PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARG in regulation of TGFÎ² signaling.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>A robust cell model of TGFÎ² signaling, i.e. human HaCaT keratinocytes, was used. Endogenous Smad3 ADP-ribosylation and protein complexes between Smads and PARPs were studied using proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays, which were complemented by in vitro ADP-ribosylation assays using recombinant proteins. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels and promoter-reporter assays provided quantitative analysis of gene expression in response to TGFÎ² stimulation and after genetic perturbations of PARP-1/-2 and PARG based on RNA interference.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>TGFÎ² signaling rapidly induces nuclear ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 that coincides with a relative enhancement of nuclear complexes of Smads with PARP-1 and PARP-2. Inversely, PARG interacts with Smads and can de-ADP-ribosylate Smad3 <italic>in vitro</italic>. PARP-1 and PARP-2 also form complexes with each other, and Smads interact and activate auto-ADP-ribosylation of both PARP-1 and PARP-2. PARP-2, similar to PARP-1, negatively regulates specific TGFÎ² target genes (<italic>fibronectin</italic>, <italic>Smad7</italic>) and Smad transcriptional responses, and PARG positively regulates these genes. Accordingly, inhibition of TGFÎ²-mediated transcription caused by silencing endogenous PARG expression could be relieved after simultaneous depletion of PARP-1.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Nuclear Smad function is negatively regulated by PARP-1 that is assisted by PARP-2 and positively regulated by PARG during the course of TGFÎ² signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Signal transduction pathways, including transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²), are controlled by negative regulatory mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0103651-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Massagu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The TGFÎ² pathway is extensively studied due to its implication in early embryonic development, in specification of different organs, in homeostatic regulation of adult tissue integrity and due to its role in the development and progression of many diseases, including cardiovascular, fibrotic and malignant diseases <xref rid="pone.0103651-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the TGFÎ² pathway, negative regulation is exerted at multiple levels: at the level of the extracellular ligand and its access to the signaling receptors <xref rid="pone.0103651-tenDijke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; at the level of the type I and type II receptors that have serine/threonine kinase activity and phosphorylate intracellular Smad proteins or other signaling proteins <xref rid="pone.0103651-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; at the level of the Smad proteins that form complexes with each other, e.g. the receptor-phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 (R-Smads) associate with Smad4 and together accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcription <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>; and finally, at the level of many of the cytoplasmic and nuclear cofactors of the receptors and Smads, which are themselves regulated based on crosstalk with many other signaling pathways, and which provide the âcontext-dependentâ function of the pathway <xref rid="pone.0103651-Massagu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Ikushima1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We recently established a mechanism of negative regulation of Smad activity taking place in the nucleus, based on the finding that Smad3 and Smad4 can associate with the nuclear ADP-ribosyl-transferase (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like 1, ARTD1), also known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. PARP-1 binds to Smad proteins and ADP-ribosylates them proximal to their DNA-binding domain, thus reducing their affinity to DNA and negatively regulating their transcriptional activity. A straightforward consequence of this biochemical modification is that PARP-1 negatively regulates gene responses to TGFÎ² signaling <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In a similar manner, PARP-1 suppresses the expression of TGFÎ² receptors in CD4-positive T cells and for this reason PARP-1 inhibitors enhance signaling by TGFÎ² <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, PARP-1 can mediate positive gene responses to TGFÎ² as reported in studies of vascular smooth muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A potential dual role of PARP-1 in mediating transcriptional responses is compatible with the current understanding of PARP-1 as a positive or negative regulator of transcription <xref rid="pone.0103651-Krishnakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PARP-1 is the prototype of a large family of ADP-ribosyl-transferases (ARTDs) that enlists eighteen members acting towards diverse substrates in the nucleus, cytoplasm or mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0103651-Krishnakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Kraus1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. PARP-1 is best understood for its role in the DNA damage and repair response and the surveillance mechanisms that guarantee genomic integrity. Equally well established is the role of PARP-1 as a regulator of physiological transcription during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0103651-Krishnakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Kraus1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. During transcription, PARP-1 builds poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) chains on histones inside nucleosomes, affects the binding of histone H1 to nucleosomes, regulates DNA methylation, ADP-ribosylates the chromatin insulator protein CTCF and many DNA-binding transcription factors by modulating (usually negatively) their binding to DNA <xref rid="pone.0103651-Krishnakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Kraus1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition, PARP-1 and other PARP family members are known to auto-ADP-ribosylate as a mechanism that regulates their activity and residence to chromatin <xref rid="pone.0103651-Hottiger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PARP-2 (ARTD2) is the second member of the family, it also localizes in the nucleus and shares a highly conserved catalytic domain with PARP-1 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, however, it is a smaller protein, lacking many of the protein-protein interaction domains of PARP-1 and having a short N-terminal nuclear localization domain <xref rid="pone.0103651-Haenni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. PARP-2 functions in a relatively similar manner with PARP-1 as both enzymes are intimately involved in the DNA-damage and repair response, chromatin remodeling and transcription and in the development of cancer <xref rid="pone.0103651-Yelamos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. During the DNA damage and nucleotide base excision-repair mechanisms PARP-2 functionally cooperates with PARP-1 by forming physical complexes with each other and affecting each other's catalytic activity <xref rid="pone.0103651-Schreiber2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, PARP-2 can associate with the regulatory sequences of genes, such as <italic>SIRT1</italic>, an NAD-dependent deacetylase, repressing its expression and providing a mechanism that limits energy expenditure and mitochondrial function <xref rid="pone.0103651-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, such transcriptional function of PARP-2 can be directly regulated by the histone acetyl-transferase P/CAF, which acetylates the N-terminal domain of PARP-2 and reduces the DNA-binding and auto-ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP-2 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Haenni2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Protein ADP-ribosylation mediated by PARP-1 is dynamic and its turnover is controlled in part by the action of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) <xref rid="pone.0103651-Gagn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. PARG can hydrolyze PAR chains, whereas mono(ADP-ribosyl) units are removed from target proteins by the action of the ADP-ribosyl hydrolase 3 (ARH3) and macrodomain-containing proteins such as MacroD1 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Rosenthal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A clear function of PARG is the regulation of chromatin remodeling during transcription as it antagonizes the functional effects of PARP-1 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Genome-wide location analysis has demonstrated that both PARP-1 and PARG localize in distinct sets of gene regulatory sequences <xref rid="pone.0103651-Frizzell1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Krishnakumar2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Evidence based on comparative RNAi of PARP-1 versus PARG in breast cancer cells proposed that the two enzymes regulate gene expression in a coordinate and non-antagonistic manner, an intriguing finding that requires future mechanistic explanation <xref rid="pone.0103651-Frizzell1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this investigation we analyzed the role of PARP-2 and PARG in association to PARP-1 during TGFÎ² signaling. Using proximity ligation assays (PLA) and immunoprecipitations, we demonstrate that TGFÎ² induces endogenous PARP-1/Smad3 and PARP-2/Smad2/3 complexes, while only having small effects on the PARP1/PARP-2 interaction. TGFÎ² also promotes endogenous Smad3 oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ation, while in vitro ADP-ribosylation experiments demonstrated that recombinant Smad3 or Smad4 could co-precipitate activated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 and PARP-2. During TGFÎ²-regulated transcription, PARP-2 may act functionally in a similar manner as PARP-1, since PARP-2 suppressed TGFÎ²/Smad-dependent transcriptional responses. Finally, after demonstrating that PARG is capable of interacting with Smad proteins and de-ADP-ribosylating Smad3, we found that PARG is required for optimal transcriptional responses to TGFÎ². Thus, in the case of TGFÎ²-mediated transcriptional regulation, PARP-2 complements PARP-1's negative regulation of nuclear Smad function, while PARG seems to antagonize PARP-1/2 and provide a balancing mechanism for the optimal control of signal-regulated transcription.</p>

        <title>Induction of ADP-ribosylation by TGFÎ²</title>
        <p>We have previously provided evidence for the biochemical association of PARP-1 with Smad3 and Smad4, and for in vitro ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 and Smad4 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the present work we explored alternative techniques in order to demonstrate and quantify the extent of Smad protein ADP-ribosylation in living cells responding to TGFÎ² stimulation. We obtained reliable results when we applied in situ PLA <xref rid="pone.0103651-Sderberg1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which provides a sensitive and quantitative method for detecting protein complexes or post-translational modifications of proteins. We focused mainly on Smad3, as this Smad associates stronger with PARP-1 and becomes ADP-ribosylated <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Using human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) that are responsive to TGFÎ² signaling, we could observe rolling circle amplification (RCA) signals after applying antibodies against Smad3 and against PAR chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In the absence of TGFÎ² stimulation, very weak Smad3 ADP-ribosylation was detected that was indistinguishable from the negative controls of Smad3 or PAR antibody alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast, TGFÎ² rapidly induced nuclear RCA signals that presumably represent ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). After quantification of the nuclear RCA signals using the DuolinkImageTool software, we could verify that nuclear ADP-ribosylation was induced at 5 min, was further enhanced at 10 min, already declined significantly at 20 min, and returned to steady but low levels up to 90 min after TGFÎ² stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>), and the same low level persisted even up to 6 h after TGFÎ² stimulation (data not shown). Attempts to link the nuclear signals of Smad3-PAR to the activity of PARP-1 or PARP-2 using siRNA-mediated silencing of each protein failed for technical reasons, as PLA with the PAR antibody repeatedly failed when the cells were transfected (data not shown). As a positive control, we measured the endogenous Smad3 ADP-ribosylation after cell exposure to a rapid and acute dose of hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), which is known to induce strong PARP activity in the nucleus and can also induce stable Smad3-PARP-1 complexes <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Peroxide treatment in the absence of TGFÎ² stimulation caused dramatically higher levels of Smad3-PAR in the nuclei of HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We conclude that PLA can reliably monitor endogenous Smad3 ADP-ribosylation in human cells in culture. This method allowed us for the first time to observe the rapid and relatively transient time course of Smad3 ADP-ribosylation in response to TGFÎ² signaling.</p>

        <p>Smad3/PARP-1 complexes occurred even in the absence of TGFÎ² stimulation, but the incidence of complexes was higher after TGFÎ² stimulation for 0.5 h and lower after 1.5 h stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>), which persisted even up to 6 h after TGFÎ² stimulation (data not shown). As a positive control, we measured the endogenous Smad3/PARP-1 complexes after exposure of cells to a rapid and acute dose of hydrogen peroxide, which led to a very dramatic accumulation of the nuclear RCA signals that was much stronger than the accumulation achieved by TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). Multiple negative controls ascertained the specificity of detection of the endogenous Smad3/PARP-1 complexes: a) silencing of PARP-1 using siRNA reduced the nuclear RCA signals to almost background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Similarly, silencing of PARP-1 significantly reduced the Smad3/PARP-1 complexes after cell treatment with peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). b) Silencing PARP-2 using siRNA only weakly reduced the observed Smad3/PARP-1 complexes, suggesting that PARP-2 is not essential for the formation of complexes between R-Smad and PARP-1 but contributes partially to the formation of the complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). c) Controls with single PARP-1 or Smad3 antibody gave the absolute background signal of this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Formation of endogenous complexes between PARP-2 and R-Smads using the PLA approach in HaCaT cells after TGFÎ² or peroxide treatment was also studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Once more, PLA-positive RCA products were detected in the nucleus. The incidence of R-Smad/PARP-2 complexes was higher after TGFÎ² stimulation especially at 0.5 h and lower after 1.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), and persisted even up to 6 h after TGFÎ² stimulation (data not shown), while they were also increased by peroxide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). The negative controls of PLA with single antibodies and silencing of PARP-2 with the siRNA showed high degree of specificity in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, when the endogenous PARP-1 was silenced the R-Smad/PARP-2 complexes were significantly but not dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that PARP-1 only partly contributes to the formation of the complex between PARP-2 and R-Smad.</p>

        <p>Subsequently, we studied protein interactions by performing immunoprecipitation assays in embryonic kidney cells under conditions where all three Smad proteins (Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4) were overexpressed at stoichiometric levels to simulate endogenous Smad signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). We have found that expression of all three Smads leads to the formation of robust levels of Smad complexes and probing the cells with antibodies against the phosphorylated C-terminal of Smad2 or Smad3 indicated strong activation of these Smads, as if the cells produced autocrine TGFÎ² (data not shown). Both endogenous PARP-1 and PARP-2 were co-precipitated with the three Smads. The PARP-2 antibody used recognized two near migrating protein bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>) that both represent PARP-2 protein as both are lost after PARP-2-specific silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>). Interestingly only the slower migrating PARP-2 species co-precipitated with the Smads, while the faster migrating PARP-2 protein species showed weak association with the Smads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). We currently do not understand the reason behind this observation.</p>

        <p>We also detected endogenous complexes between R-Smad (Smad2/3) and PARP-1 and PARP-2 in HaCaT cells that were used for the PLA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). In this endogenous co-precipitation, PARP-1 formed complexes with R-Smads only after 0.5 h stimulation with TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). PARP-2 associated with R-Smads even without TGFÎ² stimulation, but its association was enhanced after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Immunoblotting with a Smad4 antibody revealed the TGFÎ²-dependent association of endogenous Smad4 with Smad2/3, serving as positive control of functional TGFÎ² signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Use of an isotype-matched control immunoglobulin (IgG) for the immunoprecipitation demonstrated very low level of co-precipitating non-specific proteins binding to the Smads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). By performing the siRNA-mediated knockdowns of each PARP protein, as done in the PLA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>), we confirmed that TGFÎ² signaling promotes distinct complexes of R-Smads with PARP-1 and with PARP-2, as well as with Smad4, the positive control for signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, silencing 80â90% of PARP-1 caused loss of R-Smad/PARP-1 complexes, but did not affect the R-Smad/PARP-2 complexes. Similarly, loss of 90% of PARP-2 did not affect the R-Smad/PARP-1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>). It is worth noting that by comparing PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>) with co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b, c</xref>), it appears as TGFÎ² is strongly required for formation of endogenous R-Smad/PARP complexes as judged by co-precipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4b, c</xref>), while such complexes occur also in the absence of TGFÎ² stimulation as judged by PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>). This may reflect the fact that PLA measures proximity between proteins but not necessarily formation of stable complexes, whereas the co-precipitation assay, especially after stringent washes with salt, measures the formation of more stable protein complexes. Furthermore, this difference could also indicate that the phosphorylation of Smads leads to a stronger and more stable interaction with PARP1 and PARP2 that better endures the immunoprecipitation protocol. We conclude that TGFÎ² signaling rapidly promotes R-Smad/PARP1 and R-Smad/PARP-2 complexes that reside in the nucleus.</p>

        <title>Induction of ADP-ribosylation by Smad proteins</title>
        <p>The in vivo ADP-ribosylation of endogenous Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and the endogenous complexes between R-Smad and PARP-1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">4</xref>) prompted further in vitro experiments.

We now tested the capacity of purified Smad proteins to associate with PARP-1 and PARP-2 and become poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated, using in vitro ADP-ribosylation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). Recombinant GST-Smads isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) and insect cell-derived PARP-1 and PARP-2 purified after baculovirus infection were added in reactions together with radioactive Î²-NAD, which served as the tracer that can reveal ADP-ribosylation on any of the proteins included in the reaction after separation on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). In addition, since the Smad proteins used were tagged with GST, we could perform glutathione-based pull down assays followed by SDS-PAGE, which allowed us to monitor ADP-ribosylated proteins simultaneously with their ability to form complexes and co-precipitate together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). In these experiments we tested three specific Smad variants, full length Smad3 N-terminally fused to GST, GST-Smad3 lacking its C-terminal Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain (GST-Smad3 ÎMH2) and full length GST-Smad4. The proteins were mixed in the same reaction vessel, incubated with radioactive Î²-NAD for 30 min and then proteins were precipitated; after washing, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.</p>
        <p>Using PARP-1 and PARP-2 together with GST as control, we observed only weak poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1, and very low levels of PARP-2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 1, 12; stars indicate PARP-2 migration). Co-incubation of PARP-1 with GST-Smad3 led to a robust ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lane 3) as previously established <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and reproduced the enhanced complex formation and activation of PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, compare the PARP-1 band in lanes 1 and 3). Addition of PARP-2 in the reaction together with PARP-1 and GST-Smad3 did not enhance Smad3 ADP-ribosylation but led to weak but detectable and reproducible poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lane 5). Similar results were obtained with GST-Smad3 ÎMH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 8â10), however, PARP-2 migrated exactly at the same position as GST-Smad3 ÎMH2 prohibiting us from observing effects on PARP-2 ADP-ribosylation; moreover, this deletion mutant led to detection of a more robust poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 and itself, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, due to the tighter association of the N-terminal Smad3 domain (MH1) with PARP-1. Interestingly, when GST-Smad4 was incubated with PARPs, we observed ADP-ribosylation of Smad4, but less efficient than the ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 as previously explained <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, Smad4 led to more efficient detection of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 than Smad3 (see thick smear migrating upwards in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 14, 16) and the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-2 was correspondingly enhanced (see long exposure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). PARP-2 alone did not ADP-ribosylate Smads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 4, 9, 15). As a control, excess amount of GST protein did not co-precipitate ADP-ribosylated proteins, neither did GST become ADP-ribosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lanes 1, 12).</p>
        <p>The above experiments reconfirmed our previous results that Smad3 and Smad4 can be directly ADP-ribosylated by PARP-1, and of the ability of Smad3 or Smad4 to stimulate interaction and activation of PARP-1 auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The data further demonstrate that Smads also bind and activate PARP-2, albeit much less efficiently. These in vitro experiments also suggest that purified PARP-1 is more catalytically active than purified PARP-2, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0103651-Schreiber2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and do not allow us to fully conclude whether the observed ADP-ribosylation of PARP-2 in the presence of PARP-1 and Smads is due to the activity of PARP-1 or PARP-2 itself. However, the weak but detectable auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-2 in experiments where PARP-1 was left out and Smad4 was co-incubated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>, lane 15) suggests that PARP-2 can exhibit genuine ADP-ribosylation activity, which is assisted by the presence of Smad4. We therefore conclude that one possible function of the observed protein complex between Smads, PARP-1 and PARP-2, is that the binding of Smads regulates or stabilizes the catalytically active form of these enzymes.</p>

As a control, peroxide treatment enhanced the nuclear PARP-1/PARP-2 complexes even further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>). Silencing of PARP-1 reduced the number of complexes significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Silencing PARP-2 also reduced the number of nuclear complexes, albeit not so efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). The loss of PLA-positive signals in these experiments reflected rather well the silencing efficiency, which was approximately 80% for PARP-1 and only 60% for PARP-2 (not shown).

        <p>The PLA experiments were reproduced using co-immunoprecipitation assays in the same cell system, measuring the endogenous complexes of PARP-1 and PARP-2 in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5câe</xref>). First, we established the efficient immunoprecipitation by the PARP-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>). Stimulation with TGFÎ² did not affect at all the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of PARP-1 as revealed by immunoblot with the same antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>). Then, by immunoprecipitating first PARP-1 or PARP-2 followed by immunoblotting with the reciprocal antibody gave evidence for the presence of PARP-1/PARP-2 complexes that were only weakly affected by TGFÎ² stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5c, d</xref>), as predicted from the PLA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Use of an isotype-matched control immunoglobulin (IgG) for the immunoprecipitation gave only low amounts of co-precipitating proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5a, b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then performed in situ PLA for PARP-1 and PARP-2 ADP-ribosylation and measured effects of TGFÎ² stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast to endogenous Smad3, which showed weak basal levels of ADP-ribosylation using the PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Figure 1</xref>), endogenous PARP-1 in the same cells, showed rather high level of RCA signals, compatible with an active PARP-1 enzyme that was ADP-ribosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Under the same conditions, PARP-2 showed weaker than PARP-1 but higher than Smad3 ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6c, d</xref>). Stimulation with TGFÎ² for 30 min resulted in measurable enhancement of ADP-ribosylation of PARP-1 and even more dramatic enhancement of ribosylation of PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6b,d</xref>). At 90 min after TGFÎ² stimulation ADP-ribosylation of both proteins decreased and especially for PARP-2 reached the same low levels as in control, unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6b,d</xref>). We therefore conclude that PARP-1 and PARP-2 complexes exist in the nucleus, and TGFÎ² either does not influence or only weakly affects this association, whereas TGFÎ² prominently promotes complexes of each PARP protein with Smads, and also promotes ADP-ribosylation of both PARP enzymes.</p>

        <title>Impact of PARP-2 on TGFÎ²-regulated gene expression</title>
        <p>Since PARP-2 and PARP-1 reside in the nucleus and we previously established that PARP-1 affects the transcriptional activity of Smads <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, we hypothesized that PARP-2 should be implicated in the same process. To investigate this possibility, we performed Smad-specific promoter-luciferase assays in cells where PARP-2 was either overexpressed or silenced by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7a, b</xref>). PARP-2 overexpression led to a weak but reproducible reduction of the Smad3/Smad4-specific CAGA<sub>12</sub>-luciferase promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7a</xref>). Conversely, silencing of endogenous PARP-2 almost tripled the response of the same promoter to TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7b</xref>). The impact of PARP-2 silencing on the promoter activity was as pronounced as that of PARP-1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). Finally, silencing of both PARP-1 and PARP-2 had a similar positive effect on promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7d</xref>), however, we never observed additive or synergistic effects when the two PARPs were silenced.</p>

        <p>The CAGA<sub>12</sub>-luciferase reporter provides an easy tool to assay directly the transcriptional activity of Smads. Endogenous regulatory sequences of various genes that respond to TGFÎ² are more complex and depend on the activity of Smad complexes, interacting transcription factors and many cooperating chromatin modulators and co-activators/co-repressors <xref rid="pone.0103651-Massagu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For this reason, the impact of PARP silencing on gene expression in response to TGFÎ² is more variable, gene-specific and cell context-specific <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This is corroborated by our efforts in measuring the impact of PARP-2 on TGFÎ² target genes after siRNA-mediated silencing of PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7g, h</xref>). We first established siRNA transfection conditions that showed specific silencing of PARP-2 without affecting PARP-1 expression and silencing of PARP-1 without any impact on PARP-2 expression, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7e, f</xref>). Under these conditions we measured the responsiveness of classic gene targets of TGFÎ²/Smad signaling, like <italic>fibronectin</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7g, h</xref>). PARP-1 silencing enhanced the response of both genes when measured after 9 h of TGFÎ² stimulation, while PARP-2 silencing led to more robust enhancement of the gene response. Silencing of both PARP-1 and PARP-2 had almost the same effect on gene expression in response to TGFÎ² as PARP-2 silencing alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7g, h</xref>). We therefore conclude that PARP-2, like PARP-1, can play a negative regulatory role in TGFÎ² signaling.</p>

First, we asked whether PARG can form complexes with the three Smads of the TGFÎ² pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). We could not identify a reliable antibody that could detect endogenous PARG levels in our cells, and thus, we transfected myc-tagged PARG in 293T cells together with each of the Flag-tagged Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8a</xref>).

Co-expression of all three Smads also showed the same robust co-precipitation of PARG in the same cell system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8b</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Smad2/3 from 293T cells resulted in efficient co-precipitation of the transfected myc-PARG, which was further enhanced after stimulation with TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8c</xref>).

        <p>We then investigated how the Smad ADP-ribosylation pattern is affected by increasing Î²-NAD levels. We incubated GST-Smad3 together with PARP-1 and radiolabeled Î²-NAD; pull-down of the bound proteins followed by electrophoresis and autoradiography resulted in detectable ADP-ribosylated Smad3 (radioactive band of the same size as GST-Smad3), as well as bound auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 appearing as a high molecular weight smear migrating slower than the core PARP-1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, lane 1). We then used a constant amount of radioactive Î²-NAD and increasing concentrations of unlabeled Î²-NAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, lanes 1â4). We observed ADP-ribosylation of GST-Smad3 under all Î²-NAD concentrations. Increasing the concentration of unlabeled Î²-NAD enhanced ADP-ribosylation of GST-Smad3 and PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, lane 2), but at higher concentrations the high amount of unlabeled Î²-NAD diluted the radiolabeled tracer and we recorded a loss in signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, lanes 3, 4). As expected, PARP-1 shifted upwards in size with increasing amounts of Î²-NAD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, top smear, lanes 2â3), illustrating the ability of PARP-1 to become poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated at one or several sites. At the highest concentrations of non-radiolabeled Î²-NAD, <sup>32</sup>P-ADP-ribosylation signals were competed out from PARP-1 to a large extent, due to the dilution effect mentioned above. In contrast to the smear of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 there was no shift in size of ADP-ribosylated GST-Smad3 despite the increased concentrations of Î²-NAD, only competition and loss of the sharp radiolabeled GST-Smad3 protein band could be observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). This suggests that, under in vitro conditions, PARP-1 mainly oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ates GST-Smad3 at one or a limited number of sites since excess of Î²-NAD fails to reveal high molecular size smears.</p>
        <p>Next, we tested whether PARG could de-ADP-ribosylate Smad3 by first performing ADP-ribosylation reactions with PARP-1 and GST-Smad3 as substrates, and then incubating with recombinant PARG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8d</xref>). The reaction with PARG efficiently removed ADP-ribosylation from GST-Smad3 in a dose-dependent manner. However, the radioactive signal could not be completely removed from the core GST-Smad3 protein species, which probably reflects the inability of PARG to cleave the last ADP-ribose unit, which is coupled to the protein substrate <xref rid="pone.0103651-Gagn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, the larger sized smears, most likely corresponding to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1, were efficiently removed by PARG. In summary, the glycohydrolase PARG can effectively process the added poly-/oligo(ADP-ribose) units from both GST-Smad3 and PARP-1, but fails to act as a mono(ADP-ribose) hydrolase as predicted from previous studies <xref rid="pone.0103651-Rosenthal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We also checked whether the hampered TGFÎ²-mediated gene induction seen after silencing PARG expression also had an impact on the corresponding induced protein levels. Indeed, when PARG expression was silenced, the fibronectin and PAI-1 protein levels were induced to lower levels than those seen in control cells after 9 and 24 h of TGFÎ² stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The difference at 9 h of stimulation was most noticeable, while after 24 h the differences were reproducible but smaller. No major effects on TGFÎ²-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 were found that could account for the changes seen on downstream fibronectin and PAI-1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This suggests that the observed effects of endogenous PARG silencing more likely reflect regulation at the transcriptional level.</p>

        <title>Silencing of PARP-1 rescues the PARG-mediated reduction of TGFÎ² signaling</title>
        <p>Since there are several factors that possess ADP-ribosylating capacity in the cell <xref rid="pone.0103651-Hottiger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and since PARG might also act through an ADP-ribosylation-independent mechanism, it was important to test if the gene expression effects, recorded by loss of PARG, were dependent on PARP-1. We designed rescue experiments where we tested if the perturbed induction of <italic>fibronectin</italic> and <italic>PAI-1</italic> mRNA by TGFÎ² under PARG silencing conditions could be relieved by simultaneous silencing of PARP-1. We knocked-down PARG alone or in combination with PARP-1 using the corresponding siRNAs and stimulated cells with TGFÎ² for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10a, b</xref>). Depleting PARG mRNA had again a reducing effect on TGFÎ²-induced expression of both <italic>fibronectin</italic> and <italic>PAI-1</italic> mRNA, although the effects were significantly less after this longer (24 h) stimulation. The combination of PARG and PARP-1 siRNA could fully rescue the signal back to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10a, b</xref>). However, it did not elevate signaling beyond control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10a, b</xref>), as seen when PARP-1 knockdown was performed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10b, c</xref>). This suggests that PARP-1 accounts for a large part of the changes seen on TGFÎ² signaling after PARG knockdown; however, it is possible that other ribosylating enzymes are involved. In summary, these data establish a role of PARG as a positive mediator, or a permissive factor, that controls the transcriptional responses to TGFÎ² signaling.</p>

For simplicity distinct complexes between Smads and PARP-1 and Smads and PARP-2 are not shown but their presence is supported by the experimental evidence. PARP-1/PARP-2 use NAD and oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ate Smad3 and Smad4 (ADP-ribose chains in red) and assist dissociation of Smads from DNA (as demonstrated in ref. <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). PARG associates with ADP-ribose chains on the Smad complex and removes ADP-ribose units (ADPr) possibly generating mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated Smads (not shown). PARG therefore promotes Smad association with DNA and is required for optimal gene expression in response to TGFÎ².</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The recent demonstration that TGFÎ² induces nuclear ADP-ribosylation, that Smad proteins associate directly with PARP-1, and that PARP-1 has regulatory impact on the functional output of the TGFÎ² pathway <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, prompted us to investigate deeper TGFÎ²-induced ADP-ribosylation and the role of two other known regulators of ADP-ribosylation, PARP-2 and PARG.</p>
      <p>By using antibodies against Smad3 and poly(ADP-ribose) chains, we managed to set up a specific assay that allowed us to study Smad3 ADP-ribosylation in a timely fashion. We have previously been unable to successfully perform such analysis using immunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, we found that TGFÎ² induced ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 rapidly. Specific PLA-positive RCAs were detectable already after 5 min, peaked at 10 min and were reduced to lower levels after 40â90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This suggests that ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 is likely regulating an early nuclear event after TGFÎ² stimulation. We have previously reported that PARP-1 regulates Smad3/4 binding to promoter DNA by ADP-ribosylating the MH1 domain <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This observation would fit well with the timing of ADP-ribosylation, since Smads enter the nucleus and interact with promoters early on after TGFÎ² stimulation. Higher resolution microscopy could reveal the nuclear locations of ADP-ribosylated Smad3 and chromatin organization analysis may provide new ideas about possible functions of this molecular modification that takes place during the first minutes of TGFÎ² signaling. PARP-1 may prevent binding of Smads that are not yet attached to the DNA or may facilitate detachment of Smads that are already bound to promoters, whereas TGFÎ²-mediated activation of PARP-1 may lead to ADP-ribosylation of other proteins associated with transcription, such as transcription factors, polymerases, or histones. These interesting open questions need to be further investigated.</p>
      <p>The analysis of PARP2 as regulator of TGFÎ²/Smad signaling was motivated by the current understanding that PARP-2 makes complexes with and functions in close association with PARP-1 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Yelamos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our results have shown that Smads form complexes with PARP-2 in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">4</xref>), and that Smads may enhance the ADP-ribosylation of PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). We have not been able to identify unique functions of Smad/PARP-2 versus Smad/PARP-1 complexes. On the other hand, these complexes form and are not necessarily dependent on each other, i.e. Smad/PARP-1 complexes to a large approximation do not depend on PARP-2 and Smad/PARP-2 complexes do not depend on PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">4</xref>). However, the complexes are not entirely independent from each other as seen in PLA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>), suggesting that the complexes may become more stable when PARP-1, PARP-2 and Smads come together. Cooperation of the Smad/PARP-1/2 complexes at the level of enzymatic activity is also supported by these experiments. In addition, PARP-2 seems to negatively regulate the direct, Smad-dependent transcriptional output of TGFÎ² signaling, similar to PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). We therefore propose that PARP-2 functions together with PARP-1 to negatively regulate nuclear and transcription-related functions of the Smad complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10c</xref>).</p>
      <p>The ability of PARP-2 to interact physically with PARP-1 has been previously established <xref rid="pone.0103651-Schreiber2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and the functional interplay between these two PARP family members has been well established in vitro in cell models and in vivo in mice, and under different physiological conditions <xref rid="pone.0103651-Yelamos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here, we have confirmed this physical association using the PLA technique <xref rid="pone.0103651-Sderberg1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which provides us with the capacity to visualize the location of the PARP-1/PARP-2 complexes and also allows us to measure rather accurately the abundance of such complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, the PARP-1/PARP-2 complexes could be localized only in cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>), and PLA allowed us to establish that these complexes are only weakly enhanced or stabilized upon relatively short (0.5â1.5 h) stimulation with TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>). This change is, however, compatible with the time frame of association of Smad proteins of the TGFÎ² pathway with PARP-1 and PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>). Thus, the data suggest that when Smad complexes enter the nucleus in response to TGFÎ² signaling, they meet and associate with PARP-1 and PARP-2 that are already in complex with each other.</p>
      <p>Another interesting corollary of the association between Smads and PARPs is the possible regulation of the enzymatic activity and resulting ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by the PARPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">4d</xref>). Previous reports demonstrated that TGFÎ² enhances ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins and of PARP-1 itself in cells <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The time frame of Smad3 ADP-ribosylation falls well inside the time window when Smads associate with PARP-1 and PARP-2 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>). Furthermore, the in vitro experiments have revealed that both Smad3 and Smad4 are capable of co-precipitating with activated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-2 and PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). In addition, the experiments suggest that PARP-1 is required for the more effective ADP-ribosylation of PARP-2 itself. However, we cannot preclude that this is an effect due to the quality of our purified PARP-2 protein. PLA experiments aiming at measuring PARP-1 and PARP-2 ADP-ribosylation corroborate the above conclusion as TGFÎ² appeared to enhance ADP-ribosylation of both enzymes, and this was much more dramatic in the case of PARP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of TGFÎ² on PARP-1 or PARP-2 ADP-ribosylation, as measured by PLA, coincided with the formation of Smad3-PARP-1/2 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">3</xref>). This suggests the possibility that as nuclear Smad complexes associate with PARP-1 and PARP-2, they may also enhance the ADP-ribosylation of these two proteins. Whether enhancement of PARP-1 and PARP-2 ADP-ribosylation by TGFÎ² was mediated by Smad3, or by the association of Smad3 with the PARP enzymes, could not yet been confirmed at the cellular level due to the relative failure of anti-PAR PLA after transfection with siRNAs or plasmids expressing cDNAs. Thus, the mechanism whereby Smads regulate ADP-ribosylation of PARPs requires deeper investigation. One possibility is that upon binding, Smads activate the catalytic activity of PARP-1 and PARP-2; alternatively, Smad binding to PARPs, exposes more effectively the auto-modification domain of PARPs, thus allowing more robust and stable ADP-ribosylation of the protein substrate. To explain these mechanistic details, deeper biochemical and structural studies are needed.</p>
      <p>We have also focused our attention on the pattern of Smad3 ADP-ribosylation in vitro and on the action of the enzyme PARG that cleaves off PAR chains from modified proteins <xref rid="pone.0103651-Gagn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. PARG exhibited robust complex formation with Smads of the TGFÎ² pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The lack of a reliable antibody did not allow us to measure fully endogenous complexes between PARG and Smads. However, despite transfection of cells with exogenous PARG, we could observe that TGFÎ² stimulation promoted the association of endogenous Smad2/3 with PARG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8c</xref>). Using recombinant PARG enzyme we then demonstrated that PARG is capable of de-ADP-ribosylating Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8d</xref>). Furthermore, increasing the Î²-NAD levels in the in vitro ribosylation assays showed that Smad3 is primarily oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). This is in contrast to PARP-1 itself that is clearly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. Development of new technology that can more effectively measure the degree of polymerization of ADP-ribose during protein ADP-ribosylation and de-ADP-ribosylation will be essential to resolve questions regarding poly(ADP-ribose) chain length and function in an unambiguous manner.</p>
      <p>Our observations support a model in which PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARG regulate ADP-ribosylation of Smad3 and the flow of Smad signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">8</xref>). While depletion of PARP-1 or PARP-2 led to enhancement of the transcriptional readout of TGFÎ² signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), depletion of PARG showed the opposite effect and significantly suppressed the amplitude of the TGFÎ² transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). This evidence suggests that optimal and average transcriptional responses to TGFÎ²/Smad signaling are balanced by the action of the two opposing enzymatic activities, the ADP-ribosyl-transferases (PARP-1/2) and the ADP-ribosyl glycohydrolase PARG. Since we could not achieve complete removal of the ADP-ribose chains from Smad3 after prolonged incubation with PARG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8d</xref>), we propose that additional enzymes may act in concert with PARG to completely de-ADP-ribosylate Smad3. Such proteins may be members of the ARH and macrodomain-containing protein families <xref rid="pone.0103651-Rosenthal1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. PARG has been shown to co-localize with PARP-1 along genomic sites in mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0103651-Frizzell1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This suggests that upon entry of the Smad complex to the nucleus and formation of higher order complexes with PARP-1 and PARP-2, PARG may also be available for incorporation into such complexes in order to regulate quantitatively the degree of Smad ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10c</xref>). Thus, nuclear PARG may constantly monitor the extent of Smad ADP-ribosylation by PARP-1/2 and provide dynamic control of the Smad-chromatin association/dissociation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10c</xref>). Alternatively, PARG may play a more important role at the onset of transcription in response to Smad signaling, thus guaranteeing the establishment of chromatin-bound Smad complexes. If this scenario stands true, the action of PARG may precede the action of PARP-1 during the time-dependent trajectory of Smad complexes along the chromatin.</p>
      <p>In addition, it is worth discussing the fact that evidence from different cell systems demonstrated that PARP-1 can act either as a negative regulator of physiological responses to TGFÎ², as is the case in epithelial cells (keratinocytes and mammary cells) <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and CD4-positive T cells <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, or as a positive regulator of TGFÎ² responses, as is the case in vascular smooth muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Our new data on the functional role of PARP-2 and PARG during regulation of TGFÎ²-mediated gene expression in keratinocytes supports the negative role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 and the positive role of PARG on such cellular responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">10</xref>). It will be of importance to explain the molecular mechanism behind this apparent cell context-dependency. All studies so far agree that PARP-1 ADP-ribosylates Smad3 <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and our new evidence suggests that Smad3 can also be de-ADP-ribosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). We therefore propose that depending on the cell type, the chromatin configuration on various genes that are destined to respond to TGFÎ²/Smad signaling interpret the molecular signal of Smad3 ADP-ribosylation and de-ADP-ribosylation in distinct ways. This is compatible with the positive or negative regulatory effects PARP-1 has on transcription of various genes <xref rid="pone.0103651-Krishnakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and also compatible with the current understanding on how Smad complexes regulate transcription, by reading the pre-existing code of local chromatin and thus providing differential gene regulation according to cell type, developmental stage and crosstalk with other signaling inputs that a given cell receives <xref rid="pone.0103651-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Lnn1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Massagu1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the new evidence that implicates PARP1/2 and PARG as regulators of Smad function and overall transcriptional control by the TGFÎ² pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g010">Fig. 10c</xref>), opens a new window of understanding of the molecular connections that exist between PARP family members and the central players of a major developmental signaling pathway. Since PARG silencing blocks basic TGFÎ² signaling responses, development of specific PARG inhibitors may provide a potential tool that could simultaneously modulate PARG and TGFÎ² activity during various diseases such as cancer <xref rid="pone.0103651-Gagn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103651-Miwa1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The present investigation opens the way for exploring such novel possibilities in basic biology and in the targeted therapy of disease.</p>

        <title>Proximity Ligation Assay</title>
        <p>HaCaT cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT) with agitation prior to double wash with 1ÃPBS for 5 min with agitation. The cells were incubated with Duolink II blocking solution for 1 h at RT with agitation (80 rpm), which was removed prior to adding primary antibodies. The antibodies were diluted in Duolink II antibody diluent 1â¶100 and the cells were incubated overnight at 4Â°C, with agitation (80 rpm). The cells were washed 3Ã3 min with Buffer A (Duolink, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala Sweden) prior to adding secondary probes (Duolink II), diluted with Duolink II antibody diluent 1â¶5. The cells were further incubated 2 h at 37Â°C with agitation (80 rpm), prior to 3Ã3 min wash with Buffer A. Duolink Ligation stock was diluted 1â¶5 in double distilled water and Duolink Ligase was added to the ligation solution from the previous step at a 1â¶40 dilution under vortex condition. Ligation solution was added to each sample and the slides were incubated in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 30 min at 37Â°C. The slides were washed with Buffer A for 2Ã2 min under gentle agitation and the wash solution was tapped off after the last washing. Duolink Amplification stock was diluted 1â¶5 in double distilled water and Ligation solution was tapped off from the slides. Duolink Polymerase was added to the Amplification solution at a 1â¶80 dilution under vortex condition. Amplification solution was added to each sample and the slides were incubated in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 90 min at 37Â°C and the slides were rinsed once with Buffer A. Phallodin 488 (1â¶40) and Hoechst (1â¶500) (both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB, Stockholm, Sweden), were added to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the slides were incubated at RT for 10 min prior to 2Ã10 min wash with Buffer B (Duolink II). Slides were rinsed with double distilled water and mounted with Slowfade (Invitrogen/Life Technologies-Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Stockholm, Sweden) mounting medium. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss AxioPlan2 epi-microscope. The DuolinkImageTool software (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala Sweden) was used for image analysis and signal quantification. Due to the antibody species specificity requirement in PLA assays, a rabbit anti-Smad3 antibody was combined with a mouse anti-PAR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The same rabbit anti-Smad3 antibody was combined with a mouse anti-PARP-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), whereas a mouse anti-Smad2/3 antibody was combined with a rabbit anti-PARP-2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The mouse anti-PARP-1 antibody was combined with the rabbit anti-PARP-2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), the mouse anti-PARP-1 antibody was combined with the rabbit anti-PAR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), and the rabbit anti-PARP-2 antibody was combined with the mouse anti-PAR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103651-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). It is therefore obvious that for some of the PLA assays it was technically impossible to compare directly the same antibodies (e.g. Smad3 against the various PARPs or PAR).</p>

        <p>293T or HaCaT cells were transfected with constructs, left without transfection and/or treated as explained in the figures. Total proteins from the cells were extracted in Nonidet-P 40 (NP-40) lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia AB, Bromma, Sweden) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting, as described previously <xref rid="pone.0103651-Kowanetz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Lysates were heated at 95Â°C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, cells were lysed in the above NP-40 lysis buffer 36â48 h after transfection or after the indicated times of TGFÎ² stimulation. The indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated, and after three washes in lysis buffer, including one wash in lysis buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies, as described in the figure legends.</p>

        <p>Newly prepared GST-vector or GST-Smad proteins were kept on glutathione beads and incubated in 100 Âµl PARP-1 reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol), with or without 100 ng PARP-1 or 100 ng PARP-2. Then, 80 nM Î²-NAD and 20 nM <sup>32</sup>P-Î²-NAD were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C while shaking. For reactions with excess cold NAD, instead of 80 nM Î²-NAD, 180, 480 or 980 nM Î²-NAD were included in separate reactions, reaching the total concentration of cold plus radioactive Î²-NAD to 200, 500 and 1,000 nM respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0103651.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). PARG incubations were performed in PARG reaction buffer containing (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM dithiothreitol) with and without PARG. At the end of each reaction, beads with GST fusion proteins were collected via centrifugation, followed by a quick double wash in ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer to remove excess radioactive Î²-NAD. Samples were then heated for 4 min at 95Â°C in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, stained with CBB and dried before measuring radioactivity in a Fuji-X Bio-Imager (FujiFilm Corp., Stockholm, Sweden).</p>
