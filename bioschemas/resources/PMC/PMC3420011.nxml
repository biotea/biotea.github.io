        <title>Summary</title>
        <sec>
          <p>A pharmacologic approach to male contraception remains a longstanding challenge in medicine. Toward this objective, we explored the spermatogenic effects of a selective small-molecule inhibitor (JQ1) of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of epigenetic reader proteins. Here, we report potent inhibition of the testis-specific member BRDT, which is essential for chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis. Biochemical and crystallographic studies confirm that occupancy of the BRDT acetyl-lysine binding pocket by JQ1 prevents recognition of acetylated histone H4. Treatment of mice with JQ1 reduced seminiferous tubule area, testis size, and spermatozoa number and motility without affecting hormone levels. Although JQ1-treated males mate normally, inhibitory effects of JQ1 evident at the spermatocyte and round spermatid stages cause a complete and reversible contraceptive effect. These data establish a new contraceptive that can cross the blood:testis boundary and inhibit bromodomain activity during spermatogenesis, providing a lead compound targeting the male germ cell for contraception.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Although â¼4% of the mammalian genome encodes genes expressed in male germ cells during spermatogenesis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Schultz etÂ al., 2003</xref>), contraceptive drugs for men have remained elusive. To date, the only drugs in clinical trials are testosterone analogs that alter endogenous androgen production, although there is a short list of other possible targets (e.g., GAPDHS) and drugs (e.g., gamendazole) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aitken etÂ al., 2008</xref>). This lack of contraceptive alternatives for men is partially responsible for the high rate of unplanned pregnancies, especially in teenagers, and contributes to the maternal mortality, ethical, social, and financial costs associated with abortions and deliveries to single mothers. To approach this dearth of contraceptive alternatives for men, we have undertaken to develop small molecules that could target spermatogenic-specific proteins that have been shown to be essential for both spermatogenesis and fertility in mammals. One such contraceptive target is the testis-specific and bromodomain-containing protein BRDT.</p>
      <p>BRDT is a tissue-restricted, chromatin-associated protein expressed in pachytene spermatocytes, diplotene spermatocytes, and round spermatids (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>). During postmeiotic maturation, BRDT localizes to the nucleus and reorganizes hyperacetylated histones through twin acetyl-lysine recognition modules, or bromodomains (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berkovits and Wolgemuth, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>). The essential role of BRDT in spermatogenesis is mediated by the first bromodomain (BRDT(1); <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A), which binds the tetra-acetylated amino-terminal tail of histone 4 (H4Kac4) with moderate potency (20Â Î¼M) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>). Structural studies of murine BRDT have demonstrated that BRDT(1) binds a diacetylated histone 4 peptide (H4K5ac8ac) in part through a conserved asparagine (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>), akin to other bromodomain coactivator proteins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dhalluin etÂ al., 1999</xref>). Genetic studies ofÂ BRDT have demonstrated that selective deletion of the BRDT(1)-encoding region is sufficient to confer sterility in homozygous hypomorphic male mice (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>), and a recently published genome-wide association study of idiopathic male infertility identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms of <italic>BRDT</italic> as significantly associated with oligozoospermia or azoospermia in European men (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aston etÂ al., 2010</xref>). These insights establish a compelling rationale to target BRDT for a contraceptive effect.</p>
      <p>Recently, we established the feasibility of targeting human bromodomains with acetyl-lysine competitive small molecules (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Our index study described a potent thienodiazepine inhibitor ((+)-JQ1; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B; <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>Â = 90Â nM) of the BET family coactivator protein BRD4, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer via transcriptional control of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delmore etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Zuber etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Protein sequence alignment of human BRD4(1) to human BRDT(1) reveals 81% identity and 89% similarity, including all surface residues predicted to contact (+)-JQ1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> available online). Based on these insights and preliminary evidence of binding to BRDT(1) established by differential scanning fluorometry (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos etÂ al., 2010</xref>), we endeavored to characterize the biochemical and functional effects of (+)-JQ1 on BRDT(1).</p>
      <p>We report here that direct inhibition of BRDT by a small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor exerts a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on spermatogenesis. Structural studies of BRDT(1) bound to JQ1 reveal ligand-receptor shape complementarity and complete occlusion of the acetyl-lysine recognition cavity. These and further biochemical studies establish the molecular mechanism of potent BRDT inhibition observed inÂ vivo, where JQ1 targets meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells, leading to impaired spermatogenesis and compromised motility. In mating studies, JQ1 accomplishes a complete and reversible contraceptive effect in males without adversely affecting testosterone levels or mating behaviors and without prompting obvious teratogenic effects in offspring. These results indicate that targeting a developmental epigenetic reader protein with an orally bioavailable small molecule can modulate male fertility for a contraceptive effect.</p>

        <title>Molecular Recognition of BRDT by JQ1</title>
        <p>To assess competitive binding to BRDT(1), we devised homogeneous, luminescence proximity assays that are capable of quantifying binding of a synthetic, biotinylated tetra-acetylated histone 4 peptide (H4Kac4, residues 1â20) to recombinant epitope-tagged murine or human BRDT(1). Dose-ranging studies of (+)-JQ1 demonstrated potent inhibition of H4Kac4 binding with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of 10Â nM for murine BRDT(1) and 11Â nM for human BRDT(1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). In contrast, the (â)-JQ1 enantiomer wasÂ inactive for either ortholog, establishing stereospecific, ligand-competitive binding. To confirm competitive inhibition of the acetyl-lysine binding module, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed on human BRDT(1), employing a synthetic H4Kac4 peptide in the presence and absence of (+)-JQ1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E). This peptide was found to bind two proteinÂ modules concomitantly with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of 25.5Â Î¼M, in good agreement with published data (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>). This interaction was directly inhibited in the presence of (+)-JQ1 that partially saturated the acetyl-lysine binding (ratio 1:0.8) due to solubility limits of the inhibitor. The remaining unoccupied sites bound the H4Kac4 peptide with identical affinity and expected stoichiometry (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Binding free energies and dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) determined by ITC for each bromodomain of human and murine BRDT confirm potent, specific (ratio 1:1) interactions with all domains (K<sub>D</sub>Â = 44â190Â nM; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F). Notably, (+)-JQ1 binds murine BRDT(1) with high ligand efficiency (LEÂ = 0.30), compared to reportedÂ inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wells and McClendon, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>The mode of binding of (+)-JQ1 to BRDT(1) was established by X-ray crystallography at high-resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Similar to the structure of murine BRDT(1) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>), human BRDT(1) exhibits the canonical structural features of a bromodomain, namely a left-handed bundle of four antiparallel Î± helices (Î±Z, Î±A, Î±B, and Î±C) and a hydrophobic acetyl-lysine binding pocket defined by interhelical ZA and BC loops (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Aâ2C) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dhalluin etÂ al., 1999</xref>). The observed, extraordinary shape complementarity between (+)-JQ1 and BRDT(1) explains the increased potency of (+)-JQ1 compared to the physiologic H4Kac4 ligand. In addition, (+)-JQ1 engages all surface residues analogous to those on murine BRDT(1) mediating molecular recognition of H4K5ac8ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E) (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">MoriniÃ¨re etÂ al., 2009</xref>). Notable examples include a hydrogen bond linking the triazole ring and the evolutionarily conserved asparagine (Asn109), as well as extensive hydrophobic contacts with the ZA and BC loop regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). These biochemical and structural studies confirm and explain potent, acetyl-lysine competitive inhibition of BRDT(1) by (+)-JQ1 (hereafter referred to as JQ1).</p>

        <title>Testis Bioavailability of JQ1</title>
        <p>To test the ability of JQ1 to reach its contraceptive target cells, the testicular bioavailability of JQ1 was assessed by serum and tissue pharmacokinetic analysis. Following a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of JQ1 (50Â mg/kg) in male mice, measurements of JQ1 concentration were made in serum, testis, and brain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). Overall, JQ1 exhibits excellent testicular bioavailability (AUC<sub>testis</sub>/AUC<sub>plasma</sub>Â = 259%), suggesting preferential distribution into this tissue compartment with rapid (T<sub>max</sub>Â = 0.25Â hr) and pronounced exposure (C<sub>max</sub>Â = 34Â Î¼g/ml). Corroborating barrier permeability by JQ1, nearly uniform blood-brain barrier permeability was observed after single-dose pharmacokinetic studies (AUC<sub>brain</sub>/AUC<sub>plasma</sub>Â = 98%).</p>

        <title>JQ1 Impairs Sperm Count and Motility</title>
        <p>To determine the possible consequences of blocking BRDT function inÂ vivo, we tested the spermatogenic effects of JQ1 administered to male mice. First, juvenile or adult male mice were administered daily i.p. injections of JQ1 (50Â mg/kg once daily [QD]) or vehicle control over a 3 or 6Â week period. After drug or vehicle treatment, mice were either sacrificed or mated to females while continuing to receive JQ1. All JQ1-treated males had a significant reduction in testis volume (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C). With daily injections of 50Â mg/kg JQ1, males treated from 3â6Â weeks of age showed a reduction to 75.4% of control, males treated from 6â9Â weeks of age showed a reduction to 54.7%, and males treated for 6Â weeks with JQ1 (6â12Â weeks of age) showed a reduction to 40.6% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). Thus, longer treatment with JQ1 has the most prominent effect on testicular volume.</p>
        <p>To examine the effect on sperm production, sperm counts were determined after JQ1 or vehicle treatment. Epididymal sperm number was reduced to 28% of control after 3Â weeks of 50Â mg/kg daily exposure (3â6Â weeks of age) and 11% of control after 6Â weeks of treatment (6â12Â weeks of age) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D). Analysis of sperm motility after 3Â weeks of JQ1 (50Â mg/kg QD) revealed a significant, 4.5-fold reduction in sperm motility (16.0% for the JQ1-treated versus 72.4% for the control; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E). Following 6Â weeks of daily JQ1, only 5% of the sperm demonstrated progressive motility compared to 85% of sperm from controls (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>). Thus, daily exposure to JQ1 quantitatively reduced sperm number and motility.</p>
        <p>Recently, the tolerability of twice-daily administration of JQ1 was reported in a confirmatory study of JQ1 in hematologic malignancies (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Mertz etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Pharmacokinetic study of twice-daily (BID) JQ1 (50Â mg/kg) confirmed excellent penetration of the blood:testis barrier and demonstrated a marked increase in drug exposure in the testis (AUC<sub>0â24hr</sub>Â = 96,640Â hr<sup>â</sup>ng/ml; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>F and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>), accompanied by apparent partitioning into this compartment (AUC<sub>testis</sub>/AUC<sub>plasma</sub>Â = 236%). With BID injections of JQ1 (JQ1 50Â mg/kg), adult males treated for 3Â weeks (9â12Â weeks) showed reduction in testis weight to 63.3% of controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>G). Paralleling the reduction in testis weights, BID treatment resulted in reduction in sperm in the cauda epididymis to 35.6% of the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>H), a dramatic 5.8-fold reduction in sperm motility (11.2% for JQ1-treated versus 64.5% for controls; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>I), firmly establishing the tolerability and antispermatogenic effect of BID JQ1 in mice. Altogether, these findings are similar to defects observed in mice deficient in BRDT(1) (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>).</p>

        <title>JQ1 Selectively Targets Male Germ Cells without Affecting Hormone Levels</title>
        <p>Based on the observed inhibition of spermatogenesis, we performed further mechanistic studies of BRDT inhibition. Consistent with the reduction in testis volume, the cross-sectional area of seminiferous tubules from testes of males treated daily from 3â6Â weeks with JQ1 were 84.9% of controls, males treated from 6â12Â weeks with JQ1 were 56.4%, and males treated from 9â12Â weeks with JQ1 BID were 65.0% of controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>J). Histological examination established a JQ1-dependent decrease in the amount and number of tubules that had obvious and abundant round spermatids and spermatozoa in the lumen (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>Aâ4H). This was particularly apparent in stage VII tubules, in which a marked reduction in round spermatids was observed in JQ1-treated mice. Of note, mice treated with JQ1 BID for 3Â weeks had a 79% reduction in round spermatids in stage VII tubules (112.7 Â± 7.4 [controls] versus 23.9 Â± 3.6 [JQ1-treated]; pÂ &lt; 0.0001). Analysis of epididymides of JQ1-treated males also showed a similar finding in which fewer sperm were observed in the epididymal lumen compared to their abundance in controls (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>). Detailed microscopic analysis of the testes of mice treated with JQ1 revealed seminiferous tubule degeneration, sloughing of germ cells, and multinucleated symplasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F and 4H; black arrows), findings also described in cyclin A1 (<italic>Ccna1</italic>) knockout mice, which are infertile due to a spermatocyte block (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Liu etÂ al., 1998</xref>). Thus, JQ1 treatment causes a block in spermatogenesis and a resultant reduction in testicular production of spermatozoa.</p>
        <p>Because absence of glycoprotein hormone and abrogation of androgen signaling pathways cause male infertility (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">MatzukÂ and Lamb, 2008</xref>), we measured the serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone after treatment with JQ1. Differences in the levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone were not statistically significant between control and JQ1-treated males (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FiguresÂ 3</xref>Kâ3M). Likewise, weights of the seminal vesicles, a major androgen-responsive tissue, were similar (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>). These results are consistent with the presence of histologically normal testosterone-producing Leydig cells in JQ1-treated males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B; red arrows). Thus, JQ1 effects are specific to germ cells and do not alter hormone-dependent processes.</p>

        <title>Molecular Analysis of the Germ Cell Defects in JQ1-Treated Testes</title>
        <p>To molecularly define the consequences of BRDT inhibition by JQ1, we performed genome-wide expression analysis of males treated with 50Â mg/kg JQ1 daily for 6Â weeks (6â12Â weeks of age). Hierarchical clustering separated samples by treatment assignment and identified 1,685 unique genes enriched or upregulated and 675 unique genes depleted or downregulated (2-fold or greater; Q valueÂ &lt; 0.05) with JQ1 exposure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). The broad transcriptional events observedâmore than an order of magnitude greater than prior studies of JQ1Â (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delmore etÂ al., 2011</xref>) âsuggested a pronounced effect on multistage differentiation more than selective effects on discrete transcriptional programs. Multiple germ-cell-expressed genes were suppressed upon treatment with JQ1, including <italic>Ccna1</italic> (expressed in pachytene spermatocytes), <italic>Msy2</italic> (pachytene spermatocytes and postmeiotic germ cells), polo-like kinase 1 (<italic>Plk1</italic>; diplotene and diakinesis stageÂ spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, and round spermatids), aurora kinase C (<italic>Aurkc</italic>; chromocenter clusters in diplotene spermatocytes), and A-kinase anchoring protein 4 (<italic>Akap4</italic>; postmeiotic germ cells). These results are significant because knockout mice lacking cyclin A1 have a spermatocyte block (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Liu etÂ al., 1998</xref>); <italic>Msy2</italic> knockout mice are sterile due to postmeiotic germ cell block and multinucleated spermatids (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Yang etÂ al., 2005</xref>); absence of AKAP4 prevents progressive motility (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Miki etÂ al., 2002</xref>); humans with aurora kinase C mutations demonstrate polyploid nuclei secondary to meiosis I arrest (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dieterich etÂ al., 2007</xref>); and the mammalian PLK1 protein, similar to fruit fly polo kinase, is believed to function in the completion of meiotic division.</p>
        <p>To determine the stages of spermatogenesis at which JQ1 functions, we then queried these data with functionally defined gene sets reflecting early (pachytene spermatocyte) or late (spermatid) transcriptional signatures (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Schultz etÂ al., 2003</xref>) and observed coordinate depletion (normalized enrichment score [NES]Â = â2.5 to â2.1; pÂ &lt; 0.001) in three independent modules by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).</p>
        <p>Our expression profiling results were confirmed and extended by gene-specific RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>). Genes expressed early in spermatogenesis such as <italic>Plzf</italic>, a spermatogonial marker, and <italic>Stra8</italic>, expressed in differentiating spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes, are 2.0- and 1.3-fold enriched, respectively, in testes of JQ1-treated mice compared to controls. In addition to <italic>Ccna1</italic>, <italic>Msy2</italic>, <italic>Plk1</italic>, <italic>Aurkc</italic>, and <italic>Akap4</italic>, other key genes expressed during meiosis or spermiogenesis, including <italic>Brdt</italic> (mid- to late-spermatocytes), <italic>Papolb</italic> (step 1â7 round spermatids), <italic>Klf17</italic> (step 4â7 spermatids), and <italic>Prm1</italic> (step 7â16 spermatids), are 2.1- to 7.3-fold lower in testes of mice treated with JQ1 versus control. Unlike the <italic>Brdt</italic> mutant mouse (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>), in which pachytene spermatocyte-expressed gene <italic>Hist1h1t</italic> is upregulated, JQ1 treatment leads to a 2.6-fold downregulation of this gene, in line with suppression of <italic>Brdt</italic>, <italic>Ccna1</italic>, <italic>Msy2</italic>, and <italic>Plk1</italic>. This difference is likely secondary to enhanced blockade of BRDT function by JQ1 in spermatocytes compared to the <italic>Brdt</italic> hypomorphic mouse.</p>
        <p>To further characterize the consequences of these molecular changes, we performed histological analysis of zona pellucida binding protein 1 (ZPBP1) and transition protein 2 (TNP2). ZPBP1 is an acrosomal matrix protein first detected in round spermatids as the acrosome forms (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Lin etÂ al., 2007</xref>), and TNP2 is expressed in the nuclei of step 10â15 spermatids during histone-to-protamine transition (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Zhao etÂ al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with transcriptional analysis, JQ1 treatment for 3 or 6Â weeks reduced the number of round spermatids, elongating spermatids, elongated spermatids, and spermatozoa that are positive for ZPBP1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>Aâ6D and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>) and TNP2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>E and 6F and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). Depending on the severity of the cellular loss in any specific tubule, JQ1 treatment caused variable losses of spermatocytes positive for GASZ (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>), a piRNA pathway protein expressed in pachytene spermatocytes in adults (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ma etÂ al., 2009</xref>). The significant effect of JQ1 on the seminiferous tubule compartment confirms the transfer of JQ1 across the blood:testis boundary to alter spermatogenesis.</p>
        <p>The Bradner laboratory has demonstrated a pronounced antimitotic effect of JQ1 on dividing cancer cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delmore etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos etÂ al., 2010</xref>). In BRD4-dependent cancers, the antitumor efficacy of JQ1 is associated with G1 cell-cycle arrest. Toxicity to proliferative compartments such as bone marrow or bowel has not been observed. To firmly exclude a BRD4-mediated, nonspecific antimitotic effect of JQ1 in testes, we stained testis sections for phosphorylated serine 10 of histone H3 (pH3Ser10), which accumulates in the nuclei of mitotic spermatogonia during chromatin condensation. Changes in pH3Ser10 are not seen, supporting a selective effect of JQ1 on spermatocytes and during spermiogenesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>G and 6H). Further supporting a nontoxic effect of JQ1 on spermatogonia, quantitative microscopic analysis failed to identify any statistically significant decrease in the abundance of cyclin-D1-positive nuclei or any increase in TUNEL-positive cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>In translational models of solid and hematologic malignancies, the cancer-specific antiproliferative activity of JQ1 has been mechanistically linked to addiction to the <italic>BRD4</italic> proto-oncogene (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Filippakopoulos etÂ al., 2010</xref>) or oncogenic <italic>MYC</italic> (a BRD4 target gene) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delmore etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Zuber etÂ al., 2011</xref>). In cancer models, BET bromodomain inhibition by JQ1 results in the coordinated downregulation of the Myc transcriptional program (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delmore etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Zuber etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Though <italic>Myc</italic> is expressed in type B spermatogonia and early prophase spermatocytes (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Wolfes etÂ al., 1989</xref>), JQ1 exposure did not suppress the expression of MYC target genes, as assessed by GSEA using the functionally defined MYC signature validated by Dang and colleagues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C) (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Zeller etÂ al., 2003</xref>). Paradoxically, MYC-dependent genes trended toward increased expression (NESÂ = 1.8; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), possibly due to enrichment of spermatogonial RNA amidst depletion of spermatids and spermatozoa. Together, these orthogonal measurements of spermatogonial transcription, appearance, and function rule out a nonspecific antiproliferative effect of JQ1 on BET bromodomains within mitotic germ cells.</p>

        <title>BRDT Inhibition Confers a Reversible Contraceptive Effect in Males</title>
        <p>To determine the effects of alternative JQ1 treatment regimens on the fertility of male mice, JQ1 (50Â mg/kg/day) and vehicle control were each delivered to 10 male mice for 6Â weeks. To ensure that JQ1 and vehicle were having proper effects, three males from each group were sacrificed and were shown to have reduced testis size (control: 107.4 Â± 8.8; JQ1: 62.8 Â± 7.5Â mg; pÂ &lt; 0.05), sperm counts (control: 12.3 Â± 0.6Â Ã 10<sup>6</sup>; JQ1: 3.8 Â± 0.3Â Ã 10<sup>6</sup>; pÂ &lt; 0.0001), and sperm motility (control: 72.4 Â± 2.5%; JQ1: 16.0 Â± 0.1%; pÂ &lt; 0.0001). After this pretreatment period, the remaining seven JQ1-treated and seven control males were mated continuously to two adult females per male while continuing to receive JQ1 or vehicle. After the first month of breeding, the seven control males had sired 14 litters of offspring. However, only four of the seven JQ1-treated males sired offspring (only six litters of offspring and a reduced number of pups). For the three JQ1-treated males that had not yet sired offspring, these mice demonstrated normal mating behavior as evident by the presence of copulation plugs. Thus, even at a low dose of JQ1, there is a partial contraceptive effect.</p>
        <p>As the mice appeared to be healthy at 50Â mg/kg/day of JQ1, we escalated the dosage of JQ1 in the second mating month to 75Â mg/kg/day. The male mice appeared to fall into two groups: those that show a contraceptive effect with 50Â mg/kg/day followed by 75Â mg/kg/day (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A) and those that still produced at least one litter under this lower-dose regimen (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). For the three mice that were most responsive to the low-dose regimen, only one was able to sire a litter of two offspring (born on the first day of month 2). For the latter group, the four males that sired offspring were treated in mating month 3 with 50Â mg/kg twice per day. These males were not observed to sire any offspring in month 3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). Thus, depending on individual variability of each of the males, total daily dosages between 50 and 100Â mg/kg can produce a complete contraceptive effect in male mice.</p>
        <p>To assess the reversibility of the JQ1-induced contraceptive effect, we examined whether fertility returned after JQ1 treatment was halted. Among the three infertile mice treated with the low-dose regimen, infertility remained complete at 1Â month of recovery (mating month 3), indicating a durable effect of JQ1 on spermatogenesis. However, in mating month 4, all three males sired offspring with a statistically similar number of pups per female as observed for the controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A). The average days to effective copulation was estimated to be 31.7 Â± 6.0Â days (range: 26â38Â days) based on the birth of the first litters after treatment was stopped and the 19Â day gestation period of mice. After a total mating period of 7Â months (i.e., 4Â months after halting the low-dose regimen), testis volume, seminiferous tubule area, testis histology, sperm motility, and sperm counts were statistically similar to the control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>Câ7E and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>), consistent with fully recovered fertility. Thus, mice treated with JQ1 at 50Â mg/kg/day and then 75Â mg/kg/day recover fertility within 6Â weeks of withholding the drug and show no long-term effects of JQ1 treatment. For the mice that required escalation to the high-dose regimen (50Â mg/kg BID), JQ1 was halted after the first month of this treatment (i.e., treatment month 3). In months 4 and 5, these males failed to sire offspring (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). However, all JQ1-treated males sired offspring in month 6 and sired similar litter sizes as controls in months 6â8. The average days to effective copulation forÂ this cohort was estimated to be 65.7 Â± 7.7Â days (range: 58â81Â days). Thus, longer JQ1 treatment and/or the increased dosage of JQ1 resulted in an extended (â¼1Â month) period of infertility.</p>
        <p>To more precisely determine the integrity and function of the testes and spermatozoa following withdrawal of JQ1 therapy, two additional independent experiments were performed. In the first experiment, JQ1-treated adult male mice were examined at the end of 6Â weeks of treatment (50Â mg/kg/day) or after 2 or 4Â months following cessation of therapy. After 2Â months, the testis weight and sperm counts and motility were increased, and after 4Â months, the weights and sperm parameters approached normal levels (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>). Histologically, seminiferous tubules of JQ1-treated mice are indistinguishable from controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>I and 7J). In the second experiment, a cohort of mice was treated with vehicle or 3Â weeks of high-dose JQ1 (50Â mg/kg BID). Mice were sacrificed at 3Â weeks of treatment and 10, 30, and 60Â days after JQ1 withdrawal. Males treated with high-dose JQ1 continue to show defects in testicular parameters 30Â days after halting treatment but exhibit complete recovery of all parameters within 60Â days (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>Fâ7H), consistent with the documented recovery of fertility. Thus, depending on duration and overall dosage of JQ1, testicular and semen parameters normalize within 1â3Â months to allow productive copulation and return of fertility.</p>
        <p>Lastly, offspring that were born from JQ1-treated males showed normal size, activity, and behavior as offspring born from controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>K and data not shown). When offspring from vehicle and JQ1-treated fathers were allowed to mate with adult females (2 females/cage) at 6Â weeks of age, both sets of males (nÂ = 6 for each group) displayed normal mating behavior, sired offspring from each female, and produced statistically similar litter sizes from matings over the first month (control: 7.73 Â± 0.70 pups/litter; JQ1: 7.50 Â± 0.34 pups/litter). At 11Â weeks of age, the testis weights (control: 98.7 Â± 2.8Â mg; JQ1: 95.8 Â± 3.2Â mg), sperm counts (control: 11.8 Â± 0.3Â Ã 10<sup>6</sup>; JQ1: 11.2 Â± 0.6Â Ã 10<sup>6</sup>), and sperm motility (control: 69.5 Â± 1.7%; JQ1: 69.8 Â± 1.3%) of the offspring were statistically similar. Together, these findings indicate that JQ1 did not have any long-term transgenerational effects on testis physiology or reproductive capacity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using a highly potent and selective chemical probe, our studies provide pharmacologic validation of the amino-terminal bromodomain of BRDT as a target for male contraception. JQ1 emerges as a lead compound for a new class of drugs that can cross the blood:testis boundary, inhibit bromodomain activity during spermatogenesis, impair sperm generation and motility, and produce a reversible contraceptive effect in mammals. These data support JQ1 as the first contraceptive agent that selectively and reversibly targets the male germ cell.</p>
      <p>Modulation of chromatin structure during spermatogenesis by an inhibitor of an epigenetic reader protein, such as BRDT, raises concern for epigenetic developmental abnormalities in progeny born to animals on treatment or following cessation. To date, we have not identified any anomalous phenotypes in offspring during or following exposure to JQ1. Targeting the male germ cell might raise concern for irreversible toxicity and resultant infertility. We have only observed full recovery of fertility in treated males; testis size, seminiferous tubule diameter, histological appearance, sperm number and motility, and fertility of JQ1-treated males recover to the levels of controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>). These observations are consistent with the restricted expression of the BRDT target in pachytene spermatocytes through round spermatids and with the function of BRDT in these stages to promote spermatogenesis. Indeed, the phenotype ofÂ mice treated with JQ1 closely resembles the seminal findingsÂ by Wolgemuth and colleagues in the characterization of BRDT(1) hypomorphic mice (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2007</xref>). We cannot rule out that some of effects of JQ1 are through inhibition of other members of the BET subfamily that are also expressed in murine testes (e.g., BRD4 [mRNA expressed in spermatogonia], BRD2 [diplotene spermatocytes], and BRD3 [round spermatids]) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Shang etÂ al., 2004</xref>). However, the mitotic status of spermatogonia is unaltered in the JQ1-treated males, and we do not observe end-organ toxicity in testis or other tissues in mice, such as the gastrointestinal mucosa, suggestive of a generalized antimitotic effect, as might be expected with inhibition of BRD4 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dey etÂ al., 2003</xref>). Unequivocally, JQ1 is a BET family inhibitor that exerts its contraceptive effect on the male germline during the peak of expression of BRDT.</p>
      <p>This chemical genetic study of bromodomain inhibition for male contraception provides pharmacologic target validation, encourages further drug development efforts, and offers insights guiding and enabling pharmaceutical BRDT inhibitor development. As this index study closely examines effects on human and murine BRDT, further study of additional species may be relevant for drug development. Toward this objective, we have completed preliminary studies of JQ1 in rats in which we have observed excellent pharmacologic exposure to JQ1 by i.p. injection (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S5</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>) and have identified a tolerated dose (10Â mg/kg BID), which is effective in reducing testis mass, sperm count, and motility (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5</xref>BâS5D), accompanied by comparable histological evidence of impaired spermiogenesis (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S5</xref>E). For a chemical probe intended for laboratory research, JQ1 has excellent drug-like properties yet possesses a short terminal elimination half-life. Pharmacokinetic studies performed herein demonstrate that excellent drug exposure can be accomplished with twice-daily administration. TheÂ observed complete contraceptive effect of JQ1 when given twice daily suggests that more continuous inhibition of BRDT-dependent effects on spermatogenesis may be required for clinical translation of this research.</p>
      <p>We are currently creating and testing the effects of JQ1 derivatives possessing selectivity for BRDT to extend the favorable therapeutic window of BRDT inhibition for male contraception. Recently described tool compounds of BET bromodomains provide divergent putative scaffolds for lead optimization (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Chung etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dawson etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Nicodeme etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Compounds that demonstrate higher affinity and specificity for BRDT would be expected to reduce any possible long-term, adverse effects of a pan-BET bromodomain inhibitor. Structural and sequence comparisons of BRDT(1) and BRD4(1) reveal differences in surface residues that may be explored to develop further isoform-selective BET inhibitors. Because human and mouse BRDT proteins are highly conserved and have nearly identical bromodomain pockets based on our structural predictions, we envision that our discoveries can be completely translated to men, providing a novel and efficacious strategy for a male contraceptive.</p>

        <title>Mouse Contraceptive Studies</title>
        <p>(+)-JQ1 was dissolved in DMSO at 50Â mg/ml, 75Â mg/ml, or 100Â mg/ml andÂ then diluted 1:10 in 10% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-Î²-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich)Â or 20% Captisol (CYDEX, Lenexa, KS). The mixture was injected i.p. into male mice at 1% of the body weight (50Â mg/kg or 75Â mg/kg) or 0.5% of the body weight for the 50Â mg/kg BID injections. The control wasÂ DMSO dissolved 1:10 in 10% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-Î²-cyclodextrin or 20% Captisol and injected similarly. Juvenile or adult C57BL6/J/129S5 hybrid mice for these studies were weighed daily before injections and fed ad libitum.</p>
        <p>For mating studies, males were pretreated for 6Â weeks with vehicle or JQ1Â and caged continuously with two females each while continuing 50 mpk QD for month 1 and escalating to 75Â mg QD for month 2. The JQ1-treated males that were responsive to this âlow-doseâ treatment regimen were allowed to recover untreated while continuing to breed to 2 females per cage through 7Â months of continuous breeding. Males that continued to sire offspring in month 2 were treated in month 3 of breeding with 50Â mg/kg BID (âhigh-doseâ regimen), and JQ1 treatment was stopped for these males and controls while continuing to breed to 2 females per cage through 8Â months of continuous breeding. Cages were checked daily, and offspring born per each female were recorded.</p>
        <p>For the recovery studies, males were sacrificed post-JQ1 and control treatment, and testis and sperm parameters were determined. These studiesÂ were approved by the Administrative Committee on Laboratory AnimalÂ Care at Baylor College of Medicine, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>

              <title>Protein Expression and Purification</title>
              <p>Colonies from freshly transformed plasmid DNA in competent <italic>E.Â coli</italic> BL21(DE3)-R3-pRARE2 cells (phage-resistant derivative of BL21(DE3) cell [Invitrogen] with a pRARE-plasmid-encoding rare codon tRNA) were grown overnight at 37Â°C in 5Â ml of Luria-Bertani medium (LB-broth, Merck) with 50Â Î¼g/ml kanamycin and 34Â Î¼g/ml chloramphenicol (startup culture). The startup culture was diluted 1:1,000 in fresh medium, and cell growth continued at 37Â°C to an optical density of about 0.3 (OD600) before the temperature was decreased to 18Â°C. When the system equilibrated at 18Â°C and the optical density was about 0.6 (OD600), protein expression was induced overnight at 18Â°C with 0.1Â mM isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (8,700Â Ã <italic>g</italic> for 15Â min at 4Â°C, JLA 81,000 rotor, on a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20 XP centrifuge) and were frozen at â20Â°C as pellets for storage. Cells expressing His6-tagged protein were resuspended in lysis buffer (50Â mM HEPES [pH 7.5] at 25Â°C, 500Â mM NaCl, 10Â mM Imidazole, 0.5Â mM TCEP) in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (1Â Î¼l/ml) and were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 high-pressure homogenizer (Avestin [Mannheim, Germany]) at 4Â°C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (17,000Â Ã <italic>g</italic> for 30Â min at 4Â°C, JA 25.50 rotor, on a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-20 XP centrifuge) and was applied to a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column (DE52 anion exchanger, Whatman Int. Ltd, 10 gr in 100Â ml of 2.5Â M NaCl, equilibrated with 100Â ml lysis buffer) that was serially connected to a nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose column (Ni-NTA, QIAGEN Ltd., 5Â ml, equilibrated with 20Â ml lysis buffer). The column ensemble was washed with 50Â ml of lysis buffer, and the DE52 column was discarded. The Ni-NTA column was washed twice with 10Â ml of lysis buffer containing 30Â mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted using a step elution of imidazole in lysis buffer (50, 100, 150, 2Â Ã 250Â mM imidazole in 50Â mM HEPES [pH 7.5] at 25Â°C, 500Â mM NaCl). All fractions were collected and monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Criterion Precast Gels, 10%â20% Tris-HCl 1.0Â mm, from Bio-Rad, CA; Gel electrophoresis conditions: 180 V, 400 mA, 55Â min in SDS buffer). After the addition of 10Â mM dithiothreitol (DTT), the eluted protein was treated overnight at 4Â°C with TEV protease to remove the hexa-histidine tag. The proteins were further purified with size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 16/60 HiLoad gel filtration column (GE/Amersham Biosciences) on an ÃktaPrime plus system (GE/Amersham Biosciences). Samples were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, concentrated to 10â40Â mg/ml in the elution buffer, 10Â mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150Â mM NaCl, and 0.5Â mM TCEP and were used for crystallization. Protein handling was carried out on ice or in a cold room in all of the above steps.</p>

              <title>BRDT Proximity Assay</title>
              <p>For the AlphaScreen assays, all reagents were diluted in 50Â mM HEPES, 150Â mM NaCl, 0.1% w/v BSA, and 0.01% w/v Tween20 (pH 7.5) and were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to addition to plates. After addition of Alpha beads to master solutions, all subsequent steps were performed in low-light conditions. A 2Ã solution of components with final concentrations of BRDT at 80Â nM, Ni-coated Acceptor Bead at 25Â Î¼g/ml, and 80Â nM biotinylated H4-tetra acetyl was added in 10Â Î¼l to 384-well plates (AlphaPlate - 384, PerkinElmer, USA). Biotinylated peptide for BRDT was synthesized in-house on a CEM Liberty 9008005 microwave peptide synthesizer: H4-tetra acetyl, Biotin-PEG2-SGRGKacGGKacGLGKacGGAKacRHRK-COOH. Addition to wells was performed with either a multichannel pipet (for optimization experiments) or a Biotek EL406 liquid handler. After a 1Â min 1000Â rpm spin-down, 100 nl of compounds from stock plates were added by pin transfer using a Janus Workstation (PerkinElmer, USA). The streptavidin-coated donor beads (25Â Î¼g/ml final) were added as with previous solution in a 2x, 10Â Î¼l volume. Following this addition, the plates were sealed with foil to block light exposure and to prevent evaporation. The plates were spun down again at 1000Â rpm for 1Â min, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1.5Â hr prior to reading the assay.</p>

              <p>Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were carried out at 10Â°C in 50Â mM HEPES pH 7.5 (at 25Â°C), 150Â mM NaCl. The calorimetric cell was loaded with a solution of the protein sample (54Â Î¼M protein or an equimolar mixture of 54Â Î¼M protein and (+)-JQ1, in 50Â mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150Â mM NaCl). The peptide (1.5Â mM in 50Â mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150Â mM NaCl) was loaded into the micro-syringe. Titrations were conducted using an initial control injection of 2Â Î¼l followed by 30 identical injections of 8Â Î¼l. The collected data were corrected for peptide heat of dilution (measured on a separate experiment by titrating the peptide into 50Â mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150Â mM NaCl) and normalized using the MicroCal Origin software supplied with the instrument. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the basic equation of thermodynamics (ÎGÂ = ÎH - TÎSÂ = -RTlnKB, where ÎG, ÎH and ÎS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy and entropy of binding respectively). In all cases, a single binding site model was employed, supplied with the MicroCal Origin software package.</p>
