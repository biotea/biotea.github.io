        <p>TRAF-interacting protein (TRIP) negatively regulates TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâinduced IFN-Î² signaling by promoting K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TBK1.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) plays an essential role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)â and retinoic acidâinducible gene I (RIG-I)âmediated induction of type I interferon (IFN; IFN-Î±/Î²) and host antiviral responses. How TBK1 activity is negatively regulated remains largely unknown. We report that TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)âinteracting protein (TRIP) promotes proteasomal degradation of TBK1 and inhibits TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâinduced IFN-Î² signaling. TRIP knockdown resulted in augmented activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and enhanced expression of IFN-Î² in TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâactivated primary peritoneal macrophages, whereas overexpression of TRIP had opposite effects. Consistently, TRIP impaired Sendai virus (SeV) infectionâinduced IRF3 activation and IFN-Î² production and promoted vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIP negatively regulated the cellular levels of TBK1 by directly binding to and promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1. Therefore, we identified TRIP as a negative regulator in TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâtriggered antiviral responses and suggested TRIP as a potential target for the intervention of diseases with uncontrolled IFN-Î² production.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Host cells express various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acidâinducible gene I (RIG-I)âlike helicases (RLRs), which sense invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">OâNeill, 2008</xref>). Once recognition of microbial components, such as LPS, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), and viral RNA, TLRs, and RLRs, are activated, they initiate a series of signaling events leading to production of type I IFN (IFN-Î±/Î²) and proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">OâNeill, 2008</xref>).</p>
    <p>TLRs recruit a set of intracellular TIR domainâcontaining adaptors, including myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and TIR domainâcontaining adapter inducing IFN-Î² (TRIF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beutler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). MyD88 is a universal adaptor that activates inflammatory pathways; it is shared by all TLRs with the exception of TLR3. Recruitment of MyD88 leads to the phosphorylation of IRAKs (IL-1Râassociated kinases) and subsequent activation of TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, allowing for the activation of NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the induction of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beutler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). TRIF is recruited to TLR3 and TLR4 and activates an alternative pathway (TRIF-dependent pathway). TRIF associates with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and activates downstream IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), mediating TLR3- and TLR4-activated type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beutler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). RLRs comprise three cytoplasmic DExDâH-box RNA helicases, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Takeuchi and Akira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>). The helicases RIG-I and MDA5 have been found to recognize viral RNAs and poly(I:C) in the cytoplasm and subsequently recruit another antiviral signaling adaptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also called IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA), to initiate IFN-Î² signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Takeuchi and Akira, 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>Although full activation of TLR and RIG-I signaling and secretion of type I IFNs are important for the elimination of invading microorganisms, inappropriate production of IFN-Î² and proinflammatory cytokines might promote the development of immunopathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banchereau and Pascual, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GonzÃ¡lez-Navajas, et al., 2012</xref>). TBK1 is essential for both TLR and RLR signaling and is required for activation of IRF3 and subsequent induction of IFN-Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Takeuchi and Akira, 2009</xref>). The active state of TBK1 is tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. GSK-3Î² promoted TBK1 dimerization and autophosphorylation in virus-triggered type I IFN induction and cellular antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lei et al., 2010</xref>). Nrdp1 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination and promotes TBK1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). The mindbomb E3 ligases (MIB1 and MIB2) have been proposed to activate TBK1 by catalyzing its K63-linked polyubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2011</xref>). During the revision of the manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al. (2012)</xref> reported that NLRP4 could recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4 to TBK1 for Lys48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitination, which led to degradation of TBK1. However, how TBK1 activity is negatively regulated remains largely unknown.</p>
    <p>TRAF-interacting protein (TRIP, or TRAIP) was initially identified as a TRAF1- and 2-interacting protein that functions to inhibit NF-ÎºB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). TRIP contains an N-terminal RING finger and coiled-coil and leucine zipper regions that bind TRAF-family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse et al., 2007</xref>) and a C-terminal region reported to interact with CYLD that facilitate the inhibition of TNF-mediated NF-ÎºB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Regamey et al., 2003</xref>). TRIP interacts with the protein tyrosine kinase Syk and sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhou and Geahlen, 2009</xref>). TRIP plays important roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression and keratinocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, TRIP-deficient mouse embryos died shortly after implantation as a result of proliferation defects and excessive cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Park et al., 2007</xref>). TRIP possesses RING-dependent Ub ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse et al., 2007</xref>), but its substrate and physiological functions remain largely unclear.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we identified TRIP as a new regulator in TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâmediated IFN-Î² signaling and antiviral responses by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1 through the N-terminal RING domain. The identification of a physiological suppressor of TBK1 provides an explanation on the inability of the kinase to activate the IFN pathways under physiological conditions.</p>

      <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
      <sec>
        <title>TRIP expression is induced by TLR stimulation in macrophages</title>
        <p>To determine the potential role of TRIP in TLR signaling, we analyzed its expression upon stimulation with TLR agonists. TRIP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) expression were both significantly increased in mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS (TLR4 ligand). TRIP expression was up-regulated after 4 h of stimulation and reached the peak level of expression at 8 h. After 24 h, TRIP expression declined to the basal level as in untreated cells. TRIP expression was also up-regulated in mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand) or infected with Sendai virus (SeV; unpublished data). Collectively, these data indicate that TRIP was up-regulated after TLR activation and SeV infection in macrophages, raising a possibility that TRIP may be involved in this signaling transduction.</p>

        <p>A previous study identified the localization of overexpressed TRIP as predominantly perinuclear in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Regamey et al., 2003</xref>). Another study identified that endogenous TRIP and exogenously overexpressed TRIP predominantly localize in the nucleus in MCF7 cells and a small portion of TRIP localizes in punctate cytoplasmic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhou and Geahlen, 2009</xref>). To investigate the subcellular localization of TRIP, GFP-TRIP was transfected into HeLa cells, followed by immunofluorescence staining and microscopic analysis. We found that TRIP was presented by small speckled structures diffused throughout the cell and that its expression pattern remains unchanged after TLR4 activation (unpublished data). Collectively, these data indicate that TRIP diffused in the whole cytoplasm and nucleus.</p>

        <title>TRIP negatively regulates TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâinduced IFN-Î² production</title>
        <p>To investigate whether TRIP plays a role in TLR signaling, we initially examined the effects of TRIP on LPS- and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² production in macrophages. Two synthesized interfering RNAs targeting mouse TRIP were used to suppress endogenous TRIP expression. TRIP expression was significantly decreased with transfection of TRIP specific small interference RNAs (siRNAs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). TRIP knockdown substantially increased LPS- and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² production in mouse peritoneal macrophages at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). TRIP siRNA 1, which has a higher efficiency to knockdown TRIP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1C</xref>), has a greater potential to increase the TLR3/4-induced IFN-Î² production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Therefore, TRIP siRNA 1 was used in the following experiments. To further confirm the negatively regulatory role of TRIP in TLR3/4-mediated IFN-Î² production, the effect of TRIP on LPS- and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² luciferase reporter gene expression was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. TRIP overexpression significantly decreased LPS- and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² reporter activation in mouse peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Consistently, TRIP overexpression also significantly decreased poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² reporter activation in HEK293-TLR3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p>
        <p>RIG-I is a key PRR for the detection of RNA virus (such as SeV and vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]) and poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Takeuchi and Akira, 2009</xref>). To address the physiological function of TRIP in RIG-Iâinduced IFN-Î² production, HEK293 cells were transfected with poly(I:C) to activate RIG-I signaling. RIG-Iâinduced up-regulation of IFN-Î² and TNF was attenuated in TRIP-overexpression HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate whether TRIP specifically inhibited TLR and RLR pathways, we observed the effect of TRIP on IFN-Î³âinduced activation of GAS and iNOS promoter reporter in RAW264.7 cells. TRIP could not inhibit IFN-Î³âinduced activation of GAS reporter and iNOS reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). As a parallel control, TRIP overexpression was significantly decreased LPS- and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² reporter activation in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that TRIP specifically repress TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâinduced IFN-Î² signaling.</p>

        <title>TRIP inhibits IRF3 activation</title>
        <p>IRF3 is the key transcription factor that mediates the expression of IFN-Î² in TLR3/4- and RIG-Iâmediated signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doyle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>). We then observed the effect of TRIP on IRF3 activation. TRIP significantly inhibited LPS- and poly(I:C)-induced IRF3 reporter activation in mouse peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To address the function of TRIP in RIG-Iâinduced IRF3 activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with poly(I:C) to activated RIG-I signaling. TRIP significantly attenuated RIG-Iâinduced IRF3 reporter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). TRIP also significantly inhibited RIG-Iâ, MAVS-, and TBK1-dependent IRF3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, TRIP overexpression inhibited RIG-Iâinduced phosphorylation of IRF3 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). To investigate the physiological function of TRIP in IRF3 activation, mouse peritoneal macrophages were transfected with TRIP siRNA 1. TRIP knockdown substantially enhanced poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). All together, these data suggest that TRIP negatively regulates TLR- and RIG-Iâinduced IRF3 activation.</p>

        <title>TRIP targets TBK1 for degradation</title>
        <p>TLR3/4 and RIG-I recognize the microbial patterns and recruit adaptors TRIF and MAVS, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). TRIF and MAVS mediate IRF3 activation and IFN-Î² production through a complex cascade composed of various molecules including TRIF, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). To determine the molecular targets of TRIP in TLR- and RIG-Iâinduced IFN-Î² signaling, the effects of TRIP on the IFN-Î² expression mediated by various adaptors were examined. TRIP inhibited RIG-Iâ, MAVS-, TBK1-, TRIF-, and MDA5-induced IFN-Î² mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Consistently, TRIF-, RIG-I-, MAVS-, and TBK1-induced IFN-Î² promoter activation were also significantly inhibited by TRIP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Previous investigations showed that WT IRF-3 induces marginal levels of type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, the IRF-3 5D mutant, in which residues at positions 396, 398, 402, 404, and 405 were replaced by the phosphomimetic aspartate amino acid, induces strong activation of the IFN-Î² promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). We examined the effects of TRIP on the IFN-Î² promoter activation mediated by IRF3 using IRF3 5D mutation. IRF3-induced IFN-Î² promoter activation remains unchanged by TRIP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that TRIP targets molecules upstream of IRF3.</p>

        <p>To clarify TRIP target, the function of TRIP on the degradation of the molecules involved in TLR3/4 and RIG-I signaling was investigated. TRIP knockdown greatly increased TBK1 protein level in peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). IRF3, STAT1, and TRAF3 protein levels were not impaired. Consistently, TBK1 protein level in TRIP stable transfection RAW264.7 cells was greatly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). TRAF3 and TRAF6 protein levels were not changed. Therefore, we speculate that TBK1 may be a TRIP target. To confirm, TRIP targets TBK1, HA-TBK1, and Flag-TRIP were cotransfected into HEK293 cells. TRIP promoted degradation of TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). As a control, TRIP overexpression had no effects on TRAF3 expression. To determine whether TRIP inhibits TBK1 activity, in vitro kinase assay of TBK1 was assessed with myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate. As expected, LPS stimulation could increase TBK1 kinase activity; remarkably, TBK1 kinase activity was further increased in TRIP siRNA-transfected macrophages after LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). All together, these data indicate that TRIP targets TBK1 for degradation to inhibit TLR- and RIG-Iâinduced expression of IFN-Î².</p>

        <title>TRIP promotes K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TBK1</title>
        <p>Protein ubiquitination is a crucial posttranscriptional modification to provide specificity and regulate the intensity of TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang and Chen, 2012</xref>). K48-linked protein ubiquitination leads to the degradation of the corresponding protein by 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang and Chen, 2012</xref>). Ubiquitination requires the sequential actions of three enzymes: Ub-activating enzyme (E1), Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and Ub ligase (E3), and the E3 ligase dictates which target protein gets ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang and Chen, 2012</xref>). Several proteins possessing E3 ubiquitin ligase activity have been implicated in regulation of TLR and RLR pathways, such as Nrdp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), RAUL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yu and Hayward, 2010</xref>), CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), and others. TRIP is a RING-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that TRIP promoted TBK1 degradation through the ubiquitinâproteasome pathway.</p>
        <p>Physical binding to target proteins is a necessary step for E3 ligase to initiate ubiquitination. First, we investigated whether TRIP interacted with TBK1. Myc-TBK1, Myc-IRF3, or Myc-TRAF3 and Flag-TRIP were cotransfected into HEK293 cells, and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with Flag antibody. TBK1 was coprecipitated with TRIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). As a negative control, IRF3 was not coprecipitated with TRIP. As a positive control, TRAF3 was coprecipitated with TRIP, consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse et al., 2007</xref>). Endogenous interaction was examined in mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS for indicated time periods, followed by immunoprecipitation with TBK1 antibody. TBK1 interacted with TRIP in both LPS-stimulated and nonstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The interaction could not be detected with control IgG. Consistently, immunostaining experiments also demonstrated the colocalization between TBK1 and TRIP before and after LPS stimulation or SeV infection (unpublished data). Collectively, these results show that TRIP binds directly to TBK1.</p>

        <p>To test the role of TRIP in TBK1 ubiquitination and degradation, we constructed various TRIP mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). In mutant CA, the cysteine residues at positions 7, 10, 25, 33, and 46 within the RING domain were substituted with alanine. ÎC51 lacks the RING domain. TRIP markedly increased polyubiquitination of TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>, lane 3). In contrast, the TRIP CA lost the ability to promote polyubiquitination of TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>, lane 5), indicating that the RING-finger domain is required for the TRIP-mediated ubiquitination of TBK1.</p>
        <p>To investigate the forms of TRIP-mediated polyubiquitination of TBK1, ubiquitin mutant vectors K48 and K63, which contain arginine substitutions of all of its lysine residues except the one at position 48 and 63, respectively, were used in the transfection assays. TRIP-mediated polyubiquitination of TBK1 was significantly increased in the presence of both WT and K48 mutant ubiquitin plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>, lane 3 and 6), but not in the presence of K63 mutant ubiquitin plasmid, indicating that TRIP mediates K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1. K48-linked polyubiquitination leads to the degradation of target proteins through 26S proteasome. Consistently, TRIP-induced degradation of TBK1 could be reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Furthermore, TRIP mutant ÎC51 lost the ability to promote degradation of TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).

        <title>TRIP negatively regulates cellular antiviral response</title>
        <p>Type I IFNs (IFN-Î±/Î²) play critical roles in the immune responses against viral infection. We further investigated the potential role of TRIP in cellular antiviral responses. TRIP inhibited IFN-Î² and RNATES expression in HEK293 cells infected with SeV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Consistently, TRIP inhibited SeV-induced IFN-Î² and IRF3 promoter activation and TRIP CA mutant lost the inhibitory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Importantly, SeV-induced IRF3 dimerization was significantly attenuated by transfection of TRIP expression plasmid in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Furthermore, SeV-induced IFN-Î² and RNATES expression was significantly enhanced by TRIP knockdown in peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). TBK1 protein level was greatly decreased in SeV-infected HEK293 cells with TRIP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). In contrast, IRF3, TRAF3, and STAT1 levels remain unchanged. Consistent with the observation of TRIP-mediated decrease of TBK1 expression, TRIP knockdown greatly increased TBK1 kinase activity after SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>).</p>

        <p>To directly investigate the effects of TRIP on antiviral responses, VSV, a kind of single-stranded RNA virus recognized by RIG-I, was used to infect HEK293 cells and macrophages. Plaque assay of HEK293 cells infected with VSV showed that TRIP overexpression substantially increased viral replication in the presence of poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). In sharp contrast, TRIP mutant CA could not increase viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Similarly, VSV RNA replicates were greatly increased in TRIP-transfected cells compared with control vector- or TRIP CA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). To further confirm the function of TRIP on VSV replication under physiological condition, TRIP expression was silenced by TRIP siRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and then the macrophages were infected with VSV. TRIP knockdown greatly decreased VSV viral replication in macrophages in the presence or absence of poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>). Accordingly, TRIP knockdown significantly decreased intracellular VSV RNA replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRIP negatively regulates cellular antiviral response by inhibiting IFN-Î² expression.</p>
        <p>Given the important roles of IFN-Î² in host antiviral immunity, virus may escape immune surveillance by modulating TRIP expression in the infected cells, and then feedback may inhibit the innate immune response against itself. In contrast, excessive IFN-Î² production has manifested in diverse pathogenic autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banchereau and Pascual, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GonzÃ¡lez-Navajas, et al., 2012</xref>). Our results demonstrate TBK1 as a substrate of TRIP, provide a strategy to down-regulate IFN-Î² production, and they suggest that TRIP may have therapeutic potential for the intervention of diseases with uncontrolled IFN-Î² production.</p>

The supernatants were diluted 1:10<sup>6</sup> and then used to infect confluent HEK293 cells cultured on 24-well plates. At 1 h after infection, the supernatant was removed, and 3% methylcellulose was overlaid. At 3 d after infection, overlay was removed, and cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. Plaques were counted, averaged, and multiplied by the dilution factor to determine viral titer as LOG10 (pfu/ml). Total HEK293 cellular RNA was extracted and VSV RNA replicates were examined by quantitative RT-PCR as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Primers for VSV were as follows: 5â²-ACGGCGTACTTCCAGATGG-3â² (sense) and 5â²-CTCGGTTCAAGATCCAGGT-3â² (antisense).</p>
