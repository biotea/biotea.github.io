        <p>PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin, which then binds to Parkin and activates its E3 ligase activity, leading to induction of selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>PINK1 kinase activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to induce selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria. However, it has been unclear how PINK1 activates and recruits Parkin to mitochondria. Although PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin, other PINK1 substrates appear to activate Parkin, as the mutation of all serine and threonine residues conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human, including Parkin S65, did not wholly impair Parkin translocation to mitochondria. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that endogenous PINK1 phosphorylated ubiquitin at serine 65, homologous to the site phosphorylated by PINK1 in Parkinâs ubiquitin-like domain. Recombinant TcPINK1 directly phosphorylated ubiquitin and phospho-ubiquitin activated Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in cell-free assays. In cells, the phosphomimetic ubiquitin mutant S65D bound and activated Parkin. Furthermore, expression of ubiquitin S65A, a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PINK1, inhibited Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria. These results explain a feed-forward mechanism of PINK1-mediated initiation of Parkin E3 ligase activity.</p>

Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cell biology studies in mammalian cells place PINK1 upstream of Parkin in the same pathway and indicate they may normally mediate mitochondrial quality control (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Narendra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ashrafi and Schwarz, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Winklhofer, 2014</xref>).</p><p>PINK1 is a kinase that is imported into mitochondria, cleaved by the inner membrane protease PARL to generate an N-end degron and then eliminated by the proteasome (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Kang, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Deas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yamano and Youle, 2013</xref>). When mitochondria lose membrane potential or amass unfolded protein, PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane via TOM7 in association with the TOM complex (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hasson et al., 2013</xref>). On the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), PINK1 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Geisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Narendra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</xref>) and activates latent Parkin activity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>) to ubiquitinate scores of OMM proteins (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>). This leads to proteasomal degradation of OMM proteins (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yoshii et al., 2011</xref>) and to selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that PINK1 and Parkin mediate a mitochondrial quality control pathway.</p><p>How PINK1 recruits Parkin to the OMM and what PINK1 kinase substrate is involved have been unclear. A leading candidate is Parkin itself, as PINK1 directly phosphorylates Parkin at serine 65 (S65; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kondapalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2012</xref>). This model is consistent with data that PINK1 experimentally localized to peroxisomes or lysosomes can recruit Parkin to these locations (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lazarou et al., 2012</xref>). Here we show that PINK1 recruits Parkin to mitochondria despite mutation of S65 to alanine or individual mutation of all other Ser/Thr residues conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human Parkin. This indicates that another PINK1 substrate mediates Parkin translocation and activation. Using mass spectrometry we identified ubiquitin (Ub) as an endogenous PINK1 substrate and found that both a phosphomimetic mutant Ub in cells and phospho-Ub in vitro can activate Parkin. Interestingly, PINK1 phosphorylates Ub at S65, a residue that is homologous with the S65 site PINK1 phosphorylates on the Parkin ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The mechanism of PINK1-mediated activation of Parkin has remained elusive (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Trempe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wauer and Komander, 2013</xref>). Parkin is cytosolic, but translocates to damaged mitochondria where it ubiquitinates proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Several Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites have been reported on Parkin (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201402104/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1</ext-link>), and in particular, S65 is suggested to be involved in activating its E3 ligase activity (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kondapalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Iguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Though ParkinS65A does not translocate to damaged mitochondria as efficiently as the wild type (WT), it completely translocates in over 25% of cells after carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment (Table S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), consistent with other studies (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Iguchi et al., 2013</xref>). ParkinÎUBL, which lacks the UBL domain, including S65, also translocates to damaged mitochondria (Table S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To investigate the involvement of other phosphorylation sites in Parkin activation, we mutated all Ser/Thr residues in human Parkin that are conserved with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Parkin and all that are conserved only among mammalian homologues to nonphosphorylatable alanine residues (Table S1). Other than S65A, no mutants of previously reported phosphorylation sites showed more than a 20% deficit in translocation as compared with WT (3-h CCCP treatment; Table S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), nor did mutation of any other conserved Ser/Thr (Table S1 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201402104/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S1</ext-link>). The translocation of Parkin WT, ÎUBL, and S65A is dependent on PINK1, as they fail to translocate in PINK1 knockout (KO) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of conserved serine/threonine residues of Parkin does not completely inhibit Parkin translocation or activity.</bold> (A) YFP-Parkin is normally cytosolic (left panels), but upon mitochondrial damage (10 ÂµM CCCP for 2.5 h), YFP-Parkin translocates to mitochondria and causes the ubiquitination proteins (right panels). Cells were stained for Tom20 (mitochondria, blue) and Ub (red). (B) ParkinÎUBL, as well as alanine mutants of Ser/Thr residues previously reported to be phosphorylated, were all capable of translocating to damaged mitochondria (10 ÂµM CCCP for 2.5 h). Fewer cells expressing ParkinS65A displayed mitochondrial translocation than any other mutant (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201402104/DC1" id="supp3">Table S1</ext-link>). Cells were stained for Parkin (green) and Tom20 (mitochondria, red). For quantification and references of observed phosphorylation, see Table S1. (C) CCCP-treated (10 ÂµM CCCP for 3 h) PINK1 KO cells expressing the indicated Parkin mutants showed that Parkin translocation is PINK1 dependent. (D) Phos-tag and SDS-PAGE gels revealed a shift of WT Parkin on Phos-tag gels after CCCP treatment (arrow), indicating it is phosphorylated (lane 2 vs. lane 3), and this phosphorylation was removed by phosphatase (CIP, lane 1). ParkinÎUBL, S65A, and S65E displayed no observable shift. (E) Parkin in vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that Parkin mutants are capable of ubiquitinating Mfn1 (bottom arrow). Cytosolic extracts from cells expressing the indicated Parkin mutants were incubated with mitochondria from cells not expressing Parkin (Â±CCCP). Ubiquitination of Mfn1 was observed (arrow + Ub and polyUb) only in the presence of mitochondria from CCCP-treated cells. Bars: (AâC) 10 Âµm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201402104_Fig1"/></fig><p>Phosphorylation of Parkin was investigated further using Phos-tag gels. In the absence of CCCP, there was no evidence of phosphorylation of Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). After a 3-h CCCP treatment, Parkin WT exhibited a shift on the Phos-tag gel indicative of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lane 3, arrow) that was eliminated by phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lane 1, CIP). ParkinÎUBL, S65A, and S65E do not display a gel shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, lanes 5, 7, and 9), confirming that S65 is the major site of Parkin phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kondapalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Shiba-Fukushima et al., 2012</xref>). Because ParkinÎUBL and S65A are capable of PINK1-dependent translocation to mitochondria, phosphorylation of Parkin is not required for its relocalization.</p><p>To further explore the importance of S65 phosphorylation in the activation of Parkin, mutants were assessed in an in vitro assay of Mfn1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lazarou et al., 2013</xref>). Mfn1 appeared as one band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, bottom arrow) when cytosol expressing any form of Parkin was incubated with mitochondria isolated from vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Each of the mutant forms of Parkin caused ubiquitination of Mfn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, top arrow, Ub) when the assay was performed using mitochondria from CCCP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The poly-Ub bands in CCCP-treated samples were more prevalent with WT Parkin than with any mutant, but were still observed for ÎUBL and S65A Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lanes 4 and 6, polyUb). S65E was not more efficient at Mfn1 ubiquitination than either ÎUBL or S65A Parkin, indicating that phosphomimetic mutation at S65 did not increase Ub ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lane 8).</p><p>Abolishing Parkin phosphorylation at S65 did not completely inhibit its PINK1-dependent activation, indicating that another PINK1 substrate must be involved. Therefore, we designed an unbiased proteomics approach to identify PINK1 substrates using mass spectrometry (MS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Mitochondria were isolated from WT and PINK1 KO cells after CCCP treatment. Isolated mitochondria were treated with trypsin to release exposed OMM protein peptides, the remaining intact mitochondria were pelleted, and the supernatant was treated overnight with trypsin to ensure complete digestion of peptides. These peptides were then analyzed on an mass spectrometer and the results were queried for phosphopeptides present only in the PINK1 WT samples. This interrogation yielded a unique phosphopeptide corresponding to Ub phosphorylated at S65 in WT samples that was not identified in PINK1 KO samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This phosphopeptide was observed as a triply charged peak (at m/z 737.38). The extracted ion chromatograms of this peak, showing the intensity of the phospho-Ub peptide TLSDYNIQKE<bold>pS</bold>TLHLVLR (bold-type pS, phospho-Ser), confirmed the presence of this peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, asterisk) only in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, red) and not in PINK1 KO mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, blue). To verify this, we incubated recombinant His-Ub in vitro with mitochondria isolated from control or CCCP-treated cells. The same Ub phosphopeptide was observed in three separate forms with different charge states, quadruply, triply, and doubly charged (at m/z 553.29, 737.38, and 1105.57, respectively), and all of these forms were observed only in His-Ub samples exposed to mitochondria from CCCP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, red) and not from untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, blue). A second LC/MS/MS acquisition was performed using peptides from in vitroâphosphorylated His-Ub using different fragmentation methods, including ETD (electron-transfer dissociation) and HCD (higher-energy collisional dissociation). Both ETD and HCD spectra confidently identified the phosphopeptide TLSDYNIQKE<bold>pS</bold>TLHLVLR and clearly demonstrated phosphorylation at the S65 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Label-free quantitation of nonphosphorylated peptides detected for Ub showed that the total amount of endogenous Ub in PINK1 WT vs. KO samples and the amount of His-Ub in the in vitro samples was comparable (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201402104/DC1" id="supp4">Table S2</ext-link>). This indicates that detection of the phosphopeptide was due to a dramatic increase in phosphorylation, not a change in the abundance of Ub. Phosphorylation of Ub S65 by PINK1 mirrors PINK1 phosphorylation of Parkinâs UBL domain on the homologous Parkin S65 residue (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kondapalli et al., 2012</xref>). There are several divergent residues between Ub and Parkin in this region that distinguish phospho-Ub from phospho-Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Proteomics search for PINK1 substrates revealed that PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin.</bold> (A) Workflow of the sample preparation for the PINK1 substrate search.

HA-Ub was incubated with mitochondria isolated from control or CCCP-treated cells, and the mitochondria (containing PINK1 in the CCCP sample) were then removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was added to recombinant Parkin, E1 and E2 enzyme, untreated HA-Ub, and ATP. The inclusion of HA-Ub that had been exposed to CCCP-treated mitochondria caused an activation of Parkin, as evidenced by the accumulation of poly-Ub chains in the fourth lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>, Ub<sub>n</sub>). To determine if this activation was specific to PINK1-phosphorylated Ub, we incubated HA-Ub with recombinant TcPINK1 WT, removed the PINK1, and then added this to a cell-free assay with recombinant Parkin, E1 and E2 enzyme, untreated HA-Ub, and ATP and observed a robust activation of Parkin with WT TcPINK1-treated HA-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). This activation was a result of phosphorylation of Ub at S65, and not a result of phosphorylation at a different residue because His-UbS65A did not activate nor was it a result of residual PINK1, as it was completely removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>, top and bottom, respectively).

Our MS results indicate that PINK1 is capable of phosphorylating Ub on the mitochondria in the absence of Parkin and we show in vitro phosphorylation of free Ub. Phosphorylation of Ub already present on a subset of OMM proteins before Parkin activation may in part explain the variety of proteins previously reported to be Parkin receptors. PINK1 phosphorylation of Ub to activate Parkin would also explain how PINK1 experimentally located on peroxisomes and lysosomes recruits and activates Parkin ectopically (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lazarou et al., 2012</xref>), as PINK1 could phosphorylate Ub present on peroxisomal or lysosomal proteins. It is also consistent with the stoichiometry of Parkin activation that its addition of Ub chains on the mitochondria would increase the mitochondrial-localized substrate for PINK1 Ub kinase activity to further recruit and activate more Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>).</p><p>Beyond PINK1 activation of Parkin, this novel modification of Ub may have other implications. Ub S65 is near the poly-Ub chain linkage site K63 and phosphorylation at S65 may modulate Ub chain linkage. Several other UBL proteins have a serine conserved with Ub S65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of these other proteins may be biologically important. One example is ISG15, which was identified to facilitate Parkin translocation in a genome-wide screen (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hasson et al., 2013</xref>). Several UBL domainâcontaining proteins also have a conserved serine residue at the position homologous to Parkin S65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Included in this list are Ub-specific protease 48 (USP48) and Ub-like domain-containing CTD phosphatase 1 (UBLCP1), which are involved in processing K48-linked Ub chains. The presence of S65 sites in other small UBL proteins and other UBL domainâcontaining proteins raises the possibility that other kinase and regulatory loops exist for these proteins.</p><p>Phosphorylation of Ub at S65 was previously identified by MS in a phosphoproteome analysis after EGF receptor stimulation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>).
