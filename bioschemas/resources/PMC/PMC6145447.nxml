        <p id="P1">DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) display limited DNA end processing and chromosomal mobility. In contrast, DSBs undergoing homology-directed repair (HDR) exhibit extensive processing and enhanced motion. The molecular basis for this movement is unknown. Using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> cell-free extracts and mammalian cells, we establish that nuclear actin, WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are recruited to damaged chromatin undergoing HDR. We demonstrate that nuclear actin polymerization is required for the migration of a subset of DSBs into discrete sub-nuclear clusters. Actin-driven movements specifically affect DSBs repaired by HDR in G2; inhibition of actin nucleation impairs DNA end-processing and HDR efficiency. In contrast, Arp2/3 is not enriched at DSBs repaired by NHEJ and does not regulate NHEJ. Our findings establish that nuclear actin-based mobility shapes chromatin organization by generating repair domains essential for HDR in eukaryotic cells.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">DSBs induce chromatin movement. In budding yeast, which repair DSBs primarily by HDR, induction of a single chromosomal break triggers increased local mobility: the DSB mean-square displacement is significantly higher than that of an undamaged region<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, multiple DSBs cluster after traversing long distances<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. DSB clustering may facilitate homology search, increase repair efficiency or shield breaks from misrepair<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These movements are intricately related to HDR. Factors critical for resection initiation and downstream recombination are essential for DSB mobility in yeast<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In mammalian cells, DSBs are often described as more stable suggesting that NHEJ, the predominant repair pathway, limits movement<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, in HeLa cells, Rad51-positive DSBs induced by alpha particles cluster<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Similarly, damaged telomeres in U2OS cells that are maintained by recombination merge in a Rad51-dependent manner<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, damaged active genes cluster in preparation for HDR<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Deprotected mouse telomere movements require the LINC complex which transmits cytoskeletal forces from the cytoplasm<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The molecular basis for DSB movement and its role in DNA repair, however, remain enigmatic.</p>
    <p id="P3">The machinery that drives actin polymerization in the cytoplasm is also found in the nucleus<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Specifically, the Arp2/3 complex as well as its activator WASP, a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family member, are located in both cellular compartments<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. WASP brings the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits into close proximity to activate the complex and enable filament elongation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Genotoxic agents trigger actin polymerization in the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; however, actin polymerizationâs role in DSB repair is not characterized.</p>

      <title>Actin nucleators bind damaged chromatin</title>
      <p id="P4">We performed an unbiased proteomics screen to document the recruitment of proteins to chromosomal DSBs in cell-free S-phase extracts derived from <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs. Peptides from control or DSB-containing chromatin protein fractions were labeled with isobaric tags and subjected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We observed enrichment of known DSB repair regulators and proteins not previously associated with the DNA damage response (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Among such proteins were all seven subunits of the actin nucleating complex Arp2/3, as well as Î²-actin and capping proteins (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). We confirmed that Î²-actin, Arpc4, and CapZÎ² are recruited to Mre11-enriched, DSB-containing chromatin by Western blot (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We next asked whether actin enrichment at chromosomal DSBs required DNA damage signaling. Inhibition of the PI3K-like kinases ATM and ATR reduced the binding of actin complexes to damaged chromatin (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b, c</xref>). Moreover, treatment with the small molecule inhibitor CK-666, which stabilizes the Arp2/3 complex in an open, inactive conformation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, decreased Arpc4, Î²-actin, and CapZÎ² enrichment in damaged chromatin (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Overall, these results reveal that PI3K-like kinases and the Arp2/3 complex regulate the assembly of polymerized actin at chromosomal DSBs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts.</p>

      <title>WASP and Arp2/3 bind DSBs undergoing HDR</title>
      <p id="P5">We next tested whether WASP, an Arp2/3 activator, localized to DSB foci in mammalian cells. DSB generation by Neocarzinostatin (NCS), a radiomimetic antibiotic, induced WASP foci in U2OS cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Moreover, WASP significantly co-localized with Î³H2AX, which marks large chromatin domains surrounding DSBs<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, suggesting that sites of DNA repair contain WASP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Similarly, WASP foci arose in mouse-tail fibroblasts (MTFs) post DSB generation and co-localized with Î³H2AX (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1dâf</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P6">We next asked whether actin complexes are recruited in close proximity to DSBs. Accordingly, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments in U2OS cells in which genome-wide DSBs are generated via nuclear translocation of the AsiSI restriction enzyme<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We interrogated four DSB sites, annotated DSBs I-IV, in the G1- or G2-phase of the cell cycle in synchronized cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). First, we monitored the recruitment of Rad51 and the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs). Rad51 was previously shown to localize to a subset of these DSBs<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. DNA-PKcs was recruited to all four DSBs in both cell-cycle phases (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). In contrast, we confirmed Rad51 binds exclusively DSBs I and II, which occurs more robustly in G2- than in G1-synchronized cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HDR may be monitored at a subset of DSBs in G2 and distinguished from DSBs undergoing NHEJ, the more frequent mode of repair.</p>
      <p id="P7">We then asked if actin filament nucleators localize to DSB sites. WASP accumulated at DSBs I and II in both cell cycle phases (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), whereas Arpc2 recruitment was restricted to G2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). Notably, WASP was also enriched at DSBs III and IV whereas Arpc2 was not (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g, h</xref>). Neither WASP nor Arpc2 were enriched at an undamaged site (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). Collectively, these data establish that WASP binds DSBs independently of repair pathway choice but specifically activates Arp2/3 at DSBs undergoing HDR. This supports a model by which actin polymerization is primed at all DSBs but only triggered during the assembly of HDR machinery.</p>

      <title>Arp2/3 inactivation impairs DSB movement</title>
      <p id="P8">The Arp2/3 complex generates propulsive forces by nucleating a highly-branched network of actin filaments. Since WASP and Arp2/3 localized to Rad51-bound DSBs, we asked whether their activity induces movement and clustering of HDR machinery. Accordingly, we visualized DSB movements using a U2OS cell line that stably expresses Rad52 tagged with mCherry and 53BP1 tagged with YFP<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Rad52 mediates recombination and forms foci in S/G2 cells exclusively<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Generation of DSBs in S/G2 cells yielded robust induction of Rad52-mCherry foci (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Strikingly, Rad52 foci clustered and merged over a 60-minute interval (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">SI Videos 1aâd</xref>). Coalescing foci increased in intensity and size and remained merged for a minimum of 15 min (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Notably, Arp2/3 inactivation following treatment with CK-666 decreased the frequency of clustering events and abrogated the increase in foci size (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, d</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">SI Videos 1e, f</xref>). We subsequently compared DSB movements in the presence of CK-666 and CK-689, an inactive control analog<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Quantitative analysis of DSB tracks in CK-689-treated cells indicated that Rad52 foci explore a mean cumulative distance of 4.1 Î¼m over 100 min (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). Mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis of Rad52 foci revealed a diffusion coefficient <italic>D(t)</italic> of 3.7Ã10<sup>â5</sup> Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Motion type analysis was consistent with confined Brownian motion. Critically, Arp2/3 inhibition diminished the distance DSBs traveled over the 100-minute period (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). Furthermore, CK-666 treatment decreased the Rad52 diffusion coefficient from 3.7 to 1.8Ã10<sup>â5</sup> Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">We subsequently monitored DSBs bound by RPA in MTFs expressing RPA32-pEGFP-NLS. Similar to the behavior of Rad52-mCherry foci, RPA32 foci frequently merged over a 60-minute interval (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">SI Videos 1g, h</xref>). Notably, CK-666 treatment diminished the distance RPA foci traveled relative to CK-689 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). Moreover, the diffusion coefficient calculated for RPA foci in cells treated with CK-666 decreased from 4.1 to 2.1Ã10<sup>â5</sup> Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Finally, we employed MTF cells harboring a conditional Arpc2 allele<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Upon 4-OHT treatment, cells are depleted of Arpc2<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>). Consistent with CK-666 treatment, RPA movements were significantly attenuated upon Arcp2 depletion (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3iâl</xref>). CK-689 minimally affected Rad52 and RPA foci movement relative to DMSO (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P10">Formation of Rad51 filaments requires ssDNA-RPA intermediates. Thus, we assessed how Arp2/3 inactivation impacts Rad51 foci behavior. To circumvent the lack of a functional fluorescent Rad51 reporter, we employed the Icy bioimaging software and its spatial analysis plug-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icy.bioimageanalysis.org">http://www.icy.bioimageanalysis.org</ext-link>) to assess Rad51 foci clustering. This approach was validated in a study showing ATM-dependent clustering of Î³H2AX foci in fixed cells<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Analysis with Icy software revealed that Rad51 foci are highly clustered in the nucleus and that CK-666 reduces this clustering (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3aâd</xref>). CK-666 treatment did not affect cell viability, cell cycle progression, nuclear size, nuclear morphology, nor RPA or Rad51 protein expression (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4aâg</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization enhances DSB motion during HDR, thereby increasing the incidence of foci clustering.</p>
      <p id="P11">In G1 cells, 53BP1 forms foci and regulates end-joining events. Consistent with the lack of Arp2/3 at DSBs in G1 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), 53BP1-YFP foci movements in G1 cells were unaffected by Arp2/3 inhibition (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5aâc</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). In G2 cells, many 53BP1-YFP and Rad52 foci colocalized, consistent with the localization of 53BP1 at sites of DSB resection<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). Relative to G1 cells, the diffusion coefficient for 53BP1 foci increased from 2.4 to 3.5Ã10<sup>â5</sup> Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s in G2 cells (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5e, f</xref>). In contrast to G1 cells, the motion of 53BP1 foci in G2 cells was reduced by Arp2/3 inactivation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that Arp2/3 enhances the motion of sites of DSB resection in G2 cells.</p>

      <title>Arp2/3 nucleates actin foci at sites of HDR</title>
      <p id="P12">Genotoxic agents induce nuclear actin structures in mammalian cells<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In U2OS cells transfected with nuclear-actin-chromobody-tag-GFP<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, we identified a subset of actin structures resembling foci (actin-cb foci) that increased following NCS treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref> and <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). We also identified brighter, rod-like filaments (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Strikingly, actin-cb foci clustered and merged over a 20-minute interval (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">SI Videos 2a, b</xref>).

Similar to Rad52 and RPA, the Î± coefficient for actin-cb foci indicated confined motion.

In contrast, nuclear actin rods exhibited limited mobility and were unaffected by CK-666 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6aâd</xref>). Finally, we compared the localization of actin-cb foci with Rad51 foci in fixed cells and RPA-mCherry foci using live cell imaging. Following NCS treatment, 46% of Rad51 foci overlapped or abutted actin-cb foci (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>).

Arp2/3 inactivation by CK-666 or CK-548 reduced the ability of cells to repair I-SceI-induced DSBs by HDR or SSA by 40 percent (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, b</xref> and <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a, e</xref>). Similarly, wiskostatin, a small molecule inhibitor of WASP<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, reduced HDR and SSA efficiency (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Comparable HDR defects in cells depleted of WASP by RNA interference were also observed (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7bâd</xref>). Notably, inhibition of WASP or Arp2/3 did not compromise MMEJ or NHEJ, neither of which require significant resection (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref> and <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7f, g</xref>). Finally, the application of CK-689 did not reduce the repair of I-SceI-induced DSBs by HDR, SSA or NHEJ (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7h</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P14">Although the Arp2/3 complex is found in the nucleus<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, it also polymerizes actin in the cytoplasm. To strengthen the idea that the HDR defect was a direct consequence of inhibiting nuclear actin polymerization, we increased nuclear actin levels by overexpressing actin fused to a nuclear localization sequence (WT-actin-NLS) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Whereas expression of WT-actin-NLS did not affect HDR, overexpression of an actin variant that interrupts filament formation (R62D-actin-NLS) significantly inhibited HDR to levels comparable with Arp2/3 inhibition (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Treatment of cells expressing R62D-actin-NLS with CK-666 did not further reduce HDR, suggesting that nuclear actin and Arp2/3 functioned together. Moreover, WT-actin, R62D-actin, and WT-actin-NLS tagged with mCherry did not affect DSB repair, whereas expression of R62D-actin-NLS significantly inhibited HDR (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a, b</xref>). This strongly suggests that inhibiting actin polymerization in the cytoplasm does not influence DNA repair in the nucleus. Similar to CK-666, expression of R62D-actin-NLS did not reduce NHEJ-based repair (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). Finally, neither siRNA directed against the actin filament nucleator formin-2 nor treatment with the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 inhibited HDR efficiency (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8câf</xref>).

In G1 cells, the repair kinetics of both DSBs were identical in the presence or absence of CK-666, confirming that Arp2/3 does not influence NHEJ (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). In contrast, in G2 cells, CK-666 substantially slowed repair at the two DSB sites interrogated (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P16">To address how actin-driven clustering might promote HDR efficiency, we asked if the Arp2/3 complex facilitates resection.

We consolidated this finding by quantifying Rad51 foci that arise following DSB resection in NCS-treated cells over 24 hours (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d, e</xref>). In control cells, the number of Rad51 foci first increased from 2 to 8 hours then decreased up to 24 hours, indicative of recruitment and repair (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P19">DSB mobility is influenced by cell cycle stage, chromatin state, and repair pathway choice. Our finding that Arp2/3 specifically enhances the movement of HDR breaks is supported by studies showing that DSB mobility requires DNA end-resection. In S/G2, DSBs induced in pericentric heterochromatin relocate to the nuclear periphery, whereas DSBs generated in G1 remain stable<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Critically, blocking HDR or resection prevented DSB mobility in G2. Similarly, in Drosophila, the activities of CtIP, Exo1, and Blm were necessary for DSB movement outside the heterochromatic domain<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Conversely, we now show Arp2/3 inhibition decreases end processing, consistent with positive feedback regulation between DSB mobility and resection. Indeed, DSB clustering could facilitate enzymatic reactions by increasing the local concentration of repair factors. Interestingly, in budding yeast, Arp2, Arp3, and Arpc2 are synthetic lethal in combination with Mre11 or Sgs1 deficiency<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. This supports actin polymerization and resection interdependency.</p>
      <p id="P20">Our ChIP analyses suggest a two-step mechanism for actin nucleation at HDR sites (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10f</xref>). WASP is recruited at all DSBs regardless of cell cycle stage, reminiscent of NHEJ factors. In contrast, Arp2/3 is recruited in G2 to breaks that assemble HDR machinery. Actin polymerization promoted by WASP and Arp2/3 might therefore require sequential activation of PI3K-like kinases. Whereas ATM promotes the assembly of complexes required for resection, ATR commits repair to HDR<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Accordingly, following ATM activation and WASP recruitment at DSBs, resection initiation could create a permissive environment for Arp2/3 activity leading to increased chromosomal mobility at specific DSB sites.</p>

For mirin experiments, cells were pre-treated with mirin (Sigma Aldrich: M9948, 50 Î¼M) for 1 hour prior to addition of 4-OHT, and subsequently washed and incubated with mirin for indicated time points. After 4 hours, cells were trypsinized and washed with cold PBS before resuspension in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM TrisCl pH 8, 25 mM EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K). Cells were agitated at 37Â°C overnight. After phenol/chloroform purification and salt/ethanol extraction, precipitated DNA underwent restriction enzyme digest by BamHI-HF, BsrGI, or HindIII-HF (1 unit of enzyme per 7 ng of DNA) at 37 Â°C overnight. DNA digests were subsequently used as templates in a 20 uL qPCR reaction containing 10.0 Î¼L 2Ã TaqMan Universal PCR Master mix (Thermo), 0.5 Î¼M of each primer, and 0.2 Î¼M of probe. The extent of ssDNA generation at sites downstream of various DSBs was determined by calculating the ÎCt value for each site (mock-digested Ct value - digest Ct value) and employing the following equation: ssDNA = 1/(2^(ÎCt-1)+0.5)*100.

Cells were washed twice with PBS before adding media containing DMSO. After 3 hours, images were acquired on an A1RMP confocal microscope using equipment and settings described above. Cells with actin-cb foci were classified using the following criteria: actin-cb foci exhibited movement and frequent turnover, were round in morphology and often appeared to have fuzzy âtailsâ. Cells with actin-cb rods were classified using the following criteria: actin-cb rods exhibited limited movement, no turnover, were very bright, and were filamentous in morphology. Foci movements were examined by collecting z series at 0.4 Î¼m intervals throughout the entire nucleus every 30 seconds for 10 min. Following initial image acquisition, cells were subsequently treated with 100 Î¼M CK-666. Images of actin-cb foci were subsequently acquired 1 hour post CK-666 treatment. Actin-cb foci were scored as the number of discrete punctate structures appearing per nucleus, as detected by the Icy Spot Detector plug-in. For experiments assessing localization of actin cb foci with RPA, U2OS cells were co-transfected with actin-chromobody-tag-GFP and RPA32-NLS-mCherry (a kind gift of Jiri Lukas) for 16 hr prior to NCS treatment.

Nikon NIS Elements data files were processed in ImageJ <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Green and red channels were split and a maximum-intensity projection of each z stack was generated. T stacks were subsequently aligned using the StackReg plugin <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to correct for cell movements over the duration of the experiment. Cells that underwent large-scale nuclear deformations or expansions were discarded. The TrackMate plug in for ImageJ <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> was used to perform single-particle tracking of DSB foci over a 100-min interval and monitor foci intensity. Foci trajectories were subsequently exported to Matlab and analyzed using the class @msdanalyzer <sup>44</sup>. The mean-square displacement (MSD) of DNA damage foci plots the average squared distance foci travel at increasing time intervals, whereas the diffusion coefficient <italic>D(t)</italic> is approximated through the linear-weighted fit of the initial mean MSD curve <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Mean-Square Displacement curves for DSB foci in a given cell were computed using the formula MSD = &lt;(x(t+Ît)-x(t))<sup>2</sup>&gt;, where Ã reflects focus position and t is the time in minutes. For Rad52 foci, the weighted mean of all the MSD curves acquired from &gt; 2000 tracks in 3 independent experiments is shown. The error bars for each point on the weighted mean of the MSD curve represent the weighted standard error of the mean over all MSD curves. The diffusion coefficient D(t) was estimated from the linear fit of the first 20% of each MSD curve. Calculation of the time-dependence coefficient Î± was determined using Matlab via log-log fitting of the power law MSD(t) = Î Ã t<sup>Î±</sup>. Cumulative distance (CD) traveled by foci over 100 min was calculated relative to their starting position using the formula: D(i)=sqrt(((X(i)-X(i-1))<sup>2</sup> + ((Y(i)-Y(i-1))<sup>2</sup>))) where X and Y refer to the x and y coordinates of the focus at time i.</p>

In S/G2, DSBs may be repaired by HDR (in red). All DSBs recruit WASP, but Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization occurs only at HDR breaks, which become more mobile. Actin polymerization in the vicinity of DSBs generates forces resulting in DSB clustering, optimal DNA end resection, Rad51 foci formation, and HDR.</p>
