      <abstract>
        <p>Estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, mediates the expression of its target genes by interacting with corepressors and coactivators. Since the first cloning of SRC1, more than 280 nuclear receptor cofactors have been identified, which orchestrate target gene transcription. Aberrant activity of ER or its accessory proteins results in a number of diseases including breast cancer. Here we identified SFR1, a protein involved in DNA homologous recombination, as a novel binding partner of ERÎ±. Initially isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen, the interaction of SFR1 and ERÎ± was confirmed in vivo by immunoprecipitation and mammalian one-hybrid assays. SFR1 co-localized with ERÎ± in the nucleus, potentiated ERâs ligand-dependent and ligand-independent transcriptional activity, and occupied the ER binding sites of its target gene promoters. Knockdown of SFR1 diminished ERâs transcriptional activity. Manipulating SFR1 expression by knockdown and overexpression revealed a role for SFR1 in ER-dependent and -independent cancer cell proliferation. SFR1 differs from SRC1 by the lack of an intrinsic activation function. Taken together, we propose that SFR1 is a novel transcriptional modulator for ERÎ± and a potential target in breast cancer therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Estrogen signaling is mediated by two nuclear receptors, ERÎ± and ERÎ², which regulate a broad range of biological processes (Reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0068075-Deroo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Couse1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Koehler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). Like other nuclear hormone receptors, ERÎ± contains an N-terminal transactivation domain (AF1), a DNA binding domain, a hinge region and a ligand binding domain overlapping with the second transactivation domain (AF2). In the absence of estradiol, ERÎ± is normally present in the nucleus as complex with heat shock proteins. Upon binding to estradiol, heat shock proteins are released, and ERÎ± undergoes conformational changes, dimerizes and binds to the estrogen receptor responsive elements (EREs) of the target genes. This initiates recruitment of a number of transcriptional accessory proteins known as coactivators. The complex formation on the ERE facilitates the initiation of target gene transcription in responsive tissues to promote growth and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0068075-McDonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the absence of ligands, ERÎ± (henceforth referred to as ER or ERÎ±) is bound by corepressors including N-CoR and SMRT <xref rid="pone.0068075-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, through the corepressorâs CoRNR box motifs (LXXIXXXL) <xref rid="pone.0068075-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Ligand binding promotes a conformational change in ER most notably in the helix 12 region. Subsequently, a binding pocket, composed of helices 3, 4, 5 and the re-folded helix 12, is generated to attract the LXXLL motifs (NR-boxes) of coactivators <xref rid="pone.0068075-Voegel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Heery1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Nuclear receptor coactivators contribute to ERÎ±-dependent gene transcription in different fashions, including acetylating and methylating histone tails, remodeling chromatin structure, recruiting and modifying other coactivators, and bridging the general transcription machinery with the nuclear receptors (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0068075-McDonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Rosenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>). Thus far, six groups of nuclear receptor coactivators have been characterized, including: i) p160 family coactivators (SRC1, SRC2/TIF2 and SRC3/AIB1), which directly bind to liganded ER and recruit additional coactivators such as CBP/p300 and CARM1 <xref rid="pone.0068075-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; ii) CBP/p300 family members, acetylating p160 coactivators and histones, are responsible for the quick dispersal of the coactivator complex <xref rid="pone.0068075-Kamei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; iii) DRIP205/TRAP220/MED1, which resides in the human mediator complex, thus anchoring the general transcription machinery on the liganded nuclear receptors <xref rid="pone.0068075-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; iv) subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, including BAF57, Brm and Brg-1 <xref rid="pone.0068075-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which help to remodel the chromatin to increase the accessibility for transcriptional factors/cofactors; v) non-p160 family proteins, including some co-factors, such as RIP140, TIF1 and ARA70, which can function as coactivators or corepressors depending on the promoter and receptor contexts <xref rid="pone.0068075-McDonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; and vi) the so-called secondary coactivators, including CoCoA and GAC63, which bind to p160 family members but do not directly interact with NRs <xref rid="pone.0068075-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The classical corepressors and coactivators bind to ER in the strict ligand-independent and ligand-dependent manners. In this work, we considered the possibility of the existence of novel ER-interacting proteins that may bind to ER in manners different from that of classic corepressors and coactivators. To this end, an unbiased yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify novel ER-interacting proteins, utilizing the CDEF domains of human ERÎ± as bait, both in the absence and presence of ER ligands. We identified SFR1, a subunit of the Swi5-SFR1 (Mei5) complex involved in DNA recombination and repair <xref rid="pone.0068075-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Akamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Kokabu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, as a novel binding partner of ERÎ±. SFR1 enhances ERâs ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcriptional activity and also promotes breast cancer cell proliferation. SFR1, however, does not harbor an intrinsic activation function and shares no homology with known coactivators. We propose that SFR1 is a unique transcriptional modulator of ER that can facilitate both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcription. Importantly, our results also categorize SFR1 into the group of proteins that regulate both transcription and DNA repair.</p>

        <title>Yeast Two-hybrid Screen Identifies SFR1 Protein as an ERÎ±-interacting Partner</title>
        <p>To identify novel co-factors of ERÎ±, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a human mammary gland cDNA library with ERÎ± CDEF domain as the bait in the presence and absence of estrogen. A number of known and novel proteins were identified, including the p160 family member SRC1 <xref rid="pone.0068075-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the transcription factor Stat3 <xref rid="pone.0068075-Bromberg1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We focused on a novel protein coded by a gene on chromosome 10q25.1 (designated C10ORF78, accession no. NM_001002759). Coincidently, another group recently identified C10ORF78 as the human counterpart of yeast SFR1 (Mei1), a protein in the DNA homologous recombination pathway <xref rid="pone.0068075-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although there are three putative isoforms named SFR1-A, -B, and -C based on the length of the predicted proteins, the longest isoform, which codes 307aa, should represent the true transcript in the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068075.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Thus, western blot analysis showed a consistent 37 kDa band of FLAG-SFR1 protein across multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, an independent study showed that mouse SFR1 is a 303 amino acid protein <xref rid="pone.0068075-Akamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The deduced SFR1 protein is conserved in vertebrates, including mammals, chicken, zebra fish and Xenopus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068075.s001">Figure S1</xref>). From amino acid 67â307, about 74% of amino acids are identical among human, chimpanzee, monkey and dog. About 76% of amino acids are conserved among all 5 mammalian species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068075.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) FLAG-SFR1-A and ER were co-transfected into Ishikawa cells. Co-IP experiments were performed with anti-ERÎ± and anti-FLAG antibodies in Ishikawa cells in the presence and absence of E2. (B) The interaction of ERÎ± and SFR1-A was further analyzed with mammalian one-hybrid experiments in Ishikawa cells. pM vector, pM-SFR1-A (SFR1-A) and pM-SRC1 were used as baits.

        <p>The sequence of SFR1 reflects its unique role as a nuclear receptor coregulator. At the conserved C-terminal region, SFR1 contains sequences (Î¦XXÎ¦XXXÎ¦, Î¦; hydrophobic amino acids) similar to the CoRNR-box of corepressors and another sequence similar to the NR-box (Î¦XXÎ¦Î¦, Î¦; hydrophobic amino acids) of coactivators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068075.s001">Figure S1A</xref>-B). Supporting the notion that these motifs might mediate the interaction of SFR1 with nuclear receptors and, hence, carry functional importance <xref rid="pone.0068075-Heery1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, they are completely conserved among the different mammal species of SFR1 proteins. SFR1 also contains a putative coiled-coil region. Coiled-coil domains mediating protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions have been found in nuclear receptor coactivators <xref rid="pone.0068075-Burkhard1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Gruber1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For example, CoCo-A, a secondary coactivator containing a coiled-coil domain, was found to enhance ER and AHR transcriptional regulatory activity <xref rid="pone.0068075-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Finally, although a nuclear localization signal was not identified, several sub-cellular localization prediction programs (WoLFPSORT, LOCtree and SignalP3.0) predicted SFR1 as a non-secretory protein localized in the cell nucleus, containing no DNA binding domain (data not shown). Taken together, the domains within SFR1 are indicative of hormone-receptor binding with nuclear function, consistent with its nuclear receptor coregulator activity.</p>

        <title>SFR1 mRNA is Expressed in Human Breast Cancer Cells</title>
        <p>The information from GenBank indicated that human SFR1 mRNA was detected in multiple sex hormone-responsive tissues including mammary gland, male and female reproductive systems and prostate. Mouse SFR1 mRNA was detected in the mammary tumor of MMTV-int1 transgenic mice, suggesting possible involvement of SFR1 in mammary tumorigenesis. To address the role of SFR1 in ER-positive breast cancer cells, we examined the expression of SFR1 in several human cancer cell lines. SFR1 mRNA was detected in ERÎ±-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells as well as Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068075.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).

        <title>SFR1 Interacts with ERÎ± in Estrogen-sensitive Ishikawa Cell Line Derived from Human Endometrial Cancer Cells</title>
        <p>To confirm the interaction of SFR1 with ERÎ± in mammalian cells, the cDNA of SFR1 was cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 mammalian expression vector and transfected into Ishikawa cells (a cell line derived from human endometrial cancer). As predicted, a 37 kDa band was detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), indicating that the fusion protein was expressed in mammalian cells (see below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We then examined the interaction between ERÎ± and SFR1 proteins by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays in Ishikawa cells. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data, immunoprecipitation with both anti-FLAG and anti-ERÎ± antibody showed that ERÎ± and SFR1 can pull each other down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), supporting the notion that ER and SFR1 form a physical complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. To determine whether SFR1 can bind to other nuclear receptors, Co-IP experiments were performed with protein extracts from Ishikawa cells co-transfected with androgen receptor (AR) and SFR1. Similar to ER and SFR1 interaction, AR associated with SFR1 both in the absence and presence of dihydroxy-testosterone (DHT) (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Next, we tested whether the biochemical interaction between ER and SFR1 can be recapitulated by the functional mammalian one-hybrid assay. The SFR1 cDNA was subcloned into the pM vector as bait. This fuses SFR1 with the first 147 amino acids of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The SRC1 cDNA fragment containing NR-boxes (SRC1-NR) known to interact with ERÎ± was similarly fused to Gal4-DBD and used as a positive control. In the absence of ERÎ±, neither SFR1 nor SRC1-NR, as a Gal4-fusion protein, was capable of activating luciferase reporter expression beyond the basal level. Co-expression of ER allowed both Gal4-SFR1 and Gal4-SRC1-NR to respond to estradiol (E2) stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) by a similar magnitude.

As expected, transfected SFR1 was present in the nuclei of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

        <title>SFR1 Enhances ERÎ± Transcriptional Activity in Mammalian Cells</title>
        <p>We have demonstrated that SFR1 interacts and colocalizes with ERÎ± in the cell nuclei. This nuclear interaction of SFR1 and ER raised the question of whether SFR1 can modulate ERÎ±âs transcriptional activity. Therefore, in the following study, we examined the effect of SFR1 and its truncated versions SFR1-B and SFR1-C on ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Transient co-transfection experiments were first conducted in Ishikawa cells that express a low level of SFR1 mRNA, but do not have detectable ER expression (as reflected in our following ERE-luc reporter assays(the cells were originally ER positive, but lost ER expression after several passages of culture). In the ERÎ±-dependent ERE-luc reporter assay, E2 treatment for a period of 12 hrs resulted in a 3-fold activation, which was further increased in a dose-dependent fashion by ectopic expression of SFR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, we also observed a dose-dependent increase of ER ligand-independent transcriptional activity in the presence of SFR1. Similar enhancement was observed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). We then tested whether the truncated forms of SFR1, SFR1-B and SFR1-C, can enhance ERÎ± transcriptional activity in the reporter assay. Little transcriptional enhancement was observed with SFR1-B and C, suggesting that the N-terminus of SFR1 is important for its ER stimulatory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

        <title>SFR1 is Required for the Transcriptional Activity of Endogenous ERÎ±</title>
        <p>SFR1 overexpression experiments described above indicated that SFR1 is capable of enhancing both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of ERÎ±. The dose-dependent effect of SFR1 indicates that SFR1 is a rate limiting factor in the regulation of ER-dependent transcription. We also showed that ERÎ± and SFR1 physically interact with each other in the cell nucleus. As an extension to the above studies and to further examine the physiological role of SFR1, the requirement of SFR1 proteins for endogenous ER-mediated transcription was examined using RNA interference to deplete endogenous SFR1 in MCF7 cells.

The transcription level of a co-transfected luciferase reporter containing four GAL4 binding sites at the promoter region was measured by the luciferase assay. Using GAL4-SRC1-NR-box and ERÎ± one-hybrid as the positive control, neither SFR1 nor the truncated SFR1-C can activate Gal4-luc reporter, indicating that SFR1 does not contain an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and data not shown).</p>

To facilitate the detection of SFR1, we used MCF7 cells expressing the FLAG-tagged SFR1. Control ChIP assays using normal IgG produced very weak signal. In contrast, SFR1 was detected on both pS2 and PR promoters in the presence and absence of E2 treatment, but not on the outside control region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). To determine the functional significance of SRF1, SRF1 was depleted in MCF7 cells. Depletion of SFR1 abated the expression of pS2 and PR upon estrogen stimulation in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068075.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Two other ER target genes, Cathepsin D and HSP27, however, did not show significant change upon SFR1 knockdown in MCF7 cells, indicating that SFR1 selectively regulates ER targets. Furthermore, the expression of non-ER target gene, beta-Actin was not significantly changed. Together, these results show that SFR1 is involved in ER-dependent regulation of target genes.</p>

        <title>SFR1 Plays a Role in Estrogen-dependent and Independent Cell Proliferation</title>
        <p>It is well known that ERÎ± mediates estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation in mammary epithelium. Since SFR1 can enhance ER transcriptional activity, we analyzed its roles in ERÎ±-dependent and -independent cell proliferation. Thymidine incorporation assays were utilized to monitor cell proliferation (as reflected by DNA synthesis) under different conditions. The role of SFR1 in ER-independent cell proliferation was determined in SFR1-transfected HeLa cells. SFR1 significantly enhanced DNA synthesis compared to mock-transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Because SFR1 RNAi assays indicated that SFR1 is required for ER-mediated transcription in MCF7 cells, we also determined whether the estrogen-dependent growth of MCF7 cells is affected by the depletion of SFR1. As expected, estrogen markedly stimulated the growth of non-transfected (data not shown) and scrambled (control) siRNA-transfected MCF7 cells. However, SFR1 siRNA treatment completely abolished the estrogen-dependent growth of MCF7 cells, suggesting that SFR1 proteins are essential for ER-dependent cell proliferation and raising the possibility that SFR1 could be a therapeutic target in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, SFR1 knockdown in AR-positive LNCaP cells also blocked AR-dependent cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore and consistent with the thymidine incorporation data, BrdU incorporation assays in MCF7 cells stably expressing SFR1 shRNA and control luciferase shRNA also showed that SFR1 is required for MCF7 cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g004">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In SFR1 shRNA-transduced cells, cell apoptosis increased 3 fold (from â¼2% to &gt;6%), and cell proliferation decreased 2.5-fold (a significant decrease of cell numbers in S phase from â¼23.3% to 10.4%). Although the effect of SFR1 knockdown on the cell behavior is qualitatively similar to the effect of knockdown of SRC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>), SFR1 shRNA partially released the growth inhibition effect by SRC1 shRNA, indicating that SFR1 may regulate MCF7 cell proliferation in an SRC1-independent fashion (data not shown). Overall, these results indicated that SFR1 plays roles in anti-apoptosis and cell proliferation in cancer cells.</p>

        <title>SFR1 is a Novel ER-interacting Protein and Functions as a Unique Transcriptional Modulator of ER</title>
        <p>We have identified the DNA recombination protein SFR1 as a protein that directly binds and regulates ERâs transcriptional activity by multiple complementary studies. First, SFR1 was identified as an ER-interacting protein by the unbiased yeast two-hybrid screen. Second, SFR1 co-localized with ERÎ± in cell nuclei and bound to ER in a ligand-independent fashion. Third, reporter assays showed that the transcriptional regulatory activity of ERÎ± was enhanced by SFR1. Fourth, ChIP assays confirmed the direct recruitment of SFR1 to the ER binding sites of two representative target genes. Finally, not only was SFR1 involved in the endogenous transcriptional activity of ERÎ±, it also enhanced ER-dependent cell proliferation.</p>
        <p>Unlike some ER coactivators such as SRC1, no intrinsic transcriptional activity was detected for SFR1. It also lacks sequence homology with other known ER coactivators. These findings, along with the ability of SFR1 to mediate ligand-independent and ligand-dependent interactions with ER, led us to propose that SFR1 functions as a unique transcriptional modulator of ERÎ±. The sequence of SFR1 carries features similar to that of the CoRNR box of N-CoR/SMRT corepressors and that of the NR box of coactivators. CoRNR boxes and NR boxes are known to bind to the ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors, including ER. These motifs may thus serve as the structural basis of the observed ligand-independent and ligand-dependent associations between SFR1 and ER, indicative of the unique co-regulator function of SFR1. This idea is also consistent with the fact that SFR1 was isolated from a human mammary gland cDNA library on the basis of its interaction with the ERÎ± CDEF domain fragment.</p>

        <title>Mechanism of ER Transcriptional Modulation by SFR1</title>
        <p>Although a nuclear localization signal was not predicted for SFR1, its function as a nuclear protein was confirmed by our transient transfection and immunostaining experiments showing SFR1 primarily resides in cell nuclei. SFR1 interacts with ER and enhances both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ERÎ± transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068075-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the enhancement is more robust at 12â16 h after the E2 treatment, suggesting a role for SFR1 in dissociating the co-repressors bound to ERÎ± and/or facilitating the subsequent interaction of ERÎ± with other coactivators to assemble a functional transcriptional complex.</p>
        <p>SFR1 may antagonize the function of some ligand-dependent co-repressors, such as ligand-dependent corepressor (LCoR) and repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA), which bind ERÎ± in the presence of E2 <xref rid="pone.0068075-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Mussi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. LCoR inhibits ERÎ± transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent fashion by recruiting co-repressors HDAC3 and CtBP to ERÎ±.

        <title>SFR1: a Potential New Link between Transcription and DNA Repair and a Therapeutic Target for Breast Cancer</title>
        <p>Some transcriptional cofactors can function both in the regulation of transcription and DNA repair, such as the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, the TFIIH general transcription factor and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Our results provide another example of such proteins. Importantly, our work suggests that SFR1 may be specifically involved in ER-dependent regulation of these processes. In this context, Williamson showed that ER is required for an E2-induced DNA double strand break, which is mediated by TopoII-beta <xref rid="pone.0068075-Williamson1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Given that SFR1 binds to ER and that Swi5-SFR1 activates RAD51 recombinase activity <xref rid="pone.0068075-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0068075-Akamatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, it is possible that SFR1 may play an important role in facilitating DNA homologous recombination repair following an ER-mediated DNA double strand break. In a related scenario, recent studies have shown that efficient transcriptional activation by ER requires transient formation of a transcription-induced double strand DNA break <xref rid="pone.0068075-Ju1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. How this transiently-formed DNA break is repaired is not known. Our work raises the intriguing possibility that SFR1 may play a role in this transcription-coupled repairing process.</p>
        <p>Like most NR cofactors, SFR1 is expressed in multiple cell types and tissues. A role for SFR1 in the development of mammary tumors is supported by the finding that the mRNA of SFR1 (GenBank: AAH24403) is expressed in mammary tumors of 5-month-old MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice. Further supporting the involvement of SFR1 in the progression of ER-positive breast cancer, we found that SFR1 is required for estrogen-dependent MCF7 cell proliferation.</p>
        <p>The effect we observed in proliferation assays is likely contributed by an effect of SFR1 knockdown on cell cycle progression in addition to its role in ER or AR mediated transcription.</p>
        <p>While SFR1 may manifest its function in tumors by enhancing ERâs transcriptional activity, given the involvement of SFR1 in the regulation of DNA homologous recombination, it is also possible that hormone receptors, such as ER, may impact the maintenance of genome stability of cells. A further understanding of how SFR1 regulates ERâs transcriptional activity and how ER, through its binding to SFR1, regulates DNA repair, may lead to the identification of important targets that may be used to treat the large number of ER-positive breast cancer patients.</p>
