      <abstract>
        <p>Ocular coloboma results from abnormal embryonic development and is often associated with additional ocular and systemic features. Coloboma is a highly heterogeneous disorder with many cases remaining unexplained. Whole exome sequencing from two cousins affected with dominant coloboma with microcornea, cataracts, and skeletal dysplasia identified a novel heterozygous allele in <italic>MAB21L2</italic>, c.151 C&gt;G, p.(Arg51Gly); the mutation was present in all five family members with the disease and appeared de novo in the first affected generation of the three-generational pedigree. <italic>MAB21L2</italic> encodes a protein similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic> mab-21 cell fate-determining factor; the molecular function of MAB21L2 is largely unknown. To further evaluate the role of <italic>MAB21L2</italic>, zebrafish mutants carrying a p.(Gln48Serfs*5) frameshift truncation (<italic>mab21l2<sup>Q48Sfs*5</sup></italic>) and a p.(Arg51_Phe52del) in-frame deletion (<italic>mab21l2<sup>R51_F52del</sup></italic>) were developed with TALEN technology. Homozygous zebrafish embryos from both lines developed variable lens and coloboma phenotypes: <italic>mab21l2<sup>Q48Sfs*5</sup></italic> embryos demonstrated severe lens and retinal defects with complete lethality while <italic>mab21l2<sup>R51_F52del</sup></italic> mutants displayed a milder lens phenotype and severe coloboma with a small number of fish surviving to adulthood. Protein studies showed decreased stability for the human p.(Arg51Gly) and zebrafish p.(Arg51_Phe52del) mutant proteins and predicted a complete loss-of-function for the zebrafish p.(Gln48Serfs*5) frameshift truncation. Additionally, in contrast to wild-type human <italic>MAB21L2</italic> transcript, mutant p.(Arg51Gly) mRNA failed to efficiently rescue the ocular phenotype when injected into <italic>mab21l2<sup>Q48Sfs*5</sup></italic> embryos, suggesting this allele is functionally deficient. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization experiments identified retinal invagination defects, an increase in cell death, abnormal proliferation patterns, and altered expression of several ocular markers in the <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants. These findings support the identification of <italic>MAB21L2</italic> as a novel factor involved in human coloboma and highlight the power of genome editing manipulation in model organisms for analysis of the effects of whole exome variation in humans.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Coloboma is a hole or gap in one or more of the structures of the eye. Coloboma occurs when the eye is not formed properly during prenatal development. It is often associated with additional eye abnormalities and can result in significant loss of vision. Identification of the genetic causes of coloboma provides more information about how the eye develops. We used whole exome sequencing in an affected family to identify mutations in a new gene associated with dominant coloboma in humans, <italic>MAB21L2</italic>. We used genome editing to disrupt the <italic>mab21l2</italic> gene in zebrafish, which led to similar eye conditions in affected fish, providing additional evidence for the role of this gene in eye development. The function of MAB21L2 is largely unknown; further study of the pathways affected by MAB21L2 deficiency and study of the zebrafish generated by this project will provide more information about the role of this gene in eye development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Coloboma is a congenital segmental ocular defect which can affect one or more structures of the eye; typical coloboma results in an inferior deficiency of iris, chorioretinal, and/or optic nerve tissue [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ocular coloboma is believed to result from failure of normal closure of the optic fissure during embryonic eye development, termed optic fissure closure defect (OFCD) [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Coloboma can occur as an isolated anomaly (simple coloboma) but in most cases it is associated with additional ocular defects, including microphthalmia, cataract, retinal detachment, and ocular motility disorders [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Microcornea, a reduction in the diameter of the cornea, is common in colobomatous eyes and can be associated with normal or even increased (macrophthalmic) axial length [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additional systemic anomalies are present in a large proportion of patients with OFCDs including brain, skeletal, cardiac, or urogenital anomalies [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>A number of genes have been associated with coloboma including transcriptional regulators <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>PAX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>CHD7</italic> and <italic>SALL2;</italic> secreted signaling factor-encoding gene <italic>SHH</italic>; members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily <italic>GDF6</italic> and <italic>GDF3;</italic> members of the retinoic acid synthesis pathway <italic>STRA6</italic> and <italic>ALDH1A3;</italic> as well as membrane porphyrin transporter <italic>ABCB6</italic>, and a member of the HIPPO growth control pathway, <italic>YAP1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to the number of genes involved and the large proportion of unexplained cases, whole exome sequencing has been used with increasing frequency to screen families with coloboma and other ocular conditions [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since whole exome sequencing generates a large number of variants and often involves genes with unexplored/unknown function, studies in animal models can be invaluable in providing further insight into the functional roles of candidate genes/variants and their possible involvement in the studied phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recent advances in genomic editing technologies using engineered nucleases empowered researchers with tools for the functional exploration of these genes/variants of interest [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this manuscript we present evidence for the role of <italic>MAB21L2</italic> in human coloboma and further investigate its role in vertebrate ocular development by generation and analysis of zebrafish <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants.</p>

        <title>Identification of a <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mutation in a human pedigree affected with ocular disease</title>
        <p>The proband (Patient 1) was diagnosed with bilateral microcornea, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, corectopia, nystagmus and cataract (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>); the cataractous lens of his right eye was removed at age 24. Based on ultrasound measurements at age 32, the axial length was 29.02 mm (right eye) and 24.67 mm (left eye), thus showing no signs of microphthalmia (normal axial length for adult males is approximately 23 mm) [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Evaluation of other systems identified mild contracture in the knees and elbows and rhizomelia of the upper and lower limbs: the lengths of the femur (40.3 cm, left and 40.6 cm, right), tibia (34.5cm, left and 34.3 cm, right), humerus (26 cm, left and 26.3 cm, right), ulna (23.5 cm, left and 23.4 cm, right) and radius (22.2 cm, left and 22.6 cm, right) were determined by scanography and the observed femur/tibia (1.18) and humerus/radius (1.17) ratios were found to deviate from the normal reference numbers of 1.23 and 1.31, respectively. No signs of cardiac, brain or other abnormalities were identified. Analysis of family history identified a similarly affected sister, brother, and two nephews, while his father, mother, and two additional sisters were unaffected (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

        <p>Independent whole exome sequencing of DNA samples from the probandâs two affected nephews (III-1 and III-2, <xref rid="pgen.1005002.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) yielded a mean coverage of 63.9X Â± 4.0 for the two samples with 96.25% Â± 0.49 of bases having &gt;10X coverage. Initial analysis of the whole exome data excluded mutations in 72 known factors involved in anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and/or coloboma [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Comparison of whole exome data of the two nephews identified 16 shared heterozygous variants that were novel or rare (&lt;1%): one splicing, one frameshift indel, one inframe indel, and 13 missense alleles (three novel and ten rare) that were found to be damaging by at least 4 functional effect prediction programs (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The five novel alleles and one rare frameshift variant were tested for cosegregation in the pedigree; only the heterozygous <italic>MAB21L2</italic> missense mutation c.151 C&gt;G, p.(Arg51Gly), was present in all five affected individuals (II-1, -5, -7 and III-1, -2) and absent in the unaffected parents (a low âGâ peak at position c.151 was seen in the motherâs sample (I-2) in addition to the wild-type âCâ on sequencing of two independent PCR reactions, suggesting that she is likely to have low-level mosaicism for this mutation) (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The <italic>MAB21L2</italic> variant was further identified as a strong candidate based on its absence in all control populations (EVS, dbSNP, and 1000 genomes) and having the highest Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP++) score, as well as enrichment of both human <italic>MAB21L2</italic> and mouse <italic>Mab21l2</italic> transcripts in ocular structures based in BioGPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org">http://biogps.org</ext-link>). The mutation was predicted to be damaging by SIFT, Polyphen2, Mutation Taster and MutationAssessor, and demonstrated high conservation scores for the affected nucleotide with a GERP++ score of 6.16 and a PhyloP score of 2.94 (of note, the highest possible GERP++ score is 6.17 (most conserved) [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p>

The function and domain structure of MAB21L proteins are largely unknown; the most similar protein with a known structure is human MB21D1 (Mab-21 domain containing 1, also known as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)), a protein involved in innate immunity and binding to cytosolic double stranded DNA to activate interferon production [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The domain structure of MB21D1 includes a mab-21 domain and two DNA-binding domains, one located N-terminally to the mab-21 domain (with a three-residue overlap) and the other situated within the C-terminal portion of the mab-21 domain [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. If MAB21L2 structure is similar to MB21D1, then the arginine at position 51 of MAB21L2 would be located in proximity to the predicted mab-21 domain and within the N-terminal DNA-binding domain; this is consistent with the fact that arginine represents the most basic amino acid and is often observed at protein-nucleic acid interaction sites.</p>

Analysis of the UK10K_Rare_Coloboma cohort identified a heterozygous mutation affecting the same arginine residue described above (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), c.152 G&gt;A, p.(Arg51His), in two samples: UK10K_COL5001067 (the c.152 G&gt;A change was present in 10 out of 23 high quality reads) and UK10K_COL5001068 (the c.152 G&gt;A change was seen in 21 out of 32 high quality reads). While the publicly available UK10K data does not specify family relationships, the presence of identical mutations in consecutively numbered samples suggests that these individuals may be family members. Similar to the c.151 C&gt;G, p.(Arg51Gly) allele, this mutation was not reported in the Exome Variant Server (0/13,006 alleles), the 1000 Genomes Browser (0/2,194 alleles), or dbSNP, and is predicted to be damaging by SIFT, Polyphen2, Mutation Taster and Mutation Assessor.

Crosses involving frameshift mutations resulted in a distinct phenotype in 26 out of 101 (26%) embryos, consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance. The phenotype of homozygous frameshift mutants included microphthalmia with small or absent lens in 100% of affected embryos, as well as coloboma and shortened body/curved tail in 76% and 56% of affected fish, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G-I</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005002.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.).

        <title>Analysis of wild-type and mutant MAB21L2/mab21l2 proteins</title>
        <p>To examine the effect of the p.(Arg51Gly) mutation on the MAB21L2 protein, we tested the expression, localization and protein stability of the wild-type and mutant proteins via transfections of the corresponding FLAG-tagged constructs into human lens epithelial B3 (HLE-B3) cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; <italic>MAB21L2</italic> was also found to be endogenously expressed in these cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.). Mab21l proteins were previously shown to localize primarily to the nucleus [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Western Blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions confirmed the presence of ~41kDa wild-type MAB21L2 protein in both cellular compartments with greater nuclear localization (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts detected a decreased amount of the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant in comparison to wild-type protein (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>); the mutant protein was found to be present at 31.97% Â± 9.36% of wild-type based on three independent experiments. Cellular immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated no significant alteration in the localization pattern between wild-type and mutant protein with predominant nuclear localization and some cytoplasmic staining for both forms (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Since the levels of recombinant <italic>MAB21L2</italic> transcript encoding for wild-type and p.(Arg51Gly) mutant proteins detected by RT-PCR did not show a significant difference (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005002.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.), we proceeded to perform protein stability assays using a series of cycloheximide treatments of HLE-B3 cells transfected with MAB21L2 constructs (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Protein stability assays showed a more rapid decrease in the amount of p.(Arg51Gly) mutant in comparison to wild-type protein at all examined time points, with 11% of the mutant protein being present after 7.5 hours of cycloheximide treatment in comparison to 20% of the wild-type MAB21L2 (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). Calculation of the proteinsâ half-life identified a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in stability of wild-type (2.64Â±0.25 hours) versus the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant (1.91Â±0.36).

        <p>Functional analysis of the p.(Gln48*) (to represent the zebrafish p.(Gln48Serfs*5) mutant) and p.(Arg51_Phe52del) proteins was also undertaken in HLE-B3 cells. The p.(Gln48*) mutant was found to be highly unstable as no detectable level of this protein (estimated to have a molecular weight of ~5.5 kDa) was identified via Western blot analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). The p.(Arg51_Phe52del) mutant also demonstrated a reduction in the amount of detected protein to 2.57% Â± 2.20% of wild-type MAB21L2 protein based on three independent experiments (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>); cellular immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated predominantly nuclear staining similar to wild-type distribution (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Protein stability assays confirmed increased instability of the p.(Arg51_Phe52del) protein with less than 5% of mutant protein being detected after 7.5 hours of cycloheximide exposure versus 20% for the wild-type (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>). The half-life of the p.(Arg51_Phe52del) mutant was estimated to be 1.91Â±0.27 hours versus 2.64Â±.25 for wild-type, which represented a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05). The half-life values of the p.(Arg51_Phe52del) and p.(Arg51Gly) proteins were not significantly different from each other despite the observed reduced level of p.(Arg51_Phe52del) in comparison to p.(Arg51Gly) in replicate Western blots of untreated cells (see above, <xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>); this suggests that there may be additional factors affecting the stability of the p.(Arg51_Phe52del) mutant which may require alternative assays to uncover [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
        <p>To further test the pathogenicity of the human p.(Arg51Gly) allele, we injected embryos generated by heterozygous <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> crosses with either wild type <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mRNA or mRNA encoding for the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant; a small number of embryos were left uninjected as a control. The embryos were carefully examined for ocular anomalies at 72-hpf, divided into affected and normal groups, and then genotyped. In total, out of 104 surviving embryos injected with wild type <italic>MAB21L2</italic>, 68% (21/31) of homozygous fish developed normal eyes and lenses while out of 108 surviving embryos injected with the mutant mRNA encoding for p.(Arg51Gly), only 14% (3/22) of homozygous fish developed normal eyes and lenses; in the control group, none of the 9 uninjected homozygous embryos (out of 36 surviving) had normal eyes and lenses. The difference in the proportion of normal phenotypes seen in the homozygous <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> fish injected with wild-type mRNA versus embryos injected with either mutant mRNA or left uninjected was statistically significant (p&lt;.0005), while the difference between the mutant RNA- injected and the uninjected embryos was not statistically significant (p&gt;.20) by chi-squared analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005002.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). The efficient rescue by wild type <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mRNA confirms that the ocular phenotype in the mutant line is caused by the <italic>mab21l2</italic> deficiency and demonstrates functional conservation between zebrafish and human mab21l2/MAB21L2 proteins. The absence of robust rescue by mRNA encoding for the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant supports the pathogenic role of this <italic>MAB21L2</italic> allele in human disease.</p>
        <p>To investigate the possibility of dominant-negative effects for the mutant allele, <italic>MAB21L2</italic> wild type mRNA or mRNA encoding for the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant were injected (at the same concentrations as in rescue experiments) into wild-type embryos and observed for phenotypes up to 120-hpf. Among the 39 surviving embryos that were injected with wild-type <italic>MAB21L2</italic>, no embryos displayed an eye phenotype (9 fish showed moderate-severe overall malformations). Similarly, among the 61 surviving embryos that were injected with the mutant mRNA encoding for the p.(Arg51Gly) protein, no embryos showed an eye phenotype (10 fish showed moderate-severe overall malformations). Thus, these experiments identified no dominant-negative effect for the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant allele in zebrafish at concentrations that are sufficient for phenotypic rescue of the <italic>mab21l2</italic>-deficient phenotype.</p>

      <p>In this manuscript we present evidence for the conserved function of <italic>MAB21L2/mab21l2</italic> in vertebrate ocular development through demonstration of abnormal phenotypes associated with mutations in this gene in humans and zebrafish. Human <italic>MAB21L2</italic>, located at 4q31.3, is a member of the <italic>MAB21L</italic> gene family that consists of three members, <italic>MAB21L1-3</italic>. MAB21L proteins are related to the mab-21 (male abnormal 21) nuclear factor [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] associated with thinning of ray 6 and frequent fusions of rays 4 and 6 of a set of nine bilateral peripheral rays in male <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The molecular function of MAB21L2 is largely unknown. Previous reports involving double mutants of <italic>mab-21</italic> and <italic>sma</italic> members (<italic>SMAD</italic> family) in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> indicated that <italic>mab-21</italic> is positioned downstream of <italic>sma</italic> and is negatively regulated by <italic>dbl-1</italic>, a homolog of human <italic>BMP5</italic>, thus placing <italic>mab-21</italic> in the TGF-Î² signaling cascade [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The TGF-Î² signaling cascade plays an important role in ocular development and mutations in many associated factors, such as <italic>BMP4</italic>, <italic>BMP7</italic>, <italic>GDF3</italic>, and <italic>GDF6</italic>, lead to an overlapping spectrum of phenotypes in humans [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, mab-18 (PAX6 ortholog) mutants demonstrate a phenotype that is highly similar to mab-21 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and <italic>Mab21l2</italic> expression was found to be upregulated in embryonic mouse lenses heterozygous for a <italic>Pax6</italic> loss-of-function allele [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] suggesting a possible conserved genetic interaction.</p>
      <p>In mouse, <italic>Mab21l2</italic> ocular expression was reported in the dorsal optic vesicle and head surface ectoderm in E8.5â9.5 embryos and the neural retina, optic nerve and RPE at E12 [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; homozygous <italic>Mab21l2</italic> knockout mice demonstrated a rudimentary retina and aphakia due to improper invagination of the optic vesicle as well as ventral body wall defects, improper formation of the heart and liver, and embryonic lethality [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Previously published reports of lens expression in animal models are somewhat inconsistent: four studies reported lack of lens expression for <italic>Mab21l2/mab21l2</italic> (with many showing the presence of lens expression for its close homolog, <italic>Mab21l1/ mab21l1</italic>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] while three other manuscripts noted <italic>Mab21l2/mab21l2</italic> transcripts in the developing lens [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which is consistent with the results of our study. In zebrafish, morpholino-mediated knockdown of <italic>mab21l2</italic> resulted in microphthalmia and incomplete retinal development including discontinuous inner and outer plexiform layers [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the zebrafish genetic mutants that we developed, severe defects in the development of both the lens and retina were observed consistent with strong expression of <italic>mab21l2</italic> in both tissues. While the phenotypes of <italic>mab21l2</italic> morphants and mutants show overlap, some ocular features, including severe lens degeneration, coloboma, and early retinal invagination defects, appear to be more pronounced or observed primarily in genetic mutants; this may be due to incomplete disruption of mab21l2 function via morpholino, the transient nature of morpholino-induced effects, and/or genetic background differences.</p>
      <p>Both of the <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants generated in this study demonstrated variable retinal invagination defects. In zebrafish, retinal invagination, which occurs upon contact of the optic vesicle (formed as an extension of the forebrain neuroepithelium) with the surface ectoderm, is completed with formation of the cup-shaped optic vesicle by ~22-hpf. In <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> embryos, a shallow misshapen optic cup, especially at its ventral part, was detected in 24-hpf embryos; the lens mass (similar to the mammalian lens vesicle) was also visibly smaller than normal at this stage. In the <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>R51_F52del</italic></sup> in-frame deletion mutant, a more constricted optic cup with some ventral and dorsal retinal folding was observed, while the developing lens appeared to have normal size and shape in most embryos. The observed defects in early optic cup formation indicate a possible conserved role for <italic>mab21l2</italic> in this process in vertebrates.</p>

<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> mutants at early embryonic stages. An increase in TUNEL staining was also observed at later stages of development and was, to a lesser degree, present in the <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>R51_F52del</italic></sup> embryos carrying homozygous in-frame deletion alleles. Both increased cell death (through apoptosis and/or necroptosis) and defects in cellular proliferation have been linked to optic fissure closure defects in other genetic models of coloboma [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]; since the TUNEL assay may not discriminate between apoptotic and other cell death mechanisms [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], further studies are needed to evaluate the possible involvement of necroptosis in <italic>mab21l2</italic> deficient phenotypes. Additionally, the expression of several ocular markers including <italic>pax6b</italic>, <italic>pax2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, <italic>foxe3</italic> and ZL-1 was altered in <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants. These observed differences seem more likely to be caused by the severe disorganization of mutant ocular tissues rather than direct regulation of expression of those markers by mab21l2.</p>
      <p>The distinct phenotypes associated with the <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> frameshift truncation and <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>R51_F52del</italic></sup> in-frame deletion mutations suggest different molecular mechanisms. The <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>R51_F52del</italic></sup> in-frame deletion demonstrated milder features in comparison to the <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> mutant, such as less affected lens development, less pronounced cell death and incomplete embryonic lethality. These observations support the possibility that this mutation results in a hypomorphic allele retaining some of its normal function, particularly in relation to lens development. The severe coloboma observed in <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>R51_F52del</italic></sup> embryos may point to the particular importance of domains located in the N-terminal region of mab21l2 for its proper functioning in the developing retina. Since the zebrafish p.(Arg51_Phe52del) in-frame deletion and the human p.(Arg51Gly) missense alleles affect homologous regions of the MAB21L2/mab21l2 proteins, the mechanism(s) of these mutations may be similar to each other. Understanding of these mechanisms requires additional studies into the domain structure and function of MAB21L2/mab21l2 protein.</p>
      <p>Analysis of wild-type and mutant proteins in human lens epithelial cells identified a range of protein stability defects among mutant forms with the human p.(Arg51Gly) mutant stability mildly reduced, the zebrafish p.(Arg51_Phe52del) mutant stability highly affected, and the p.(Gln48*) truncation protein (similar to the p.(Gln48Serfs*5) mutant) being entirely unstable. This analysis suggested that the zebrafish p.(Gln48Serfs*5) mutation results in a complete loss-of-function allele, since the similar mutant protein p.(Gln48*) was completely unstable and any protein produced would be missing the entire mab-21 domain. These experiments also indicated the likely importance of arginine 51 and the immediately adjacent amino acids for normal conformation and stability of the MAB21L2/mab21l2 protein because disruptions of this region resulted in decreased stability for both the human p.(Arg51Gly) and the zebrafish p.(Arg51_Phe52del) proteins. Further studies demonstrated that, in contrast to wild-type human <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mRNA, mutant mRNA encoding for the p.(Arg51Gly) protein failed to efficiently rescue the ocular phenotype of homozygous <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> embryos, suggesting functional deficiency for the identified human mutation. In addition, overexpression of mutant <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mRNA in zebrafish embryos resulted in no obvious ocular phenotype, implying absence of a dominant-negative effect. However, it is possible that the full impact of the p.(Arg51Gly) mutation was not discernable due to insufficient dosage, its acting later in development, or other factors; this needs to be further investigated by additional approaches, including development of zebrafish mutants carrying this specific allele.</p>
      <p>No abnormal phenotype was seen in heterozygous zebrafish for either the frameshift truncation or in-frame deletion mutations, while a dominant phenotype was observed in human patients with the p.(Arg51Gly) alteration. This may be explained by variability in gene dosage requirements between species [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] or a different mechanism for the human mutation. The presence of mild rhizomelia/ contractures in human patients with <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mutations suggests its involvement in skeletal development. Additional phenotypes such as shortened body/curved tail, craniofacial malformations and lethality were present in the zebrafish <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants while heart, liver, embryonic lethality and other anomalies were previously reported in mouse <italic>Mab21l2</italic> mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Considering these observations and the fact that multiple pleiotropic effects of mab-21 mutations have been previously noted [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], additional <italic>MAB21L2</italic>-associated phenotypes are likely to be identified and may present with broad interfamilial variability.</p>
      <p>While this paper was in revision, four families with mutations in <italic>MAB21L2</italic> were described by Rainger et al [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This manuscript reports three heterozygous mutations (p.(Arg51Cys), p.(Arg51His), and p.(Glu49Lys) affecting the same region as the mutation reported here and resulting in similar phenotypes (anophthalmia or colobomatous microphthalmia with rhizomelic skeletal dysplasia in two families); one of the reported families includes the UK10K_COL5001067 and UK10K_COL5001068 cases with the p.(Arg51His) mutation that we presented in results from the publically available data. In addition, one family with a recessive <italic>MAB21L2</italic> mutation affecting the C-terminal region of the protein was identified. Functional assays of the mutant alleles using an inducible HEK293 cell system expressing wild-type or mutant MAB21L2 as GFP fusion proteins suggested a possible gain-of-function effect for the dominant mutations based on observed increased protein stability; an increase in phospho-ERK1 was detected with induction of either wild-type or p.(Arg51His) mutant MAB21L2 protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This differs from the proposed mechanism of the mutation identified in our study which revealed a decrease in protein stability for the p.(Arg51Gly) mutant tagged with FLAG epitope and absence of a dominant phenotype in zebrafish embryos injected with mRNA encoding for this protein. This may be due to diverse effects of the studied amino acid substitutions (Arg51Gly versus Arg51His, Arg51Cys, and Glu49Lys) on MAB21L2 protein structure, different effects of tags on protein stability (GFP versus FLAG), or other factors, and needs to be investigated further. Rainger and co-authors (2014) also suggested an involvement of MAB21L2 in ssRNA binding [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In our manuscript, we developed an allelic series of zebrafish <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants, uncovered an early onset optic cup apoptosis phenotype in affected embryos, and demonstrated a decrease in protein stability, as well as functional deficiency and no dominant-negative effect for the p.(Arg51Gly) mutation in zebrafish embryos.</p>
      <p>Taken as a whole, the complete co-segregation of the identified <italic>MAB21L2</italic> allele with the ocular phenotype in the family, the <italic>de novo</italic> appearance of the mutation in the affected progeny of unaffected parents with low-level mosaicism present in the mother, the in silico and experimental indications of the functional importance of the arginine at position 51, the development of ocular defects in <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutant zebrafish embryos, as well as rescue of the ocular phenotype of homozygous <italic>mab21l2</italic>
<sup><italic>Q48Sfs*5</italic></sup> embryos with injection of wild-type but not the p.(Arg51Gly)-encoding mutant mRNA, provide strong support for the pathogenicity of the identified <italic>MAB21L2</italic> allele and the involvement of <italic>MAB21L2</italic> in human ocular development and disease. The developed zebrafish <italic>mab21l2</italic> mutants will help to further explore the developmental roles and molecular function of this conserved ocular factor.</p>

        <p>Human lens epithelial B3 (HLE-B3) cells (ATCC, CRL-11421) were maintained in MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% FBS (Life Technologies), 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies). All transfections were performed by transfecting HLE-B3 cells with 15 Î¼g of DNA and 30 Î¼l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) in Opti-MEM in 100 mm petri dishes.</p>
        <p>For Western blot analysis, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were generated using the CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction kit (Cat#NXTRACT Sigma-Aldrich,). 48 hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, collected, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 15 minutes, 30 Î¼l of 10% IGEPAL was added to the cell suspension. Cells were then vortexed and spun at 10,000 xg for 30 seconds at 4Â°C. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was decanted and saved. The nuclear fraction was generated by adding 70 Î¼l of nuclear extraction buffer to the pellet, incubating on ice for 25 minutes, spun at 20,000 xg for 5 minutes at 4Â°C and the supernatant was saved (nuclear fraction). Molecular weights for wild-type and mutant proteins were estimated using Protein Molecular Weight calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.org/sms/prot_mw.html">http://bioinformatics.org/sms/prot_mw.html</ext-link>). The BenchMark Pre-stained Protein Ladder (Cat. #10748-010) (Life Technologies) was utilized as the protein molecular weight standard.</p>
        <p>The stability of the MAB21L2 wild type and mutant proteins were characterized using a modified protocol previously described by Alur et al. 2010 [<xref rid="pgen.1005002.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In these experiments, cycloheximide, which is known to block translational elongation and thus to inhibit protein biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms, was used to treat cells transfected with MAB21L2 expression constructs in a time-course analysis to allow for protein degradation rates to be revealed in the absence of new protein production. Briefly, cells were split 24 hours after transfection into 35 mm petri dishes. After an additional 24 hours, cells were treated with 100 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide (Cat. #C4859; Sigma-Aldrich) and collected at the indicated time points (0-, 1.5-, 3-, 4.5-, 6, and 7.5-hours after exposure). Whole cell lysates were generated by washing with PBS, cells were scraped in PBS and collected in 1.5 ml tubes, cells were spun at 1,000 xg for 1.5 minutes and PBS was removed. Cells were then resuspended in 40 Î¼l of 1x RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCL, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 15 minutes, vortexing every 5 minutes. Cells were spun down for 10 minutes at 20,000 xg at 4Â°C and the supernatant was used for Western Blot analysis (see below). Western blots signals for MAB21L2 were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to GAPDH levels (also measured by ImageJ) and the obtained values were graphed to produce degradation curves. Stability assays were performed in triplicate. Exponential decay curves were fitted to each replicate stability assay and the half-lives were determined. A two-tailed student's t-test was used to determine if the groups were different.</p>
        <p>Lysates were denatured by adding equal volume of 2x sample buffer (65.8 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 26.3% (w/v) glycerol, 2.1% SDS, and 0.01% bromophenol blue) (Cat. #161-0737) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) followed by boiling for 4 minutes at 95Â°C and run on a 10% Criterion Tris-HCl Gel (Cat. #345-1018) (Bio-Rad). Gels were immunobloted with anti-FLAG (Cat. #F1804) (Sigma-Aldrich) antibody at a 1:1000 dilution or anti-GAPDH (Cat#ab8245) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibody at 1:5000 dilution. The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (Cat. #12-349) (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) at a 1:2500 dilution. The blots were developed using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
        <p>For cellular immunofluorescence experiments cells were split 24 hours after transfection and seeded onto coverslips. After 24 hours the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed twice with PBS, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum in PBS for 30 minutes at 37Â°C, incubated with 1:1000 anti-FLAG antibody in 10% normal donkey serum in PBS for 2 hours at 37Â°C, washed three times with PBS, incubated in 1:1000 Alexa Flour 568 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Cat. #A10037) (Life Technologies), washed twice with PBS, incubated for 5 minutes at room temp with 1:1000 DAPI in PBS, washed twice with PBS and mounted on glass slides.</p>

        <p>For rescue and overexpression experiments, mRNA was generated using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE Transcription kit (Cat. #AM1344) (Life Technologies). 300 pg of mRNA was injected into 1â4 cell stage embryos produced by wild-type or c.141_153delCCAAGAGCCCCGT heterozygous mutant crosses. The injected embryos were observed for up to 5 days of fertilization, separated into groups based on observed presence/absence of ocular phenotype and then genotyped.</p>
