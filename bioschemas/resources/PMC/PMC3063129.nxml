        <p>Centrosomal localization of kinase-active CK1Î´ is required for neurite outgrowth in response to Wnt-3a.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Previously we determined that Dishevelled-2/3 (Dvl) mediate Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth in Ewing sarcoma family tumor cells. Here we report that neurite extension was associated with Dvl phosphorylation and that both were inhibited by the casein kinase 1 (CK1) Î´/Îµ inhibitor IC261. Small interfering RNAs targeting either CK1Î´ or CK1Îµ decreased Dvl phosphorylation, but only knockdown of CK1Î´ blocked neurite outgrowth. CK1Î´ but not CK1Îµ was detected at the centrosome, an organelle associated with neurite formation. Deletion analysis mapped the centrosomal localization signal (CLS) of CK1Î´ to its C-terminal domain. A fusion protein containing the CLS and EGFP displaced full-length CK1Î´ from the centrosome and inhibited Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth. In contrast to wild-type CK1Îµ, a chimera comprised of the kinase domain of CK1Îµ and the CLS of CK1Î´ localized to the centrosome and rescued Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth suppressed by CK1Î´ knockdown. These results provide strong evidence that the centrosomal localization of CK1Î´ is required for Wnt-3aâdependent neuritogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnts comprise a large family of secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins that have a variety of activities during embryonic development and promote tissue homeostasis in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klaus and Birchmeier, 2008</xref>). They are particularly important in the development of the nervous system where they participate in several morphogenetic events including neural tube closure, formation of specific brain structures, as well as the induction and migration of neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciani and Salinas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malaterre et al., 2007</xref>). Wnts also stimulate axonal remodeling, pathfinding, dendritic arborization, and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salinas and Zou, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Several Wnt signaling mechanisms have been implicated in neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciani and Salinas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Endo and Rubin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SÃ¡nchez-Camacho and Bovolenta, 2009</xref>). They are mediated by various Wnts and the Frizzled seven-pass transmembrane Wnt receptors or the atypical tyrosine kinase Wnt receptor, Ryk/Derailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Wnt-7a promoted axonal remodeling of mossy fibers in mouse cerebellum by stabilizing microtubules via a mechanism that involved Dishevelled 1 (Dvl-1) and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krylova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciani et al., 2004</xref>). Activation of Dvl-1, Rac1, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by Wnt-7b stimulated dendritic arborization in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosso et al., 2005</xref>). Axon specification in hippocampal neurons was induced by Wnt-5a through a process that relied on interaction of Dvl-2 with atypical PKC-Î¶ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), an enzyme that also mediated Wnt-4âdependent extension of commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyuksyutova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolf et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>As noted in the previous paragraph, Dvl isoforms contribute to Wnt-dependent neurite outgrowth in a variety of ways. Dvls function as positive effectors in the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway as well as in the noncanonical planar cell polarity (PCP) and calcium-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao and Chen, 2010</xref>). Many of their activities have been associated with specific molecular domains and presumed to be regulated by phosphorylation. Dvls have dozens of potential phosphorylation sites and are substrates for several kinases, including casein kinase 1 (CK1), CK2, and protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>). In particular, several articles suggest a functional connection between CK1 and Dvls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryja et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The CK1 family of evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinases consists of seven isoforms in mammals (Î±, Î², Î³1, Î³2, Î³3, Î´, and Îµ). These enzymes share a highly related kinase domain but differ considerably in the length and sequence of their N- and C-terminal regions. The C-terminal domains have a role in the contrasting activities and regulation of the various isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graves and Roach, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross and Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahlberg et al., 2009</xref>). CK1 enzymes participate in multiple processes including DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowrey et al., 2000</xref>). All the isoforms except CK1Î³s phosphorylate Dvl in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKay et al., 2001</xref>). However, accounts of the functional consequences associated with Dvl phosphorylation vary widely. CK1Îµ was initially identified as a positive regulator of the Î²-catenin pathway in <italic>Xenopus</italic> via a Dvl-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peters et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakanaka et al., 1999</xref>). Another report claimed that CK1Îµ-dependent Dvl phosphorylation caused a shift from JNK to Î²-catenin signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cong et al., 2004</xref>). However, others observed that CK1Îµ stimulated PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strutt et al., 2006</xref>), or both PCP and Î²-catenin signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> after Dvl phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, inhibition of CK1Î´/Îµ blocked Wnt-3aâdependent Dvl phosphorylation in a rat dopaminergic cell line, but did not prevent activation of the Î²-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryja et al., 2007a</xref>). The same group also documented Wnt-5aâdependent Dvl phosphorylation by CK1Î´/Îµ and linked it to dopaminergic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryja et al., 2007b</xref>). Subsequently, they suggested that Dvl phosphorylation by CK1Î´/Îµ triggered a switch from Rac1 activation to stimulation of another noncanonical signaling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryja et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Previously, we reported that Wnt-3a induced neurite outgrowth in Ewing sarcoma family of tumor (ESFT) cells via a noncanonical mechanism that required Frizzled-3, Dvl-2/3, and JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo et al., 2008</xref>). Now we describe a connection between Dvl phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. Although CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ both contributed to Dvl phosphorylation, only CK1Î´ was required for Wnt-3aâdependent neurite extension. CK1Î´, but not CK1Îµ was strongly localized to the centrosome, an organelle that functions in neurite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Anda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007</xref>), and displacement of CK1Î´ from the centrosome was associated with inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, a chimera comprised of the kinase domain of CK1Îµ and the centrosomal localization signal (CLS) of CK1Î´ rescued neurite outgrowth when expression of endogenous CK1Î´ was inhibited by siRNA. These findings demonstrated a surprising difference in function of CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ and established the importance of CK1Î´ centrosomal localization for Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <title>Dvl-2/3 phosphorylation is associated with Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth</title>
        <p>Wnt-3a stimulates neurite outgrowth in a variety of ESFT cell lines including TC-32 cells. In contrast, Wnt-1 conditioned medium (CM) failed to elicit neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo et al., 2008</xref>). To investigate differences in the signaling downstream of Wnt-1 and Wnt-3a, we examined dose-dependent changes in Dvl phosphorylation after treatment of TC-32 cells. Wnt-3a CM induced a mobility shift of Dvl-2 and Dvl-3 in SDS-PAGE and decreased the recognition of Dvl-2 by mAb 10B5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), all signs of Dvl phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GonzÃ¡lez-Sancho et al., 2004</xref>). No changes in Dvl mobility or immunoreactivity were seen with Wnt-1 CM. However, TC-32 cells were able to respond to Wnt-1 in other ways, as indicated by the stabilization of Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo et al., 2008</xref>). The differential effects of Wnt-3a and Wnt-1 on Dvl phosphorylation suggested a potential connection between these post-translational modifications and Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <title>CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ both phosphorylate Dvl-2/3, but only CK1Î´ is required for neurite outgrowth induced by Wnt-3a</title>
        <p>A screen of small molecule inhibitors targeting kinases known to phosphorylate Dvls revealed that IC261, a preferential inhibitor of CK1Î´/Îµ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mashhoon et al., 2000</xref>), blocked Wnt-3aâdependent Dvl-2 phosphorylation and neurite extension. To confirm that CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ were responsible for the Dvl-2 mobility shift, we pretreated TC-32 cells with siRNA reagents directed against CK1Î´ or CK1Îµ alone or in combination before incubation with Wnt-3a. Western blot analysis verified that the siRNA reagents specifically inhibited the expression of the corresponding CK1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Immunoblotting with the Dvl-2 mAb 10B5 showed that knockdown of each CK1 isoform decreased the Wnt-3aâdependent mobility shift and loss of epitope recognition, whereas the simultaneous knockdown of CK1Î´/Îµ had a stronger effect. The CK1Î´/Îµ siRNA reagents also decreased the Dvl-2 mobility shift and enhanced 10B5 cross-reactivity in the absence of added Wnt-3a, implying that in the basal state Dvl-2 was partially phosphorylated by CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p>

        <p>When cells were treated with CK1Î´/Îµ siRNA reagents in the neurite outgrowth assay, we obtained a surprising result. Although CK1Î´ knockdown markedly inhibited Wnt-3aâinduced neurite formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), CK1Îµ knockdown increased neurite formation in the absence of exogenous Wnt-3a, and there was no additional stimulation by Wnt-3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). The CK1Î´ requirement was confirmed when neurite outgrowth was rescued by expression of an siRNA-resistant CK1Î´ construct. Simultaneous knockdown of CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ prevented the neurite outgrowth observed when only CK1Îµ expression had been suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, DâF</xref>), further emphasizing the importance of CK1Î´ for neurite formation.</p>

        <title>CK1Î´ but not CK1Îµ is strongly localized to the centrosome</title>
        <p>Because neurite outgrowth and axonal specification are dependent on the activity of the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Anda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007</xref>), we examined the centrosomal distribution of CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ in TC-32 cells. Confocal microscopy of methanol-fixed cells showed an intense signal for CK1Î´ that colocalized with the centrosomal marker Î³-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). A weaker signal was detected in the cytoplasm and in neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Analysis of CK1Îµ distribution revealed a diffuse pattern and little colocalization with pericentrin, another centrosomal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). To ensure that the contrast in centrosomal localization of CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ was not due to differences in detection conditions, experiments were performed with HeLa cells expressing Myc-tagged CK1Î´ or CK1Îµ and co-stained with Myc and pericentrin antibodies. As in TC-32 cells, only CK1Î´ colocalized with the centrosomal marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Centrosomal localization signal of CK1Î´ is in the C-terminal domain</title>
        <p>CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ are 87% and 97% identical in their N-terminal and kinase domains, respectively, but only 55â56% identical in their C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We hypothesized that the C-terminal sequences accounted for the differences in their centrosomal distribution. To test this idea, colocalization experiments were performed in HeLa cells that expressed Myc-tagged wild-type CK1 isoforms or chimeras in which the C-terminal domains had been interchanged. Co-staining with antibodies to Myc and pericentrin demonstrated that only wild-type CK1Î´ and the chimera containing its C-terminal domain (Î´CT) showed a clear association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This suggested that Î´CT was required for centrosomal distribution, a conclusion that was confirmed when a CK1Î´ derivative lacking Î´CT failed to localize to the centrosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201011111/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). To determine whether Î´CT was sufficient for centrosomal localization, Î´CT sequence was linked to cDNA encoding enhanced GFP (EGFP). Transient expression in HeLa cells followed by confocal microscopy revealed that Î´CT-EGFP bound to the centrosome, whereas EGFP did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). A similar construct containing the C-terminal domain of CK1Îµ exhibited weaker centrosomal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Taken together, these findings established that Î´CT was both necessary and sufficient for CK1Î´ binding to the centrosome.</p>
        <p>To map the CLS within Î´CT, a series of Î´CT-EGFP truncation mutants were generated and their colocalization with pericentrin was examined in transiently transfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201011111/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). A strong centrosomal signal was seen in &gt;70% of cells expressing the mutant lacking residues 365â415 (Î´CT(278â364)-EGFP). The derivative lacking residues 326â415 (Î´CT(278â325)-EGFP) also localized to the centrosome in a large majority of cells, although the signal intensity was diminished. Further deletion of C-terminal sequences resulted in a progressively decreasing proportion of cells in which co-staining with pericentrin was observed. A complementary construct lacking residues 278â325 exhibited little association with the centrosome. These results demonstrated that residues 278â325 were necessary but not sufficient for a strong association with the centrosome. We concluded that the CLS was comprised of residues 278â364. Interestingly, this region contains most of the evolutionarily conserved differences between CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201011111/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>EGFP fusion proteins containing an intact CLS displaced full-length CK1Î´ from the centrosome and blocked neurite outgrowth</title>
        <p>To test the functional relevance of centrosomal CK1Î´, we first determined that EGFP derivatives containing the CLS could prevent the accumulation of CK1Î´ at the centrosome. Myc-tagged CK1Î´ was required in these experiments because the antibody used to detect endogenous CK1Î´ cross-reacts with the C-terminal domain. Î´CT/EGFP and Î´CT(278â364)-EGFP each inhibited the centrosomal localization of Myc-tagged CK1Î´ when the constructs were coexpressed in TC-32 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Semi-quantitative analysis indicated that the centrosomal staining pattern was absent from at least 70% of the â¼30 cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). In contrast, when cells coexpressed a truncation mutant lacking approximately half of the CLS, Î´CT(278â325)-EGFP, only â¼10% lacked the centrosomal staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). EGFP also did not impede the centrosomal distribution of Myc-CK1Î´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Moreover, ÎµCT/EGFP had little effect on CK1Î´ centrosomal localization, even when ÎµCT/EGFP was detected at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Immunoblotting confirmed that the failure to block centrosomal localization was not due to low levels of fusion protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Contrasting activity of CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ in neurite outgrowth is directly linked to centrosomal localization</title>
        <p>To further address the potential relevance of centrosomal CK1Î´ for neurite outgrowth, we investigated the activity of a CK1Îµ derivative that contained the CLS of CK1Î´ in place of its own C-terminal domain. As with the CK1Îµ/Î´CT chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), this protein showed a strong centrosomal staining pattern (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201011111/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Neurite extension after Wnt-3a administration was abrogated when TC-32 cells were pretreated with CK1Î´ siRNA targeting a 3â²UTR sequence and rescued by the expression of full-length CK1Î´ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). Although neurite outgrowth was not maintained by the expression of full-length CK1Îµ, it was rescued by mCK1Îµ/Î´CT(278â364) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). Thus, the addition of sequence to CK1Îµ that anchored it like CK1Î´ to the centrosome was sufficient to enable Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current study is the first to demonstrate a critical role for CK1Î´ in neurite formation. Knockdown of CK1Î´ expression by siRNA blocked Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth in TC-32 cells, and the CK1Î´ requirement was confirmed when transfection with an siRNA-resistant CK1Î´ cDNA restored neuritogenesis. Moreover, we determined that the centrosomal localization of CK1Î´ is important for neurite extension. Using CK1Î´/Îµ chimeras and a series of CK1Î´/EGFP fusion proteins we identified the CLS within the CK1Î´ C-terminal domain. Only EGFP fusion proteins containing this CLS displaced full-length CK1Î´ from the centrosome, mimicking results obtained with corresponding CLS/EGFP fusion proteins that displaced cyclins A and E from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsumoto and Maller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pascreau et al., 2010</xref>). Displacement of CK1Î´ from the centrosome was associated with inhibition of Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth, whereas expression of a similar fusion protein lacking the CLS or EGFP alone did not block neurite extension. Prior work demonstrated the importance of cell membrane or nuclear localization for the function of specific CK1 isoforms and implicated the C-terminal domain in this spatial regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross and Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babu et al., 2002</xref>). In the present study, the C-terminal domain again was shown to specify a functionally important subcellular distribution, as the centrosomal localization of CK1Î´ was pivotal for Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth.</p>
      <p>Our study revealed a surprising functional difference between CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ. Typically, they have been described as having similar or redundant activities, reflecting the 97% homology of their kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knippschild et al., 2005</xref>). Both CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ contribute to the control of circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowrey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), although recent studies with gene knockout mouse models and selective inhibitors for each kinase suggest that CK1Î´ has a stronger effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Etchegaray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2010</xref>). In our experimental system not only is the requirement of CK1Î´ for Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth significant, the stimulation of neurite extension after CK1Îµ siRNA treatment also is noteworthy. Apparently CK1Îµ has an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth, perhaps by competing with CK1Î´ for interaction with critical substrates. In this regard, we propose that their differential localization to the centrosome is critical: CK1Îµ elsewhere in the cell could prevent substrate access to CK1Î´ at the centrosome where phosphorylation presumably is crucial for neuritogenesis. Consistent with this view, CK1Î´ and Dvl-2/3 were required for neurite outgrowth induced by CK1Îµ siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, DâF</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201011111/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The lack of substantial centrosomal localization by CK1Îµ reported in this paper differs from an earlier finding in which both CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ were identified at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milne et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, in that article the kinase domain was alleged to be required for the centrosomal distribution. We believe our divergent results are attributable to differences in technique: the former study relied on conventional immunofluorescent microscopy rather than confocal microscopy and therefore may not have had sufficient resolution to draw definitive conclusions about the centrosomal distribution. Subsequently, the same investigators demonstrated that CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ associated with AKAP450 via the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sillibourne et al., 2002</xref>). Although AKAP450 localizes to the centrosome, it also is found at other sites such as the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>), where CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ have been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milne et al., 2001</xref>). A recent report about CDK5RAP2 showed that it also localizes to the centrosome and Golgi, and that binding to AKAP450 was responsible for its Golgi but not centrosomal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). We suggest that AKAP450 binding to CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ may contribute to their Golgi distribution, whereas other binding partners are necessary for the centrosomal localization of CK1Î´.</p>
      <p>The centrosomal distribution of CK1Î´ has potential significance that goes beyond neurite outgrowth. Detection of CK1Î´ at the mitotic spindle and induction of cytokinesis defects, mitotic arrest, centrosomal amplification, and the formation of multipolar spindle structures by IC261 suggest a broader role for CK1Î´ in centrosomal structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrend et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">StÃ¶ter et al., 2005</xref>). Although a functional connection between CK1Î´ and Dvl has not been established in this context, a recent article demonstrated the presence of Dvl-2 at the mitotic spindle and a role in cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>). Dvl also contributes to the formation of motile cilia by facilitating the docking and planar polarization of the centrosomally derived basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, other Wnt pathway components, Axin2/conductin and Î²-catenin, have been identified at the centrosome and participate in centrosomal separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahmanyar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hadjihannas et al., 2010</xref>), a process that is disrupted by IC261 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">StÃ¶ter et al., 2005</xref>). Future investigation will address the potential activity of CK1Î´ in such centrosomal processes. In this paper, we established a key role for CK1Î´ in Wnt-3aâdependent neurite outgrowth that underscores the importance of its localization at the centrosome.</p>

        <p>Cotransfection of pcDNA3.3 6x myc-mCK1Î´, 6x myc-mCK1Îµ, or 6x myc mCK1Îµ/Î´CT (278â364) constructs and siRNA targeting hCK1Î´ 3â²UTR sequence were performed with Amaxa system or GenMute (SignaGen). For Amaxa transfection, 10<sup>6</sup> cells were resuspended with 2 Âµg DNA and 200 pmol of siRNA, and placed in 6-well and 24-well plates. 72 h later, cells in 6-well plate were harvested for Western blotting, and cells placed in 24-well plates were treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant Wnt-3a for 3 h and fixed with formaldehyde to analyze neurite outgrowth. For GenMute, TC-32 cells were plated on the day before transfection on 6-well and 24-well plates. Cells were 50â60% confluent on the day of transfection. 0.5 Âµg DNA and 5 pmol of siRNA were used for 6-well plate, 0.25 Âµg DNA and 2.5 pmol siRNA were used for 24-well plate. 48 h later, cells in 6-well plates were harvested for immunoblotting, cells in 24-well plates were treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant Wnt-3a for 3 h, and fixed with formaldehyde to analyze neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <title>Lentiviral expression</title>
        <p>Lentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. 2 d after transfection, the cell culture medium was harvested and concentrated â¼10-fold with Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore) and stored at â80Â°C. On the day before transfection, HeLa cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density that reached 80â90% confluency the next day. On the day of transfection, 0.2 ml of concentrated lentiviral particle was added to each well filled with 1 ml of complete growth medium and 8 Âµg/ml of polybrene (Millipore). 24 h later the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium without polybrene. After another 24 h geneticin was added to cell culture medium (400 Âµg/ml) to obtain stable transfectants. Fresh complete medium supplemented with geneticin was provided every 2 d. 1 wk later cells were subjected to Western blotting to verify recombinant protein expression.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescent analysis</title>
        <p>TC-32 or HeLa cells were seeded on 12-mm-diam glass coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in complete growth medium. For TC-32 cells, collagen-coated coverslips were used. Depending on the combination of antibodies and reagents, different fixatives were used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201011111/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). For methanol (MeOH) fixation, cells were first washed once with PBS, then with PHEM (60 mM Na-Pipes, 25 mM Na-Hepes, 10 mM Na-EGTA, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 6.9), followed by treatment with PHEM containing 0.19 M NaCl, 1% Saponin, 10 ÂµM Taxol, and 0.1% DMSO for 5 min at room temperature (RT) to extract and stabilize tubulin. Extracted cultures were immersed in MeOH at â30Â°C for 10 min, rehydrated by rinsing in PBS three times, and treated with blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS) for 30 min at 37Â°C. Primary antibody/antibodies was/were added with 2.5% BSA in PBS, and cell samples were incubated for 60 min at 37Â°C or overnight at 4Â°C. After washing three times with PBS, cell samples were incubated with the secondary antibody reagent(s) and DAPI with 2.5% BSA in PBS for 45 min at RT. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides (VWR Scientific) using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Formaldehyde fixation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo et al., 2008</xref>). In brief, cells were fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at RT and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT, primary antibody/antibodies was/were added with 2.5% BSA in PBS, and cell samples were incubated for 60 min at 37Â°C or overnight at 4Â°C, followed by the same procedure used for the MeOH fixation method described above.</p>

        <title>Cell imaging</title>
        <p>Fluorescent images were collected with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (510 LSCM; Carl Zeiss, Inc.), using a 63x objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Zeiss LSM Image Browser version 4.0.0.157 was used for image processing, and composite figures were prepared with Adobe Photoshop CS2 v9.0.2 (Adobe Systems, Inc.).</p>

        <title>Quantitative colocalization analysis</title>
        <p>To further examine the colocalization of Myc-tagged CK1Î´ and CK1Îµ with pericentrin at the centrosome in TC-32 cells, Pearsonâs correlation coefficient was calculated with Imaris x64 (v7.0.0) image visualization software (Bitplane, Inc.).</p>

        <title>Quantitative analysis of neurite outgrowth</title>
        <p>Stimulation of neurite outgrowth was monitored as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

        <title>Immunoblotting</title>
        <p>To detect CK1Î´, CK1Îµ, and Dvl, 80â90% confluent monolayers of TC-32 cells that had been seeded in 6- or 12-well cell culture plates were serum starved overnight. For immunoblot analysis to verify siRNA knockdown of endogenous proteins, TC-32 cells transfected with siRNA were seeded in 6- or 12-well cell culture plates and harvested 48 h after transfection. After incubation for the indicated time, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, lysed with buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 Âµg/ml aprotinin, 10 Âµg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Endo et al., 2008</xref>). In brief, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined with Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For all immunoblotting, 30 Âµg of protein was loaded per lane in 10% or 4â20% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), which was blocked with 5% milk, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4Â°C, and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidaseâlabeled secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized with SuperSignal Femto Chemiluminescent reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and BioMax film (Kodak).</p>
