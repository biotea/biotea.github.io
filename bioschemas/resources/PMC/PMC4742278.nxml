        <p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) plays an important role in driving immortalization of EBV-infected B cells through regulating the expression of many viral and cellular genes. We report a structural study of the tumor suppressor BS69/ZMYND11 C-terminal region, comprised of tandem coiled-coil-MYND domains (BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>), in complex with an EBNA2 peptide containing a PXLXP motif. The coiled-coil domain of BS69 self-associates to bring two separate MYND domains in close proximity, thereby enhancing the BS69 MYND-EBNA2 interaction. ITC analysis of BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> with a C-terminal fragment of EBNA2 further suggests that the BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> homodimer synergistically binds to the two EBNA2 PXLXP motifs that are respectively located in the conserved regions CR7 and CR8. Furthermore, we showed that EBNA2 interacts with BS69 and down-regulates its expression at both mRNA and protein levels in EBV-infected B cells. Ectopic BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> is recruited to viral target promoters through interactions with EBNA2, inhibits EBNA2-mediated transcription activation, and impairs proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Substitution of critical residues in the MYND domain impairs the BS69-EBNA2 interaction and abolishes the BS69 inhibition of the EBNA2-mediated transactivation and LCL proliferation. This study identifies the BS69 C-terminal domains as an inhibitor of EBNA2, which may have important implications in development of novel therapeutic strategies against EBV infection.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Since the discovery of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 50 years ago, the etiologic links between EBV and a variety of human cancers have gained wide recognition. It is estimated that &gt;90% of the worldwide population carry this virus, which causes over 200,000 cancers across the world every year. One of the key proteins in driving immortalization of EBV-infected B cells is Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), which regulates the expression of many cellular and viral genes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the interactions between EBNA2 and cellular transcriptional regulators remains enigmatic. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the coiled-coil and MYND tandem domains of BS69/ZMYND11, a candidate tumor suppressor, in complex with an EBNA2 peptide containing a PXLXP motif. We found that the coiled-coil and MYND domains of BS69 cooperate in binding to EBNA2. We also showed that EBNA2 interacts with BS69 and down-regulates its expression at both mRNA and protein levels in EBV-associated B cells. Ectopic BS69 coiled-coil-MYND dual domain is recruited to viral target promoters through interaction with EBNA2, inhibits EBNA2-mediated transcription activation, and impairs proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Together, this study identifies the BS69 C-terminal domains as an inhibitor of EBNA2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widespread herpes virus that transforms resting B cells into permanent lymphoblastoid cell lines [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Under some circumstances, this may further lead to several malignancies, including Burkittâs lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One of the key EBV proteins that drive immortalization of B cells is Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2). It is, together with another EBV protein, EBNA-LP, the first protein to be expressed upon infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These two proteins then cooperate to promote the G0âG1 phase transition of the cell cycle [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. EBNA2 plays a critical role in controlling the expression of many viral and cellular genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For instance, it recruits a variety of cellular proteins, including histone acetyltransferases (e.g. P300) [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and basal transcription factors [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Sequence comparison of EBNA2 across serotypes of EBV, combined with mutational studies, has identified nine evolutionarily conserved regions (CR1-CR9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) that define the functional domains of EBNA2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Most notably, CR8 (residues 437â477) is the transactivation domain (TAD) [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which interacts with both acetyltransferases and EBNA-LP to mediate transcriptional activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; CR5 and CR6 mediate indirect contact of EBNA2 with DNA [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, several other domains, including CR7, are important for EBNA2-LP coactivation [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>

      <p>BS69 (ZMYND11) is an emerging tumor suppressor [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] that was originally identified as the Adenovirus protein E1A and EBNA2-interacting protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been shown that low expression of BS69 correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, whereas its overexpression suppresses cancer cell growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. BS69 contains, in addition to a C-terminal MYND (MYeloid translocation protein 8, Nervy and DEAF-1) domain, an N-terminal Plant Homo Domain (PHD) zinc finger, a Bromo domain and a PWWP domain. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tandem Bromo-PWWP domains of BS69 specifically recognize histone H3.3 trimethylated at lysine 36 (H3.3K36me3), thereby linking BS69 to transcriptional elongation, tumor suppression and pre-mRNA splicing [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The structure and function of the BS69 C-terminal region is less clear. Nevertheless, it has been reported that BS69 interacts with E1A, EBNA2 and a variety of cellular transcriptional regulators through its MYND domain [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which recognizes a common PXLXP (X denotes any amino acid) sequence motif present in many of these proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we identified a coiled-coil domain that precedes the MYND domain of BS69. The crystal structure of the coiled-coil domain in tandem with the MYND domain of BS69, bound to an EBNA2 peptide (residues 381â389, EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub>), reveals that BS69 forms a homodimer through the self-association of its coiled-coil domain, permitting the two MYND domains of the BS69 dimer to cooperatively bind to the EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> peptide. Through ITC assays, we also demonstrated that the BS69 homodimer binds to the two PXLXP motifs within CR7 and CR8 of EBNA2 in a synergistic manner. Interestingly, analysis of the EBV-infected B cells indicates that BS69 interacts with EBNA2 at the early stage of EBV infection, but is subsequently suppressed by EBNA2 at both mRNA and protein levels. We confirmed that the ectopically expressed BS69 coiled-coil-MYND domains can interact with EBNA2 in cells through a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. Furthermore, through <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription reporter and cell viability assays, we showed that ectopic expression of the BS69 coiled-coil-MYND domains leads to inhibition of the EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation in the EBNA2-transfected BJAB B lymphoma cell line [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and decreased viability of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). By contrast, substitution of critical residues in the MYND domain disrupts the BS69-EBNA2 interaction and abolishes the BS69 inhibition of both the EBNA2-mediated transactivation and LCL cell growth. Taken together, this study identifies the BS69 C-terminal domains as a potential inhibitor of EBNA2, thereby providing a mechanism for development of novel therapeutic strategies against EBV infection.</p>

        <title>Structural characterization of the BS69-EBNA2 interaction</title>
        <p>A previous study suggested that the interaction between BS69 and EBNA2 is mediated by the MYND domain of BS69 (residues 521â562) and the PXLXP motif from EBNA2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, sequence analysis of BS69 using the program Paircoil2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] suggests that this protein may also contain a coiled-coil domain (residues 429â520), immediately preceding its C-terminal MYND domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Therefore, we have set out to investigate the interaction of a C-terminal fragment of BS69, comprised of both the predicted coiled-coil domain and the MYND domain (BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>), with a PXLXP motif-containing peptide derived from region CR7 of EBNA2 (residues 381â389, EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The crystal structure of BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> (residues 440â562) in complex with EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> was determined at 2.4 Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). The structure of the BS69<sub>MYND</sub> domain reveals a Î²Î²Î± fold that was observed for other MYND domains [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Two zinc finger clusters, formed by a Cys<sub>4</sub> motif and a Cys<sub>3</sub>His motif, respectively, are arranged in a cross brace topology. In addition, a short 3<sub>10</sub>-helical turn (Î±2) immediately follows the major Î±-helix (Î±1), participating in formation of one of the zinc clusters. Structural analysis of the BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> complex also confirmed the presence of a coiled-coil domain upstream to the MYND domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The coiled-coil domains from two BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> molecules further associate to form a homodimeric fold. Consequently, the two MYND domains within the same BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> dimer are brought in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Association of BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> with EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> is mainly mediated through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, involving a surface area formed by the Î±1-helix and Î²1-strand of BS69<sub>CC</sub>-<sub>MYND</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Notably, the side chain of BS69 Q546 forms direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of EBNA2 P383 and L385, respectively; and BS69 M531 and H533 form direct and water-mediated backbone hydrogen bonds with EBNA2 V388 and S386, respectively. The three conserved residues in the PXLXP motif of EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub>: P383, L385 and P387, all make contacts with BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> (residues Y532, C534, Y540, Q546, W550, C558 and R560) through van der Waals contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Additional intermolecular contacts involve the residues flanking the PXLXP motif: EBNA2 M382 makes contacts with BS69 Q546, Q547 and W550, and EBNA2 V388 is in close proximity with W536 from a second MYND domain within the same BS69 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The engagement of W536 from the neighboring MYND domain in the BS69<sub>MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> interaction implies that the BS69 coiled-coil domain plays a role in enhancing the interaction between the BS69<sub>MYND</sub> domain and EBNA2.</p>

        <title>ITC analysis of the BS69-EBNA2 interaction</title>
        <p>To test our structural observation, we performed mutational studies of BS69 and Isothermal Calorimetry Titration (ITC) assays to evaluate the BS69-EBNA2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We observed that BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> and BS69<sub>MYND</sub> bind to the EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> peptide with a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub>) of 7.4 Î¼M and 25.6 Î¼M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), confirming that the coiled-coil domain of BS69 contributes to its binding to EBNA2. In addition, we showed that mutation of Y532 and R560 of BS69<sub>MYND</sub> each to alanine decreased the BS69<sub>MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> binding by about 3- and 10-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g002">Fig 2C and 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Even more dramatically, mutation of Q546 and W550 of BS69<sub>MYND</sub> largely abolished the interaction between BS69<sub>MYND</sub> and EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Together, these data lend a strong support for our structural observation of the BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> complex.</p>

        <p>A previous study based on GST pull-down assay suggests that the BS69<sub>MYND</sub> domain may also interact with another PXLXP motif from region CR8 of EBNA2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To gain further insight, we characterized the interactions between BS69 and an EBNA2 peptide encompassing this PXLXP motif (residues 435â445, EBNA2<sub>435â445</sub>). Our results showed that BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> and BS69<sub>MYND</sub> both bind to the EBNA2<sub>435â445</sub> peptide, with a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> of 34.9 Î¼M and 93.4 Î¼M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). To determine whether the two PXLXP motifs in EBNA2 cooperate in BS69 association, we also measured the binding affinity of BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> for an EBNA2 fragment (residues 381â445, EBNA2<sub>381â445</sub>) encompassing both PXLXP motifs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g002">Fig 2H</xref>, BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> binds to EBNA2<sub>381â445</sub> with a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> of 0.24 Î¼M and a monophasic binding curve, which is 30â150 fold stronger than the binding of BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> to either motif alone. Therefore, these data suggest that the two monomers of the BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> homodimer synergistically bind to the two sequential PXLXP motifs of EBNA2, resulting in enhanced BS69-EBNA2 recognition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). On the other hand, the Q546A mutation substantially decreases the respective binding affinities of the BS69<sub>MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>435â445</sub> and BS69<sub>CC</sub>-<sub>MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â445</sub> complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>), similar to what was observed for the BS69<sub>MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> interaction. Furthermore, a Q546A/W550A double mutation largely abolishes the binding between BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> and the EBNA2<sub>381â445</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>

        <title>Comparison of the protein interactions mediated by BS69<sub>MYND</sub> and other MYND domains</title>
        <p>In addition to BS69, the MYND domain exists in a variety of chromatin-related proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Currently, structural information on the interactions between this class of domains and their binding partners has only been limited to leukaemogenic protein AML1-ETO [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and transcriptional regulator DEAF-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An NMR structural study of the AML1-ETO MYND domain (ETO<sub>MYND</sub>) revealed that it recognizes a PPPLI sequence motif, present in nuclear co-repressors SMRT and N-CoR, through antiparallel Î²-pairing interactions [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using NMR titrations, a similar binding model was later revealed for the interactions of the DEAF-1 MYND domain with SMRT and N-CoR [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our structure-based sequence alignment of BS69<sub>MYND</sub> with these reported MYND domains, as well as its closely related RACK7 MYND domain (RACK7<sub>MYND</sub>), reveals that the overall sequence identity between these MYND domains is only around 30%, the majority of which are the cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Nevertheless, the protein interaction sites of BS69<sub>MYND</sub>, AML1-ETO MYND domain (ETO<sub>MYND</sub>) and DEAF-1 MYND domain (DEAF-1<sub>MYND</sub>) appear to be highly conserved, with each formed by the Î±1-helix and Î²1-strand of the respective proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g003">Fig 3Bâ3D</xref>). Of particular note, three strictly conserved, non-zinc binding residues (Y540, Q546 and W550 in BS69<sub>MYND</sub>) are important for mediating the protein interactions of all three proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For instance, the BS69<sub>MYND</sub> Q546 and W550 equivalent residues in ETO<sub>MYND</sub> (Q688 and W692, respectively) interact with SMRT<sub>1101â1113</sub> through hydrogen bond formation and packing against a proline residue from SMRT<sub>1101â1113</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], in a similar fashion to what is observed for BS69 Q546 and W550 in the BS69<sub>CC</sub>-<sub>MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The equivalent residues in DEAF-1<sub>MYND</sub> (Q529 and W533, respectively) also underwent large chemical shift perturbations in DEAF-1<sub>MYND</sub> when peptides from nuclear co-repressor N-CoR or SMRT are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Together, these observations demonstrate that MYND domains, despite having large sequence variation, adopt evolutionarily conserved surface sites for protein interaction. On the other hand, we also observed a number of BS69<sub>MYND</sub>-unique protein interaction sites (e.g. Y532, Q547, R560) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), which help define the surface complementarity between BS69<sub>MYND</sub> and EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub>, and provide the molecular basis for the binding specificity of the BS69<sub>MYND</sub> domain, as suggested by a previous molecular modeling analysis [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

        <title>Expression analysis of BS69 in EBV-infected B cells</title>
        <p>A previous study has indicated that EBNA2 is recruited to the BS69 promoter upon EBV infection of B cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Along this line, we ask whether EBNA2 influences the expression of BS69 in EBV-infected cells. For this, we performed quantitative real time PCR to monitor the changes of the endogenous BS69 mRNA levels in B cells with EBV infection from 0 to seven days of post-infection. Prominently, we observed that the relative mRNA level of BS69 over Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in primary B cells was significantly decreased following EBV infection, with a &gt;20-fold reduction at day 5 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Among a number of EBV-infected cell lines, a large down-regulation of the BS69 mRNA level was also observed for three independent immortalized LCLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). On the other hand, the BS69 mRNA remained expressed abundantly in the EBV latency I AKATA cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], regardless of the presence of EBV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Given the fact that EBNA2 is not expressed in EBV-infected AKATA cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we postulate that the presence of EBNA2 leads to down-regulation of the BS69 expression in the EBV-infected primary B cells and LCLs. We therefore analyzed the BS69 mRNA from EBV-negative B lymphoma cell line, BJAB, and two of BJAB derivative stable clones, BJAB-E1 and BJAB-E2, with constitutive expression of Epstein-Barr virus Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBNA2, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, the BS69 mRNA is expressed in parental BJAB and BJAB-E1, but downregulated in BJAB-E2, indicating that its expression is abrogated by the presence of EBNA2. Consistently, Western blotting analysis of the BS69 protein in EBV-infected B cells, B lymphoma or lymphoblastoid cells revealed that the protein level of BS69 became barely detectable in those B cells with EBV infection at 4 or 7 dpi and the BJAB-E2 or LCL cells, but persisted in the primary B cells, parental BJAB, BJAB-E1 and AKATA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that EBNA2 down-regulates the expression of BS69 in EBV-infected B cells.</p>

(B) Expression of endogenous BS69, EBNA2 and EBNA1 in B cells with EBV infection at 0, 1, 4, and 7 dpi, LCLs, and B lymphoma cells was analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against BS69, EBNA2 and EBNA1, respectively. The images with short exposure (S.E.) versus long exposure (L.E.) were shown. The expression of Î²-actin was used as internal control. (L.E.) (C) Transfection-mediated Co-IP analysis was performed using BJAB cells co-transfected with the plasmids of flag-BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> wild type, Q546A, Q546A/W550A and EBNA2 (E2). The anti-flag M2 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation of flag-BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> wild type or Q546A. The slower migration of the Q546A/W550A band was due to the fact that its linker sequence bridging the flag-tag and BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> is 13-amino acid longer than that of wild type or Q546A.

        <title>BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> inhibits EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation</title>
        <p>Next, we ask whether the BS69 C-terminal domains, when expressed, influence the EBNA2-mediated transcriptional regulation. Toward this, we performed luciferase reporter assays on the EBNA2 target promoters, including LMP1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and BamHI C promoter (Cp) [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the absence of BS69, the EBNA2 protein activated a co-transfected LMP1-luciferase (LMP1-Luc) or Cp-luciferase (Cp-Luc) reporter genes both by around 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), confirming the strong transcriptional activation potential of EBNA2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The presence of wild-type BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> reduced the relative transcriptional activation to 2-fold or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting that BS69 down-regulates the EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation. On the other hand, the presence of BS69 failed to suppress the EBNA1-mediated transcriptional activation of OriP (origin of replication)-Luc reporter, suggesting that BS69 specifically inhibits EBNA2. The BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> Q546A mutation partially reduced its inhibition of the EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), presumably due to the residual binding affinity of this mutant toward EBNA2. By contrast, the BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> Q546A/W550A double mutation lost the inhibitory effect on EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation. To further delineate the functional consequence of the BS69 Q546A mutation, we next transfected various amounts of wild-type or Q546A BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> vector into HeLa cells and tested the effects on activation by a co-transfected C-terminal fragment of EBNA2 (residues 375â465, containing both CR7 and CR8) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-EBNA2) using the G5-TK-luciferase (G5-TK-Luc) as a reporter gene [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our choice of the EBNA2 (375â465) construct was based on a previous study [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showing that this fragment exhibits a stronger transcriptional activation potential than the full-length protein. Indeed, we observed that the GAL4-EBNA2 fusion protein activated the G5-TK-Luc reporter gene by over 100-fold in the absence of BS69 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). However, in the presence of wild-type BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> the transcriptional activation was reduced to less than 4-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), supporting the inhibitory role of BS69 in the EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation. By contrast, a 60-fold activation by Gal4-EBNA2 was observed in the presence of the Q546A mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), and this mutant remained less repressive than wild type even at 5-fold excess (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). To decipher the importance of the PXLXP motifs in BS69 inhibition of EBNA2 dependent transcription, we next introduced the EBNA2 PXLXP mutations, in which the proline residues within either of the two PXLXP motifs were replaced by alanine residues. Although mutations on either PXLXP motif did not affect the expression levels and transactivation function of EBNA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), mutations on the second PXLXP motif relieved ~50% of the BS69 inhibitory effect, while mutations on the first PXLXP motif had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005414.s003">S3BâS3D Fig</xref>). These observations suggest that the BS69-EBNA2 interaction is required for BS69 inhibition of EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activation.</p>

PE2 (EBNA2) ChIP was used to assay EBNA2 enrichment at transfected LMP1 DNA. IgG was used as negative control. The amount of ChIPed DNA was quantified by real time PCR.

        <p>To determine whether BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> is able to associate with EBNA2 target promoters through protein-protein interactions, we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using BJAB cells, in which flag-tagged wild-type, Q546A, or Q546A/Q550A BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> was co-transfected with or without EBNA2 expression vector and a reporter plasmid containing the LMP1 promoter, LMP1-Luc. In the absence of EBNA2, the amount of LMP1-DNA brought down by wild-type, Q546A or Q546A/Q550A BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> ChIP is similar to that of IgG negative control (7â8% over input DNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), indicating no appreciable BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>-LMP1 DNA binding. On the other hand, an EBNA2 ChIP brought down ~13% of LMP1-DNA, consistent with the fact that LMP1 is one of the target sites of EBNA2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notably, the presence of EBNA2 also increases the amount of wild-type and Q546A BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> ChIPed LMP1-DNA to ~17% and ~12%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), indicating that BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> binding to LMP1-DNA is EBNA2 dependent.

        <title>BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> blocks EBNA2-mediated LCL proliferation</title>
        <p>It has been established that EBNA2 is essential for EBV-mediated B cell immortalization [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To determine whether introduction of the BS69-EBNA2 interaction could affect the proliferative activity of LCL, we generated an inducible retroviral vector harboring a destabilization domain (DD) N-terminally fused to wild type or Q546A flag-tagged BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>. The expression of the DD-BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> fusion protein, wild-type or Q536A, can therefore be regulated by the ligand Shield 1, which binds to DD to keep the fusion protein from degradation [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Cell viability assays were performed on two independent LCLs transduced with the retrovirus vector encoding DD-BS69, wild-type, Q546A or Q546A/W550A, DD-GFP fusion protein or GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We observed that the Shield 1-induction led to a complete loss in viability of both LCLs transduced with the DD-BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> wild-type vector. The Q546A single mutation partially impaired the cell viability. By contrast, no appreciable change in viability occurred for the LCLs transduced with the DD-Q546A/W550A, DD-GFP or GFP vectors. On the other hand, the viability of the EBV-negative BJAB cells transduced with any of these vectors was not affected by Shield 1 induction, suggesting that the BS69 inhibition of cell viability is EBNA2-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), either through direct inhibition of EBNA2 function or interference with its downstream signaling events (e.g. LMP1 signaling).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>-EBNA2<sub>381â389</sub> complex, which provides important insights into how BS69 recognizes the common PXLXP motif, present in EBNA2, E1A and a variety of cellular transcriptional regulators. Importantly, dimerization of the BS69 coiled-coil domain results in an enhanced and synergistic interaction between BS69 and the two sequentially proximate EBNA2 PXLXP motifs, located in CR7 and CR8, respectively. Note that both CR7 and CR8 of EBNA2 play a role in its oncogenic function: CR7 is important for coactivation of EBNA2 by EBNALP protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while CR8, the transcriptional activation domain of EBNA2, mediates gene transcriptional activation through its recruitment of cellular basal transcription machinery and histone acetyltransferases [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interactions of BS69 with CR8 may affect the binding of EBNA2 with basal transcriptional machineries or histone acetyltransferases, thereby inhibiting the transactivation potential of EBNA2.</p>
      <p>This study reveals that, whereas endogenous BS69 interacts with EBNA2 in EBV-infected B cells, the expression of BS69, at both mRNA and protein levels, is gradually down-regulated by EBNA2, which may be one of the strategies used by EBV to evade host defense. Given such a situation, it is impractical to determine the functional consequence of the BS69-EBNA2 interaction in cells through knockdown of endogenous BS69. Nevertheless, we show that ectopically expressed BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> binds to EBNA2, leading to its enrichment at the EBNA2-targeted LMP1 promoter and inhibition of the EBNA2-mediated transcriptional activations. Through an inducible expression system, we further show that expression of BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> inhibits the EBNA2-mediated proliferation of LCL cells. Therefore, this study suggests that restoration of BS69 expression in EBV-infected B cells may provide a mechanism to inhibit the proliferation of EBV-infected cells, which may have important implications in development of novel therapeutic strategies against EBV infection.</p>
      <p>The coiled-coil domain of BS69 may have important biological functions other than EBNA2 binding. For instance, recent studies reveal that this region is responsible for mediating the interaction between BS69 and RNA splicing factor EFTUD2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and that aggregation of BS69 is required for LMP1-mediated JNK signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition to BS69, tandem arranged coiled-coil and MYND domains have been identified in AML1-ETO [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and DEAF-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In AML1-ETO, oligomerization of the coiled-coil (also known as NHR2) domain is required for the interactions of AML1-ETO with ETO, MTGR1, MTG16 and E protein in the transcription factor complex (AETFC) [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and essential for AML1-ETOâs ability in inducing haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and leukaemogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In DEAF-1, the coiled-coil domain stabilizes the interaction between an unstructured region of DEAF1-1 and LMO4 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this context, this study adds a new example on how the coiled-coil domain of the MYND domain-containing proteins regulates their target recognition.</p>
      <p>Genetic mutations within the BS69<sub>MYND</sub> domain have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our structural and biochemical studies therefore shed new light onto the pathological roles of the BS69 mutations in these diseases. For instance, the syndromic intellectual disability-associated mutations, Q547Î and R560W [<xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005414.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], are both located in the protein interaction sites of BS69<sub>MYND</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005414.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Therefore, these two mutations may affect neural development through impairing the interaction between BS69 and its cellular partner(s). It would be interesting to identify the affected interacting partners in future studies.</p>

        <p>The DNA sequence encoding residues 440â562 (BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub>) of mouse BS69/ZMYND11 was inserted into a modified PRSF-duet vector (Novagen), in which the BS69 fragments are separated from the preceding His6-SUMO tag by a ubiquitin-like protein (ULP1) cleavage site; and the DNA sequence encoding BS69 516â562 (BS69<sub>MYND</sub>) was inserted into a pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare), preceded by a GST tag and a PreScission protease cleavage site. Note that the amino acid sequences of both fragments are identical to the corresponding regions of human BS69. The BS69<sub>MYND</sub> mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was then transformed into BL21 (DE3) RIL cell strain for overexpression. The bacterial cells were grown at 37Â°C and induced by 0.4 mM isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the cells density reached an optical density (OD600) of 0.6. After induction, the cells continued to grow at 20Â°C for overnight. The cells were then harvested and lysed, and the His6-SUMO- or GST-tagged BS69 fusion proteins were purified through a Ni-NTA column or a Glutathione Sepharose fast flow column (GE Healthcare), followed by removal of His6-SUMO tag and GST tag by ULP1 and PreScission protease cleavages, respectively. The tag-free BS69<sub>MYND</sub> or BS69<sub>CC-MYND</sub> was finally purified through size-exclusion (Superdex 200 16/60, GE Healthcare) chromatography in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM Arginine hydrochloride, 50 mM Sodium Glutamate, 200 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT.

The EBNA2 induced activity of the LMP1-Luc reporter plasmid was shown. (B-D) The expression plasmid of EBNA2 (B), EBNA2 PXLXP1 mutant (C), or EBNA2 PXLXP2 mutant (D) was cotransfected with Flag-BS69cc<sub>-MYND</sub> WT, Q546A, or Q546A/W550A and LMP1-Luc and internal control CMV-Î² gal. The resulting activity produced by each transfectant relatively to the intrinsic activity of EBNA2, PXLXP1 mutant, or PXLXP2 mutant was shown. The expression levels for all the indicated transfected plasmids and actin were shown.</p>
