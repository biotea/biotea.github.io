      <abstract>
        <p>SHIP-2 is a phosphoinositidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PtdIns[3,4,5]P<sub>3</sub>) 5-phosphatase that contains an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH2 domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and a COOH-terminal proline-rich domain. SHIP-2 negatively regulates insulin signaling. In unstimulated cells, SHIP-2 localized in a perinuclear cytosolic distribution and at the leading edge of the cell. Endogenous and recombinant SHIP-2 localized to membrane ruffles, which were mediated by the COOH-terminal prolineârich domain. To identify proteins that bind to the SHIP-2 prolineârich domain, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed, which isolated actin-binding protein filamin C. In addition, both filamin A and B specifically interacted with SHIP-2 in this assay. SHIP-2 coimmunoprecipitated with filamin from COS-7 cells, and association between these species did not change after epidermal growth factor stimulation. SHIP-2 colocalized with filamin at Z-lines and the sarcolemma in striated muscle sections and at membrane ruffles in COS-7 cells, although the membrane ruffling response was reduced in cells overexpressing SHIP-2. SHIP-2 membrane ruffle localization was dependent on filamin binding, as SHIP-2 was expressed exclusively in the cytosol of filamin-deficient cells. Recombinant SHIP-2 regulated PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels and submembraneous actin at membrane ruffles after growth factor stimulation, dependent on SHIP-2 catalytic activity. Collectively these studies demonstrate that filamin-dependent SHIP-2 localization critically regulates phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling to the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Phosphoinositides are ubiquitous membrane components which regulate proliferation, differentiation, inhibition of apoptosis, secretion, cell movement, and the actin cytoskeleton. Receptor-regulated phosphoinositide 3 (PI-3)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> kinases phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P<sub>2</sub>) forming phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PtdIns[3,4,5]P<sub>3</sub>) that is dephosphorylated by the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-phosphatase) to PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Majerus, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 1997</xref>). Both PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> localize signaling proteins to the inner wall of the plasma membrane and allosterically regulate these target proteins. PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> binding proteins include the serine/threonine kinase, Akt, which inhibits apoptosis, and proteins such as cytohesins and centaurins that regulate ADP ribosylation factor (ARF), and thereby vesicular trafficking and the peripheral actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Corvera et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Datta et al., 1999</xref>). Ptd- Ins(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> regulates growth factorâinduced actin-dependent extension of lamellipodia, membrane ruffle formation, and cell migration.</p>
      <p>PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is metabolized by the removal of either the 5- or 3-position phosphate by specific 5- or 3-lipid phosphatases, respectively. The product of the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 3-phosphatase which hydrolyses PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, forming PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The lipid 3-phosphatase activity of PTEN is critical for its tumor suppressor function (for review see <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cantley and Neel, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>The 5-phosphatases hydrolyze the 5-position phosphate from both inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides and share the same catalytic mechanism to the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Majerus, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Whisstock et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tsujishita et al., 2001</xref>). SHIP-2 is a widely expressed 5-phosphatase which plays a significant role in negatively regulating insulin signaling (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ishihara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al., 2001</xref>). SHIP-2 contains an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH2 domain, a central 5-phosphatase domain, and a COOH-terminal prolineârich domain and bears significant sequence identity with the 5-phosphatase, SHIP-1, except in the proline-rich domain. SHIP-2 hydrolyses the 5-position phosphate from PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and in some, but not all, studies has been shown to hydrolyze the soluble inositol phosphate Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pesesse et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wisniewski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast to SHIP-1, which has a restricted hematopoietic expression, SHIP-2 is widely expressed. SHIP-2 undergoes cytokine-, growth factorâ, and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in a number of cell lines (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Habib et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wisniewski et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, SHIP-2 is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with Shc in chronic myeloid leukemic progenitor cells, suggesting a role for SHIP-2 in 210<sup>bcr/abl</sup>-mediated myeloid expansion (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wisniewski et al., 1999</xref>). SHIP-2, like PTEN, regulates both PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-mediated Akt activation and the induction of cell cycle arrest associated with increased stability of expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>KIPI</sup> (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated SHIP-2 negatively regulates insulin signaling. Homozygous mice lacking SHIP-2 develop severe neonatal hypoglycemia and prenatal death. Adult SHIP-2 heterozygous mutant mice demonstrate insulin sensitivity associated with increased translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin treatment (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study we examine the intracellular location of the 5-phosphatase SHIP-2 and demonstrate the enzyme is located at membrane ruffles mediated via its proline-rich domain. SHIP-2 forms a complex with the actin binding protein, filamin, and thereby regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and actin at the leading edge of the cell. This may represent a mechanism for the tight spatial regulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at specific sites after growth factor or insulin stimulation.</p>

        <title>Intracellular localization of SHIP-2 in unstimulated and EGF-stimulated cells</title>
        <p>We localized endogenous SHIP-2 in both COS-7 cells and NIH3T3 cells (unpublished data) by indirect immunofluorescence using affinity-purified antiserum raised to its unique COOH-terminal sequence. Similar results were found in both cell types. In unstimulated COS-7 cells, SHIP-2 was detected diffusely in the cytosol and concentrated at the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
A). SHIP-2 colocalized with markers of submembraneous actin, including Î²-actin (unpublished data) and phalloidin staining. After EGF stimulation, conditions under which membrane ruffles and actin are actively formed and remodeled, SHIP-2 localized initially at membrane ruffles i.e., areas at the edges of lamellipodia where the plasma membrane detaches from the support and rolls up. After 5â10 min EGF stimulation, SHIP-2 was diffusely expressed at the membrane and was detected in areas of active cytoskeletal rearrangement. However, SHIP-2 did not at any time associate with stress fibers, although the enzyme was detected at focal adhesions (unpublished data) as recently reported (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2001</xref>). Preimmune sera were nonreactive (unpublished data). Localization of recombinant SHIP-2 tagged with either green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) or hemagglutinin (HA) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C), matched that of the endogenous protein. In nonstimulated cells, GFPâSHIP-2 was expressed diffusely in the cytosol and in many cells concentrated in a perinuclear distribution. It was also present at the plasma membrane at the leading edge of the cell, colocalizing at this site with phalloidin staining. After EGF stimulation at 1 min, GFPâSHIP-2 concentrated at membrane ruffles, and by 5 min localized diffusely at the plasma membrane, colocalizing as shown in the merged images with phalloidin-staining of actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). We noted membrane ruffling was significantly reduced in many cells overexpressing SHIP-2 (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>)
. Expression of HA-tagged SHIP-2 demonstrated a similar intracellular location to GFPâSHIP-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). GFP or HA alone were detected diffusely through the cytosol and nucleus and localization did not change after EGF stimulation (unpublished data). Recombinant GFPâSHIP-2 was expressed as a 166-kD protein on SDS-PAGE, with little proteolysis detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D).</p>

        <title>Identification of peptide sequences mediating SHIP-2 localization to membrane ruffles</title>
        <p>SHIP-2 contains an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH2 domain, a central catalytic 300 amino acid 5-phosphatase domain, and an extensive COOH-terminal prolineârich domain. To investigate the structural domains mediating SHIP-2 intracellular location, specifically to membrane ruffles, a series of wild-type and mutant SHIP-2 recombinants tagged with HA were expressed in COS-7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). SHIP-2 that lacked the SH2 domain (HAâSHIP-2ÎSH2) localized to membrane ruffles similarly to wild-type SHIP-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). SHIP-2 that lacked the proline-rich domain (HAâSHIP-2ÎPRD) showed no membrane association in the resting cell and failed to demonstrate membrane ruffle localization after 1 min of EGF stimulation. However, after 5 min of stimulation, faint membraneous localization of HAâSHIP-2ÎPRD was detected, although this was much less intense than the wild-type protein, suggesting that sequences independent of the proline-rich domain may contribute to plasma membrane localization after prolonged growth factor stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). This result is consistent with recent studies which have demonstrated SHIP-2 forms a complex with the adaptor protein p130<sup>cas</sup> via the SH2 domain and localizes to membrane ruffles and focal adhesions after cell adhesion (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2001</xref>). Studies in which only the proline-rich domain was expressed (HA-PRD) demonstrated this domain localized to the leading edge of the cell in resting cells, as shown for the wild-type enzyme, and concentrated at membrane ruffles and submembraneous actinârich structures immediately after EGF stimulation. After 5-min stimulation, however, expression at the membrane was less intense than the wild-type enzyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Wild-type and mutant HAâSHIP-2 proteins were expressed intact with little proteolysis and migrated at their predicted molecular mass (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the proline-rich domain mediates SHIP-2 membrane ruffle localization in the resting and in EGF-stimulated cells. In addition, sequences such as the SH2 domain may contribute to membrane localization after prolonged growth factor stimulation.</p>

        <title>Identification of SHIP-2 binding partners using yeast two-hybrid analysis</title>
        <p>The SHIP-2 COOH-terminal prolineârich domain contains numerous âPXXPâ motifs which conform to consensus sequences for SH3 binding domains, 1 WW binding domain motif (PPLP) which may bind to WW domain-containing proteins, and one EVH1 binding domain motif (E/DFPPPPXD/E) which may link the cytoskeletal network to signal transduction pathways (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fedorov et al., 1999</xref>). The SHIP-2 prolineârich domain sequence demonstrates no significant sequence homology over the extreme COOH-terminal 322 amino acids with SHIP-1. We searched for proteins that specifically interact with the proline-rich domain using yeast two-hybrid analysis. The entire SHIP-2 proline-rich domain (amino acids [aa] 936â1258) was expressed in yeast cells with a library of proteins expressed as fusions with the GAL4 transcription activation domain. Several rounds of screening a human skeletal muscle library (4 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> clones) identified a number of interacting clones in which growth on selective media suggested the presence of bona fide interactors for the proline-rich domain. Sequence analysis demonstrated that one clone, an 818 bp fragment, encoded aa 2434â2705 of the last COOH-terminal two and a half immunoglobulin repeats of the cytoskeletal actin-binding protein filamin C (FLNC), which were in frame with the GAL4 activation domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
A). Filamin is located in the cortical cytoplasm subjacent to the plasma membrane, and binds actin, promoting orthogonal branching of actin filaments and thereby cell migration and membrane stability (reviewed by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>). Filamin forms a complex with a variety of cell surface receptors including FcÎ³RI, the platelet von Willebrand factor receptor, glycoprotein Ib-IX-V, Î²<sub>1</sub> and Î²<sub>2</sub> integrin receptors, and intracellular proteins involved in various signaling cascades including Traf 2, granzyme B, caveolin-1, and the stress-activated protein kinase (reviewed by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

        <p>Three human gene filamin paralogues have been identified. Filamin A encodes Î±-filamin (also called ABP-280) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gorlin et al., 1990</xref>), filamin B codes for Î²-filamin (also called ABP-278) (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Takafuta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>), and FLNC encodes for Î³-filamin (also called ABPL or FLN2), which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, differential splicing has been demonstrated for each gene (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Maestrini et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). All three filamin isoforms demonstrate a similar structure comprising an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal actin binding domain followed by 24 immunoglobulin-like repeat domains creating an extended rod like structure. The extreme COOH-terminal repeat 24 contains a homodimerization domain which is linked to other repeats by a calpain-sensitive âhinge II regionâ (reviewed by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>). As each of the three filamin isoforms shows significant sequence identity in the COOH-terminal region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A), we investigated if each isoform interacted in cotransformation assays with the proline-rich domain expressed in frame with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (DNA-BDPRD), or with recombinant mutant SHIP-2 which lacked the proline-rich domain (DNA-BDSHIP-2ÎPRD), versus control heterologous baits. The proline-rich domain âbaitâ (DNA-BDPRD), but not the SHIP-2 âbaitâ lacking the proline-rich domain (DNA-BDSHIP-2ÎPRD), interacted with the COOH-terminal four immunoglobulin repeats of filamin A and B, and the COOH-terminal two and a half immunoglobulin repeats of FLNC, indicated by expression of all three reporter genes <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>ADE2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B) and <italic>LacZ</italic> (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Identification of FLNC sequences mediating interaction with SHIP-2</title>
        <p>To determine the region of FLNC specifically interacting with SHIP-2, a series of wild-type and mutant FLNC constructs comprising the COOH-terminal immunoglobulin repeat regions R22âR24 (aa 2434â2705), which include a âhinge II regionâ between R23 and R24, were cloned into the activation domain and cotransformed with the DNA-BDPRD bait and interactions scored as strong (+++), or weak (+) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). The fragment containing FLNC repeats 22â24 demonstrated the strongest binding to the proline-rich domain bait. FLNC repeats 23 and 24, either alone or in combination, did not interact with SHIP-2. Repeats 22 and 23 in combination, with or without the hinge II region, interacted with SHIP-2; however, this was weaker than repeats 22â24 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). All FLNC truncation mutants were expressed in the yeast strain AH109 and were soluble (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>We took several approaches to verify whether SHIP-2 interacted with filamin in vivo and thereby regulated the membrane localization of SHIP-2. First, we investigated using cotransfection and coimmunopreciptation assays if filamin interacted with SHIP-2 in COS-7 cells. We also determined association of endogenous proteins using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Second, we demonstrated colocalization of SHIP-2 and filamin at membrane ruffles in resting and EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells. Third, we showed colocalization of filamin and SHIP-2 in mouse heart and skeletal muscle sections using immunolocalization of both species. Finally, we showed the membrane localization of SHIP-2 is dependent on filamin by determining the intracellular localization of SHIP-2 in cells which do not express filamin.</p>
        <p>Association of SHIP-2 and filamin was demonstrated in COS-7 cells, which were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged SHIP-2 and HA-tagged filamin (encoding aa 2434â2705 of FLNC), followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis using antibodies to each tag. FLAGâSHIP-2 was detected in HA immunoprecipitates of HA-filaminâtransfected cells, but not cells transfected with HA empty vector (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>
A). We determined the effect of EGF stimulation on association between recombinant SHIP-2 and filamin. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with myc-filamin and FLAGâSHIP-2, and after EGF stimulation for 5 min, Triton X-100âsoluble lysates were immunoprecipitated using FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with myc antibody. The level of filamin in SHIP-2 immunoprecipitates was unchanged after 5 min EGF stimulation, compared with nonstimulated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). These studies were repeated expressing SHIP-2 and filamin as fusion proteins with different tags with similar results (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>We investigated whether the recombinant COOH-terminal filamin domain (aa 2434â2705) localized as endogenous filamin in COS-7 cells. We also determined whether this recombinant filamin COOH-terminal domain, which represents the SHIP-2 binding site, when expressed at high levels, could displace endogenous SHIP-2 localized at membrane ruffles. The myc-filamin recombinant protein may actually inhibit the localization of SHIP-2 to membrane ruffles by blocking binding to endogenous filamin. In both low and high myc-filaminâexpressing cells, the localization of the recombinant protein matched that of endogenous filamin at membrane ruffles in unstimulated (unpublished data) and more prominently in EGF-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). However, in cells expressing myc-filamin at very high levels we noted increased expression of filamin in the cytosol in addition to membrane staining.

        <title>Colocalization of filamin and SHIP-2 in heart and skeletal muscle</title>
        <p>FLNC is highly expressed in striated muscle, where it is predominantly localized in myofibrillar Z-discs, with a minor fraction of the protein showing subsarcolemma localization (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">van der Ven et al., 2000</xref>). SHIP-2 is also expressed in skeletal muscle, although its intracellular location in this tissue has not been reported. SHIP-2 homozygous null mice demonstrate increased sensitivity to insulin (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al., 2001</xref>). One of the major sites of insulin action is skeletal muscle, where insulin stimulates the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in a PI-3 kinaseâdependent manner to the sarcolemma (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2000</xref>). We investigated whether SHIP-2 and filamin colocalized in striated muscle. Mouse heart striated muscle sections were isolated, fixed, and probed with specific affinity purified SHIP-2 antibodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>
A). Soleus muscle showed similar localization (unpublished data). In longitudinal sections SHIP-2 antibodies stained intensively in an alternate banding pattern at areas that resembled Z-lines. No staining of any structure was observed using preimmune serum (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). Counter-staining sections using antibodies to filamin and the Z-lineâspecific protein Î±-actinin demonstrated both colocalized with SHIP-2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, CâH). Cross-sectional analysis of skeletal muscle demonstrated both filamin and SHIP-2 localized to the sarcolemma, the site of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, IâL).</p>

        <p>To investigate if SHIP-2 membrane ruffle localization was dependent on an interaction with filamin, we examined the intracellular localization of SHIP-2 in a cell line (M2) derived from a human malignant melanoma that does not express detectable filamin messenger RNA or protein (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 1992</xref>). M2 cells demonstrate a distinct phenotype characterized by extensive membrane blebbing and defective locomotion, which is reversed by the stable transfection of filamin A cDNA (A7 subline). Equivalent SHIP-2 expression was demonstrated in A7 and M2 cells as shown by immunoblot analysis using SHIP-2 antipeptide antibodies of 100 Î¼g of cell lysate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>)
. The intracellular localization of SHIP-2 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence of endogenous enzyme using SHIP-2 antipeptide antibodies, or cells transfected with HA-tagged SHIP-2 with detection by staining with antibodies to the tag (unpublished data) with the same result. In nonstimulated M2 cells, SHIP-2 was expressed diffusely in the cytosol and did not colocalize with markers of submembraneous actin such as phalloidin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). Upon EGF stimulation, M2 cells transiently form membrane ruffles, or membrane âblebs,â which can be detected by phalloidin staining (for review see <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>). SHIP-2 remained in the cytosol in stimulated cells and did not colocalize with filamin at membrane ruffles. In contrast, in A7 cells, which have been stably transfected with filamin, SHIP-2 localized to membrane ruffles upon EGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B) and colocalized with phalloidin staining.

        <title>SHIP-2 regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and Î²-actin at membrane ruffles</title>
        <p>To establish that recombinant SHIP-2 localized at membrane ruffles was active and to determine the functional consequences on PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels, we employed the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ARNO, which has high affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to assess local plasma membrane concentrations of this phosphoinositide (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balla et al., 2000</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that GFP-tagged PH domains with specificity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> can be used to accurately detect PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at the leading edge of the cell (for review see <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rickert et al., 2000</xref>). Although it has been established that SHIP-2 regulates total cellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels, the membrane ruffle localized regulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> has not been reported (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pesesse et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, the functional role of SHIP-2 membrane location in regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> degradation has not been determined. GFP-fused with the PH domain of ARNO (GFP-PH/ARNO) was coexpressed with either empty vector (HA), or HAâSHIP-2, or the proline-rich domain (HA-PRD), or mutant SHIP-2 which lacked the proline-rich domain (HAâSHIP-2ÎPRD) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>)
. In addition, we determined the effect of overexpressing the COOH-terminal filamin fragment (aa 2434â2705) which binds SHIP-2 in COS-7 cells on PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels, as we have shown overexpression of recombinant myc-filamin displaces endogenous SHIP-2 from membrane ruffles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). In nonstimulated cells transfected with HA empty vector and GFP-PH/ARNO, plasma membrane staining of GFP-PH/ARNO was not detected. Upon EGF activation GFP-PH/ARNO translocated rapidly to membrane ruffles after 1 min of stimulation and by 5 min intense plasma membrane staining was detected (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast, cells overexpressing SHIP-2 demonstrated no or low expression of GFP-PH/ARNO at the plasma membrane of EGF-stimulated cells. However, cells expressing the SHIP-2 proline-rich domain (HA-PRD), which lacks the SH2 and catalytic domain, demonstrated strong plasma membrane expression of GFP-PH/ARNO, comparable to HA empty vector expressing cells after EGF stimulation. In cells expressing SHIP-2, which lacks the proline-rich domain (HA-SHIP-2ÎPRD) but contains the SH2 and 5-phosphatase catalytic domain, GFP-PH/ARNO demonstrated growth factorâdependent relocalization to the plasma membrane. However, staining was less intense at 5 min compared with empty vectorâexpressing cells, but was greater than intact SHIP-2 expressing cells. To confirm these observations, transfected cells were scored as showing high or low GFP-PH/ARNO plasma membrane expression after 5 min of EGF stimulation. Over 40 cells were scored per transfection for three independent experiments by an independent observer. The expression of GFP-PH/ARNO at the plasma membrane was low or not detected in &gt;90% of cells overexpressing SHIP-2, with &lt;10% of cells showing high plasma membrane expression of GFP-PH/ARNO. In contrast, 35% of cells in which mutant SHIP-2 lacking the proline-rich domain was overexpressed demonstrated high plasma membrane expression of GFP/ARNO, with 60% of cells demonstrating low expression. In control studies, the majority of cells (&gt;85%) expressing the proline-rich domain demonstrated high expression of GFP/ARNO at the plasma membrane. Finally, the effect of overexpression of myc-filamin on PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels was determined. Cells expressing myc-filamin at high levels demonstrated a dramatic increase in GFP-PH/ARNO staining at the plasma membrane of EGF-treated cells, most apparent after 5 min stimulation. This result is consistent with the contention that expression of this COOH-terminal filamin domain displaces endogenous SHIP-2 from membrane ruffles and therefore leads to enhanced PI-3 kinase signals. Collectively, these studies indicate the SHIP-2âfilamin interaction regulates plasma membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.</p>

        <p>PI-3 kinase plays a key role in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton and inducing membrane ruffling via regulation of Rac and Cdc42 (for review see <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rickert et al., 2000</xref>). As SHIP-2 hydrolyses PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and localizes to membrane ruffles via association with filamin, we investigated the regulation of actin at membrane ruffles by this 5-phosphatase. Cells overexpressing SHIP-2 (HAâSHIP-2) or the proline-rich domain of SHIP-2 (HA-PRD), which lacks the catalytic 5-phosphatase domain but localizes to membrane ruffles and complexes with filamin, were stained for submembraneous actin by Î²-actin immunoreactivity. Î²-actin is ubiquitously expressed and localizes specifically at the leading edge of the cell at subplasma membrane cortical sites, rather than stress fibers. HAâSHIP-2 colocalized with Î²-actin in both resting and EGF-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> A). In addition, the intensity of Î²-actin staining was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing SHIP-2, compared with the SHIP-2 proline-rich domain (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> A) or vector alone (unpublished data). To quantitate these differences, cells overexpressing HAâSHIP-2 or the proline-rich domain were scored for the intensity of Î²-actin staining after EGF stimulation (5 min): 40 cells per transfection for three experiments by an independent observer. Greater than 80% of cells expressing HAâSHIP-2, compared with &lt;20% of cells overexpressing the proline-rich domain which has no 5-phosphatase activity, demonstrated low level Î²-actin staining. The minority of HA-SHIP-2âexpressing cells (&lt;20%) demonstrated intense Î²-actin staining compared with 75% of cells expressing the proline-rich domain. To further establish whether SHIP-2 regulates submembraneous actin, cells overexpressing HAâSHIP-2 or empty vector were stained with phalloidin which stains polymerized actin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> B). Cells overexpressing high levels of HAâSHIP-2 demonstrated significantly decreased staining of actin at membrane ruffles and decreased membrane ruffling. In many HAâSHIP-2 overexpressing cells, only a fine cortical rim of actin was stained by phalloidin after 5 min EGF stimulation. The intensity of phalloidin staining of actin at the membrane was scored as high or low after 5 min EGF stimulation in HAâSHIP-2 versus HA empty vector expressing cells for 40 cells per transfection for three independent experiments by an independent observer. Greater than 70% of HA-SHIP-2âexpressing cells, compared with 30% of cells expressing the HA empty vector, demonstrated low intensity phalloidin staining at membrane ruffles. In addition, only 25% of SHIP-2 versus 75% of HA empty vectorâexpressing cells demonstrated high intensity phalloidin staining at membrane ruffles. Collectively, these studies demonstrate SHIP-2 localizes to membrane ruffles via association with filamin and regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, Î²-actin, and membrane ruffling.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of this study demonstrate the 5-phosphatase SHIP-2 forms a functionally significant complex with the actin-binding protein, filamin. SHIP-2 interacts via its proline-rich domain, specifically with filamin A, B, and C isoforms in yeast two hybrid assays. Filamin and SHIP-2 colocalized to Z-lines and the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle, and in mammalian cell lines to membrane ruffles. We demonstrated by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies that SHIP-2 and filamin form a stable complex in COS-7 cells and the level of association between these species does not change after EGF stimulation. SHIP-2 membrane localization is dependent on filamin expression, as membrane association was not detected in a well-characterized melanoma cell line, which does not express filamin. The association of SHIP-2 with filamin serves to regulate PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and Î²-actin at membrane ruffles.</p>

        <title>Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases and the cytoskeleton</title>
        <p>Increasing evidence indicates that both mammalian and yeast 5-phosphatase isoforms, via hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and or PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, play a significant role in regulating cytoskeletal reorganization. The 5-phosphatases comprise 10 mammalian and 4 yeast isoforms with many spliced variants described. Null mutation of any two yeast Sac-1 domain containing 5-phosphatases results in a phenotype which includes disorganization of polymerized actin and delocalization of actin patches from the growing yeast bud to the mother cell (for review see <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>). The yeast 5-phosphatases, Inp52p and Inp53p, translocate to actin patches upon osmotic stress, the site of plasma membrane invaginations. In addition, overexpression of Inp52p and Inp53p, but not catalytically inactive Inp52p, results in a significant reduction in the repolarization time of actin patches after osmotic stress (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ooms et al., 2000</xref>). The mammalian 5-phosphatase, synaptojanin-1, hydrolyses Ptd- Ins(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> bound to the actin regulatory proteins, Î±-actinin, vinculin, gelsolin, and profilin, and decreases the number of stress fibers in the cell (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sakisaka et al., 1997</xref>). Synaptojanin-2 directly interacts with Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner, resulting in translocation of the 5-phosphatase to membrane ruffles and inhibition of endocytosis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Malecz et al., 2000</xref>). Overexpression of SKIP (skeletal muscle and kidney-enriched inositol phosphatase) results in loss of actin stress fibers in areas of SKIP expression (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ijuin et al., 2000</xref>). The recently identified proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP) localizes to membrane ruffles, but unlike SHIP-2 does not appear to regulate the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mochizuki and Takenawa, 1999</xref>). SHIP-2 regulation of submembraneous actin levels is most probably mediated via localized regulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. However, both SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 also hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, forming PtdIns(4)P (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kisseleva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

        <title>Role of SHIP-2 association with FLNC in insulin signaling</title>
        <p>The recent characterization of SHIP-2 homozygous null mice has demonstrated that this 5-phosphatase plays a significant role in regulating insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al., 2001</xref>). Although the signaling pathways mediating the phenotype of insulin hypersensitivity have yet to be fully determined, insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane appears to be enhanced in mice lacking SHIP-2. In addition, overexpression of SHIP-2, but not catalytically inactive SHIP-2, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in negative regulation of insulin-induced signaling (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wada et al., 2001</xref>). The submembraneous actin microfilament network links various signaling proteins, including IRS-1 and PI-3 kinase, that regulate GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Insulin-induced reorganization of the subplasma membrane actin filaments may allow exocytic GLUT4 vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane during stimulation by insulin (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Khayat et al., 2000</xref>). GLUT4 expression is restricted to muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle accounts for 80% of glucose uptake postprandial (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Khayat et al., 2000</xref>), localizing GLUT4 to the sarcolemma. Filamin may provide a scaffold for the juxtaposition of SHIP-2 to the sarcolemma, localizing the enzyme to PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> after insulin treatment and thereby regulating GLUT4 translocation.</p>
        <p>Filamin forms a scaffold for the binding of Rho GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42, Rho A, and RalA, and their activators such as Trio, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 1999</xref>). The localization of both Rho GTPases and their activators on filamin may allow spatial coordination of actin nucleation at sites where newly assembled actin filaments are cross-linked. It is noteworthy that many filamin-binding proteins, including Trio and SHIP-2, bind to the extreme COOH-terminal repeats 21â24 of filamin, by a variety of interacting modules, including proline-rich domains, as is the case for SHIP-2 and PH domains as shown for Trio. This would therefore provide close proximity between all these signaling proteins, including SHIP-2, that regulate actin polymerization on a filamin scaffold.</p>
        <p>Several recent studies in fibroblasts and the neutrophil cell line HL60 have demonstrated using the PH domain of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-binding proteins fused to GFP, that PI-3 kinase signals are generated at the leading edge of the cell (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blomberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Watton and Downward, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balla et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Servant et al., 2000</xref>). These PH domains function as an accurate probe for the localized agonist-dependent accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. It has been proposed, but not previously shown, that this asymmetric distribution of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> may result from its localized synthesis or degradation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rickert et al., 2000</xref>). The results of the study reported here are consistent with this contention. We have shown the spatially controlled synthesis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at membrane ruffles is regulated by the Ptd- Ins(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 5-phosphatase SHIP-2, which also localizes to membrane ruffles.</p>
        <p>We have demonstrated SHIP-2 localization to membrane ruffles is mediated by its COOH-terminal proline-rich domain binding to the actin binding protein filamin. The expression of SHIP-2 in filamin deficient cells is exclusively cytosolic. In addition, SHIP-2 membrane localization appears to contribute to localized PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> hydrolysis. SHIP-2 COOH-terminal truncation mutants were not as efficient at regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at membrane ruffles as intact SHIP-2. Furthermore, displacement of endogenous SHIP-2 by overexpression of the SHIP-2 filamin binding domain (myc filamin aa 2434â2705) lead to the marked enhancement of the PI-3 kinase signal PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. Several recent reports have shown the membrane localization of the highly related SHIP-2 homologue SHIP-1 is also important for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> hydrolysis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Phee et al., 2000</xref>). Enforced plasma membrane localization of SHIP-1, mediated by overexpression of a human CD8âSHIP-1 chimera, decreased the total cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3.</sub> Membrane targeting of SHIP-1 mediated by the COOH-terminal proline-rich domain appears to be important in B cell inhibitory function (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aman et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, the SHIP-1 COOH terminus is essential for PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> hydrolysis and inhibition of mast cell degranulation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Damen et al., 2001</xref>). Collectively, these studies show membrane targeting of these two 5-phosphatases mediated by their respective COOH-terminal proline-rich domains plays an important functional role in regulating PI-3 kinase signals.</p>
        <p>SHIP-2 associates with the p130<sup>Cas</sup> adaptor protein at focal adhesions and regulates cell spreading, which is dependent on the SHIP-2 SH2 domain and is enhanced by tyrosine phosphorylation and cell adhesion (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2001</xref>). We have shown SHIP-2 and filamin also form a functionally significant complex both in the resting cells and after cellular activation at membrane ruffles. We therefore propose the binding of SHIP-2 to filamin provides a mechanism for exquisite localized hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in resting, growth factorâ and insulinâstimulated cells at the leading edge of cell.</p>

        <title>Localization of SHIP-2 and filamin in murine heart and soleus muscle</title>
        <p>Mice were killed humanely following National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, Monash University animal ethics number BAM/B/2000/17. Murine heart and soleus were dissected from 12-wk-old male mice, C57B/6. Organs were snap frozen in isopentane chilled with liquid nitrogen and blocked in OCT (10.24% wt/wt polyvinyl alcohol, 4.26% wt/wt polyethylene glycol, and 85.5% wt/wt nonreactive ingredients) compound and stored at â70Â°C until used. Blocks were equilibrated to â20Â°C before sectioning. Cross-sections and longitudinal sections were cut 7-Î¼m thick and placed on superfrost plus slides before staining. They were then fixed in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, then blocked and permeablized with PBS, 10% horse serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Slides were washed and stained with antiâSHIP-2NC sera, and detected with FITC antiârabbit IgG. Antifilamin was detected with TRITC antiâgoat IgG and antiâÎ±-actinin was detected with TRITC antiârabbit IgG; overnight incubation at 4Â°C. Sections were washed with PBS, mounted using SlowFade, and visualized by confocal microscopy.</p>
