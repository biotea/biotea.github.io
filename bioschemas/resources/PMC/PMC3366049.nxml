        <p id="P1">Cdt1, a protein critical for replication origin licensing in G1 phase is degraded during S phase but re-accumulates in G2 phase. We now demonstrate that human Cdt1 has a separable essential mitotic function. Cdt1 localizes to kinetochores during mitosis through interaction with the Hec1 component of the Ndc80 complex. G2-specific depletion of Cdt1 arrests cells in late prometaphase due to abnormally unstable kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments and Mad1-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint activity. Cdt1 binds a unique loop extending from the rod domain of Hec1 that we show is also required for kMT attachment. Mutation of the loop domain prevents Cdt1 kinetochore localization and arrests cells in prometaphase. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy indicates that Cdt1 binding to the Hec1 loop domain promotes a microtubule-dependent conformational change in the Ndc80 complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results support the conclusion that Cdt1 binding to Hec1 is essential for an extended Ndc80 configuration and stable kinetochore microtubule attachment.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">The cell division cycle is the process of complete and precise duplication of the entire genome in S phase followed by accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. The formation and stability of kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments during mitosis depends on the Ndc80 complex, Ndc80 (hsHec1), Nuf2, Spc24 and Spc25<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Hec1/Nuf2 and Spc24/25 form dimers respectively that are tethered together at the C-termini of Hec1/Nuf2 and the N-termini of Spc24/Spc25 by long alpha helical coiled-coil rod domains. In the middle of the rod domain is a âhingeâ site produced by a ~40 amino acid loop in Hec1 that is thought to play a key role in MT binding dynamics and attachment<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Binding partners for the loop region of yeast Hec1/Ndc80 proteins have been identified<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, but the partners and function of the unique Hec1 loop domain at metazoan kinetochores remains unknown. In this study, we identify the Cdt1 protein as an essential partner for Ndc80 dynamic function through interaction with the Hec1 loop domain.</p>
    <p id="P3">Cdt1 is required for DNA replication origin licensing, the initial step in genome duplication, which occurs in G1 phase<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Proteins involved in origin licensing are not strictly DNA replication factors however; some licensing proteins have functions in transcription<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, the DNA damage response<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, centrosome duplication<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and mitosis<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We report here the previously undiscovered mitotic role for the Cdt1 replication licensing protein that is distinct from its role in DNA replication.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of Cdt1 function induces mitotic arrest</title>
        <p id="P4">Both Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins are required for replication licensing in human cells, but we found an intriguing difference in the phenotypes of Cdc6-depleted cells compared to Cdt1-depleted cells. Cdc6-depleted cells arrest primarily in G1 as expected<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, but Cdt1-depleted cells arrested in both G1 and G2/M, despite the fact that both proteins cooperate in the same DNA replication step, MCM loading (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The accumulation of G2 cells suggested a possible unique mitotic role for Cdt1 which we set out to test.</p>
        <p id="P5">To eliminate the possibility that a mitotic phenotype simply reflected replication errors in the preceding S phase, we took advantage of the fact that Cdt1 is actively degraded during S phase after its G1 origin licensing role is complete<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). We synchronized cells in early S phase, at which time origins are fully licensed, and released them into medium containing control siRNA <italic>or cdt1</italic> siRNA. As expected, control cells had very low amounts of Cdt1 in S phase, and Cdt1 re-accumulated in G2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, lanes 1â5). Synchronized cells treated with <italic>cdt1</italic> siRNA could not re-accumulate Cdt1 in G2 however (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, lanes 7â10). (Cdt1 is phosphorylated in G2 by stress MAP kinases<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>) Cdt1 depletion during S phase caused no delay in S phase progression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1a and S1b</xref>), and by 9 hours after release both control and Cdt1-depleted cells exhibited normal chromosome condensation and/or nuclear envelope breakdown (e.g. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and data not shown). This unique experimental approach allowed us to generate cells that underwent a normal G1 and S phase but lacked Cdt1 during G2 and M phase.</p>
        <p id="P6">We then tested the ability of Cdt1-depleted cells to transit mitosis to G1 after a nocodazole arrest and release (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d and 1e</xref>). Control cells completed cell division, but Cdt1-depleted cells remained arrested with G2 DNA content (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, si-control <italic>vs.</italic> si-<italic>cdt1</italic>). A cell line stably expressing normal Cdt1 with synonymous mutations in the siRNA target site was fully capable of mitotic progression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d and 1e</xref>). Unphosphorylatable Cdt1<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> also complemented the cell division phenotype of Cdt1-depleted cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1c and S1d</xref>). Cells depleted of Cdt1 during S phase did not accumulate phosphorylated H2AX by the subsequent G2, a marker of DNA damage, whereas siRNA transfection of <italic>asynchronous</italic> cultures to deplete either Cdt1 or another licensing protein, Orc6, resulted in the accumulation of phospho-H2AX-positive foci, presumably from incomplete replication and fork collapse (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">The majority of the synchronized Cdt1-depleted cells arrested just prior to metaphase with most chromosomes positioned near the spindle equator. A smaller fraction of cells arrested in prometaphase (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a and 2b</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a and S2b</xref>). In addition to Cdt1 depletion in synchronized cells, we also microinjected purified anti-Cdt1 antibody (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2c</xref>) into HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B during prophase or early prometaphase and conducted live imaging (n = 27). Anti-Cdt1 antibody induced both a severe delay in chromosome congression and an arrest near metaphase for the entire ~3 hr duration of imaging (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d and 2e</xref>). Control buffer-injected cells (n = 15) or control anti-mouse IgG-injected cells (n = 8) executed mitosis normally (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, 2e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Movies S1 and S2</xref>). Anti-Cdt1 injection during late-prometaphase or metaphase (n = 10), resulted in 70% of the cells remaining arrested in that stage for up to 8 hours. During this period, cells progressively lost chromosome alignment but did not divide (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cdt1 localizes to mitotic kinetochores through interaction with the Hec1 component of Ndc80</title>
        <p id="P8">The late prometaphase arrest of Cdt1-depleted cells prompted us to examine Cdt1 localization in mitosis. Remarkably we detected endogenous Cdt1 co-localization with a known kinetochore protein, Hec1, in prometaphase in both nocodazole-treated PTK2 and HeLa cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, and data not shown). Cdt1 depletion by siRNA treatment in S phase eliminated detectable anti-Cdt1 kinetochore staining (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a</xref>). We observed no kinetochore localization of the Cdt1 inhibitor geminin<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> at any stage of mitosis, (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3b</xref>). A second anti-Cdt1 antibody also detected endogenous Cdt1 at kinetochores in LLCPK1 cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>â<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Thus, Cdt1 localizes to kinetochores in control cells at a time coincident with the stage at which Cdt1-depleted cells arrest.</p>
        <p id="P9">In a search for Cdt1 interacting proteins by two-hybrid screening in yeast, we identified multiple independent clones containing portions of human Hec1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a</xref>); the shortest contained Hec1 amino acids 306â642 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a and S4b</xref>). To determine if Cdt1 and Hec1 interact biochemically, we incubated immobilized bacterially-expressed GST-Cdt1 with lysates of asynchronous HeLa cells. Endogenous Hec1 associated with GST-Cdt1 but not GST alone (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Nuf2 was also retrieved from cell lysates by GST-Cdt1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) suggesting that Cdt1 can associate with the Ndc80 complex, possibly through a direct interaction with Hec1 (based on interaction of the fusions in yeast). We further confirmed the interaction between Cdt1 and Hec1 by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b and 4c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">To test if Hec1 recruits Cdt1 to kinetochores in mitosis, we stained for endogenous Cdt1 in Hec1-depleted PTK2 cells. Hec1 depletion resulted in a profound loss of Cdt1 at kinetochores in nocodazole-treated prometaphase (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, bottom panel and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>) and metaphase cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4c</xref>, bottom panel) compared to controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4c</xref>, top panels). We observed no Cdt1 decrease in extracts of Hec1-depleted cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4d</xref>), and Cdt1 depletion had no effect on Hec1 expression or kinetochore localization (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4e</xref>). Other kinetochore proteins, including components of the Mis12 complex, Knl1, and the Zwint1-RZZ complex, were also localized normally in Cdt1-depleted cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8a</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">Like Cdt1, ORC is essential for replication origin licensing, and the Orc2 and Orc6 subunits in particular have also been reported to localize to centromeres or kinetochores<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. ORC is required for Cdt1 chromatin localization in G1<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, and the Orc6 subunit associates with Cdt1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5a</xref><sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>). We found that, like Cdt1, Orc6 immunofluorescence at kinetochores was also substantially reduced in Hec1-depleted cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f and 4g</xref>). Orc6 depletion had no effect on Hec1 or Cdt1 kinetochore localization however (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5d and S5e</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of Cdt1 resulted in a ~50% decrease in the intensity of Orc6 kinetochore staining (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5b and S5c</xref>). To compare the reported mitotic defects induced by Orc6 inhibition<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> to those produced by depleting Cdt1, we first calculated the mitotic indices of asynchronous cells depleted of Orc6. Orc6 is not degraded in S phase like Cdt1, so we could not employ the same synchronization strategy to remove Orc6 only before mitosis. Orc6 depletion caused a ~50% increase in the number of mitotic cells compared to controls (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5f</xref>) by producing a four-fold increase in the number of telophase cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5g</xref>). In addition, cells depleted of Orc6 exhibited normal cold-stable kMTs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5h</xref>). These observations support the conclusion<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> that Orc6 has a role late in mitosis during cytokinesis distinct from the role of Cdt1 during prometaphase or metaphase.</p>

        <title>The Hec1 loop domain is required for Cdt1 localization and anaphase onset</title>
        <p id="P12">Our two-hybrid analysis indicated that the Cdt1-binding region of Hec1 includes a short interruption in the coiled-coil pattern postulated to be a flexible âloopâ<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a and 4b</xref>).

A similar sequence provides a flexible linker in a well-studied GFP-PCNA fusion<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.

Live-imaging of cells expressing only Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP also revealed a 100% mitotic arrest phenotype (n = 29). The phenotypes of Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP cells were more severe than Cdt1-depleted cells, which could be due to quantitative differences in effectiveness of the different siRNAs in synchronized <italic>vs</italic>. asynchronous cultures, defects in spindle structure from Hec1 perturbation, or to additional functions of the loop apart from Cdt1 binding. The range of phenotypes in both circumstances was similar however (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6c and S6d</xref>) suggesting that the Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup> phenotype might be largely explained by failure to recruit Cdt1 to kinetochores.</p>

        <title>The absence of Cdt1 at kinetochores causes defective kinetochore-MT attachment and Mad1-dependent arrest</title>
        <p id="P14">These phenotypes prompted us to probe the spindle assembly checkpoint status of arrested cells. In Cdt1-depleted cells, kinetochore localization of the checkpoint protein, Mad1, was 5.2-fold higher than in control cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, top and middle panel and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). We measured a similar 4.5-fold Mad1 increase at aligned kinetochores in cells expressing Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP vs. <italic>wt</italic> Hec1-GFP (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, bottom panel and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Kinetochore localization of another checkpoint protein, BubR1, was unaltered by Cdt1 depletion (data not shown). To test if Mad1 recruitment fully accounts for the mitotic arrest produced by Cdt1 inhibition, we co-depleted Mad1 with Cdt1. As demonstrated previously<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, control cells depleted of Mad1 alone underwent premature anaphase onset (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, compare d and f). Importantly, co-depletion of Mad1 with Cdt1 bypassed the mitotic arrest of Cdt1-depleted cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, compare e and g). We thus conclude that Cdt1 depletion induces persistent Mad1-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. Of further note, synchronized cells co-depleted of both Mad1 and Cdt1did not produce many anaphase bridges relative to Mad1-depleted cells. We reasoned that unreplicated DNA segments would not be segregated properly leading to the production of anaphase chromosome bridges. The absence of increased anaphase bridges reinforces our assertion that Cdt1 is not required <italic>during</italic> S phase for complete DNA replication. On the other hand, asynchronous cells depleted of either Cdt1 or Orc6 produced many anaphase bridges (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7a and S7b</xref> and data not shown).</p>
        <p id="P15">The presence of high levels of Mad1 at kinetochores suggested that loss of Cdt1 or mutation of the Hec1 loop produces kMT (kMT) attachments that are insufficiently robust. We therefore tested the cold stability of kMTs by chilling cells at late prometaphase or metaphase before fixing them for immunofluorescence. The fluorescence of kMTs after cold treatment for Cdt1-depleted cells or Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP cells was ~50% of controls (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, top and middle panel and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7c</xref>). Quantification of kinetochores that made contact with cold-stable spindle MTs revealed a 77% decrease in the number of K-fibers in Cdt1-depleted cells and an 84% decrease in Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP cells relative to corresponding controls (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). As an additional indicator of kMT attachment, we measured the inter-kinetochore stretch (K-K) distance of aligned sister kinetochore pairs; ~1.4 Î¼m for siRNA-transfected controls and ~1.25 Î¼m for Hec1-depleted cells expressing wt Hec1-GFP. In contrast, the K-K distance was just 0.96 Î¼m in Cdt1-depleted cells and 1.05 Î¼m in cells expressing Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). These values correspond to a 50â60% loss of kinetochore stretch since the unstretched K-K centromere length is ~0.7 Î¼m in cells treated with nocodazole<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. As in Cdt1-depleted cells, there were no discernible changes in the kinetochore localization of most other proteins tested in cells expressing Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">To determine if artificially strengthening MT attachments can compensate for Cdt1 loss or mutations in the Hec1 loop domain, we blocked Aurora B kinase-mediated Hec1 phosphorylation. Pharmacological Aurora B inhibition or mutation of the 9 phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal Hec1 tail enhances MT binding affinity at this end of the Ndc80 complex<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.

We also coupled our synchronization and Cdt1 depletion protocol with expression of the Aurora B-resistant Hec1 (9A-Hec1-GFP) combined with endogenous Hec1 depletion. The result of this manipulation was identical to that of Aurora B inhibition (data not shown). To test if progression to anaphase in these experiments involved stabilization of kMT attachments, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, to prevent anaphase onset and subjected them to the cold stability assay. ZM447439-treated or 9A-Hec1-GFP-expressing cells lacking Cdt1 retained stable kMTs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7d and 7e</xref>). These results indicated that the absence of Cdt1 at kinetochores results in failure to establish and/or maintain sufficiently strong kMT attachments.</p>

We used the 9G3 antibody whose epitope in Hec1 resides next to the N-terminal CH domain, an anti-Spc24 antibody to mark the C-terminal region of the Ndc80 complex, and a Nsl1 antibody to mark the Mis12 complex, which is about 4 nm inside Spc24<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Measurements of the average separation, Delta, between 9G3 and the two other antibodies yielded values of ~41 and ~45 nm for kinetochores of aligned chromosomes in control cells at metaphase (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8c and 8d</xref>). After Cdt1 depletion, the corresponding Deltas were ~35 nm and ~37 nm respectively (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8câd</xref>), values significantly different from controls (p&lt;0.001). To determine if these reductions were a general consequence of unstable kMT attachments, we measured Delta following depletion of Rod (a component of the RZZ complex) which, like Cdt1 depletion, produces 50% reduction in kMT stability<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Unlike Cdt1 depletion, Delta values for Rod depletion (~39 nm and ~45 nm, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8câd</xref>) were not significantly different from controls (p= 0.31 and p = 0.86 respectively); Rod-depletion reduced K-K stretch from ~1.4 Î¼m to 1.15 Î¼m demonstrating the effectiveness of the siRNA. In nocodazole-treated cells which lack kMTs, the distance between the ends of the Ndc80 complex along the K-K axis is short with a Delta value of ~ 17 nm<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We measured Delta values for Cdt1-depleted and nocodazole-treated cells at 19 +/â 7 nm for Spc24-9G3 and 20 nm +/â8 nm for Nsl-9G3 (n =100 sister kinetochore pairs, &gt; 5 cells). Taken together, these results suggest that the essential mitotic function of Cdt1 is to bind to the Ndc80 complex at the Hec1 loop and maintain an extended conformation along the lattice of kMTs to stabilize end-on attachments of spindle MTs to kinetochores.</p>

        <p id="P18">Using a unique approach to deplete Cdt1 specifically after its replication function is completed, we unequivocally demonstrated an essential and previously unknown mitotic function for human Cdt1 in kMT attachment. This discovery raises the question of why such dual roles would have evolved. One possibility is to ensure orderly progression from S phase to M phase. Cdt1 is degraded while replication is ongoing to avoid re-licensing origins that have already fired <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. We recently reported a mechanism of Cdt1 stabilisation after S phase through MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. We now suggest that Cdt1 stabilisation in G2 cells evolved to facilitate its rapid re-accumulation prior to mitosis. Though yeast Cdt1 is clearly not required for anaphase<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, metazoan Cdt1 may have acquired its mitotic role as a means of reinforcing the dependence of a key mitotic event on the completion of genome duplication.

        <title>The role of the Hec1 âloopâ domain</title>
        <p id="P19">The presence of high levels of Mad1 at kinetochores of Cdt1-depleted cells or Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>âexpressing cells indicates that Cdt1 and the loop are required for attachment but not for Mad1 retention, unlike cells lacking Hec1 entirely in which both attachment and Mad1 retention are defective (<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; data not shown). The globular CH domain and N-terminal tail of Hec1 make direct contacts with MTs, and the loop domain is not required for high affinity binding of Ndc80<sup>bonsai</sup> complexes to MTs, a construct lacking the region that includes the loop<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. It was therefore somewhat surprising that mutation of the Hec1 loop domain, a site ~18 nm along the Hec1 rod domain from these direct MT contacts, had such profound negative effects on the formation of stable MT attachments. Clearly the formation of robust attachments <italic>in vivo</italic> requires not only the Hec1 CH domain and N-terminal region, but also Cdt1 interaction with the loop domain.</p>
        <p id="P20">Recent studies in yeast have shown a requirement for the loop in yeast Hec1/Ndc80 for binding MT binding proteins (MAPs), i.e. the Dam1 complex in budding yeast or Dis1/TOG in fission yeast<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.

This average distance extends to ~41 nm for control metaphase cells when kinetochores achieve a full MT complement. In the absence of Cdt1, Ndc80 does not make this full extension producing Delta measurements ~68 â 76% between the two extremes. In contrast, Rod depletion removes the major recruitment factor for the dynein-dynactin complex and disrupts other kMT-binding sites contributed by this MT motor<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.

        <p><bold>(a</bold>) Normal human fibroblasts (NHF1-htert) were transfected with siRNAs targeting <italic>cdc6</italic>, <italic>cdt1</italic>, or GFP (control) mRNAs for 72 hours. Cells were labeled with BrdU for the final hour and then analysed by flow cytometry for cell cycle position and by immunoblotting for endogenous Cdc6, Cdt1, and Tubulin. (<bold>b</bold>) Diagram of experimental design. Endogenous Cdt1 protein levels normally drop during S phase due to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and recover beginning in G2 (dotted gray line). Release from an early S block into <italic>cdt1</italic> siRNA transfection medium blocks Cdt1 protein re-accumulation (solid gray line). (<bold>c</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of endogenous Cdt1 protein in cells synchronized as diagrammed in <bold>b</bold>; M phase occurs between 9 and 10 hours post-release from the second thymidine arrest.

Cells were released from early S phase into nocodazole for 10 hr and then either harvested (0 hr) or released for 2 hours into G1 phase, and Cdt1 protein levels were analysed by immunoblotting.

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of the Ndc80 complex showing the loop region and the construction of the Hec1 loop replacement mutant,âHec1 Loop<sup>MUTâ</sup>, (adapted from Ciferri et al., 2008<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>). (<bold>b</bold>) Endogenous Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of asynchronously growing HeLa cells transfected with Hec1-GFP plasmids; âCtrl IPâ indicates the use of normal mouse serum as a control. Hec1-GFP in the bound (âCdt1 IPâ) and unbound (âSupe.â) fractions was detected with anti-GFP antibody. (<bold>c</bold>) PTK2 cells were treated with <italic>hec1</italic> siRNA followed by transfection with either <italic>wt</italic> Hec1-GFP or Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP constructs. The cells were treated with nocodazole then fixed and stained using anti-Cdt1 antibody and anti-GFP antibody. (<bold>d</bold>) As in <bold>c</bold> except that HeLa cells were stained with anti-Orc6 and anti-GFP antibodies. (<bold>e</bold>) As in <bold>c</bold> except that HeLa cells were stained with anti-tubulin antibody to mark MTs and anti-GFP antibody to mark Hec1-GFP at kinetochores. (<bold>f</bold>) Quantification of mitotic stages in Hec1-depleted cells expressing ectopic <italic>wt</italic> Hec1-GFP or Hec1 Loop<sup>MUT</sup>-GFP stained with DAPI; n = 125 GFP-expressing cells. Scale bars = 5 Î¼m.
