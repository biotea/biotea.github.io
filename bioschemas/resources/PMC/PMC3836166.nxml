Ultrastucturally, lesional epidermis showed abnormalities in intracellular vesicle biology. Immunohistochemistry showed hyperproliferation within the punctate lesions. Knockdown of p34 in keratinocytes led to increased cell division, which was linked to greatly increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. We hypothesize that p34 deficiency may impair endocytic recycling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR, leading to increased signaling and proliferation.</p>

    <p id="P2">Palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) describes a group of hereditary skin disorders characterized by thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the palm and sole epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Historically, PPKs have been classified according to the pattern of lesions (diffuse, focal, punctate, striate), as well as histopathologic changes (epidermolytic, non-epidermolytic, porokeratotic). Molecular genetics now allows for improved classification, diagnosis and personalized medicine approaches to treatment. Three distinct types of inherited punctate PPK are recognized by OMIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These are: PPKP1 (also known as the Buschke-Fischer-Brauer type, OMIM #148600), mapped to 15q22 <sup>Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>; PPKP2 (porokeratotic type, OMIM #175860), not yet mapped; and PPKP3 (also known as acrokeratoelastoidosis, OMIM #101850), where preliminary linkage suggests a possible locus on 2p25-p12 <sup>Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. An additional locus was identified at 8q24.13-8q24.21 in two Chinese families whose phenotype resembles PPKP1 clinically and histologically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Here we studied a collection of 18 kindreds with PPKP1 from Scotland, Ireland, Japan and Tunisia, 11 of which had a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In our PPKP1 case collection, there was considerable phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In all families, onset was typically during the first to second decades of life, with the appearance of small circumscribed lesions on palms and soles. These consistently increase in number with advancing age and later coalesce to form larger lesions. In some families, lesions remained subtle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a&amp;b</xref>), whereas in other kindreds, the phenotype, resembling HPV-induced papilloma-like lesions, was much more severe, painful and debilitating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c&amp;d</xref>). Histology of lesional palmar epidermis from 3 unrelated kindreds â Families 1, 11 and 15 â all showed very similar findings of a well-defined central epidermal depression associated with hypergranulosis and a prominent layer of overlying orthokeratosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining for cell proliferation marker Ki67 showed continuous staining of the basal cell (proliferative) compartment of the epidermis beneath the hyperkeratotic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>), indicative of a hyperproliferative form of hyperkeratosis rather than a retention hyperkeratosis due to defective desquamation.</p>
    <p id="P3">Microsatellite linkage to the previously reported 15q22 locus was observed in a large Tunisian kindred originating from Saudi Arabia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), with a maximum 2-point lod score of 8.18 at Î¸=0 obtained with D15S983 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The family was reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. A 6.24 Mb critical interval was defined by visible recombination with markers D15S993 (proximal) and D15S977 (distal) containing 80 RefSeq genes. This locus overlaps the previously reported intervals for PPKP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In parallel, the proband in Family 1 (of Scottish ancestry) was subjected to whole exome sequencing. Of 28,513 SNPs identified, we elected to concentrate on loss-of-function variants located within the critical interval defined by our linkage data and that previously reported. Of 106 unique âstop-gainedâ SNPs in the exome dataset, only 3 SNPs, all heterozygous in the proband, were located on chromosome 15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Two were located well outside the interval: a known SNP rs57809907 predicting p.E417X in <italic>DYX1C1</italic>; and a second previously unreported variant of unknown consequence predicting p.L439X in <italic>GABRG3</italic>. The remaining variant, c.481C&gt;T, predicting p.R161X in <italic>AAGAB</italic> fell within our linkage interval and that initially reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, but was just outside the interval reported in a Chinese kindred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This variant was absent from current dbSNP and 1000Genomes datasets. The mutation was confirmed by conventional sequencing and co-segregated with the PPKP1 phenotype in Family 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a&amp;b</xref>). By conventional sequencing, a second loss-of-function mutation, c.348_349del, was identified and found to fully co-segregate in the linked kindred and two additional Tunisian families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c&amp;d</xref>). Sequencing of the remaining 16 families revealed a total of 8 mutations in <italic>AAGAB</italic> (2 nonsense; 5 frameshift and 1 splice site mutation), as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>. <italic>AAGAB</italic>, consisting of 10 exons spanning 53,708 bp of genomic DNA, encodes alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein p34, identified from a yeast 2-hybrid screen using a subunit of the AP-1 adaptor protein complex as bait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The positions of the mutations in relation to the p34 protein organization are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P4">By quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed that p34 is expressed at broadly comparable levels in skin, HeLa cells, primary epidermal keratinocytes and the commonly used keratinocyte cell line HaCaT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). By QRT-PCR, we also showed that p34 message is very widely expressed across tissues, including skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Two independent siRNAs were developed that showed near-complete knockdown of p34 protein in HaCaT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Treatment of HaCaT cells with either of these potent siRNAs resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in cell counts over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>), thus mirroring the increased epidermal proliferation observed in lesional epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">The coating of clathrin-coated vesicles consists of clathrin and adaptor complexes, both of which have to be recruited to the appropriate membrane from the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The two most abundant types of adaptor protein complexes are AP-1, which is responsible for sorting proteins between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, and AP-2, which is responsible for sorting proteins at the plasma membrane. Both are heterotypic complexes with AP-1 containing a Î³-adaptin subunit and AP-2 containing an Î±-adaptin subunit. Although cDNAs encoding p34 were the predominant species of clone from the original yeast 2-hybrid screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, difficulties in obtaining specific antibodies meant that further biochemical confirmation of these protein-protein interactions were not presented. Here, using two independent antibodies to p34 made in-house, we confirm by immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting that this protein indeed interacts with both AP-1 and AP-2 complexes in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). Cytosolic localization was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and using both N- and C-terminal GFP-tagged p34 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>), although C-terminal tagging also led to some nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein. Cell fractionation studies showed that p34 is found in the cytosol but not in membrane or clathrin-coated vesicle fractions in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Near-complete siRNA knockdown of p34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>) did not lead to an overt change in the plasma membrane or TGN localization of AP-2 or AP-1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). Neither AP-1 nor AP-2 co-localized with N- or C-terminal GFP fusions of p34 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Essentially identical diffuse cytoplasmic localization data were obtained in the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (not shown). Overall, these data confirm that p34 is a cytosolic protein that binds to AP-1 and AP-2, however, p34 does not follow these protein complexes into their membrane-associated vesicle populations on intracellular membranes or at the plasma membrane, respectively. This is consistent with a possible chaperone role, as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For example, p34 might either prevent soluble clathrin from assembling with soluble adaptor complexes in the cytosol; p34 might be involved in vesicle uncoating; or this protein might aid recruitment of soluble adaptors to membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of a GTPase domain, which is most closely related to the Rab superfamily of vesicular trafficking proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). It is not known if this GTPase domain is functional. If so, this may be indicative of a role in active transport of cytosolic adaptor complexes rather than a more passive-acting chaperone function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">Ultrastructural analysis of lesional plantar skin revealed mild acanthosis, a reduction in the granular cell layer and compact orthokeratosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), there was a large increase in the number of small vesicles close to the cell membrane and prominent dilatation of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). These ultrastructural features are consistent with a vesicle transport defect.</p>
    <p id="P7">We hypothesized that a possible mechanism whereby perturbation of vesicle trafficking could lead to increased epidermal proliferation might involve recycling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is known to undergo a process of rapid turnover â a process that requires a number of sorting steps including clathrin- and AP-2-dependent endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Internalized ligand-bound EGFR is either shuttled to late endosomes/lysosomes for degradation or into recycling endosomes, where, following removal of the bound ligand and dephosphorylation, the receptor is returned to the plasma membrane via vesicle fusion. Knockdown of p34 in HaCaT cells led to a modest ~2.5-fold increase in EGFR mRNA levels as determined by QRT-PCR (data not shown), however, a &gt;10-fold increase in EGFR total protein expression was seen by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>), consistent with decreased EGFR turnover. Importantly, phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine-992, indicating active EGFR signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, was increased &gt;20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). The regulation of EGFR signaling via clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a complex process involving Rab proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, dynamin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, AP-2, the Grb2 adaptor protein, and multiple mechanisms relating to post-translational modification of the receptor itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Disruption of EGFR endocytosis by knockdown of the motor protein dynamin has been shown to produce decreased protein turnover with increased EGFR signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, very similar to what we observed here by knockdown of p34.</p>
    <p id="P8">Here, using a combination of genetic linkage and whole exome sequencing, we have identified a gene for the autosomal dominant form of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma previously linked to 15q22 <sup>Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, known as PPKP1 (OMIM #148600). The causative gene, <italic>AAGAB</italic>, encodes alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein p34 <sup>Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. AP-2 is known to be involved in EGFR endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and we confirm here that p34 binds cytosolic AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and show that p34 deficiency increases epidermal cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, p34 appears to play a hitherto unrecognized role in the control of cell division, possibly by contributing to normal endocytotic recycling of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Other genes involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking have been linked to inherited skin disease where hyperkeratosis and/or keratoderma form part of the phenotypic constellation. This includes <italic>SNAP29</italic> in cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma (CEDNIK syndrome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and <italic>VPS33B</italic> in arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC syndrome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, both of which encode proteins required for vesicle membrane fusion in the epidermis and other tissues. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>AP1S1</italic>, which encodes the small Ï1A subunit of the AP-1 complex, have been shown to cause the recessive neurocutaneous disorder MEDNIK (mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, defects in multiple proteins involved in melanosome transport and fusion lead to the pigmentation disorder Griscelli syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and mutations in the AP-3 subunit protein Î²3A have been linked to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2, which consists of oculocutaneous albinism and other features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, a growing number of genes involved in vesicle transport have been linked to genetic skin disease, plus or minus extra-cutaneous phenotypes.</p>
    <p id="P9">Disruption of EGFR signaling is a feature of neoplasia. There are anecdotal reports of cancer occurring in association with punctate PPK families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, however, without genetic testing we cannot say that the p34 gene was involved in those cases. Although a few cases of cancer were reported in the larger families studied here, we did not observe co-segregation with the p34 mutations and so any causal link remains unproven.</p>
    <p id="P10">It remains unclear why haploinsufficiency for this widely expressed protein leads to a phenotype limited to palm and sole epidermis, although this is not unusual in hereditary skin disease, e.g. haploinsufficiency for the desmosomal proteins desmoplakin and desmoglein-1 <sup>Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, or keratin 1 <sup>Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, all of which are structural proteins expressed throughout the epidermis, lead to striate palmoplantar keratoderma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Another unanswered question relates to why the hyperkeratotic lesions are focal. These lesions are late-onset, appearing in the first or second decades of life, and increase in number with increasing age. This might be explained by a âsecond hitâ mutation in <italic>AAGAB</italic> and so we examined this by sequencing the gene using genomic DNA derived from microdissected lesional tissue from more than one patient. This revealed neither loss-of-heterozygosity nor a second compound heterozygous p34 mutation (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry was also attempted, however, neither the in-house nor commercial p34 antibodies available gave a signal on fixed tissue. A further possibility is the occurrence of a second somatic mutation in a gene other than <italic>AAGAB</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P11">In conclusion, this study expands the molecular diagnostic repertoire for keratodermas and reveals that the AP-1 and AP-2 associated protein p34 is involved in control of epidermal cell division.</p>

Knockdown of p34 was achieved using an siGENOME SMARTpool (#M-0159891) and control knockdowns were performed with a non-targeting siRNA (#D-001810-10), both (Thermo-Fisher, Epsom, UK). Transient transfections with GFP-tagged plasmid DNA was achieved using HeLa Monster transfection reagent (Cambridge Bioscience, Cambridge, UK) following the manufacturerâs instructions and transfecting 48 h prior to imaging. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass bottom coverslips (Mat Tek, Ashland MA), fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope using a Zeiss Plan Achromat 63x oil immersion objective, a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER2 camera and Improvision Openlab software (Perkin-Elmer, Cambridge, UK).</p>

        <p id="P26">These were performed with antibodies raised in-house including p34 (p34-1, p34-2), AP-2Î±, AP-1Î³, clathrin heavy chain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Antibody P34-2 was used to detect p34 unless otherwise specified. N- and C- terminally tagged p34 were constructed from rat cDNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (note that human and rat AP-1Î³, share 99% amino acid identity) by PCR amplification and cloned in-frame into pEGFP-N3 (p34GFP) or pEGFP-C1 (GFPp34; Takara Bio Europe/Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) using <italic>Hind</italic> III and <italic>Kpn</italic> I restriction sites.

        <p id="P27">For immunoprecipitation, cells were lyzed in PBS containing 1% IGEPAL (Sigma-Aldrich), cleared of debris by centrifugation and antibody-protein complexes captured using protein-A Sepharose (Pharmacia, Milton Keynes, UK). The samples were then analyzed by PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting. Blots were probed with various antibodies followed by ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). Control CCV-enriched fractions were prepared as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, except the final pelleting step was performed at 86,900 Ã g RCFmax (40,000 rpm, TLA-110) for 30 min to improve yield.</p>

        <p id="P28">Skin biopsy specimens were cut into small pieces (of &lt;1 mm<sup>3</sup>) and fixed in half-strength Karnovsky fixative for 4 hours at room temperature. After washing in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the samples were immersed in 1.3% aqueous osmium tetroxide (TAAB Laboratories, Berkshire, UK) for 2 hours, followed by incubation in 2% uranyl acetate (Bio-Rad), and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and then embedded in epoxy resin via propylene oxide (TAAB Laboratories). Ultra-thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).</p>

        <title>Clinical and histological features of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma</title>
        <p>(a) The palms of the proband in PPKP1 Family 1 show numerous small, hard, slightly indented hyperkeratotic lesions (arrow; see inset), which typically appear around age 10 and increase in number throughout life.</p>
        <p>(b) On the soles, lesions tend to coalesce at pressure points and so the presentation can resemble a focal form of keratoderma.</p>
        <p>(c&amp;d) In some cases, the phenotype is much more severe, as seen here in the proband from Family 15.</p>
        <p>(e) This H&amp;E stained section shows a punch sample of skin incorporating a well defined central epidermal depression associated with hypergranulosis and a prominent layer of overlying orthokeratosis. Scale bar = 500 Î¼m.</p>
        <p>(f) The proliferation marker Ki67 shows an increase in the numbers of keratinocytes in cell cycle within the floor of the epidermal depression (arrowheads) compared to perilesional epidermis (arrow). Scale bar = 100 Î¼m.</p>

        <title><italic>AAGAB</italic> is expressed in skin and keratinocytes and its depletion leads to increased cell numbers over time</title>
        <p>(a) QRT-PCR showed that <italic>AAGAB</italic> mRNA is expressed in skin and is present at broadly comparable levels in HeLa cells, primary epidermal keratinocytes and the epidermal keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Conventional RT-PCR showed expression in palmoplantar epidermis comparable to abdominal skin (data not shown).</p>
        <p>(b) Western blotting shows that two independent siRNAs (designated 1239 and 2164) potently knocked down p34 expression in HaCaT cells. Non-specific control siRNA = NSC4 (inverted lacZ sequence).</p>
        <p>(c) <italic>AAGAB</italic> knockdown by either siRNA leads to an approximate 2-fold increase in HaCaT cell division at 96 hours post-transfection. Similar data were seen at early time-points (not shown). Error bars show standard deviation. Non-specific control siRNA = NSC4 (inverted lacZ sequence).</p>

        <title>p34 associates with AP-1 and AP-2 in the cytosol</title>
        <p>(a) Native immunoprecipitation (IP) of HeLa cytosolic extracts was performed with antibodies against p34 (p34-1 and p34-2), followed by Western blotting (WB) with antibodies against p34, AP-1 or AP-2. Note the association of both AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor complexes with p34.</p>
        <p>(b) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either C-terminally (p34GFP) or N-terminally (GFPp34) GFP-tagged p34 constructs. Both constructs show a mainly cytosolic localization and this is consistent with the staining pattern (albeit faint) observed using an antibody against p34 in either transfected or untransfected cells (#).</p>
        <p>(c) HeLa lysates were subjected to fractionation into cytosol, membrane, and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) fractions, and then Western blotted for clathrin heavy chain (CHC), AP-1 and p34. Note that p34 is found principally in the cytosolic fraction and is virtually undetectable in membrane or CCV fractions in which AP-1 and CHC are enriched. (* = cross reacting band)</p>
        <p>(d) HeLa cells were treated with siRNA to knock down expression of p34 (kd), and western blotted for clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and p34 (* = cross reacting band). Note the efficient knockdown of p34 (&gt;95%).</p>
        <p>(e) Localization of AP-1 and AP-2 visualized by immunofluorescence following knock down of p34 (kd). Note that the AP-2-containing membrane-associated vesicles or AP-1-trans-Golgi network appear unperturbed. Bar = 20 Î¼m.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of p34 greatly increases EGFR protein expression</title>
        <p>(a) Knockdown of p34 with siRNA 1239 leads to greatly increased EGFR protein compared to non-specific control siRNA NSC4. Part of the blot was stained for Î²-actin as a loading control and to normalize EGFR quantification. Using the LI-COR Odyssey system, the observed upregulation was found to be &gt;10-fold (data not shown). +, p34 siRNA; â, NSC4 siRNA control.</p>
        <p>(b) Knockdown of p34 with siRNA 1239 also leads to greatly increased phosphorylation of tyrosine-992 on the EGFR protein compared to non-specific control siRNA NSC4. Using the LI-COR Odyssey system, the observed increase in phosphorylation of this residue was found to be &gt;20-fold (data not shown).</p>
