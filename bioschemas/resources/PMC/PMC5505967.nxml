        <p id="Par1">Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) is a rare disorder, caused by bialellic mutations of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, sometimes associated with alopecia. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of functional disruption of a novel mutation, detected in a patient with HVDRR, comparing to other mutations with or without alopecia. The patient was a 2-year-old girl with alopecia, who was clinically diagnosed as HVDRR. Genetic analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation, S360P, located in ligand binding domain (LBD). The mutation was predicted as not disease causing by Polyphen2 and SIFT. But the transcriptional activity of S360P was disrupted as well as other reported mutations, Q152X (located in the hinge lesion), and R274L, H305Q (located in LBD). Following assays revealed no ligand binding affinity, no interaction with cofactors or RXR and no functioning of nuclear localization signals. Our results provide an additional evidence for the previous findings suggesting that DNA binding by the VDR/RXR heterodimer is essential for the function of the VDR in hair development. In conclusion, we identified a novel missense mutation of VDR causing HVDRR with alopecia. Functional analyses revealed that the single amino acid substitution could disrupt the function of the protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Hereditary 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D)-resistant rickets (HVDRR) (OMIM #277440) is a rare disorder caused by homozygous mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. It is characterized by rickets symptoms, and sometimes alopecia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Biochemical investigation of the blood shows hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and high levels of serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. Patients with HVDRR are resistant to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and 1Î±(OH)D<sub>3</sub> treatment. Elevated 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels differentiate HVDRR from 1Î±-hydroxylase deficiency, known as vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The VDR is a member of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, composed of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The VDR has other functional domains that contribute to the binding of cofactors, retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimerization, and nuclear localization signals (NLS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. When acting as a transactivator, the VDR binds to a ligand, enters the nucleus, makes a heterodimer with the RXR, binds to vitamin D response elements, and transactivates target genes, while being modulated by cofactors. If any of these steps is disrupted, HVDRR occurs. Almost 50 mutations of the <italic>VDR</italic> gene have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Some mutations cause rickets symptoms, and alopecia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Most mutations located on the DBD result in alopecia and severe rickets, whereas mutations on the LBD result in various degrees of rickets symptoms, with or without alopecia. Functional analyses of several LBD mutants associated with alopecia show an inability of the VDR to interact with the RXR, but the mechanism by which LBD mutants cause alopecia is not well understood. Comparing the functional features of mutants with and without alopecia would increase our understanding of the mechanism of hair development.</p>
      <p id="Par3">Several softwares are available for <italic>in silico</italic> studies to predict the functional impairment resulting from single amino acid substitutions. However, functional predictions with such software does not always reflect the actual effect of missense mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In such cases, only functional analyses can provide the correct information. Additionally, comparing a substitution with other mutations in several functional studies provides more information about the substitution. It is intriguing to study how one amino acid substitution located on a certain functional domain impacts the whole function of the protein. Herein, we identified a novel missense mutation located on the LBD of the VDR in a patient with severe HVDRR with alopecia. We performed several functional analyses to investigate the effects on the whole VDR protein of the single amino acid substitution on the LBD, comparing its effects with those of some other mutations reported in patients with HVDRR. We found that the novel mutation disrupted the protein function, which finding was not predicted by the <italic>in silico</italic> analyses.</p>

        <p id="Par4">We obtained informed consent of the patientâs parents for publication of identifying information and images. The patient was a 2-year-old Turkish girl admitted for total alopecia and bilateral bowlegs. Her weight was 9.2âkg (â2.1âSD) and her height 78.5âcm (â1.3âSD). She had total alopecia, frontal bossing, prominent costochondral junctions, widening of the wrists, and bowlegs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Alopecia began when she was 3 months old. Motor and mental development was normal. She was taking 400âIU of oral vitamin D daily. She was the first offspring of consanguineous parents. Laboratory examination revealed serum calcium 2.1âmmol/L (normal range, 2.1â2.5), serum phosphorus 0.77âmmol/L (normal range,0.97â1.78), alkaline phosphatase 1400âIU/L (normal range, 100â350), PTH 73.4âpmol/L (normal range, 1.3â6.4), 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D 258âpmol/L (normal range, 39â102), and 25(OH)D 80ânmol/L (normal range, 50â250). X-rays of the left hand and wrist and the lower extremities were consistent with severe rickets (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We diagnosed HVDRR clinically because of the rickets symptoms and alopecia.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical appearance of the patient and results of VDR gene analysis.

        <p id="Par5">We began treatment with calcitriol 6âÂµg/day, elementary calcium 150âmg/kg/day, and phosphate 100âmg/kg/day. After 1 year, we began cinacalcet treatment with 6âmg/kg/dose twice a day orally. While tapering and ceasing calcitriol and phosphate, we continued cinacalcet and elementary calcium. This regimen improved the rickets symptoms (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), but the alopecia remained.</p>

This result indicated that S360P and the other mutations are disease-causing mutations. This was the first functional analysis of V346M, and it indicated that V346M is also a disease-causing mutation. The activity of V346M was increased with high-dose 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), a finding consistent with the improvement of rickets by alfacalcidol in one case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>VDR functional analyses: Transcriptional activity, ligand-binding affinity, RXR interaction, cofactor interactions, and enhanced transcriptional activity.

        <title>Interaction with the RXRÎ±</title>
        <p id="Par15">Heterdimerization with the RXR is also one of the crucial roles of the VDR in binding the vitamin D response element of the target genes and activating transcription. Some mutants reportedly have impaired RXR binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, RXR heterodimerization has been suggested to be critical for the function of the VDR in hair development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Some reports have demonstrated that the VDR function in the hair follicle does not require a ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, the result of interaction with the RXRÎ± without ligand binding gives profitable information to understand each mutant with regard to occurring alopecia. In the absence of ligand, S360P, and V346M, which are associated with a phenotype with alopecia, showed no interaction with the RXRÎ±. R274L and H305Q, which are not associated with alopecia, interacted with the RXRÎ± to the same extent as did the wild type (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). With ligand adding, the interaction increases in a dose-dependent manner in the mutants that have ligand-binding affinity (V346M, R274L, and H305Q) (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). The interaction of the V346M mutant with the RXRÎ± was especially improved with the addition of a large amount of ligand (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). S360P did not interact with the RXRÎ± in the presence or in the absence of ligand (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). These results indicate that the mutants associated with alopecia (S360P and V346M) did not interact with the RXRÎ±, whereas the mutants not associated with alopecia (R274L and H305Q) did interact with the RXRÎ±. In these mammalian two hybrid assays, the reporter activities are not affected by endogenous VDR.</p>

        <title>Interaction with cofactors</title>
        <p id="Par16">Next, we performed a cofactor interaction assay by mammalian two-hybrid assay. Decreasing interactions with coactivators or increasing interactions with corepressors cause disruption of VDR function and result in HVDRR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Interaction with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) was seen with V346M and H305Q, even though it was smaller than that with the wild type, but not with S360P and R274L (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), which was consistent with the fact that ligand binding was necessary to increase interaction for coactivators. On the other hand, ligand binding reduces interaction for corepressors. Consistent with this, wild-type VDR interacts with the corepressor N-CoR without a ligand and decreases the interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). H305Q interacted even more than the wild type, V346M and R274L had less interaction, and S360P had no interaction with N-CoR, even without a ligand (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).

        <title>Intracellular localization</title>
        <p id="Par18">The VDR needs to enter the nucleus for transactivation, which is performed by nuclear localization signals (NLS). Fluorescence microscopy of GFP-VDR transfected to COS-1 cells gives information about protein translocation in cells. In this assay, we used wild-type VDR and S360P, Q152X, and V346M mutants. In addition, we used Q400LfsX7, a frameshift mutation with a dominant negative effect and no ligand-binding affinity, as we reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The results showed that the fusion protein consisting of GFP and wild-type VDR was localized mainly in the nucleus, even without ligand, and that localization was enhanced with ligand, which is consistent with results reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, whereas GFP alone was distributed over the whole cell (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We defined a nucleus lesion by merging images stained by Hoechst (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Among VDR mutants, S360P was localized very weakly in the nucleus before ligand binding, and localization was not enhanced after ligand adding (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). V346M was also less localized in the nucleus, but its localization was better than that of S360P and was enhanced with the addition of ligand (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Other mutants, as well as the wild type, were localized much more in the nucleus, but localization was not enhanced in the mutants by adding ligand, because they had no ligand-binding affinity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Quantified analysis of the images was performed by ImageJ. The mean brightness values of the nucleus and cytoplasm were measured.

Moreover, the residue is not highly conserved in other vertebrates (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Nevertheless, the clinical features of severe rickets unresponsive to high-dose vitamin D therapy, combined with alopecia, indicated a severe defect in the function of the VDR.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Functional domains of the VDR protein and homologues of the 360<sup>th</sup> residue.

</p>
      <p id="Par20">To investigate the discrepancy between the <italic>in silico</italic> studies and the clinical features, and to confirm the molecular cause of this patientâs clinical features, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the mutant. Analysis revealed the disrupted transcriptional activity of S360P, demonstrating that the mutation caused HVDRR. To further investigate the mechanism of disruption of VDR function, we performed several functional analyses, comparing the findings with those from wild-type VDR and other reported mutants. First, the ligand-binding affinity assay showed that S360P had no ligand-binding affinity. The ligand-binding pocket is bordered by helices H3, H5, H7, and H11 and loop-encompassing residues that include S275 (loop H5-Î²), W286 (Î²-1), and L233 (H3), with a lid formed by H12; residues H305 and H397 also play a role in the ligand-binding pocket<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Considering that S360P does not appear to affect ligand binding directly (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), it might have a distinctive mechanism to disrupt VDR function. Second, RXR and cofactor interactions were impaired in S360P. S360 belongs to helix 9, which has an important role in RXR binding (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This mutant lost the ability to interact with the RXR. On the other hand, S360P (H9) is not located in the region contributing to binding with cofactors (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). S360P did not interact with SRC-1, which was supposed to be because interaction with SRC-1 depends on ligand binding and S360P lacks ligand-binding affinity. Conversely, N-CoR interaction should present highest degree before ligand binding, but interaction was not seen in S360P. Because S360P retains the region responding the LXXLL motif of cofactors, these findings suggest that S360P disrupts the VDR structure more than would be expected from a single amino acid substitution.</p>
      <p id="Par21">Herein, we performed several functional analyses comparing S360 with other mutants, to understand the distinctive S360P features. This is the first functional analysis demonstrating that V346M is also a mutation causing HVDRR. The transcriptional activity of V346M was improved with high doses of ligand, and ligand-binding affinity partially remained, consistent with the clinical course described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par22">The intracellular localization study provided further information about the mutants. The S360P mutant presented a different pattern from that of the wild type and of other mutants, showing very weak localization in the nucleus, which was not enhanced in the presence of ligand. V346M also showed weak localization in the absence of ligand, but localization was improved with ligand addition. The VDR has two types of NLS. One is dependent on ligand binding and is located in the hinge region; the other is independent of ligand and is located in the DBD (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that NLS independent of ligand binding were impaired in the S360P and V346M mutants, but that NLS dependent on ligand binding works in the V346M mutant, suggesting that S360P and V346M, which are both single amino acid substitutions on the LBD, might be detrimental to NLS function in the DBD. It is clear that NLS independent of ligand binding works in Q152X, and Q400LfsX7, but NLS dependent on ligand binding does not work in either of these mutants, which have been demonstrated not to have ligand-binding affinity.</p>
      <p id="Par23">Alopecia is a distinctive sign of HVDRR. Previous reports suggested that alopecia occurred in mutants that could not form a heterodimer with the RXR or that had a defect in DNA binding, whereas ligand-binding ability was unrelated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, we considered that whether a mutant can interact with the RXR in the absence of ligand is important with regard to alopecia. Recently, the V26M mutant in a patient with alopecia reportedly indicated that DNA-binding ability and not RXR heterodimerization is crucial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Herein, we showed that mutant VDR in patients without alopecia (R274L and H305Q) interacted with the RXR and had presumed DNA binding, but mutant VDR in patients with alopecia (S360P and V346M) did not interact with the RXR or have presumed DNA binding in the absence of ligand. These results were consistent with previous studies and we also think that the DNA-binding ability of the VDR/RXR heterodimer is essential for the function of VDR in hair development, and that DBD mutants lacking DNA-binding ability and LBD mutants lacking RXR-binding ability may result in a DNA-binding defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The fact that the transcriptional activity and RXR interaction of V346M were improved by the addition of ligand corresponds to the reported clinical course in which treatment with alfacalcidol improved rickets symptoms but alopecia remained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, indicating that alopecia may occur independently of ligand binding. The Hairless gene (<italic>HR</italic>) is the other key factor in hair follicle cycles, and <italic>HR</italic> mutation results in hair-loss phenotypes similar to those associated with VDR mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Some mutants of VDR were reportedly less suppressed by <italic>HR</italic>, suggesting the interface of <italic>HR</italic>, which interacts with the VDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Further research is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of alopecia in HVDRR and possible treatments for hair loss.</p>
      <p id="Par24">The impaired VDR function of S360P identified in this study is consistent with the patientâs clinical presentation as severe HVDRR with alopecia. According to the chart of VDR functional domains, the 360<sup>th</sup> residue does not seem to contribute to any of these functions, except for RXR binding (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). However, a single amino acid substitution of serine to proline causes extensive disruption of the function of the VDR protein. This possibly occurs because proline, the only cyclic amine, breaks helix 9 with damage to the whole protein structure, leading to all the defects of ligand binding, cofactor interaction, RXR heterodimerization, and localization in the nucleus.</p>
      <p id="Par25">The limitation of this study is that the assays were performed with overexpression of fusion proteins although protein expression after 24âhours of transfection was confirmed by western blot. It also harbored the possibility that the instability of the mutant proteins influenced the result of overexpression assay. Ideally, we should analyze the function of S360P in the patientâs tissue such as skin fibroblasts, although we could not obtain fibroblasts from the patient. Reporter assay is also one of significant assays, which reflect specific characters of the mutation. There are quite a few studies, in which only reporter assays were performed to investigate functional defects, not only for VDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> but also for other nuclear receptors, such as androgen receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and thyroid hormone receptor Î²<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, our results showing considerable differences among the mutants suggest that those are replicating the clinical severity and the ineffectiveness to calcitriol treatment.</p>
      <p id="Par26">In this study, <italic>in silico</italic> models of S360P did not match the functional analyses, and this kind of inconsistent predictions could happen reportedly. In particular, Polyphen2, which integrates information including protein structure, could not detect such a vast disruption throughout the function of the whole protein. Each software has its own accuracy, and the accuracy of predictions for specific genes and diseases varies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, indicating that undiscovered mechanisms for the disruption of protein function with missense mutations still exist. In this case, we suggest as one of the reasons for the unpredicted results, that serine, the 360th residue, is not a highly conserved residue. There is no objection to using computer software broadly to predict the functional effects of a mutation; however, we should consider the possibility of misleading results from an <italic>in silico</italic> study, and we consider that functional analyses will be necessary to confirm the functional consequences of a mutation.</p>
