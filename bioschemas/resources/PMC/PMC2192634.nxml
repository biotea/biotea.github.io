      <abstract>
        <p>Î³-Filamin, also called ABP-L, is a filamin isoform that is specifically expressed in striated muscles, where it is predominantly localized in myofibrillar Z-discs. A minor fraction of the protein shows subsarcolemmal localization. Although Î³-filamin has the same overall structure as the two other known isoforms, it is the only isoform that carries a unique insertion in its immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain 20. Sequencing of the genomic region encoding this part of the molecule shows that this insert is encoded by an extra exon. Transient transfections of the insert-bearing domain in skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes show that this single domain is sufficient for targeting to developing and mature Z-discs. The yeast two-hybrid method was used to identify possible binding partners for the insert-bearing Ig-like domain 20 of Î³-filamin. The two Ig-like domains of the recently described Î±-actininâbinding Z-disc protein myotilin were found to interact directly with this filamin domain, indicating that the amino-terminal end of Î³-filamin may be indirectly anchored to Î±-actinin in the Z-disc via myotilin. Since defects in the myotilin gene were recently reported to cause a form of autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, our findings provide a further contribution to the molecular understanding of this disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The three-dimensional structure of actin-based macromolecular assemblages largely depends on the activity of a plethora of actin-binding proteins. Thus, microfilaments can be as short as 13 actin monomers in the submembraneous cytoskeleton of erythrocytes, while they can reach several micrometers in length, for instance in the stress-fibers of cultured cells. Strictly bundled filaments in microvilli or stress fibers oppose to loose networks with very little apparent regularity, as found in the terminal web of epithelial cells or the leading edge of motile cultured cells. Mostly, these distinct structures can be attributed to the specific activity of individual actin filament-binding proteins or protein families (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ayscough1998">Ayscough 1998</xref>). The various isoforms or individual family members often exhibit strikingly different expression patterns and/or subcellular localizations. The molecular basis for the distinct functionality of highly similar but distinct variants of a protein is, however, little understood. One example for such versatile proteins that should allow us to analyze isoform-specific cellular functions is the filamin family (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hock1999">Hock 1999</xref>). These ubiquitously distributed actinâcross-linking proteins were described to cause bundling of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wangetal1975">Wang et al. 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="WangandSinger1977">Wang and Singer 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Brotschietal1978">Brotschi et al. 1978</xref>), a situation compatible with filamin's stress-fiber localization (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mittaletal1987">Mittal et al. 1987</xref>) and with its suggested role in organizing the contractile units of smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Smalletal1986">Small et al. 1986</xref>). Conversely, a number of studies emphasized filamin's role in organizing the cortical actin filaments of, for instance, blood platelets and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Cunninghametal1992">Cunningham et al. 1992</xref>). This latter function is exemplified further by the documentation of interactions between filamins and several transmembrane proteins: the cytoplasmic portion of the glycoprotein Ib IX complex, the receptor for von Willebrand factor (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fox1985">Fox 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Okitaetal1985">Okita et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Meyeretal1997">Meyer et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takafutaetal1998">Takafuta et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xuetal1998">Xu et al. 1998</xref>), Î²1-integrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pfaffetal1998">Pfaff et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Looetal1998">Loo et al. 1998</xref>), Î²2-integrin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sharmaetal1995">Sharma et al. 1995</xref>), caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StahlhutandvanDeurs2000">Stahlhut and van Deurs 2000</xref>), and Î³- and Î´-sarcoglycan (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>) were all identified as ligands for filamins. Intracellular proteins that bind to filamin include furin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>), presenilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1998">Zhang et al. 1998</xref>) and SEK-1, the activator of SAPK (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martietal1997">Marti et al. 1997</xref>). This leaves us with the need to define distinct functions of certain filamin variants in certain cell types. Until now, three human filamin gene paralogues have been identified: <italic>FLNA</italic> encodes Î±-filamin (also called ABP-280) and maps to the chromosomal position Xq28 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gorlinetal1990">Gorlin et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gorlinetal1993">Gorlin et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maestrinietal1993">Maestrini et al. 1993</xref>). <italic>FLNB</italic> codes for Î²-filamin (also called ABP-278) and was located at chromosome 3p14.3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takafutaetal1998">Takafuta et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xuetal1998">Xu et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x29d9cf0N0x31e6660">BrÃ¶cker et al. 1999</xref>). <italic>FLNC</italic> encodes Î³-filamin (also called ABP-L or FLN2) and was mapped to chromosome 7q32-q35 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gariboldietal1994">Gariboldi et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1998">Xie et al. 1998</xref>). Variability, however, goes even further because differential splicing has already been demonstrated for all three genes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maestrinietal1993">Maestrini et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1998">Xie et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xuetal1998">Xu et al. 1998</xref>). The exact knowledge of the full complement of filamin isoforms expressed will have to await the detailed characterization of the entire gene family.</p>
      <p>Cross-striated muscles offer an excellent system to address several questions regarding filamin isoform-specific cellular functions. The Î³-filamin isoform harboring a unique insertion of 78 amino acids was shown to be expressed specifically in muscular tissues (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maestrinietal1993">Maestrini et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1998">Xie et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>). Its upregulation during the initial stages of myocyte differentiation and its localization predominantly at the periphery of Z-discs implied an important role of this filamin variant during myofibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, the recently documented binding to sarcoglycans (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>) and the assignment of a subtype of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) to the same region of chromosome 7 where the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene was mapped (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Speeretal1999">Speer et al. 1999</xref>) made Î³-filamin an interesting candidate for a muscular disease gene. Our analysis that focused on a differentially spliced muscle-specific region of this polypeptide demonstrated myofibrillar targeting by this portion. At the same time, we identified myotilin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Salmikangasetal1999">Salmikangas et al. 1999</xref>) as a novel filamin ligand. This report therefore sheds new light on the molecular basis of LGMD.</p>

        <p>Human skeletal muscle cells were isolated and cultured essentially as described before (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal1992">van der Ven et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal1993">van der Ven et al. 1993</xref>). In brief, enzymatically isolated satellite cells from normal human skeletal muscle biopsies, passaged two to five times and frozen in liquid nitrogen, were quickly thawed and plated on glass coverslips in DME supplemented with 20% FCS, 2% Ultroser G, 100 U/ml penicillin and 1 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies). Cells were grown until near confluency. Differentiation of the cells was induced by changing the high nutrition medium to differentiation medium (DME, 0.4% Ultroser G and antibiotics as above).</p>
        <p>C2C12 cells (ECACC # CB2438) were cultured in DME supplemented with 15% FCS and antibiotics. Differentiation was induced as described for human skeletal muscle cells.</p>
        <p>Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared exactly as described before (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Senetal1988">Sen et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Komiyamaetal1996">Komiyama et al. 1996</xref>).

        <title>Transient Transfection Experiments</title>
        <p>C2C12 cells were seeded the day before transfection and grown on glass coverslips placed in a 35-mm culture dish to â¼80% confluency. The cells were transfected using lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies), except that 5 Î¼g plasmid DNA and 10 Î¼l lipofectamine were used per culture dish. Ptk2 cells were transfected using Fugene6, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Transfected C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate by changing the culture medium to differentiation medium the day after transfection, and cells were allowed to differentiate for 2â6 d. Transfected Ptk2 were analyzed for expression of the recombinant protein 24â48 h after transfection. Cells were fixed and stained as described below.</p>
        <p>Transfections of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were performed using a modified calcium-phosphate protocol as described (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Komiyamaetal1996">Komiyama et al. 1996</xref>). In brief, 4 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cardiomyocytes were seeded per 35-mm culture dish and were allowed to grow for â¼24 h at 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. 1â2 Î¼g of DNA was diluted with H<sub>2</sub>O to a total volume of 135 Î¼l and, after vortexing, 15 Î¼l of a 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution was added. While vortexing, 150 Î¼l of 2Ã BES (<italic>N,N</italic>-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2 aminoethane sulfonic acid)-buffered saline (50 mM BES, 1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 280 mM NaCl, pH 6.7) was added dropwise, and the mixture was incubated for 12 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was added dropwise to culture dishes containing 2 ml medium and cells were incubated at 37Â°C, 3% CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 h. After transfection, cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, and the medium was changed to a low nutrition medium consisting of 78% DME/20% medium 199 supplemented with 1% horse serum, 0.1 mM phenylephrine (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and antibiotics as above, and the cells were kept in this medium for 72 h, at 10% CO<sub>2</sub> until they were fixed and stained.</p>

        <p>At different time points after the switch of media, human skeletal muscle cells and C2C12 cells were fixed for â¼5 min in methanol and subsequently for 30 s in acetone, both at â20Â°C. Ptk2 cells were fixed identically. After air drying, cells were immediately used or frozen at â80Â°C. Cardiomyocytes were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Subsequently, they were washed with PBS, treated with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 3 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Before application of the antibodies (diluted in 1% BSA in PBS), cardiomyocytes were blocked with 5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min. Double immunofluorescence assays were performed using mixtures of the primary antibodies followed by a mixture of the matching secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; Cappel) using standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal1993">van der Ven et al. 1993</xref>).

        <title>Construction of Expression Constructs</title>
        <p>The prokaryotic expression vector pET-23a (Novagen) was modified by the introduction of an immunotag directly following the His6 tag, resulting in the vector called pET23-EEF. This immunotag consists of merely three amino acids (glutamic acidâglutamic acidâphenylalanine, EEF) and is recognized by the rat mAb YL1/2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wehlandetal1983">Wehland et al. 1983</xref>). Expressed proteins therefore carry a carboxyterminal His6 tag, allowing purification on Ni-agarose (QIAGEN) columns, while at the same time the EEF tag allows for immunodetection with mAb YL1/2. Another variant of the original pET-23a vector (pET23-T7) resulted in an amino-terminal T7 tag added to the expressed protein. Thus, expressed proteins carry an amino-terminal T7 tag enabling immunodetection with the T7 tag antibody (Novagen), and a carboxyterminal His6 tag.</p>
        <p>cDNA fragments covering different parts of Î±- and Î³-filamin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) were obtained by reverse transcriptionâPCR using total RNA purified from nondifferentiated or differentiated cultured human skeletal muscle cells, respectively, as a template using the âExpand long template PCR systemâ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). These fragments were used to amplify and subclone truncated variants of both proteins in the prokaryotic expression vector pET23-EEF and/or the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5-T7 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Obermannetal1998">Obermann et al. 1998</xref>) using forward primers containing an MluI site, and reverse primers containing a SalI site adjacent to the sequence homologous to the desired filamin sequence. In the case of Î²-filamin, a full-length cloned cDNA (kindly provided by Drs. S. Shapiro and T. Takafuta, Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Department of Medicine, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA) was used as a template to amplify cDNA fragments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Double digested PCR fragments were ligated into the correspondingly cut vectors. Similarly, truncated myotilin fragments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) were cloned in pET23-T7 for bacterial expression, or in pCMV5-T7 or pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP (Invitrogen) to allow the expression of T7- or green fluorescent protein (GFP)âtagged myotilin fragments in eukaryotic cells, respectively. The human nonmuscle Î±-actinin cDNA cloned in the pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was a kind gift of Dr. C. Otey (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Constructs were transformed to and propagated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JM 109 bacteria. DNAs were purified using the Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN).

After the addition of either 1 Î¼g antiâEEF antibody (YL1/2) or antiâT7 antibody, the mixture was incubated at 4Â°C for 60 min with gentle shaking.

Sepharose bound immune complexes were sedimented twice through a sucrose cushion (1 M sucrose in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl), and the beads were washed twice with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Finally, beads were boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and bead-associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Laemmli1970">Laemmli 1970</xref>). Proteins were blotted to polyvinyl difluoride membrane using a semidry blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the precipitated proteins were identified by immunodetection.

        <title>The Î³-Filaminâspecific Insertion in Domain 20 Is Encoded by an Individual Exon</title>
        <p>To examine the genomic organization of the region encoding the unique insertion within the Ig-like domain 20 of Î³-filamin, defined portions of the human <italic>FLNC</italic> gene were amplified. Analysis of the length of the PCR products, and comparison with the theoretical length of the products derived from the cDNA sequence, showed that the product representing the insertion of domain 20 alone did not differ from the expected length, whereas all three other products, which included sequences from the insert-harboring domain, were considerably longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. B</xref>). This indicated that at least one intron should be present between the 5â² end of domain 20 and the insertion, and another intron must be localized between the 3â² end of domain 20 and the insertion. To analyze the precise structure of this part of the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene, the â¼900-bp-long PCR product yielded by amplification of the complete domain 20 was cloned and sequenced. This revealed that the insertion within domain 20 is encoded by a single exon with a length of 243 bp. This exon is separated from the parts of the gene that encode the 5â² and 3â² parts of domain 20 by introns with a length of 136 and 196 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C).</p>

        <title>Î³-Filamin Is the only Filamin Isoform Expressed in Differentiating and Adult Human Skeletal Muscle Cells</title>
        <p>In a previous report, we characterized the expression of filamins in striated muscle tissues and in cultured cells with the murine antibody mAb RR90. Here, we characterized the epitope and isoform specificity of RR90 and of mab 1680 (raised against platelet filamins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. B</xref>). Thus, the epitope of RR90 is confined to Ig-like domains 1 and 2 of both, Î±- and Î³-filamin. In contrast, the corresponding Î²-filamin was not recognized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A). Similarly, mAb 1680 was established to react solely with Ig-like domains 16â20 of Î±-filamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B).</p>
        <p>This enabled a comparison of the staining patterns of an antibody specific for human Î±-filamin and RR90, to characterize more precisely which filamin isoforms are expressed in developing and mature human skeletal muscle cells, both with respect to temporal expression patterns and differential spatial distribution. In cross sections of adult skeletal muscle, both the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasm of muscle fibers as well as blood vessels were strongly stained by mAb RR90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, AâC), whereas the Î±-filaminâspecific antibody exclusively stained blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D). This clearly indicates that the filamin isoform detected by mAb RR90 in muscle fibers solely represents Î³-filamin. In longitudinal sections, cytoplasmic Î³-filamin was localized in a distinct cross-striated pattern, due to its localization in Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E). Again, no staining of muscle fibers was observed with the Î±-filamin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> F), firmly establishing that Î³-filamin is the only filamin isoform specifically expressed in myofibers.</p>
        <p>In a previous study, Northern and Western blotting demonstrated that in proliferating cultured human skeletal muscle cells, only nonmuscle filamin is expressed and that within a few hours after the induction of differentiation, the muscle-specific Î³-filamin isoform can be detected (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>). These findings were now complemented by immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody specific for Î±-filamin. Thus, Î±-filamin was revealed solely in proliferating myoblasts and only residual staining of stress fibre-like structures was observed in early myotubes 2 d after the induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, AâD). At later stages, the Î±-filaminâspecific antibody did not detect any protein in the myotubes, while RR90 mainly gave a strong staining of Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, EâH). These results make it clear that Î³-filamin is the filamin isoform that is involved in myofibril development.</p>

        <title>Ig-like Domain 20 of Î³-Filamin Including the Muscle-specific Insertion Is Sufficient for Proper Z-Disc Targeting</title>
        <p>Î³-Filamin is the only filamin isoform that bears this unique insertion in its Ig-like domain 20. Its size, 78 amino acids, must change the three-dimensional structure of this otherwise â¼90-residues domain dramatically. Both findings are indicative of an important and specific function of this insertion in striated muscle. To test for such a function in myofibril assembly or myofibrillar targeting, the cDNA encoding Ig-like domain 20 of Î³-filamin was cloned either alone or with one or both of the neighboring Ig-like domains in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5-T7 (for positions of clones, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). For comparison, the corresponding Ig-like domain 20 of Î±-filamin (which is devoid of this unique insertion) was also cloned in this vector. Transient transfections were carried out in two myogenic cell types. To study targeting of the expressed constructs to specific subcellular regions, constructs were expressed in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that upon the time point of transfection already contain fully assembled myofibrils. Thus, the major fraction of the expressed Î³-filamin domain 20 was specifically incorporated into myofibrils of transfected cardiomyocytes in a regular, cross-striated pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> E). No obvious targeting to the cell membrane was observed. Double immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody directed against the immuno-tag of the expressed protein and an antibody specific for the sarcomeric isoform of Î±-actinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> F) revealed a precise colocalization of both proteins. This indicated that the Ig-like domain 20 of Î³-filamin was incorporated into Z-discs of cardiac myofibrils. Similarly, transfections of the longer constructs Î³-filamin d19/20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> C) and Î³-filamin d19-d21 (A), which include the flanking Ig-like domains, also resulted in the incorporation of the expressed polypeptides in Z-discs, as demonstrated by double staining using the same combination of antibodies described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, AâD). Interestingly, both longer constructs seemed to be targeted to a somewhat narrower region of the Z-disc in comparison to the construct Î³-filamin d20, indicating that at least the addition of Ig-like domain 19 could stabilize the interaction of Î³-filamin d20 to Z-discs.</p>
        <p>The importance of the unique insertion in Ig-like domain 20 of the Î³-filamin isoform for the interaction with Z-discs was confirmed by transient expression of Î±-filamin d20 (i.e., the corresponding insert-less domain from the Î±-filamin isoform) in the cardiomyocytes. This construct was distributed diffusely in transfected cardiomyocytes and did not show any specific targeting to Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. H</xref>).</p>
        <p>Subsequently, murine C2C12 cells were used to study the effects of the expression of the construct Î³-filamin d20 on the development of myofibrils. In contrast to the cardiomyocytes described above, these cells were transfected during proliferative stages during which they are devoid of myofibrils. Differentiation of the cells, and thus myofibril assembly, therefore occurred simultaneously to the expression of recombinant polypeptide. The expression of Î³-filamin d20 in differentiating C2C12 mouse myoblasts confirmed the observation described above; i.e., that this single domain is sufficient for targeting to Z-discs. This domain clearly colocalized with the amino terminus of titin at Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, CâF). Interestingly, the recombinant protein was also targeted to nascent myofibrils that did not yet show a mature cross-striated distribution of Z-disc titin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. B</xref>). In none of the transfected cells did the overexpression of the construct Î³-filamin d20 lead to an evident perturbation of myofibril assembly, nor was any targeting to the sarcolemma observed. Surprisingly, the addition of the neighboring Ig-like domain 21 to the construct abolished the Z-disc binding capacity of the recombinant protein. Although some association with premyofibrils was observed, the polypeptide was never observed in Z-discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. H</xref>). Similar to the observation in cardiomyocytes, Î±-filamin d20 was diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm upon expression in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. K</xref>).</p>

        <title>Î³-Filamin Binds to the Z-Disc Protein Myotilin</title>
        <p>The yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for binding partners of the region encompassing the unique insertion in Ig-like domain 20 of Î³-filamin. Since the single domain construct Î³-filamin fused to the activation domain turned out to be autoactivating and therefore was not suitable for screening, we had to use a bait construct that included the flanking Ig-like domains 19 and 21. The yeast two-hybrid screen yielded â¼70 HIS3 and Î²-galactosidase positive clones from â¼5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> transformants. Plasmids were rescued from 20 colonies and the inserts from 12 were partially sequenced. Three of these were found to contain the full coding region of myotilin, a recently discovered component of the sarcomeric Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Salmikangasetal1999">Salmikangas et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
        <p>To investigate with greater precision which regions of Î³-filamin and myotilin are responsible for the interaction of both proteins, different subfragments of their cDNAs were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid bait and pray vectors (as described in Materials and Methods). All constructs were analyzed for autoactivation activity. Interactions were tested by Î²-galactosidase assays in cotransformed L40 yeast cells. The pair of Ig-like filamin domains 20 and 21 (Î³-filamin d20/21) was found to be negative in these assays. Since the bait containing domains 19 and 20 (Î³-filamin d19/20) was autoactivating, the original three-domain filamin fragment was the smallest fragment that showed binding to full-length myotilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Similarly, myotilin constructs were generated that contained either the unique amino terminal 248 amino acids (MYOT-S) or the subsequent two Ig-like domains (MYOT-I, residues 251â447). In the assay, only the fragment MYOT-I was positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, this novel proteinâprotein interaction could be located to Î³-filamin Ig-like domains 19â21 and to the Ig-like domains of myotilin.</p>

        <title>Coimmunoprecipitation and Double-Transfection Experiments Confirm the Association of Î³-Filamin d19â21 with the Immunoglobulin Domains of Myotilin</title>
        <p>The yeast two-hybrid data were confirmed by independent biochemical binding assays. Distinct subfragments of Î³-filamin comprising either the insert-bearing domain 20 or this domain with one or both neighboring domains were expressed with a carboxyterminal EEF-tag in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Only two of the recombinant polypeptide<italic>s</italic> (Î³-filamin d19â21 and Î³-filamin d20/21) could be purified in a native, soluble form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> A). Likewise, the portion of myotilin that comprises its Ig-like domains was also bacterially expressed, however, with an amino-terminally situated T7 tag (construct MYOT-I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> A). This combination of two differentially tagged constructs allowed us to investigate the binding by immunoprecipitation experiments. In this assay, only the three-domain filamin construct (Î³-filamin d19â21) showed binding to the myotilin Ig-domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. C</xref>). Immunocomplexes were precipitated both with the antiâT7 tag and the antiâEEF tag antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. C</xref>, arrows). In contrast, the recombinant polypeptides Î³-filamin d20/21 and Î³-filamin d24 were not coprecipitated with myotilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> B).</p>
        <p>The validity of the observed association of myotilin with Î³-filamin was further strengthened by coimmunoprecipitation experiments from yeast cells that were coexpressing the myotilin immunoglobulin domains fused to GAL 4AD and the HA tag, and Î³-filamin d19â21 fused to the LexA protein. Both antibodies specific for the HA tag and antibodies recognizing the immunoglobulin domains of myotilin specifically precipitated protein complexes also containing the expressed Î³-filamin fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> D). In contrast, the filamin fragment was not coprecipitated with GAL 4ADâHA tag alone, substantiating the specificity of the interaction.</p>
        <p>Further evidence for the interaction between myotilin and Î³-filamin was achieved by double transfection of nonmuscle cells with GFP-tagged full-length myotilin and T7-tagged Î³-filamin d19â21. Whereas myotilin expressed in Ptk2 cells showed an obvious colocalization with Î±-actinin in stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. B</xref>), cells double transfected with the myotilin construct and Î³-filamin d19â21 showed a dramatically altered myotilin localization in aggregates together with the truncated Î³-filamin polypeptide (C and D). Double transfection of GFPâÎ±-actinin together with Î³-filamin d19â21 did not inhibit the targeting of Î±-actinin to stress fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. F</xref>), indicating that the GFP tag plays no role in the observed association.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of the Immunoglobulin Domains of Myotilin, but not of Full-Length Myotilin, Has a Dominant Negative Effect on Myofibril Assembly</title>
        <p>To gain insight in the possible function of the interaction between Î³-filamin and myotilin, the immunoglobulin domains of myotilin (MYOT-I) and full-length myotilin (MYOT-SIT) were cloned into the pCMV5-T7 vector, and overexpressed in C2C12 cells that were subsequently allowed to differentiate. The effect of the overexpression of both recombinant proteins was studied immunocytochemically by double staining the transfected cells with antibodies against the immunotag and T12, our antibody against Z-disc titin. This allowed us to study Z-disc assembly in the presence of the overexpressed polypeptides. In cells transfected with MYOT-SIT, the recombinant protein was detected in numerous large myotubes, were it colocalized with Z-disc titin during all developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. H</xref>). This indicated that MYOT-SIT is targeted to developing and mature Z-discs without obviously disturbing myofibril assembly. Transfection of the MYOT-I construct, however, resulted in a dramatic effect on myofibrillar assembly. Although the recombinant polypeptide was targeted to immature Z-discs (Z-bodies; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. B</xref>), transfected myotubes with fully developed Z-discs were never observed. Instead, irregular filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. D</xref>) or amorphous aggregates (E and F) containing MYOT-I and a major part of titin were present in transfected cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The development of myofibrils in differentiating muscle cells is one of the most impressive macromolecular assembly processes in nature. It involves the interaction of a great number of different proteins that has to be precisely controlled both in terms of space and time (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Franzini-ArmstrongandFischman1994">Franzini-Armstrong and Fischman 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Squire1997">Squire 1997</xref>). Many of these proteins occur in multiple isoforms whose expression patterns are fundamentally different and are therefore thought to fulfill highly specialized roles (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="PetteandStaron1997">Pette and Staron 1997</xref>). The filamins are an example for such a gene family that became evident only rather recently. In the chicken system, the existence of several distinct filamin isoforms was suspected already several years ago, mainly due to differentially reacting antibodies (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="GomerandLazarides1981">Gomer and Lazarides 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="GomerandLazarides1983">Gomer and Lazarides 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Priceetal1994">Price et al. 1994</xref>). Further insights into the differential functions of the avian isoforms has been hindered by the lack of primary sequence information, with only one isoform so far cloned (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Barryetal1993">Barry et al. 1993</xref>). Similar studies in mammalian systems relied for a long time on antibodies reacting with only a single polypeptide that on top could not be identified in striated muscles (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BrownandBinder1993">Brown and Binder 1993</xref>). Molecular genetic studies pointed at the existence of an additional isoform expressed in human skeletal muscle that was called ABP-L (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maestrinietal1993">Maestrini et al. 1993</xref>). Its complete cDNA was cloned recently and the protein was renamed Î³-filamin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1998">Xie et al. 1998</xref>). We have succeeded in obtaining an antibody that reacts with both filamin isoforms, which made it feasible to approach the question of the different roles of these proteins in muscle (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>). Here we used this mAb (called RR90) in combination with an antibody that we could show to be specific for Î±-filamin, with the idea that a subtraction of both antibody labels might yield firm statements about the distribution of the individual filamin isoforms. Thus, in adult striated muscle fibers, Î³-filamin is expressed while nonmuscle Î±-filamin is limited to blood vessels and connective tissue cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This still leaves the interesting question unanswered: why, within the myofibers, Î³-filamin shows a dual pattern of distribution? In accordance with cell fractionation studies (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>), we found the majority of filamin in the myofibrils that correspond to the particulate sarcoplasmic fraction; conversely, a small fraction of Î³-filamin was located at the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We propose that this differential targeting, which at the same time implies distinct functions, could be the result of alternatively spliced Î³-filamin variants. This idea is supported by a provisional genetic analysis that revealed short alternatively spliced exons for Î±-filamin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maestrinietal1993">Maestrini et al. 1993</xref>). Definitive proof, however, will require the establishment of the complete genomic structure of the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene and the subsequent elucidation of peptide-specific antibodies. In line with this view, quite distinct staining patterns were observed in developing chicken muscle cells. On the one hand, filamin was first located in stress fiberâlike structures, and then disappeared for several days, and finally reappeared at the periphery of Z-discs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="GomerandLazarides1981">Gomer and Lazarides 1981</xref>). On the other hand, filamin was detected in the developing chicken heart only from the 14 somite stage onwards; i.e. at a time when functional myofibrils in the beating heart exist already for â¼4 h (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Priceetal1994">Price et al. 1994</xref>). It is very likely that the antibodies used in these studies did not reflect the complete spectrum of filamin isoforms that can be expected to be expressed in avian tissues.</p>
      <p>The subtractive antibody labeling approach was also used on developing skeletal muscle cells in culture. This clearly demonstrated not only that Î³-filamin is expressed within a few hours subsequent to the induction of muscle differentiation (see also <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>), but also that solely this isoform participates in the striking reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during myofibril formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>The specific function of filamin in myofibrils cannot be solely attributed to its well-documented capacity to cross-link actin filaments, particularly since this region shows very little variability between the isoforms. Therefore, different functions must be determined in other, more diverse parts of the molecule. The region that mainly attracted our attention was the unique insertion of 78 amino acids located within Ig-like domain 20. We show here that this insertion, which previously was shown to be specifically expressed in differentiated muscle (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1998">Xie et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>), is encoded by a single extra exon that is differentially spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Transfection studies and yeast two-hybrid screenings were used to address the specific function of this molecular region. The transfection studies were aimed at elucidating its role for the subcellular targeting of filamin in muscle cells. Previous studies using either the Î±- or Î³-filamin isoforms have emphasized their membrane association (see Introduction). Here, we identify for the first time a myofibrillar targeting signal within Î³-filamin that is functional in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Since in both cell types myofibrils were assembled normally in the presence of the overexpressed recombinant protein, it does not seem to exert a dominant negative effect on this process, at least at the time scale of our experiments. We also believe it is justified to assume that this signal must reside in the unique domain 20 insertion because Î±-filamin (which does not contain this insertion) does not show any specific localization upon overexpression in muscle cells.</p>
      <p>The strict targeting of Ig-like domain 20 of Î³-filamin urged us to search for a myofibrillar protein that might specifically interact with it. Yeast two-hybrid screens identified the recently discovered protein myotilin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Salmikangasetal1999">Salmikangas et al. 1999</xref>) as a binding partner for Î³-filamin, and three independent experiments (coimmunoprecipitation experiments using recombinant fragments, coimmunoprecipitation from double-transfected yeast cells, and double transfection of nonmuscle cells) confirmed and further confined this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). Since myotilin was previously shown to bind Î±-actinin, we assume that the function of this Z-disc protein is the indirect anchorage of Î³-filamin, which is localized at the periphery of sarcomeric Z-discs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderVenetal2000">van der Ven et al. 2000</xref>), to Î±-actinin in the central Z-disc.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the overexpression of the myotilin binding part of Î³-filamin, the overexpression of the Î³-filaminâbinding region of myotilin had a dramatic effect on the assembly of myofibrils in differentiating C2C12 myotubes. This implies that the amino terminal part of myotilin that is lacking in this construct and is known to contain an Î±-actinin binding site (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Salmikangasetal1999">Salmikangas et al. 1999</xref>) plays an important role in the control of myofibrillar assembly. Obviously, the interaction Î³-filaminâmyotilinâÎ±-actinin is disturbed by overexpression of this truncated myotilin fragment that is still able to associate with Î³-filamin. This regulatory role is further strengthened by the observation that overexpression of full-length myotilin does not result in abnormal myofibrillogenesis. Thus, it seems that the Î±-actininâbinding part of the myotilin molecule is indispensable for the proper function of the protein.</p>
      <p>The identification of myotilin as a Î³-filamin binding partner described in this report, together with earlier observations that Î³-filamin binds Î³- and Î´-sarcoglycan (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>) is particularly interesting with regard to recent findings on LGMD. Mutations in the genes encoding all three binding partners cause LGMD (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Noguchietal1995">Noguchi et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nigroetal1996">Nigro et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hauseretal2000">Hauser et al. 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene itself has been mapped to an LGMD candidate region on chromosome 7 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Speeretal1999">Speer et al. 1999</xref>). Interestingly, caveolin-1 was recently identified as a binding partner of Î±-filamin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StahlhutandvanDeurs2000">Stahlhut and van Deurs 2000</xref>). Considering the high degree of similarity of the isoforms of both proteins, the muscle isoform of caveolin (caveolin-3, which in turn is a further LGMD gene), can be assumed to interact in a similar way with muscle filamin, although definitive proof is still lacking.</p>
      <p>Until recently, this genetically heterogeneous disease has been attributed essentially to mutations of the genes encoding sarcolemmal proteins such as Î±-, Î²-, Î³-, and Î´-sarcoglycans, caveolin-3, and dysferlin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Bushby1999">Bushby 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="TonioloandMinetti1999">Toniolo and Minetti 1999</xref>). In LGMD 2C and LGMD 2F, which are caused by mutations in the Î³- and Î´-sarcoglycan genes, respectively, the fraction of Î³-filamin that is localized to the sarcolemma is highly increased. Considering these observations, the traditional role of filamins in the submembraneous cytoskeleton and the fact that the vast majority of other identified interactors of filamins until now are mainly membrane-associated proteins, an LGMD model was suggested that favors a cyclic translocation of Î³-filamin from membrane attachment sites to intracellular locations. In LGMD 2C and 2F and other muscle diseases characterized by abnormalities in both sarcoglycans this cycling was supposed to be disturbed (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our finding that the muscle-specific isoform of filamin specifically binds myotilin, adds an interesting facet to the theme of LGMD: mutations in myotilin, a sarcomeric Z-disc protein that interacts with Î±-actinin, were suggested to cause LGMD1A (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hauseretal2000">Hauser et al. 2000</xref>). Filamin is therefore the first protein identified that can link membrane-related effects to myofibrillar defects. This finding strongly corroborates the notion that, in LGMD myofibers, large amounts of filamin accumulate at the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Thompsonetal2000">Thompson et al. 2000</xref>). LGMD may therefore be caused by two interdependent molecular events: one, the destabilization of membrane attachment complexes and, the other, the weakening of myofibrils and/or myofibrillar connections particularly at the Z-disc. The recently described LGMD 2G-causing mutations in the Z-disc protein telethonin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Moreiraetal2000">Moreira et al. 2000</xref>), a protein that has been implied to be involved in signaling events during myofibril development (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mayansetal1998">Mayans et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Muesetal1998">Mues et al. 1998</xref>), strongly supports this assumption.</p>
      <p>The relationship of Î³-filamin with both sarcolemmal and myofibrillar proteins, which are involved in LGMD, is highly indicative of an important function for this protein in signaling processes between the sarcolemma and myofibrils. In line with this idea, patients were identified whose disease phenotype showed genetic linkage to chromosome 7q (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Speeretal1999">Speer et al. 1999</xref>), a chromosomal region that also includes the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Maestrinietal1993">Maestrini et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1998">Xie et al. 1998</xref>). This increases the probability that defects in the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene itself might cause LGMD in patients who do not have mutations in any of the known LGMD genes. Our work might therefore provide a molecular basis to define a novel signaling pathway from the sarcolemma to the myofibril. Disturbances of this pathway at any point may result in essentially the same clinical manifestation in the form of LGMD.</p>

        <p>Domain organization of the filamins and of myotilin, and recombinant constructs used for transfection assays. A emphasizes the general modular organization of filamins: the actin binding head domain (ABD) is followed by 24 Ig-like modules (identified by numbers between the boxes). Stretches of unique sequence, so-called hinge regions, are found between Ig-like domains 15 and 16, as well as between domains 23 and 24. Muscle Î³-filamin, however, lacks this insertion, which might make the molecule less flexible. A conspicuous difference between Î³-filamin and the other members of the filamin family is a unique insertion in the middle of Ig-like domain 20. Constructs derived from Î±- or Î³-filamin, which were used for the experiments of this work, are shown schematically above and below the respective mother molecules. For yeast two-hybrid screens and for prokaryotic expression experiments, identical inserts were cloned into the respective vectors (see Materials and Methods). (B) A layout of the structure of myotilin is given. The molecule consists of a serine-rich amino terminal portion (S), followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains (I) and a carboxyterminal âtailâ sequence (T). Inserts were cloned into the respective vectors for yeast two-hybrid experiments and for prokaryotic expression. (C) Legend to the domain symbols used in A and B.</p>

Note that the primers used for amplification (P1: GTCACCAACAGCCCCTTCAAG; P2: AAGGTGACCGGCGAGGGCCGC; P3: CACAGTGAACTGAAAGGGGCT; P4: AGCGTCATCCGAGAGGGAGG) all had a tail of nine additional basepairs to allow restriction enzymeâbased cloning. Therefore, the actual length of the products was reduced by subtraction of 18 basepairs. (C) Splice junctions and exon and intron sizes of the part of the <italic>FLNC</italic> gene that encodes domain 20 are shown.</p>

        <p>Characterization of the filamin antibodies. Total protein extracts from bacteria expressing the carboxyterminally immunotagged polypeptides indicated above each lane were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Subsequently, the filters were incubated with YL1/2 (A and B, top), RR90 (A, bottom) or mAb 1680 (B, bottom). The reactivity with the antiâEEF tag antibody indicates that the polypeptides are intact and in the correct reading frame. Note that RR90 recognizes an epitope in the first two immunoglobulin-like domains of Î±- and Î³-filamins, but not in Î²-filamin. mAb 1680 recognizes an epitope in the polypeptide Î±-filamin d16â20, and not in Î²- or Î³-filamin, indicating that it is specific for this isoform.</p>

        <p>Immunofluorescence localization of filamin isoforms in developing human skeletal muscle cells. The micrographs show cultured human skeletal muscle cells differentiated for 0 (A and B), 2 (C and D), 4 (E and F) or 6 (G and H) d, double stained with an antibody specific for Î±-filamin (left) and mAb RR90 (right). Note that only in nondifferentiated cells a high level of Î±-filamin is detected by both antibodies (A and B). After 2 d of differentiation, RR90 strongly stains the young myotubes (D), while the level of Î±-filamin has strongly decreased (C), indicating a clear predominance of the muscle-specific filamin isoform. In further developed myotubes, Î±-filamin is not detectable (E and G), and Î³-filamin seems to be the only filamin isoform that is expressed at these developmental stages (F and H). Note that, after 6 d of differentiation, Î³-filamin is localized in a cross-striated pattern due to its localization in Z-discs. Bar, 20 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>Immunolocalization of filamins in sections of human skeletal muscle tissue. Photomicrographs were taken from cryosections of normal human skeletal muscle tissue stained with mAb RR90 (A and B) or double stained with RR90 (C and E) and mAb 1680, an antibody specific for Î±-filamin (D and F). RR90 detects both sarcoplasmic and sarcolemmal filamins in cross-sectioned myofibers (A and B). In slightly oblique sections, the typical cytoplasmic staining for proteins that show a striated, myofibrillar staining pattern in longitudinal sections is observed (A). Double staining of RR90 (C and E) with mAb 1680 (D and F) shows that blood vessels that are known to contain Î±-filamin are stained by both antibodies. In contrast, Î±-filamin cannot be detected at the sarcolemma or in the sarcoplasm of human skeletal muscle fibers, indicating that the filamin isoform detected by RR90 in these cells is exclusively Î³-filamin.

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes transfected with constructs encoding T7-tagged Î³-filamin d19-21 (A and B), Î³-filamin d19/20 (C and D), Î³-filamin d20 (E and F), or Î±-filamin d20 (G and H) were fixed and double stained with T7-tag antibody (left) and an antibody specific for sarcomeric Î±-actinin (right). Note that the recombinant polypeptides Î³-filamin d19â21 and Î³-filamin d20/21 colocalize precisely with Î±-actinin in sharp striations, indicating that this part of Î³-filamin is targeted to Z-discs (AâD, arrows). The single domain Î³-filamin d20 is also targeted to the Z-disc region, although the fluorescent stripes appear less sharp (E and F, arrows). Î±-filamin d20 is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm (G) and does not show any specific targeting to Z-discs or myofibrils in general (H). Bars, 10 Î¼m.</p>

C2C12 cells transfected with constructs encoding T7-tagged Î³-filamin d20 (A and F), Î³-filamin d20/21 (G and H), or Î±-filamin d20 (J and K) were allowed to differentiate for 2 (A and B) or 4 (CâK) d. Subsequently, they were fixed and double stained with T7-tag antibody (left) and T12 (right), an antibody specific for a Z-disc epitope of titin. Note that Î³-filamin d20 exactly colocalizes with Z-disc titin in nascent myofibrils with immature Z-discs (A and B, arrows), as well as in mature myofibrils (CâF) where the recombinant protein and Z-disc epitope of titin are localized in sharp striations (E and F, arrows). Note that, although Î³-filamin d20/21 associates with stress fiberâlike structures, it is never found at Z-discs (G and H). Î±-Filamin d20 is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm (J), and does not show any targeting to immature or mature myofibrils (K). Bars, 20 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>Characterization of the interaction of Î³-filamin with myotilin. Yeast cells pretransformed with Î³-filamin d20/21 or Î³-filamin d19â21 in pLexPd were transformed with the empty prey vector (pGADPd) or with the region of the myotilin cDNA encoding its complete polypeptide (MYOT-SIT), its serine rich domain (MYOT-S), or the immunoglobulin domains (MYOT-I) in pGADPd. (A) In four independent colonies double transformed with Î³-filamin d19â21 and MYOT-SIT, Î²-galactosidase activity was restored, indicating an interaction between both polypeptides. This reactivity was absent in all colonies of yeast cells transformed with Î³-filamin d20/21 and MYOT-SIT. (B) Two independent yeast colonies cotransformed with Î³-filamin d19â21 or Î³-filamin d20/21, and truncated myotilin fragments. Note that only in yeast cells cotransformed with Î³-filamin d19â21 and MYOT-I or MYOT-SIT Î²-galactosidase reactivity was restored. These results are summarized in C.</p>

        <p>Coimmunoprecipitation of filamin and myotilin fragments. (A) Coomassie blueâstained SDS gel of recombinant protein fragments used for coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The identity of the polypeptides is indicated above each lane. (B and C) T7-tagged MYOT-I and EEF-tagged Î³-filamin fragments alone (control) or mixed with MYOT-I (MYOT-I) were incubated with antiâEEF antibody (B) or antiâT7-tag antibody (C), immunoprecipitated as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For immunodetection of binding partners of the precipitated polypeptide, antiâT7-tag antibody (B) or antiâEEF antibody (C) were used. Arrowheads indicate positions of proteins that are specifically coprecipitated. Note that MYOT-I is coprecipitated with Î³-filamin d19â21, but not with Î³-filamin d20/21 or Î³-filamin d24 (B), and that Î³-filamin d19â21 is coprecipitated with MYOT-I (C). (D) Coimmunoprecipitation from yeast cells double transfected with an empty Lex vector (Lex) or the pLex vector containing Î³-filamin d19â21, together with an empty pACT2-HA vector (HA) or this vector with MYOT-IT (HA-MYOT-IT), as indicated above the lanes. In the left two lanes, expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using an antiâHA or antiâLexA antibody. In the middle two lanes, the complexes immunoprecipitated with the antiâHA antibody were separated and stained with the antiâLexA antibody to detect Lex-Î³-filamin d19â21. Note that Lex-Î³-filamin d19â21 is only coprecipitated with HA-MYOT-I and not with HA alone. In the right two lanes, complexes immunoprecipitated with the antiâmyotilin antibody were separated and stained with the antiâLexA antibody to detect Lex-Î³-filamin d19â21. Note that Lex-Î³-filamin d19â21 is again coprecipitated with HA-MYOT-I. No signal is obtained if the cells are transfected with the empty LexA vector.</p>

The T7-tagged recombinant protein was visualized by staining with the antiâT7-tag antibody (D and F). Endogenous Î±-actinin was stained with BM-75.2 recognizing all isoforms of Î±-actinin (B). Full-length myotilin is targeted to stress fibers, where it colocalizes with endogenous Î±-actinin (A and B). Note that if, in the same cell, Î³-filamin d19â21 is expressed, the localization of MYOT-SIT is dramatically changed, and the protein is found in aggregates together with Î³-filamin d19â21 (C and D). In contrast, the localization of GFP-tagged Î±-actinin, which is also targeted to stress fibers, is not changed upon coexpression of Î³-filamin d19â21 (E and F), indicating that MYOT-I and not the GFP tag interacts with Î³-filamin d19â21.

MYOT-I associates with stress fiberâlike structures (A and B), but it is never found in Z-discs. Moreover, myotubes expressing MYOT-I do not develop myofibrils. Instead, the myofibrillar proteins are colocalized with MYOT-I in filamentous bundles (C and D) or amorphous aggregates (E and F). Bar, 20 Î¼m.</p>
