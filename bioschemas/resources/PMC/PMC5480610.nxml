      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Metabolic pathways contributing to adiposity and aging are activated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) axis<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, known mTORC1-S6K1 targets do not account for observed loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting additional downstream effectors<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Here we identify glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) as an mTORC1-S6K1 target that contributes importantly to adiposity and aging. EPRS phosphorylation at Ser<sup>999</sup> by mTORC1-S6K1 induces its release from the aminoacyl tRNA multisynthetase complex (MSC), required for execution of noncanonical functions beyond protein synthesis<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. To investigate physiological function of EPRS phosphorylation, we generated <italic>EPRS</italic> knock-in mice bearing phospho-deficient Ser<sup>999</sup>-to-Ala (S999A) and phospho-mimetic (S999D) mutations. Homozygous S999A mice exhibited low body weight, reduced adipose tissue mass, and increased lifespan, thereby displaying notable similarities with S6K1-deficient mice<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and mice with adipocyte-specific deficiency of raptor, an mTORC1 constituent<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Substitution of the <italic>EPRS</italic> S999D allele in S6K1-deficient mice normalized body mass and adiposity, indicating EPRS phosphorylation mediates S6K1-dependent metabolic responses. In adipocytes, insulin stimulated S6K1-dependent EPRS phosphorylation and release from the MSC. Interaction screening revealed phospho-EPRS binds Slc27a1 (i.e., fatty acid transport protein 1, FATP1)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, inducing its translocation to the plasma membrane and long-chain fatty acid uptake. Thus, EPRS and FATP1 are terminal mTORC1-S6K1 axis effectors critical for metabolic phenotypes.</p>

    <p id="P2">Phosphorylation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) is emerging as a prevalent regulator of noncanonical functions beyond aminoacylation<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Vertebrate EPRS contains two distinct aminoacylation domains, connected by a non-catalytic linker, and first joined in a unicellular ancestor ~800 Mya<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation re-directs EPRS function from protein synthesis to transcript-selective translation inhibition by forming the interferon (IFN)-Î³-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that targets GAIT elements in select mRNAs in myeloid cells<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. IFN-Î³ induces phosphorylation in human EPRS linker at Ser<sup>886</sup> and Ser<sup>999</sup>; the latter is essential for GAIT complex assembly<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Cdk5/p35 kinase directly phosphorylates Ser<sup>886</sup>, and is upstream of an unidentified AGC kinase required for Ser<sup>999</sup> phosphorylation<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). To identify the Ser<sup>999</sup> kinase, 22 AGC kinases, and non-AGC MK2, were screened by immunocomplex kinase assay for phosphorylation of Ser<sup>886</sup>-to-Ala (S886A) mutant linker, phosphorylatable only at Ser<sup>999</sup>; S6K1 exhibited robust phosphorylation and modest activity was seen with RSK and AKT (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Only S6K1 showed target specificity, phosphorylating Ser<sup>999</sup> but not Ser<sup>886</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). S6K1 knockdown in human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and U937 cells specifically inhibited EPRS Ser<sup>999</sup> phosphorylation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Endogenous phosphorylation using phospho-Ser<sup>999</sup> EPRS antibody<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation of Ser<sup>999</sup> linker by lysates from IFN-Î³-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from S6K2<sup>â/â</sup>, but not S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> and double-knockout mice, confirmed the requirement for S6K1 (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation showed IFN-Î³ induced S6K1 binding to EPRS suggesting S6K1 as the proximal kinase (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Finally, recombinant S6K1 (rS6K1) phosphorylated Ser<sup>999</sup> in S886A linker (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). Rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation at the classical Thr<sup>389</sup> activation site, and suppressed EPRS Ser<sup>999</sup> phosphorylation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>), as did siRNA targeting the mTORC1 constituent, raptor, but not the mTORC2 constituent, rictor<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). To verify the mTORC1 requirement, S6K1 was suppressed with siRNA targeting the 3â²UTR, and Myc-tagged S6K1 bearing a phospho-defective mutation at Thr<sup>389</sup> was introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1f,g</xref>). The S6K1 T389A mutant, but not the phospho-mimetic T389E mutant, was unable to bind and phosphorylate EPRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1g,h</xref>). These results establish the requirement for mTORC1-activated S6K1 to phosphorylate EPRS at Ser<sup>999</sup> (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">To investigate the physiological role of EPRS phosphorylation, homozygous phospho-defective (Ser<sup>999</sup>-to-Ala; EPRS<sup>A/A</sup>) and phospho-mimetic (Ser<sup>999</sup>-to-Asp; EPRS<sup>D/D</sup>) knock-in mice in C57BL/6 background were generated by homologous recombination and verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Progeny of heterozygous crosses of both models exhibited near-Mendelian genotype distribution, indicating no apparent developmental defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Importantly, adult male and female EPRS<sup>A/A</sup>, but not EPRS<sup>D/D</sup>, mice exhibited about 15â20% lower weight than wild-type EPRS<sup>S/S</sup> mice (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). The weight difference was not observed in embryonic or early developmental stages, but began at 8â10 weeks (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Marked lifespan increase was observed for both genders of EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice; the combined median increase was about 118 days or 15% (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Cox regression analysis revealed genotype, not gender, date of birth, or parental ID, as the most significant predictor of longevity with a hazard ratio substantially greater than one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). No change in lifespan was observed in EPRS<sup>D/D</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3câe</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">The body length of EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice was same as wild-type, however, the opened abdominal cavity revealed reduced adipose tissue in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4a,b</xref>). The mass of major white adipose tissue (WAT) depots and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> was about half of that in EPRS<sup>S/S</sup> mice, but other major organs were unchanged (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>); no mass differences were observed in EPRS<sup>D/D</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Reduced adipocyte size and unaltered number was observed in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Lipolysis and fatty acid Î²-oxidation were greater in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Serum glucose, triglycerides, and free fatty acid levels were unaltered in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice, but insulin level was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4h</xref>). High-fat diet (~60% total calories from fat) feeding induced EPRS phosphorylation in wild-type adipose tissue, and body weight gain was substantially reduced in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4i,j</xref>). These characteristics of EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice approximately phenocopy S6K1-null and adipocyte-specific, raptor-deficient mice, suggesting EPRS as mTORC1-S6K1 effector contributing to obesity-related phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. To test this relationship, we bred phosphomimetic EPRS<sup>D/D</sup> alleles into S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice generated in C57Bl/6 background by targeted disruption<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Like the previously characterized S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> line<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, the mice were small, however, obesity-related phenotypes were not investigated. Gene deletion was verified by genotyping and protein absence in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5a,b</xref>). As before, this S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> line exhibited reduced body weight in embryos and early developmental stages<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Lifespan extension of about 170 d or 22% was observed in combined genders of S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5dâf</xref>). Introduction of S999D gain-of-function allele into S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice resulted in about 60% restoration of body and WAT mass toward wild-type, i.e., EPRS<sup>S/S</sup>-S6K1<sup>+/+</sup>, mice (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>) indicating S6K1-mediated EPRS phosphorylation is a critical determinant of adiposity<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Incomplete restoration might indicate contributions of other established or as-yet unidentified mTORC1-S6K1 targets<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p>

    <p id="P7">Insulin-stimulated long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake was significantly reduced in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup>, but not EPRS<sup>D/D</sup> mouse adipocytes; glucose uptake was essentially identical (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Insulin-stimulated LCFA uptake did not require EPRS phosphorylation in liver, heart, muscle, or BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Notably, a requirement for S6K1 in insulin-stimulated EPRS phosphorylation and LCFA uptake in adipocytes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). Fatty acid binding proteins and transporters, together with lipolytic enzymes and a glucose transporter, were screened to identify potential downstream targets of phospho-EPRS. Insulin-dependent interaction of EPRS was observed exclusively with the fatty acid transporter, FATP1, a principal mediator of insulin-stimulated LCFA uptake in adipocytes (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Insulin reduced EPRS association with two MSC constituents, AIMP3 and lysyl tRNA synthetase (KARS), establishing stimulus-dependent release from the parental complex (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Interaction between phospho-EPRS and FATP1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, and binding was inhibited by S6K1 knockdown or rapamycin (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Likewise, the inhibitors reduced insulin-stimulated uptake of bodipy-C<sub>12</sub>, a fluorescent LCFA analog, and [<sup>14</sup>C]oleic acid (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Knockdown of EPRS or FATP1 by about 60% reduced LCFA uptake by about half, and knockdown of both further reduced uptake to near background, without inhibiting protein synthesis (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). EPRS interaction with FATP1 was repressed in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mouse adipocytes indicating a strict requirement for Ser<sup>999</sup> phosphorylation (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Similar binding characteristics and LCFA uptake were observed in human adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>). However, insulin-stimulated EPRS/FATP1 interaction was not observed in non-adipose tissues, suggesting a requirement for adipocyte-specific factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>). Also, interaction of EPRS with FATP1 was not seen in adipose tissue from S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9f,g</xref>). These results implicate EPRS and FATP1 as critical downstream effectors of mTORC1-S6K1 specifically contributing to adiposity. Low LCFA by EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> adipocytes could increase serum or hepatic lipid levels with pathological consequences. However, serum lipids in fed and fasted mice, and liver triglycerides and neutral lipids, revealed no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4h</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10a,b</xref>).</p>

Insulin induced linker phosphorylation and interaction with FATP1, which in turn enhanced LCFA uptake (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). FATP1 failed to bind S999A mutant linker, but bound the S999D mutant even without insulin stimulation; LCFA uptake likewise required Ser<sup>999</sup> phosphorylation (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).

    <p id="P9">The metabolic phenotype of EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> mice captures several salient features of S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice. They exhibit identical food intake, small adipocytes, reduced adiposity and body weight, improved glucose homeostasis in adults, and increased energy expenditure. Adipocytes from both mouse types have reduced insulin-stimulated EPRS binding to FATP1 and LCFA uptake, and enhanced basal lipolysis. We observed extended lifespan in EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> and S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice of both genders; a previous report showed significant longevity increase in female S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice, with similar trend for males<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, S6K1<sup>â/â</sup> mice have reduced body weight at an earlier stage in development, and reduced muscle mass<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. These differences might be explained by the breadth of S6K1 targets with multiple functions in diverse organ systems<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. The phenotypic relationship between EPRS<sup>A/A</sup> and FATP1<sup>â/â</sup> mice is less clear. Both mice exhibit markedly reduced adipocyte and epididymal fat mass<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However, reduced body weight was no observed in FATP1<sup>â/â</sup> mice. Possibly, the difference is explained by genetic background, compensatory up-regulation of an alternative LCFA uptake mechanism in a knockout<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, or by calculation of body weight as fraction of initial weight that can reduce apparent differences at later times<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P10">Adipocyte triglyceride accumulation is largely determined by relative fluxes through catalytic reactions driving LCFA uptake, its esterification to glycerol backbones, glyceride lipolysis, and Î²-oxidation. Phospho-EPRS enhances the first step by activating FATP1, and EPRS knockdown inhibits adipocyte LCFA uptake by ~50%. Interestingly, others report that depletion of FATP1 and CD36 reduces adipocyte LCFA uptake by ~25% and 60â70%, respectively, suggesting EPRS stimulates FATP1-independent uptake mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Although stable interaction of EPRS was detected only with FATP1, we have not eliminated the possibility that EPRS activates transport by indirect mechanisms or by transient interactions not captured by immunoprecipitation. We also provide evidence that EPRS phosphorylation contributes to lipid accumulation by inhibiting catabolic reactions, i.e., lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation.</p>

Longevity relative to survival days (i.e., age at death) was analyzed in pooled mice by CPH regression model. The 4 independent variables genotype, date of birth (DOB), parental ID (PID), and gender were replaced with a set of category variables. In case of genotype and gender, category represents their presence or absence. DOB and PID data were divided into multiple categories as described in the supplementary methods. Independent variables were fitted into the CPH model individually (univariate) or simultaneously (multivariate). Shown are: Î²(the unstandardized regression coefficient) with standard error (SE), the degrees of freedom (df), and the significance for each model fit. Exp(Î²) for the covariate of interest is the predicted change in hazard ratio for a unit increase in the predictor, and its 95% confidence interval (CI). <bold>c</bold>, Kaplan-Meier survival curves show no change in lifespan of male, female, or combined EPRS<sup>D/D</sup> mice.

        <title>EPRS linker binds FATP1 and induces membrane translocation</title>
        <p><bold>a</bold>, Insulin induces EPRS linker phosphorylation, binding to FATP1, and LCFA uptake. Endogenous EPRS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was knocked down by 3â²UTR-specific siRNA and cells transfected with Flag-tagged EPRS domains (ERS, PRS, and linker), and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation determined by <sup>32</sup>P-labeling (left). Binding of EPRS domains to FATP1 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation, and LCFA uptake measured (mean Â± SEM, n = 4 experiments in duplicate) (right). <bold>b</bold>, Expression of phospho-mimetic S999D linker facilitates interaction with FATP1 and fatty acid uptake even without insulin (mean Â± SEM, n = 3 experiments in duplicate). <bold>c</bold>, Insulin induces translocation of Ser<sup>999</sup>-phosphorylated EPRS and FATP1 to membranes. Anti-GAPDH and -Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase antibodies verified cytosolic and membrane isolation. <bold>d</bold>, Effect of knockdown of EPRS (left) and FATP1 (targeting the coding sequence [CDS], right) on translocation to membrane. <bold>e</bold>, Schematic of mTORC1-S6K1 activation of EPRS and FATP1-mediated LCFA uptake in adipocytes.</p>
