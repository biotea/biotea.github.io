        <p id="P1">Type 1 diabetes (T1D) may result from a breakdown in peripheral tolerance that is partially controlled by peripheral tissue antigen (PTA) expression in lymph nodes. Here we show that the transcriptional regulator deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf1) controls PTA gene expression in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN). The expression of canonical <italic>Deaf1</italic> was reduced, while that of an alternatively spliced variant was increased during the onset of destructive insulitis in the PLN of NOD mice. An equivalent variant <italic>Deaf1</italic> isoform was identified in the PLN of T1D patients. Both NOD and human Deaf1 variant isoforms suppressed PTA expression by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of canonical Deaf1. Reduced PTA expression resulting from the alternative splicing of <italic>Deaf1</italic> may contribute to T1D pathogenesis.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P2">Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic Î²-cells by self-reactive T cells in genetically susceptible individuals due to a breakdown in central and/or peripheral tolerance. Central tolerance is enforced by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) that ectopically express a range of peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs) under the transcriptional control of the autoimmune regulator, <italic>Aire</italic>
<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Most maturing thymocytes that express T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for these PTAs are deleted, but some self-reactive T cells escape to the periphery where additional tolerance mechanisms are in place to protect tissues from autoimmune attack. In addition to regulatory T cells, peripheral tolerance can be mediated by lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) and extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), which present PTA peptides on MHC molecules and engage autoreactive PTA-specific T cells, ultimately leading to their clonal deletion<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The mechanism(s) that controls PTA expression in secondary lymphoid tissues are not completely understood.</p>
      <p id="P3">We previously compared the gene expression in tissues from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of T1D, to that of NOD.B10 mice, a congenic strain that does not develop disease<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. We found that the expression of the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf1) changed in parallel with the expression of genes encoding a number of islet-specific tissue antigens including insulin 1 (<italic>Ins1</italic>), insulin 2 (<italic>Ins2</italic>), glucagon (<italic>Gcg</italic>), pancreatitis-associated protein (<italic>Pap</italic>), pancreatic polypeptide (<italic>Ppy</italic>), and regenerating islet-derived alpha and gamma (<italic>Reg3a</italic> and <italic>Reg3g</italic>) in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN). The expression of <italic>Deaf1</italic> and genes encoding these islet-specific antigens was significantly downregulated in the PLN of NOD mice at the age of 12 weeks<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, a time coincident with the onset of destructive insulitis.</p>
      <p id="P4">In addition, we demonstrated that Deaf1 regulates the expression of certain PTA genes in lymph node stromal elements (LNSE). We found that <italic>Deaf1</italic> can be processed into at least two isoforms in the PLN of NOD mice: a canonical Deaf1 isoform that can translocate to the nucleus and is required for PTA expression, and a splice variant that is expressed in the cytoplasm and inhibits the transcriptional activity of canonical Deaf1. Remarkably, expression of a similar alternatively spliced Deaf1 isoform was significantly increased in the PLN of T1D patients.</p>

        <title><italic>Deaf1</italic> isoforms and PTA expression in the NOD PLN</title>
        <p id="P5">Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of various pancreatic genes and <italic>Deaf1</italic> change in parallel over time in the PLN of NOD mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Two probes (probe 1 and 2) that bind to <italic>Deaf1</italic> were present on the microarray, but only probe 1 revealed an expression profile similar to that of the pancreatic PTA genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Probe 1 hybridizes to a <italic>Deaf1</italic> region spanning exon 6 and 7, while probe 2 hybridizes to a region within exon 11 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The discordant expression profiles revealed by the two probes suggested that more than one <italic>Deaf1</italic> isoform might exist in the PLN, and that the relative expression of the two isoforms might change with age.</p>
        <p id="P6">PCR cloning and sequence analysis of <italic>Deaf1</italic> mRNA in PLN tissue identified the canonical mRNA (<italic>DF1</italic>; Genbank Accession FJ377319) as well as an alternatively spliced transcript containing an insertion between exons 6 and 7 (<italic>DF1-VAR1</italic>; Genbank Accession FJ377318; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) that results in disruption of the binding site of probe 1. Thus, changes in the expression of these two <italic>Deaf1</italic> isoforms could explain the discordant patterns of expression revealed by the two probes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">The microarray data (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) used a pool of PLN mRNA from 1.5 and 20 week old NOD.B10 mice as controls<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Next, we quantified <italic>DF1</italic> and <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> expression in NOD and NOD.B10 mice at various ages by quantitative PCR (QPCR) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2</xref>). The Taqman probe for <italic>DF1</italic> spans exons 6 and 7, at the intronic insertion site, and the <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> primer and probes were designed to hybridize within the intronic insertion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8"><italic>DF1</italic> and <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> expression did not differ between the PLN of NOD and NOD.B10 mice at 4 weeks of age (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). However, at 12 weeks, <italic>DF1</italic> mRNA expression was downregulated and <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> expression was upregulated specifically in the NOD PLN. In contrast, <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA expression did not differ between 12-week NOD vs. NOD.B10 PLN (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The changes in <italic>DF1</italic> and <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> gene expression appear specific to the PLN, as no significant change was observed in spleen tissues of 12-week old NOD and NOD.B10 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

        <title>Characterization of Deaf1 isoforms</title>
        <p id="P9">Canonical <italic>DF1</italic> contains an N-terminal alanine-rich region, the SAND and ZF-MYND domains, a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, and nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export sequences (NES). The <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> transcript contains part of intron 7, which introduces a premature stop codon that results in a truncated protein lacking part of the NLS as well as the HLH, NES and ZF-MYND domains. <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> also contains a 42 bp deletion in the alanine-rich region (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">DF1 is ~70 kDa and localized in the nucleus of HEK 293 cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). DF1-VAR1 is ~50 kDa and was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Interestingly, transient co-expression of DF1 with DF1-VAR1 resulted in nuclear localization of some DF1-VAR1, as revealed by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This finding was confirmed by immunoblot experiments (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation studies using Flag-tagged DF1 and V5 epitope tagged DF1-VAR1 demonstrate that DF1 and DF1-VAR1 can interact (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). These data suggest that the DF1 and DF1-VAR1 form hetero-dimeric complexes that can shuttle DF1-VAR1 into the nucleus using the NLS domain of DF1.</p>
        <p id="P11">The transcriptional activity of DF1 and DF1-VAR1 was examined using a 26 bp <italic>Deaf1</italic>-response element-luciferase reporter plasmid<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. When transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells, DF1-EGFP induced greater luciferase reporter activity than DF1-VAR1-EGFP (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). The lower transcriptional activity of DF1-VAR1 may be due to its cytoplasmic localization and reduced ability to translocate to the nucleus (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Co-transfection of DF1-VAR1 and DF1 resulted in substantially lower transcriptional activity than that of equivalent amounts of DF1 alone (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>

        <title>Analysis of Deaf1-deficient BALB/c mice</title>
        <p id="P12">To examine the genes that are regulated by Deaf1 in the PLN, whole genome microarrays were performed on <italic>Deaf1</italic>-deficient BALB/c PLN tissues. Approximately 300 genes were upregulated and 300 were downregulated by ~2.5 fold in <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice compared to BALB/c controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1 and 2</xref>). Interestingly, among the top 30 genes whose expression was downregulated in <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO PLN, almost three-quarters were considered potential PTAs with expression limited to â¤ 5 tissues; in contrast less than a quarter of the middle 30 genes, whose expression was not changed in the <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice, were expressed in â¤ 5 tissues (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The genes regulated by Deaf1 in the PLN did not appear to significantly overlap with genes regulated by Aire in eTACs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P13">Two Aire-regulated genes, <italic>Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb,</italic> were found among the top 20 downregulated genes in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice. <italic>Reg3g</italic> and <italic>Ppy</italic>, which encode pancreas-specific antigens, are also regulated by Aire in the thymus<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. To accurately measure the expression <italic>Reg3g, Ppy, Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb</italic> in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO and control mice, SYBR green QPCR assays were used. The specificity and amplification efficiencies of each assay were confirmed by RT-PCR, melting curve analysis and standard curves (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The expression of <italic>Reg3g, Ppy, Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb</italic> was significantly lower in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice than WT controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of these same genes was upregulated in the thymus of Deaf1-KO mice, possibly due to increased <italic>Aire</italic> mRNA expression in the thymus of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>); <italic>Aire</italic> mRNA quantities were not different in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO and control mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>Ins2</italic> mRNA in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO and BALB/c control mice was found to be 30 to 1700-fold lower than that of NOD and NOD.B10 mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), and thus was not detected in our microarray analysis.</p>
        <p id="P14">To determine if 30-week old <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice exhibited signs of autoimmunity, we looked for lymphocyte infiltration in various tissues and for the presence of autoantibodies. Lymphocyte infiltration was not detected in the pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, gut or kidney (data not shown). The serum of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice reacted with certain proteins (~15â25 kDa) in whole eye lysate (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), but not with lysates of any other tissues examined (brain, salivary gland, heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and gut). The autoantibodies in the <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO serum reacted with the outer segment layer of the retina, similar to autoantibodies in <italic>Aire</italic>-KO mice<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

        <title>Influence of <italic>Deaf1</italic> isoforms on PTA expression</title>
        <p id="P15">Next we silenced the expression of Deaf1 in NIH 3T3 cells, which express endogenous <italic>Deaf1</italic>, <italic>Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb,</italic> using siRNA to examine Deaf1-mediated regulation of these PTAs. <italic>Deaf1</italic> siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of DF1-Flag as well as endogenous <italic>Deaf1</italic> in NIH 3T3 cells, demonstrating the specificity of the <italic>Deaf1</italic> siRNA (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). <italic>Deaf1</italic> siRNA, compared to nonsense siRNA, also resulted in a significant suppression of <italic>Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb</italic> expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). However, over-expression of <italic>DF1</italic> in NIH 3T3 cells did not upregulate the expression of <italic>Fgb</italic>, and only slightly increased the expression of <italic>Ambp</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These data indicate that, while a decrease in DF1 expression can reduce PTA gene expression, an increase in DF1 expression alone may not be sufficient to enhance PTA gene expression. This conclusion is supported by data in the NOD PLN where decreased <italic>DF1</italic> and increased <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> expression in 12-week old NOD mice strongly correlated with significantly reduced PTA gene expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), whereas increased <italic>DF1</italic> expression detected in 20 week NOD PLN did not correlate with increased PTA gene expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">Next we sought to identify the cell type(s) in which changes in <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> expression occur in the 12-week NOD PLN. We found that <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> expression was approximately 7-fold and 10-fold higher in LNSEs from 12 week old NOD PLN than in T cells and B cells from the same mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Silencing of Deaf1 in immortalized lymph node CD45<sup>â</sup> cells from pooled lymph nodes of BALB/c mice resulted in a decrease in <italic>Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> in these cells reduced <italic>Ambp</italic> and <italic>Fgb</italic> expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Although overexpression of <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> did not alter the expression of <italic>DF1</italic> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), we propose that it interfered with the transcriptional activity of DF1 by interacting with and retaining it in the cytoplasm. Supporting this hypothesis, immunoblot experiments performed with nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of HEK 293 cells transfected with <italic>DF1-Flag</italic> and/or <italic>DF1-VAR1-EGFP</italic> showed that the amount of cytoplasmic DF1 was higher and the amount of nuclear DF1 was lower in cells transfected with both DF1-VAR1 and DF1 compared to cells transfected with DF1 alone (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). These data suggest that DF1-VAR1 can reduce PTA gene expression by interacting with and retaining DF1 in the cytoplasm.</p>

        <title>Alternatively spliced human Deaf1 variant</title>
        <p id="P17">To examine if an alternatively spliced variant of <italic>DEAF1</italic> is expressed in human PLN, RT-PCR was performed with human PLN cDNA as a template and primers that span the start and stop codons of the human <italic>DEAF1</italic> gene (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These primers amplified the canonical human <italic>DEAF1</italic> transcript (<italic>Hu-DF1</italic>; Genbank Accession No. BC053322), as well as an alternatively spliced variant (<italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic>; Genbank Accession No. FJ985253) that lacks exons 5 and 7 and the first nucleotide of exon 6. This variant transcript also contains an intronic 42 bp insertion between exons 10 and 11 that is expressed âin-frameâ from the start to stop codons, and contains intact SAND and MYND domains, but lacks the NLS domain encoded by exon 7 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">Characterization of the <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> isoform revealed a number of similarities with the mouse <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> isoform. <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>) and did not mediate transcriptional activation of the 26 bp <italic>Deaf1</italic> response element (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). This variant interacted with canonical Hu-DF1 and altered its distribution within the cell. When expressed alone, Hu-DF1 localized almost exclusively in the nucleus (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b, d</xref>), but when co-expressed with Hu-DF1-VAR its nuclear and cytoplasmic expression decreased by ~3-fold and increased by ~4-fold, respectively. On the other hand, co-expression of the two isoforms enhanced the nuclear localization of Hu-DF1-VAR (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P19">To examine if the alternatively spliced isoform of <italic>DEAF1</italic> is upregulated in the PLN during T1D, QPCR was performed using primers that span the two deletion sites of the <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> transcript (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Expression of <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> was ~20 fold higher in the PLN of T1D patients than in healthy controls (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>). This finding strongly correlated with the lack of <italic>INS</italic> expression observed in the PLN of all T1D patients studied (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic>INS</italic> expression was detected in 4 of 5 of the control PLN, and in the spleen of all samples. The spleen samples expressed either no <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> or <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> amounts comparable to those detected in the control PLN (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that during the progression of human T1D, <italic>DEAF1</italic> is alternatively spliced to produce a nonfunctional variant similar to mouse DF1-VAR1. The Hu-DF1-VAR isoform interacts with and inhibits the transcriptional activity of canonical Hu-DF1 by retaining it in the cytoplasm.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P20">T1D develops from a breakdown in central or peripheral tolerance that is partially controlled by PTA expression in the thymus and lymph nodes, respectively. Here we demonstrate that Deaf1 plays a role in regulating PTA gene expression in peripheral lymphoid tissues. We found that the transcriptional activity of Deaf1 can be inhibited by alternatively spliced variants of Deaf1, and that the expression of these splice variants was significantly higher in the PLN of T1D patients and 12 week old NOD mice than in controls. These findings suggest that alternative splicing of <italic>Deaf1</italic> could play a key role in the pathogenesis of T1D and NOD disease.</p>
      <p id="P21">The age of 12 weeks is pivotal in the progression of NOD disease, as infiltrative insulitis and Î²-cell destruction begins at this age<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Peripheral tolerance to certain PTAs is facilitated in the lymph nodes through the ectopic expression of PTA genes in stromal cells<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, and defects in peripheral tolerance may induce infiltrative insulitis. The expression of genes encoding various pancreatic PTAs is diminished in the PLN of NOD mice at 12 weeks of age<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. This coincides with a downregulation of <italic>DF1</italic> and upregulation of <italic>DF1-VAR1</italic> gene expression. Since DF1-VAR1 inhibits PTA gene expression and interferes with the transcriptional activity of DF1, a change in Deaf1 isoform expression may result in decreased PTA expression in 12 week old NOD PLN and reduced tolerance to these antigens.</p>
      <p id="P22">Due to the obvious practical difficulties in obtaining human PLN tissues from pre-diabetic individuals as well as those at disease onset, we could not assess the expression of <italic>Hu-DF1</italic> and <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> throughout all stages in the natural history of T1D. In the one pre-diabetic PLN sample we obtained, <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> expression was higher than in the PLN of all the healthy control samples examined. Interestingly, the increased expression of <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> and absence of <italic>INS</italic> in the PLN appeared to be maintained well after the onset of T1D.</p>
      <p id="P23">Increased expression of the Deaf1 variant can inhibit the transcriptional activity of canonical Deaf1 by forming hetero-dimeric complexes that retain the canonical isoform in the cytoplasm. Both DF1-VAR1 and Hu-DF1-VAR lack the NLS domain that is required for nuclear localization and activation of gene transcription<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, and both induced minimal transcriptional activity of the 26-bp Deaf1 response element compared to that induced by DF1 and Hu-DF1. The canonical isoform of Deaf1 is structurally similar to Aire, which also contains a SAND domain and can induce PTA gene expression by interacting with modified and unmodified histone H3 via its PHD-ZF domain<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. We suggest that Deaf1, rather than Aire, plays a role in controlling PTA expression in the PLN. Deaf1 may regulate PTA expression in a manner analogous to Aire since both proteins contain similar functional domains: Deaf1 contains a C-terminal ZF-MYND domain that is structurally similar to the PHD-ZF, as well as a SAND domain that functions as a DNA binding domain for chromatin-dependent transcription and a site for protein-protein interaction<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. However, the effect of Deaf1 function may be cell-dependent. For example, Deaf1 represses and enhances promoter activity of the 5-HT1A receptor in presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, respectively<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In addition, some genes were upregulated while others were downregulated in <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice, suggesting that Deaf1 may interact with cell-specific regulatory factors to either stimulate or suppress gene transcription. The requirement for additional factors may explain why overexpression of DF1 did not significantly increase PTA gene expression in NIH 3T3 cells, and why changes in PTA gene expression in PLN tissue did not necessarily correlate with increased DF1 expression.</p>
      <p id="P24">BALB/c mice, in which <italic>Deaf1</italic> was knocked out, did not manifest an obvious autoimmune phenotype. However, like Aire-KO mice, the serum of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice contained auto-antibodies that were immunoreactive against proteins in the retina of the eye<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Interestingly, our microarray data showed that the most downregulated gene in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice is <italic>dopachrome tautomerase</italic> (<italic>Dct</italic>), which encodes a protein that is expressed exclusively in the retina. In addition, three other genes among the top 30 genes that were downregulated in the PLN of Deaf1 mice (<italic>1500016O10Rik</italic>, <italic>Si</italic>, and <italic>Sgne1</italic>) are expressed in the retina. The control of retinal antigen expression by Deaf1 may be of particular significance, as reduced antigen presentation in eye-draining lymph nodes prevents autoreactive T cell deletion and contributes to the development of retinal autoimmunity<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P25">Variations in thymic PTA gene expression can influence susceptibility to autoimmune disease<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. The expression of genes encoding certain PTAs was reduced in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1-</italic>KO mice, while surprisingly, the expression the same genes and of <italic>Aire</italic> was increased in the thymus of the <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice. This suggests the possibility that enhanced central tolerance mechanisms, mediated by increased Aire-regulated expression of PTAs in the thymus, may result in the lack of overt autoimmunity in the <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice. Strain-dependent variations in the thymic expression of genes encoding certain PTAs, such as the uveitogenic retinal antigen interphotoreceptor retinoid binding promoter (IRBP), have been observed<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Previous studies have also shown that the severity of the autoimmune phenotype of Aire-knockout mice depends on the genetic background. Aire-deficient mice developed severe exocrine pancreatitis in NOD but not in C57BL/6 or BALB/c backgrounds<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, while autoimmune gastritis and auto-antibodies against Mucin-6 developed in Aire-deficient mice in NOD and BALB/c backgrounds, but not in the C57BL/6 background<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. The phenotype of the <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO is also strain-specific. In the C57BL/6 background, <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice suffered from various developmental defects that were not observed in BALB/c <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P26"><italic>Ambp, Fgb, Ppy</italic> and <italic>Reg3g</italic> were downregulated in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice, and we selected these genes for further study based on their regulation by Aire in the thymus<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and reduced expression in the PLN of 12 week old NOD mice. In mTECs and LNSCs, PTAs are expressed in low amounts. For example, PTA expression in lymph nodes was assessed using the iFABP-tOVA transgenic mouse model, where OVA (ovalbumin) represents a self-antigen expressed under the control of the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) promoter<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. OVA mRNA expression was detected in lymph nodes by RT-PCR, but OVA protein was not detected by immunoblotting. Similarly, PTA expression is low in the thymus, as only a small subset of mTECs ectopically express Aire and PTAs<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P27">In humans, <italic>INS</italic> was not detected in the PLN of T1D patients, but was expressed in the PLN of healthy individuals and spleens of both control and T1D samples. The lack of <italic>INS</italic> expression correlated well with the high expression of <italic>Hu-DF1-VAR</italic> expressed in the PLN of T1D patients. In 12-week old NOD PLN, <italic>Ins2</italic> gene expression was also reduced, but we could not detect a difference in <italic>Ins2</italic> mRNA expression in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice compared to BALB/c control mice. This may be due to the significantly lower expression of <italic>Ins2</italic> mRNA in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO and BALB/c control mice (30 to 1700-fold lower) compared to that of NOD and NOD.B10 mice.</p>
      <p id="P28">Members of the Reg family have been described as autoantigens in T1D, and the inflammation-induced upregulation of <italic>Reg</italic> expression in islets was suggested to contribute to the premature onset of diabetes<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. We showed that <italic>Reg3g</italic> expression was downregulated in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice and 12-week old NOD mice, but were unable to determine if Deaf1 directly regulated <italic>Reg3g</italic> expression since the NIH 3T3 and LN CD45<sup>-</sup> cell lines that we used for the siRNA experiments did not express measureable amounts of <italic>Reg3g</italic>. A loss of endogenous PTA gene expression has been shown to occur in cultured mTEC<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and LNSC lines (unpublished data). Thus, future experiments involving monoclonal antibodies to DF1-VAR1 and/or in situ hybridization studies of primary lymph node stromal elements derived from the PLN of NOD and NOD.B10 mice may be necessary to identify the actual stromal cell that expresses the variant Deaf1 isoforms and to determine the direct role of Deaf1 in the expression of PTA genes.</p>
      <p id="P29">While the expression of <italic>Ambp, Fgb, Ppy,</italic> and <italic>Reg3g</italic> is regulated by Aire in the thymus, the expression of these genes in the PLN is more likely regulated by Deaf1. <italic>Aire</italic> expression was not altered in the PLN of <italic>Deaf1</italic>-KO mice or NOD mice, and most of the PTAs regulated by Aire in eTACs appear to be distinct from those regulated by Deaf1 in the PLN.</p>
      <p id="P30">Our study suggests that Deaf1 promotes the ectopic expression of genes encoding PTAs in the PLN, and PTA expression in LNSCs can mediate peripheral tolerance<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Thus, fine-tuning of peripheral tolerance, at least in the PLN, may occur through alternative splicing of <italic>Deaf1</italic>. Alternative splicing is a mechanism that is often used to control immune responses. However, variations in splicing can impair immune function and contribute to various autoimmune diseases<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. It is unclear how splicing of <italic>Deaf1</italic> is controlled, but inflammation of the NOD PLN may be involved since various inflammatory cytokines have been shown to induce alternative splicing<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Differences in <italic>Deaf1</italic> splicing in NOD vs. NOD.B10 mice may also be due to other genes within the <italic>Idd1</italic> susceptibility region, a MHC congenic interval that distinguishes the two strains. Allelic variation of such genes or differences in their regulatory regions may influence their expression or function, which may be associated with splicing events.</p>
      <p id="P31">We propose that during the progression of T1D and NOD disease, alternative splicing of <italic>Deaf1</italic> occurs in the PLN. The alternatively spliced Deaf1 variant interacts with and retains the canonical isoform in the cytoplasm and inhibits PTA gene expression. Decreased expression of pancreatic antigens in the PLN may impair peripheral tolerance and lead to the survival of autoreactive T cells specific for these antigens. Thus, we suggest that differences in the expression of Deaf1 isoforms in the PLN of humans with T1D and NOD mice may contribute to the development of this disease.</p>
