        <p id="P3">Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) is critical for survival and genome stability of individual cells and organisms, but also contributes to the genetic diversity of species. A critical step in HR is MRN/CtIP-dependent end-resection that generates the 3â² single-stranded DNA overhangs required for the subsequent strand exchange reaction. Here, we identify EXD2 (EXDL2) as an exonuclease essential for DSB resection and efficient HR. EXD2 is recruited to chromatin in a damage-dependent manner and confers resistance to DSB-inducing agents. EXD2 functionally interacts with the MRN-complex to accelerate resection via its 3â²-5â² exonuclease activity that efficiently processes dsDNA substrates containing nicks. Finally, we establish that EXD2 stimulates both short and long-range DSB resection, and thus together with MRE11 is required for efficient HR. This establishes a key role for EXD2 in controlling the initial steps of chromosomal break repair.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P4">DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely cytotoxic lesions that can arise during normal cellular processes or are induced by exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation as well as many commonly used anti-cancer drugs. The faithful repair of DSBs is essential for cell survival and organismal development, as defective repair can contribute to a plethora of inherited human syndromes with life-threatening symptoms including cancer, neurodegeneration or premature aging <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The two major pathways involved in the repair of DSBs in eukaryotic cells are non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination (HR) <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. A key initial step in HR is resection of the DNA ends on either side of the break, which is carried out initially by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex (MRN) and CtIP to generate short stretches of ssDNA<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the EXO1 or DNA2 nucleases, in conjunction with the Bloomâs Syndrome helicase (BLM) extend these to generate longer 3â² ssDNA tails <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These ssDNA strands are then bound by replication protein A (RPA) <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> which is subsequently replaced by RAD51 in a BRCA2-dependent manner, leading to the formation of ssDNA-RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments essential for the strand exchange process <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro,</italic> MRE11 displays a weak endo- and exonuclease activity, which may be due to the lack of accessory factors <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Accordingly, work from multiple laboratories has shown that CtIP, or its yeast homologue Sae2, can stimulate MRE11âs endonuclease activity <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, MRE11 has been also shown to nick the DNA strand to be resected in multiple positions, as far as 300bp from the break itself, suggesting that resection could proceed from several entry points that are distal to the DSB <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear whether this would enhance MRE11-dependent nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, thus generating a better substrate for subsequent processing of the break by BLM-DNA2 and/or BLM-EXO1 complexes; or allow access for additional factors accelerating the initial strand processing. Indeed, the inhibition of MRE11âs endonuclease activity confers a stronger resection defect than inhibition of its exonuclease activity, suggesting perhaps that initial break processing might be also carried out by other exonucleases <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Here we identify EXD2 as a cofactor of the MRN complex required for efficient DNA end-resection, recruitment of RPA, homologous recombination and suppression of genome instability.</p>

      <title>EXD2 is required for repair of damage to DNA</title>
      <p id="P5">In an effort to identify factors required to promote HR, we carried out an unbiased proteomic approach to define the CtIP interactome. Here, we have identified EXD2, a largely uncharacterized protein with a putative exonuclease domain, as a candidate CtIP binding partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We validated this interaction by co-immunoprecipitations from human cell extracts and found that we could readily detect endogenous EXD2 by western blotting of GFP-CtIP immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Endogenous CtIP, as well as its known interactors MRE11 and BRCA1 were detected in a reciprocal FLAG-EXD2 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>; lysates were treated with benzonase to prevent DNA bridging). Therefore, we conclude that the two proteins likely exist in the same complex in cells.</p>
      <p id="P6">EXD2 is highly conserved across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) and was recently identified in the screen for suppression of sensitivity to mitomycin C <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. However, the biological and biochemical features of this protein are unknown. Since we identified EXD2 as an interactor of DBS-repair factors we tested its requirement in response to a range of DSBs-inducing agents namely, ionizing radiation (IR), campthotecin (CPT) and phleomycin. We found that depletion of EXD2 by two different siRNAs sensitized U2OS cells to these agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a and b</xref>). Taken together these results suggest a putative role for this protein in the repair of damaged DNA.</p>

      <title>EXD2 promotes DNA end resection and the generation of ssDNA</title>
      <p id="P7">CtIP is essential for efficient DNA end processing during DSB repair, with cells depleted for this factor showing a defect in the generation of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the subsequent formation of RPA foci <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Thus we hypothesized that EXD2 may promote DNA end resection. To test this, we analysed RPA focus formation in response to both CPT and IR in WT and EXD2-depleted cells. Strikingly, cells depleted for EXD2 showed severely impaired kinetics of RPA focus formation in response to both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2c and d</xref>). RPA2 phosphorylation at S4 and S8 has been widely used as a marker for the generation of single-stranded DNA by DNA-end resection <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with the data above, EXD2 depleted cells showed impaired RPA S4/S8 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). Treatment with both agents resulted in a robust phosphorylation of histone H2AX and CHK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>), confirming induction of DNA damage in cells. Moreover, since these responses were intact in EXD2-depleted cells, EXD2 is most likely not required for initial sensing of the DNA damage. Failure to generate RPA foci could be associated with either a defect in exonucleolytic processing of the DSB into ssDNA, or with impaired recruitment of RPA itself to ssDNA. To distinguish between these two possibilities we tested the efficiency of ssDNA generation in EXD2-depleted cells exposed to DNA damage. To this end, we labelled cells with BrdU and then employed immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-BrdU antibody under non-denaturing conditions to detect stretches of ssDNA. Depletion of EXD2 significantly reduced formation of ssDNA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d and e</xref>) suggesting impaired resection. This is reminiscent of the phenotype observed in cells depleted for essential components of DNA end resection machinery, such as MRE11 or CtIP <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Importantly, these phenotypes were not due to changes in the cell cycle, as EXD2-depletion had little effect on the overall cell-cycle distribution profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Despite multiple attempts, we were unable to visualise EXD2 recruitment to DNA damage foci. In this regard, we note that certain other proteins involved in DNA repair do not readily form cytologically discernible foci in mammalian cells i.e. Ku70, Ku80 or DNA2. However, EXD2 was recruited to chromatin in HeLa cells upon DNA damage as assayed by subcellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), supporting its putative role in the processing of DSBs. A similar recruitment was also observed for the key resection factor MRE11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that EXD2 is a putative component of the resection machinery required for the efficient processing of DSBs.</p>

      <p id="P8"><italic>In vivo</italic>, RPA is required for RAD51 focus formation and <italic>in vitro</italic> it has been shown to promote RAD51-mediated strand exchange <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, treatment of U2OS cells with IR generated large numbers of RAD51 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). In contrast, EXD2 depletion significantly impaired RAD51 focus formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament formation is a crucial step in DSB repair by HR <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. To examine if EXD2 is also required for efficient HR we used a U2OS cell line carrying an integrated homologous recombination reporter transgene and an I-SceI recognition sequence <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Transient expression of I-SceI endonuclease generates a DSB that, when repaired by HR, restores the expression of a functional GFP protein. We found that depletion of EXD2 significantly decreased the frequency of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Cells defective in HR are intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Accordingly, EXD2-depletion sensitised cells to the PARP inhibitor olaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Failure to efficiently repair damaged DNA is associated with chromosomal instability and in line with this, we found a significantly greater number of chromosomal aberrations in EXD2-depleted U2OS cells as compared to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Taken together this data supports a role of EXD2 in promoting homologous recombination and genome stability.</p>

      <title>EXD2âs exonuclease activity facilitates the generation of ssDNA</title>
      <p id="P9">The MRN complex processes DSBs to generate ssDNA, which requires MRE11âs 3â²-5â² exonuclease activity <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, EXD2 has a predicted exonuclease fold, which has sequence homology to the 3â²-5â² exonuclease domain of the Werner syndrome protein (WRN). Analysis of the alignment between EXD2 and WRN identified two key amino acids (D108 and E110) within the putative exonuclease domain of EXD2, which are also highly conserved in other DnaQ type exonucleases, including WRN, that coordinate the binding of metal ions within the active site <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Mutation of the equivalent residues in WRN (D82 and E84) renders the protein devoid of nuclease activity <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the equivalent residues in EXD2 may be also required for its putative nuclease activity. To test this, we expressed the full length GST-tagged EXD2 and the D108A and E110A mutant protein in bacteria, and purified them to apparent homogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Next, we tested the activity of these purified proteins on single stranded DNA radiolabeled on the 3â² or 5â² end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a and b</xref>). We found that purified EXD2, but not the D108A and E110A mutant, exhibited a robust nuclease activity on short 5â² labeled ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, a time course of the 3â² labelled substrate digestion indicates that EXD2 degrades the labelled DNA strand from the 3â² end, as evidenced by the release of the single labelled nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This data shows that EXD2 displays a 3â²-5â² exonuclease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, under these conditions the WT protein exhibited only weak activity towards blunt end double stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). To verify this data, we also identified a highly-soluble truncated form of EXD2 (spanning residues lysine 76 through to valine 564, containing the predicted exonuclease domain) that can be produced at very high yields and purity in a three-step procedure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3c-e</xref>). This version of EXD2, and its D108A E110A variant, behaved indistinguishably from full-length EXD2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). In addition, the protein showed only a weak activity towards dsDNA with resected 3âend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), and did not display any endonuclease activity on ssDNA or dsDNA with biotin/streptavidin blocked 3â² end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Importantly, purified EXD2 displayed a robust exonuclease activity, which co-elutes with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus our data identify EXD2 as a <italic>bone fide</italic> exonuclease with a 3â²-5â² polarity.</p>
      <p id="P10">To address the potential biological significance of EXD2âs exonuclease activity, we tested whether this activity was required to promote DNA-end resection <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we examined the phenotypes of two independently derived U2OS clones stably expressing wild-type or the nuclease-dead (D108A and E110A) EXD2 mutant. The endogenous protein was depleted with siRNA targeting the 3â² un-translated region (UTR) of EXD2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Notably, cells expressing the nuclease-dead protein did not correct phenotypes associated with EXD2 deficiency as compared to cells expressing wild-type EXD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-d</xref>). This result is consistent with our data showing a requirement for EXD2 in the processing of DSBs into ssDNA. Cells overexpressing WT EXD2 displayed elevated resection. In this regard we note that overexpression of WT MRE11 also increases resection efficiency resulting in elevated levels of RPA foci formation and RPA phosphorylation <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.</p>

We found that combined depletion resulted in a comparable inhibition of resection as observed for depletion of MRE11 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). A similar relationship was also observed for RAD51 foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4b and c</xref>). Interestingly, the defect observed in EXD2-depleted cells was slightly weaker than that observed in MRE11 alone, suggesting that MRE11 functions upstream of EXD2 in DNA resection, perhaps initiating resection through its endonuclease activity. Indeed, it has been suggested recently that MRE11 may create multiple nicks on the strand being resected that could serve as additional exonuclease entry sites to further enhance nucleolytic processing <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We tested this notion in several ways. First, we analysed if MRN-dependent DNA resection is accelerated in the presence of EXD2. Purified EXD2 and the MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1) were incubated together with circular single-stranded PhiX174 DNA. This substrate requires initial endonuclease-dependent nicking by the MRN complex in order to undergo resection. As previously reported, the MRN complex exhibited nuclease activity under these conditions <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Importantly, combining EXD2 with the MRN complex resulted in increased ssDNA degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b and c</xref>). As expected, addition of exonuclease-dead EXD2 protein to the MRN complex resulted in DNA degradation similar to what we observed for MRN alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b and c</xref>). Secondly, we predicted that EXD2 should be able to initiate resection from a nicked and a gapped duplex substrate designed to mimic the substrates generated by MRE11 endonuclease activity during the initial stage of DNA-end resection. Strikingly, EXD2 exhibited robust exonuclease activity on both the nicked and gapped substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d, e and f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4d and e</xref>). Taken together, these data show that EXD2 functionally collaborate with the MRN complex in promoting DNA degradation.</p>
      <p id="P12">To gain more functional insight into the role of EXD2âs exonuclease activity in DNA-end resection <italic>in vivo,</italic> we took advantage of the recently developed small molecule inhibitors targeting the exo- or endonuclease activity of MRE11 <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Inhibition of MRE11 endonuclease activity resulted in almost total inhibition of resection, whereas cells treated with the MRE11 exonuclease inhibitor showed milder resection defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>) as reported previously <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Knockdown of EXD2 alone resulted in a resection defect significantly stronger (p&lt;0.0001) than the one observed in cells treated with the MRE11 exonuclease inhibitor alone. Depletion of EXD2 in the presence of the MRE11 exonuclease inhibitor did not decrease efficiency of resection further than what was achieved with EXD2 depletion alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Interestingly, some residual resection was still observed in cells concomitantly depleted for EXD2 and incubated with the MRE11 exonuclease inhibitor, indicating either an involvement of another exonuclease in this step of DNA-end processing <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or that EXD2 knockdown or MRE11 exonuclease inhibition was not complete. Nevertheless, this data suggests that both the exonuclease activity of EXD2 and that of MRE11 function within the same pathway and are required for efficient DNA end-resection. Knockdown of EXD2 in cells treated with an inhibitor targeting MRE11âs endonuclease activity showed a similar resection defect when compared to the inhibitor alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>), supporting the notion that EXD2 functions downstream of MRE11âs endonuclease activity.</p>
      <p id="P13">Next, we asked which part of the resection process i.e. short-range vs. long-range resection is affected in cells depleted for EXD2. To test this, we depleted EXD2 in a cell line allowing for the induction of a DSB in a specific genomic locus <italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Then we analysed the efficiency of DNA resection at this DSB by q-PCR at two positions: one located close to the break (335bp downstream of the break - short range resection) and the other located at 1618bp from the break (long range resection) <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that EXD2-depletion affected both short range as well as long-range resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). Knockdown of MRE11 resulted in a similar albeit stronger resection phenotype thus providing further evidence to support its upstream function in this process. Importantly, concomitant depletion of both proteins did not further potentiate the resection defect.</p>
      <p id="P14">Given that both EXD2 and MRE11 regulate DSB resection, we tested the effect of their combined depletion on homologous recombination using the DR-GFP assay. In support of their role in this process, we observed that combined depletion of EXD2 and MRE11 did not decrease homologous recombination efficiency further than what we observed in the single knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P15">These findings therefore show that EXD2 promotes DNA end resection and homologous recombination by enhancing the generation of ssDNA through a common mechanism with the MRN complex. Furthermore, it seems likely that MRE11 functions upstream of EXD2 in this process, likely initiating resection through its endonuclease activity.</p>
      <p id="P16">To verify and extend the above conclusions, we used CRISPR-Cas9 nickase based gene editing <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> in HeLa cells to generate <italic>EXD2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The use of Cas9 nickase has been recently shown to minimize any off-target effects <sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Comparable to siRNA treated U2OS cells, <italic>EXD2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> HeLa cells showed dramatically decreased RPA focus formation in response to CPT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5b and c</xref>), diminished RPA2 phosphorylation on S4/S8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>) and decreased survival in response to CPT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). We also tested if EXD2 depletion affects the MRE11 or CtIP protein stability and/or their recruitment to DSBs. We found this not to be the case, as cells lacking EXD2 had similar level of endogenous MRE11 or CtIP as the WT control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>). Likewise, MRE11 or GFP-CtIP localization to DSBs induced by microirradiation <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 6a, b and c</xref>). These finding therefore establish EXD2 as an important regulator of DSBs resection.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P17">We have shown that EXD2 facilitates DSB resection thus promoting recruitment of RPA and homologous recombination. Accordingly, cells depleted for EXD2 show spontaneous chromosomal instability and are sensitive to DNA damage induced by agents that generate DSBs. Furthermore, we establish that EXD2 functionally interacts with the MRN complex utilizing its 3â²-5â² exonuclease activity to accelerate DSB resection and promote efficient HR. In line with this, complementation experiments showed that exonuclease-dead mutant protein failed to complement these phenotypes. Interestingly, EXD2 seems to be dispensable for the initial sensing of the break as evidenced by efficient Î³H2AX and CHK2 phosphorylation, and most likely acts downstream of MRE11. Finally we reveal that both, EXD2 and MRE11 function in the same pathway for DSB resection and HR. It is unclear at present why cells would need two exonucleases with the same polarity. However, a paradigm for such a requirement is evident from the fact that cells have two alternate machineries, consisting of BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN that carry out long-range resection<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Thus, by analogy EXD2 may function together with MRE11 to accelerate resection in the 3â²-5â² direction in order to efficiently produce short 3â² ssDNA overhangs. This could promote faster generation of longer stretches of ssDNA, which in turn may serve as a better substrate for BLMâDNA2 or BLM-EXO1 to initiate long-range resection. Accordingly, depletion of EXD2 adversely impacts on this process. Ultimately, efficient generation of ssDNA with minimal homology length required for productive HR would supress unscheduled deleterious recombination events. This may be particularly important in vertebrates, as they require significantly longer stretches of ssDNA (200-500 bp) to initiate productive HR <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, which is in contrast to yeast, where as little as 60 bp of 3â² ssDNA is sufficient to support HR <sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Not mutually exclusive is the possibility that EXD2 could also augment resection efficiency under specific circumstances, for instance in the presence of modifications to the damaged DNA and/or polypeptides bound at the 5â² ends. In line with this, we show that <italic>in vivo</italic> EXD2 depletion impairs short-range resection. Recently, it has been proposed that MRE11 may create multiple incisions on the DNA strand undergoing resection up to 300 bp distal to the break, which could allow for more efficient resection <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Indeed, inhibition of MRE11âs endonuclease activity seems to be dominant in promoting the generation of ssDNA over its exonuclease activity <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Thus, we postulate a model whereby EXD2 functionally collaborates with the resection machinery, most likely utilizing DNA nicks generated by MRE11âs endonuclease activity 3â² of the DSB. This would enhance the generation of ssDNA tails required for efficient homologous recombination (model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P18">In summary, our work identifies EXD2 as a critical factor in the maintenance of genome stability through homologous recombination dependent repair of DSBs, including those induced by commonly used anti-cancer agents, such as IR or CPT. This highlights EXD2 itself and/or its enzymatic activity as a potential candidate for development of anti-cancer drugs.</p>

Briefly ER-AsiSI U2OS cells were treated with 300 nM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Sigma) for 1 hour to allow the AsiSI enzyme to enter the nucleus and induce DSBs. Cells were then harvested and genomic DNA was extracted as previously described <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Genomic DNA was then digested with the BsrGI enzyme or mock digested and was used as a template for qPCR performed using iTaq Universal Sybr Green Mix (Bio-Rad) and Rotor-Gene (Corbett Research) qPCR system. Primers used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 4</xref>

        <p>c) ER-AsiSI U2OS cells were treated with 300 nM 4-OHT for 1 h, genomic DNA was extracted and digested or mock digested with BsrGI overnight. DNA-end resection adjacent to the DSB was measured by qPCR. The percentage of ssDNA was calculated and related to the siControl treated sample, which was set as 100%. Bars represent mean values +/â SEM (<italic>n</italic>= 5 independent experiments). Studentâs t-test was used to determine statistical significance.</p>
        <p>d) Quantification of the relative efficiency of HR in U2OS cells carrying the DR-GFP reporter construct with concomitant depletion of EXD2 and MRE11 by siRNA following transient expression of the I-SceI enzyme (see Methods and text for details). Efficiency of HR was measured by FACS and all knockdowns compared to siControl (normalized to 100%). Data represents the mean +/â SEM (<italic>n</italic>= 3 independent experiments). Studentâs t-test was employed to determine statistical significance.</p>
        <p><bold>e)</bold> Schematic model of EXD2âs putative role in DNA-end resection. DSB induction leads to recruitment of MRE11, whose endonuclease activity results in nicking of the DNA strand proximal to the DSB. EXD2 can then process this substrate, either alone or in conjunction with the MRN complex, thereby promoting DNA-end resection.</p>
