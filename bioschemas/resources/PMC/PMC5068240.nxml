        <p>In two complementary papers, Casanova, Malissen, and collaborators report the discovery of human RLTPR deficiency, the first primary immunodeficiency of the human CD28 pathway in T cells. Together, the two studies elucidate the largely (but not completely) overlapping roles of RLTPR in CD28 signaling in T and B cells of humans and mice.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The RLTPR cytosolic protein, also known as CARMIL2, is essential for CD28 co-stimulation in mice, but its importance in human T cells and mode of action remain elusive. Here, using affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we showed that RLTPR acts as a scaffold, bridging CD28 to the CARD11/CARMA1 cytosolic adaptor and to the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, and identified proteins not found before within the CD28 signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that RLTPR is essential for CD28 co-stimulation in human T cells and that its noncanonical pleckstrin-homology domain, leucine-rich repeat domain, and proline-rich region were mandatory for that task. Although RLTPR is thought to function as an actin-uncapping protein, this property was dispensable for CD28 co-stimulation in both mouse and human. Our findings suggest that the scaffolding role of RLTPR predominates during CD28 co-stimulation and underpins the similar function of RLTPR in human and mouse T cells. Along that line, the lack of functional RLTPR molecules impeded the differentiation toward Th1 and Th17 fates of both human and mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. RLTPR was also expressed in both human and mouse B cells. In the mouse, RLTPR did not play, however, any detectable role in BCR-mediated signaling and T cell-independent B cell responses.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>In the two-signal model of T cell activation, the first signal is delivered via the TCR after recognition of antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules, and the second signal provided by the CD28 co-stimulator after it binds to CD80 or CD86 on APCs. By acting in synergy, the TCR and CD28 trigger the association of the cytosolic adaptor CARMA1 (also known as CARD11) with BCL10 and MALT1 to form the CBM complex (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Thome et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jiang and Lin, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The CBM complex serves as a signaling scaffold permitting the assembly of an active I-ÎºB kinase complex that in turn stimulates the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.</p>
      <p>Using an <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosurea-mutagenesis screen, we identified a mutation in the mouse <italic>Rltpr</italic> gene (denoted as <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas</sup></italic>) and we demonstrated that its product is essential for co-stimulation via CD28 and as a result critical for the development and homeostasis of regulatory T cells (T reg cells; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Rltpr</italic> is also known as <italic>Lrrc16c</italic> (<italic>Carmil2</italic>), and in mammals it has two paralogs denoted as <italic>Lrrc16a</italic> (<italic>Carmil1</italic>) and <italic>Lrrc16b</italic> (<italic>Carmil3</italic>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2009</xref>). The three members of the LRRC16 family are large (â¼1,400 aa) multidomain cytosolic proteins with a high degree of sequence similarity (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zwolak et al., 2013</xref>). They comprise an N-terminal noncanonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a homodimerization domain (HD; as demonstrated in the case of LRRC16A), and an extended C terminus that contains a capping protein (CP) interaction (CPI) motif and a proline-rich region (PRR; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zwolak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). In their free form, CPs bind tightly to the barbed end of actin filaments and block the addition of actin subunits. After binding to CPI motif, the affinity of CP for actin filaments decreases. Therefore, by uncapping actin filaments, the members of the LRRC16 family are thought to enhance actin polymerization and play a role in endocytosis, phagocytosis, and the control of cell shape and movement (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fujiwara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez-Valladares et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that RLTPR went unnoticed until recently is likely a result of its very low abundance (2.6 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> copies per T cell; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
      <p>Glass-supported planar bilayers containing mobile antigenic peptideâMHC complexes and CD80 molecules allow imaging of the immunological synapse that forms at the T cellâplanar bilayer interface. Small TCR and CD28 clusters called microclusters nucleate immediately after T cells attach to the planar bilayer and then, driven by a centripetal flow of F-actin, form a central supramolecular activation complex (cSMAC; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Yokosuka and Saito, 2010</xref>). The <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas</sup></italic> mutation affects neither the generation of TCR and CD28 microclusters nor their translocation to the cSMAC in response to antigen stimulation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). RLTPR and RLTPR<sup>bas</sup> molecules also form microclusters at the immunological synapse in a CD80-dependent manner, and they co-migrate with CD28 microclusters. Remarkably, the <italic>Rltpr</italic><sup>bas</sup> mutation abrogated the ability of CD28-RLTPR microclusters to nucleate the accumulation of CARMA1 at the cSMAC, suggesting that RLTPR is essential for co-stimulation via CD28 in that it couples CD28 to CARMA1.</p>
      <p>Here, we combined affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis and mouse functional genomics to determine the mode of action of RLTPR in T cells. Specifically, we developed mice that bear a genetic tag allowing AP-MS analysis of the RLTPR interactome in primary T cells. We showed that CD28, RLTPR, and CARMA1 physically associate after activation, and we identified proteins not found before within the CD28 signaling pathway. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the genome of human Jurkat leukemic T cells, we demonstrated that RLTPR is also essential for co-stimulation via human CD28 and used this model for structure-function analysis of RLTPR.</p>

        <title>Quantitative analysis of RLTPR protein expression in mouse lymphoid and myeloid cells</title>
        <p>To quantify the expression of the RLTPR protein, we generated a monoclonal antibody (denoted as EM-53) that recognized residues 1147â1272 of mouse RLTPR and cross-reacted with human RLTPR (see Materials and methods). Intracellular staining of mouse thymocyte subsets with EM-53 showed that RLTPR was expressed at the highest level in both CD25<sup>+</sup> double-negative (CD4<sup>â</sup>CD8<sup>â</sup>) cells and double-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) cells and down-regulated in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> single-positive thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). CD28 showed a similar reduction of expression during the double-positive to single-positive thymocyte transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Among peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, both naive (CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup>) and effector memory (CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) T cells expressed substantial levels of RLTPR and CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

        <p>In the B lymphoid lineage, RLTPR was expressed in B cells (CD45R<sup>high</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>) and plasma cells (CD45R<sup>â</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Given that CD28 is induced at the B cellâplasma cell transition (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Delogu et al., 2006</xref>), bone marrow plasma cells expressed both CD28 and RLTPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Mouse NK cells can be organized into a CD11b<sup>lo</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup> â CD11b<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup> â CD11b<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>lo</sup> maturation sequence that is associated with a progressive acquisition of effector functions (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>). Expression of CD28 and RLTPR was elevated in immature NK cells and diminished upon NK cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Consistent with transcriptomic data available from the ImmGen project, among conventional DCs, monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, and macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were the only ones to express RLTPR, which correlated with the expression of CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref> and not depicted). Therefore, RLTPR is not lymphoid-lineage specific as originally thought, and in most lymphoid (T cells, plasma cells, and NK cells) and myeloid (pDC) cells, its expression was coordinated with that of CD28. However, as illustrated by B cells, RLTPR can be also expressed in the absence of CD28.</p>

        <title>Gene-targeted mice suitable for proteomics analysis of RLTPR</title>
        <p>To identify the RLTPR interactome by AP-MS, we generated a line of gene-targeted mice expressing a One-STrEP-tag (OST) at the C terminus of endogenous RLTPR (Fig. S1 A). Immunoblots of thymocytes from mice heterozygous for the <italic>Rltpr<sup>ost</sup></italic> allele (also known as B6-<italic>Rltpr<sup>tm1Mal</sup></italic>; called <italic>Rltpr<sup>ost</sup></italic> mice here) showed that addition of the 29-aa-long OST sequence had no effect on RLTPR expression and that the RLTPR-OST bait was efficiently affinity purified with Sepharose beads coupled to Strep-Tactin (Fig. S1 B). Analysis of thymus of <italic>Rltpr<sup>ost</sup></italic> mice showed a normal sequence of T cell development and the spleen of <italic>Rltpr<sup>ost</sup></italic> mice contained normal numbers of Î³Î´ T cells and of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. S1, C and D). Stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from WT and <italic>Rltpr<sup>ost</sup></italic> mice with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) in the presence or absence of anti-CD28 showed that RLTPR-OST molecules had no detrimental effect on the proliferation and production of IL-2 (Fig. S1, E and F). Therefore, thymocytes and T cells of <italic>Rltpr</italic><sup><italic>ost</italic></sup> mice are normal.</p>
        <p>Double-positive thymocytesâthe major population of cells found in the thymusâcontained higher levels of RLTPR than peripheral T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>), and thymocytes were thus used to determine the RLTPR interactome. Thymocytes from <italic>Rltpr</italic><sup><italic>ost</italic></sup> mice were lysed before or after treatment for 30, 120, 300, and 600 s with the tyrosine-phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, a surrogate for TCR stimulation (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Roncagalli et al., 2014</xref>), and the proteins bound to RLTPR-OST were isolated using Strep-Tactin-Sepharose beads. After elution with D-biotin (a ligand that binds to Strep-Tactin with a higher affinity than the OST sequence does), proteins were subjected to liquid chromatography coupled tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis (see Materials and methods). Three independent biological experiments, each involving five different conditions corresponding to no stimulation and to four time points spanning 600 s after pervanadate stimulation, were analyzed by AP-MS. Technical triplicates were run for each of the five conditions. The reproducibility of the AP-MS process was assessed for each condition of stimulation across biological and technical replicates (Fig. S2). To distinguish truly interacting proteins from nonspecific contaminants, control AP-MS experiments were performed for each time point using WT thymocytes. To determine whether a given detected protein was specifically associated with the RLTPR-OST bait over the course of an experiment, we compared the distribution of log-normalized intensities obtained for <italic>Rltpr</italic><sup>ost</sup> and for WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Each comparison yielded a value specifying the enrichment observed in RLTPR-OST thymocytes as compared with WT thymocytes and a corresponding P-value based on a Wilcoxon test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Proteins were selected as specific interacting partners of the considered OST bait when P &lt; 0.05 and the corresponding enrichment was greater than threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Table S1).</p>

        <title>Characterization of the RLTPR interactome</title>
        <p>A large spectrum of functional activities was found among the 19 proteins that constitute the RLTPR interactome of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). They include cytosolic adaptors (CARMA1, FYB [also known as ADAP], GRB2, and GRAP2 [also known as GADS]), the transmembrane adaptor SIT1, two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (VAV1 and DOCK8), a GTPase-activating protein (RASAL3), two receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRC [also known as CD45] and PTPRF [also known as LAR]), a cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN6; also known as SHP1), two transmembrane receptors (CD28 and CD8B), the Î±- and Î²-subunits of CP (CAPZA1, CAPZA2, and CAPZB), CNOT1, a subunit of the CCR4âNOT complex, the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X, and the SUGT1 chaperone. CAPZA1, CAPZA2, CAPZB, PTPRC, and SUGT1 associated to RLTPR before activation and remained bound to it after T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In contrast, all the remaining proteins found in the RLTPR interactome began interacting with RLTPR only after thymocyte activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p>
        <p>By imaging the immunological synapse, we previously inferred that RLTPR couples CD28 to CARMA1, but due to the extremely low abundance of RLTPR molecules, we failed to validate the existence of such association using conventional biochemistry (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the sensitivity of AP-MS analysis readily established that CD28 and CARMA1 associate with RLTPR after thymocyte activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). FYB can be recruited to the CBM complex upon CD3-CD28 stimulation and VAV1 can cooperate with CD28 to contribute to NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Marinari et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with those findings, both FYB and VAV1 were found in the RLTPR interactome of activated thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Most of the proteins found in the RLTPR interactome cannot be predicted on the basis of our previous model of RLTPR function (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). Among them stood SUGT1, the presence of which can be rationalized in that it has been found to be associated with several cytosolic nucleotide-binding proteins and immune sensors containing LRR domains and is postulated to regulate their stability (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Shirasu, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Eastburn et al., 2012</xref>). DOCK8, a member of the DOCK180 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, is also part of the RLTPR interactome. Several transmembrane receptors and adaptors expressed at the surface of T cells were also found in the RLTPR interactome in addition to the anticipated CD28 receptor. They comprised SIT1, a transmembrane adaptor that contains tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated after TCR stimulation (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">HorejsÃ­ et al., 2004</xref>), and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRC and PTPRF. Therefore, the analysis of the RLTPR interactome in T cells demonstrated that RLTPR links CD28 to CARMA1 and unraveled unexpected RLTPR interacting partners.</p>

        <p>To exclude that adventitious recombination events had occurred in RLTPR-deficient Jurkat cells and accounted for their CD28 signaling defect, we infected them with a lentivirus driving the expression of RLTPR. Upon reconstitution, RLTPR-deficient Jurkat cells expressed levels of RLTPR comparable to WT Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>), and regained their ability to produce IL-2 in response to SEE stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>).

        <title>RLTPR exists as a homodimer</title>
        <p>LRRC16A, a paralog of RLTPR, contains a central HD that mediates constitutive antiparallel association of two LRRC16A molecules (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zwolak et al., 2013</xref>). Fusing a full-length RLTPR protein to a YPET (yellow fluorescent protein for energy transfer) reporter, permitted us to distinguish RLTPR<sup>OST</sup> and RLTPR<sup>YPET</sup> molecules in polyacrylamide gels on the basis of their distinct molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). When lysates of HEK293 cells coexpressing RLTPR<sup>OST</sup> and RLTPR<sup>YPET</sup> molecules were subjected to AP with Strep-Actin-Sepharose beads and analyzed by immunoblot with an anti-YPET antibody, RLTPR<sup>OST</sup> molecules were capable of coprecipitating RLTPR<sup>YPET</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), demonstrating that, akin to LRRC16A, RLTPR also exists as a constitutive dimer. Considering that the sequence corresponding to the HD found in LRRC16A is poorly conserved in RLTPR and that residues 853â905 of the putative human RLTPR HD are dispensable for dimerization (see <related-article id="d36e1309" related-article-type="companion" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1084/jem.20160576">Wang et al.</related-article> in this issue), it remains to determine whether RLTPR dimerization requires sequences distinct from the putative HD or even additional protein partners.</p>

        <p>Most previous studies of the function of members of the LRRC16 protein family, including RLTPR, relied on heterologous cellular models and resulted in RLTPR overexpression. The possibility of editing the genome of Jurkat cells with CRISPR-Cas9 permits to express RLTPR mutants in a physiological context and to preserve the stoichiometry of the RLTPR signaling complexes. Sequence alignment suggested that the 158 aa found at the N terminus of human RLTPR code for a noncanonical PH domain similar to the one identified in mouse LRRC16A (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zwolak et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the 125 aa found at the C terminus of RLTPR contain a PRR with canonical SH3 domain-binding motifs. After introducing a OST-coding sequence at the C terminus of the two alleles of the <italic>Rltpr</italic> gene found in Jurkat cells, we used the resulting Jurkat cells, denoted as <italic>Rltpr</italic><sup>ost</sup>, to derive lines expressing RLTPR molecules deprived of either the noncanonical PH domain (RLTPR<sup>DPH</sup>) or of the PRR (RLTPR<sup>DPRR</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Truncated RLTPR<sup>DPH</sup> and RLTPR<sup>DPRR</sup> molecules with the expected molecular weight were expressed at levels comparable to WT RLTPR molecules and were still capable of binding to CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Jurkat cells expressing RLTPR<sup>DPRR</sup> molecules showed normal levels of TCR and CD28, whereas normal levels of TCR and slightly reduced levels of CD28 were found on Jurkat cells expressing RLTPR<sup>DPH</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

        <title>The CPI motif is dispensable for CD28 co-stimulation in Jurkat cells</title>
        <p>RLTPR constitutively associates with CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), via its CPI motif and thereby decreases CP affinity for actin filaments (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2016</xref>). To test the importance of the CPI motif for co-stimulation via CD28, we constructed Jurkat T cells expressing RLTPR molecules with a defective CPI motif (denoted as RLTPR<sup>DCPI</sup> molecules; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). For that purpose, we changed into alanine a contiguous stretch of 4 aa residues (RPRP) that is conserved and found in the middle of the CPI motif at position 1024â1026 (see Fig. S4 A and <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2012</xref> for appropriate sequence alignment and numbering). Changing these residues to alanine has been shown to result in a complete loss of binding to CP in vitro and in fibrosarcoma cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2015</xref>). Congruent with those data, immunoblot analysis of RLTPR<sup>DCPI</sup> molecules isolated from <italic>Rltpr<sup>dcpi</sup></italic> Jurkat cells and probed with anti-CP showed that they have lost their ability to bind CP as compared with WT RLTPR molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). <italic>Rltpr<sup>dcpi</sup></italic> Jurkat cells showed normal levels of TCR and CD28, and normal induction of CD69 in response to Raji-SEE (not depicted).

        <p>Much of the previous efforts aiming at unraveling the function of LRRC16 protein family focused on the CPI motif, as its ability to decrease the affinity of CP for actin filament was considered as a cardinal attribute of such protein family. Therefore, we sought to determine whether, as documented in human Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, F and G</xref>), the CPI motif of RLTPR was also dispensable in mouse primary T cells for co-stimulation via CD28 and the development of T reg and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We generated mice containing the very same mutation as that affecting the CPI motif in <italic>Rltpr<sup>dcpi</sup></italic> Jurkat cells (Fig. S4 A). Mice homozygous for this mutation, <italic>Rltpr<sup>dcpi</sup></italic> (also known ad B6-<italic>Rltpr<sup>tm4Mal</sup></italic>), were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies. Akin to <italic>Rltpr</italic><sup>bas/bas</sup> mice, their T cells contained approximately twofold less RLTPR protein than WT <italic>Rltpr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (Fig. S4 B), suggesting that the constitutive association of RLTPR to CP increases its stability. <italic>Rltpr<sup>dcpi/dcpi</sup></italic> mice showed a normal sequence of T cell development and their periphery was populated by normal numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with a normal phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S4, C and E).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>We demonstrated that RLTPR acts as a scaffold, bridging CD28 to CARMA1, and as such is essential for CD28 co-stimulation in mouse T cells and in the human leukemic T cell line Jurkat, a finding consistent with in vivo and ex vivo analysis of T cells from patients with inherited RLTPR deficiency (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Mouse RLTPR is also expressed in B cells, long-lived plasma cells, NK cells, and pDCs, and analysis of human circulating leukocytes revealed a rather similar pattern of RLTPR expression (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In both species, the pattern of expression of CD28 largely correlated with that of RLTPR, suggesting that the CD28-RLTPR functional linkage first documented in T cells (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>) extends to other types of leukocytes. Loss of CD28 activation significantly diminishes humoral responses (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Shahinian et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dodson et al., 2009</xref>), a finding originally attributed to defective T cell help. However, a recent study showed that CD28 provides signals that enhance in a cell-autonomous manner the survival of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rozanski et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the possibility that such prosurvival signals are conveyed via a CD28âRLTPR signaling axis. As illustrated by both mouse and human B cells, RLTPR has a broader expression than that of CD28, pointing toward plausible CD28-independent function. Mice deprived of functional RLTPR molecules had normal numbers of B cells, and cross-linking of the BCR of such B cells induced their proliferation to the same extent as WT B cells. As a result, they responded normally to a T cellâindependent antigen. Therefore, the reduced T cellâdependent B cell responses observed in the mouse in the absence of functional RLTPR molecules are likely caused by the essential role played by RLTPR in T cells. This differs from humans in which BCR-mediated B cell activation was affected in patients deprived of functional RLTPR molecules (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Considering that mouse B cells coexpress LRRC16A in addition to RLTPR, it remains possible that the mouse BCR differs from its human counterpart in that it uses RLTPR and LRRC16A in a redundant manner. In mouse pDC, CD28 acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN production after TLR stimulation or viral infection (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Macal et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, CD28 promotes activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Galea-Lauri et al., 1999</xref>). Although, mice deprived of RLTPR had normal numbers of pDC and NK cells (unpublished data), it remains to be determined whether CD28 uses RLTPR to signal in pDC and NK cells. If applicable to humans, such information should help determine whether the pathological conditions afflicting RLTPR-deficient patients result from malfunction in leukocytes other than T and B cells.</p>
      <p>Using Jurkat leukemic T cells and mouse primary T cells, which constitute the cellular environment in which RLTPR operates normally, we analyzed the functional role of the various structural domains identified to date in the RLTPR molecule. Deletion of the noncanonical PH domain found in mouse LRRC16A reduced its localization at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zwolak et al., 2013</xref>). Sequence alignment suggests that RLTPR contains a similar noncanonical PH domain. However, the residues present in the LRRC16A noncanonical PH domain and necessary for membrane binding are not conserved in the corresponding PH domain of human and mouse RLTPR, preventing its use for plasma membrane localization (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, a 27-aa-long plasma membraneâbinding motif located in close proximity to the RLTPR CPI motif and found necessary for endocytic and migratory functions of fibrosarcoma cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2015</xref>). Regardless of the exact function of the 158 aa found at the N terminus of RLTPR, our analysis of <italic>Rltpr<sup>dph</sup></italic> Jurkat T cells stresses their functional importance in CD28 co-stimulation.</p>
      <p>LRR domains are frequently involved in the formation of proteinâprotein interactions. Here, we formally established that the RLTPR LRR domain has an essential functional role in CD28 co-stimulation. The mutation found in the LRR of RLTPR<sup>BAS</sup> molecules did not prevent the formation of CD28-RLTPR microclusters, but blocked their colocalization with CARMA1 at the immune synapse (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). When considered together with our AP-MS analysis showing that RLTPR associates with both CD28 and CARMA1, the aforementioned results suggest that the LRR domain of RLTPR directly or indirectly associates with CARMA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). The LRR domain of LRRC16A is composed of repeating units with a Î²-strand-turn-Î±-helix structure and has a horseshoe shape with a solvent accessible concave interior surface made of parallel Î²-strands and a convex exterior surface made of array of Î±-helices (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Zwolak et al., 2013</xref>). In the event that the LRR domain of RLTPR shows the same structure as that of LRRC16A, the L432P mutation identified in the mouse <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas</sup></italic> allele and two of the mutations identified in human RLTPR (L372R and L525Q) are located within the LRR Î²-strands. The receptor for the FSH glycoprotein hormone uses the Î²-strands of the concave surface of its LRR domain to recognize FSH (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fan and Hendrickson, 2005</xref>). Provided that RLTPR uses a similar strategy to bind to CARMA1, the nonconservative substitutions L432P, L372R, and L525Q likely disrupt the organization of the concave surface and prevent the association with CARMA1. Alternatively, those mutations may indirectly impact on the convex and fully exposed LRR surface. Upon heterologous expression in a fibrosarcoma cell line, the LRR domain of RLTPR was found to be necessary for its colocalization with the vimentin intermediate filament network (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2016</xref>). However, our AP-MS analysis, conducted in T cells, failed to recover vimentin-specific peptides.</p>

          <p><bold>A model illustrating the mode of action of RLTPR in T cells.</bold> RLTPR is required for coupling CD28 to PKC-Î¸ and CARMA-1, two proximal effectors of the CD28 signaling pathway. RLTPR exists as constitutive dimer and contains a putative HD. The CPI motif of RLTPR molecules is constitutively associated with a CP, conferring actin-uncapping properties to RLTPR molecules. As a result, RLTPR molecules are thought to remodel the cortical actin cytoskeleton upon T cell activation. Our data demonstrated, however, that the RLTPR CPI motif is dispensable for co-stimulation via CD28 and the development of T reg and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast, the LRR domain, the noncanonical PH domain, and the PRR of RLTPR are each mandatory for co-stimulation via CD28. By disrupting the structure of the LRR domain, the L432 mutation found in <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas</sup></italic> mice prevents the association of RLTPR with CARMA1, thereby abrogating CD28-mediated co-stimulatory signals. Whether the PRR region of RLTPR is coupled to the PYAP motif found in the CD28 cytoplasmic tail via the GRB2 or GRAP2 adaptors remains to be demonstrated. CD28 likely exerts both RLTPR-dependent and -independent functions.</p>

      <p>The CD28 cytoplasmic segment contains a YMNM motif and two proline-rich motifs (PRRP and PYAP), the relative contribution of which to CD28 co-stimulatory function remains debated (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Okkenhaug et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Raab et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">PagÃ¡n et al., 2012</xref>). GRB2 and GRAP2 are capable of binding to the YMNM and PYAP motifs found in the CD28 cytoplasmic segment (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Higo et al., 2014</xref>), and both are found in the RLTPR interactome after T cell activation. Analysis of RLTPR-OST molecules present in lysates of pervanadate-stimulated thymocytes showed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (not depicted and <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, provided that GRB2 and GRAP2 bind directly to RLTPR, this should occur via their SH3 domains and involve the C-terminal PRR region of RLTPR. The C-terminal PRR region is essential for co-stimulation via CD28 in Jurkat T cells (this study), and ablation of the CD28 PYAP motif mimics a RLTPR deficiency in that it prevents both T reg cell development (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vang et al., 2010</xref>) and survival of long-lived plasma cells in mouse bone marrow (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rozanski et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, GRB2 and/or GRAP2 likely couple the RLTPR PRR region to the CD28 PYAP motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although most previous studies aiming at unraveling the function of LRRC16 family proteins focused on the CPI motif, our data using human Jurkat T cells and mouse primary T cells demonstrated that the RLTPR CPI motif was dispensable for co-stimulation via CD28 and the development of T reg and memory-effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. It has been suggested that CD28 plays an important role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, when a T cell encounters an APC bearing its cognate peptideâMHC ligand, the LCK protein-tyrosine kinase initiates a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase PLC-Î³1 and to the assembly of a CD28 signalosome. Ensuing CD28 signals are thought to remodel the cortical actin at the site of active TCR signaling, enabling LAT-bound PLC-Î³1 to access phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate at the plasma membrane and convert it into inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Although our analysis of human and mouse RLTPR<sup>DCPI</sup> molecules suggests that an actin component is not required for RLTPR-mediated CD28 co-stimulation, the recent discovery that CapZIP, another CPI motif-containing protein, is required for CD28 co-stimulation-dependent IL-2 production (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2015</xref>) suggests that CapZIP can compensate for RLTPR<sup>DCPI</sup> molecules. Other, yet to be analyzed, functions of RLTPR might depend on its actin-uncapping activity. For instance, both the <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas</sup></italic> mutation and the ablation of the Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) do not affect the overall accumulation of F-actin at the immunological synapse (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2015</xref>). However, the lack of WASP affected F-actin foci that constitute a minute fraction of total synaptic F-actin (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lanier et al., 2015</xref>). DOCK8, a member of the DOCK180 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, is part of the RLTPR interactome. Remarkably, it is only when they migrate through confined spaces that DOCK8-deficient T and NK cells develop cell shape deformation abnormalities that impair their viability (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Disentangling the actin-uncapping function of RLTPR may thus require testing of T cells subjected to a mechanically constrained environment. Therefore, the structureâfunction analysis of RLTPR allowed us to build a more complete model of how RLTPR contributes to CD28 co-stimulation in both mouse and human T cells, emphasizing its role as a scaffolding protein capable of interacting with CD28 and CARMA1 independent of its actin-uncapping function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, although <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas/bas</sup></italic> and <italic>Rltpr<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice contain normal numbers of conventional T cells and diminished numbers of T reg cells, they developed no blatant autoimmune manifestations, which is consistent with RLTPR-deficient patients (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). This paradoxâalso raised in the case of CARMA1-deficient mice (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vang et al., 2010</xref>)âcan be accounted for by the coincident defect in CD28 co-stimulation that plagues the conventional T cells that develop in normal numbers in <italic>Rltpr<sup>bas/bas</sup></italic> and <italic>Rltpr<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice and, in turn, leads to a paucity of effector memory T cells. This view is consistent with the primary function of T reg cells, which is to oppose CD28 signaling by down-regulating CD80 and CD86 on APC (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Soskic et al., 2014</xref>). Recent developments in MS applied to activated mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have revealed that the number of CD28 molecules per activated mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell (1.2 Ã 10<sup>4</sup>) is higher than that of RLTPR (2.6 Ã 10<sup>3</sup>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hukelmann et al., 2016</xref>). Assuming that the whole pool of RLTPR is available for engaging in interaction with CD28, at most 20% of the CD28 molecules present at the T cell surface will be associated with RLTPR. Therefore, although RLTPR-bound CD28 molecules constitute a few needles in the CD28 haystack, it is those molecules that are functionally relevant in term of co-stimulation. Owing to their minute numbers, they likely exert their function in a rather local manner at the immune synapse, and their functional importance may have gone unnoticed without combining functional genomics and proteomics. Therefore, our study illustrates how integrative biology of T cell activation (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Malissen et al., 2014</xref>) helps in delineating the dynamic relationships between signaling protagonists in the T cell interior to provide a more complete model of CD28 co-stimulation in human and mouse, in which RLTPR has a critical role.</p>

They were then washed twice in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and finally shrunk by incubation for 5 min with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile. The resulting alkylated gel pieces were dried at room temperature. The dried gel pieces were reswollen by incubation in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, supplemented with trypsin (12.5 ng/ml; Promega) for 1 h at 4Â°C and then incubated overnight at 37Â°C. Peptides were harvested by collecting the initial digestion solution and carrying out two extractions; first in 5% formic acid, and then in 5% formic acid 60% acetonitrile. Pooled extracts were dried down in a centrifugal vacuum system. Samples were reconstituted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 4% acetonitrile and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem MS (MS/MS) in an LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos (Thermo Electron) online with a nanoLC Ultimate 3000 chromatography system (Dionex). Peptides were separated on a Dionex Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column. First, peptides were concentrated and purified on a precolumn (C18 PepMap100; Dionex; 2 cm Ã 100 Âµm I.D, 100 Ã pore size, 5 Âµm particle size) in solvent A (0.1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile). Next, peptides were separated on a reverse phase column (C18 PepMap100; Dionex; 15 cm Ã 75 Âµm I.D, 100 Ã pore size, 2 Âµm particle size) at 300 nl/min flow rate. After column equilibration using 4% of solvent B (20% water, 80% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid), peptides were eluted from the analytical column by a two steps linear gradient (4â20% acetonitrile/H<sub>2</sub>O; 0.1% formic acid for 90 min, and 20â45â45% acetonitrile/H<sub>2</sub>O; 0.1% formic acid for 30 min). </p>
        <p>For peptide ionization in the nanospray source, spray voltage was set at 1.4 kV and the capillary temperature at 275Â°C. The Orbitrap Velos was set up in data-dependent mode to switch consistently between MS and MS/MS. MS spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap in the range of m/z 400â1700 at a FWHM resolution of 30,000 measured at 400 m/z. For internal mass calibration, the 445.120025 ions were used as lock mass. The 10 abundant precursor ions were selected, and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation was performed in the ion trap on the 10 most intense precursor ions measured to have maximum sensitivity and yield a maximum amount of MS/MS data. The signal threshold for an MS/MS event was set to 500 counts. Charge state screening was enabled to exclude precursors with 0 and 1 charge states. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 1, exclusion list size 500 and exclusion duration of 30 s.</p>

        <title>Protein identification and quantification</title>
        <p>Relative intensity-based label-free quantification (LFQ) was processed using the MaxLFQ algorithm (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2014</xref>) from the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform, version 1.5.2.8 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). The acquired raw LC Orbitrap MS data were first processed using the integrated Andromeda search engine (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2011</xref>). Spectra were searched against a SwissProt mouse database (version 2014.07). This database was supplemented with a set of 245 frequently observed contaminants. The following search parameters were used: (1) trypsin allowing cleavage before proline; (2) two missed cleavages were allowed; (3) monoisotopic precursor tolerance of 20 ppm in the first search used for recalibration, followed by 4.5 ppm for the main search and 0.5 D for fragment ions from MS/MS; (4) cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.02146) as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation (+15.99491) and N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106) as variable modifications; (5) a maximum of five modifications per peptide allowed; and (6) minimum peptide length was 7 aa and a maximum mass of 4,600 D. The match between runs option was enabled to transfer identifications across different LC-MS/MS replicates based on their masses and retention time within a match time window of 0.7 min and using an alignment time window of 20 min. The quantification was performed using a minimum ratio count of 1 (unique + razor) and the second peptide option to allow identification of two cofragmented coeluting peptides with similar masses. The false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide level and protein level were set to 1% and determined by searching a reverse database. For protein grouping, all proteins that cannot be distinguished based on their identified peptides were assembled into a single entry according to the MaxQuant rules. The statistical analysis was done with Perseus program (version 1.5.1.6) from the MaxQuant environment. The LFQ normalized intensities were uploaded from the proteinGroups.txt file. First, proteins marked as contaminant, reverse hits, and only identified by site were discarded. Quantifiable proteins were defined as those detected in at least 100% of samples in at least one condition. Protein LFQ intensities were base 2 logarithmized to obtain a normal distribution. Missing values were replaced using data imputation by randomly selecting from a normal distribution centered on the lower edge of the intensity values that simulates signals of low abundant proteins using default parameters (a downshift of 1.8 standard deviation and a width of 0.3 of the original distribution). In this way, imputation of missing values in the controls allows statistical comparison of protein abundances that are present only in the immunoprecipitation samples. To determine whether a given detected protein was specifically associated with the bait, we compared the distributions of normalized log intensities between WT and RLTPR<sup>OST</sup> backgrounds by computing the P-value from a nonparametric Wilcoxon test along with the fold-change. Proteins were selected as specific partners of the bait when both P &lt; 0.05 and the corresponding enrichment was greater than threefold. The proteomics data, including search results, have been deposited in the PRIDE repository of the ProteomeXchange Consortium under accession no. PXD003870.</p>

The guide oligos contained overhangs for ligation into BbsI sites of plasmids pX330 and pX335 and a G-C base pair (italics) was added at the 5â² end of the guide sequence for T7 transcription. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into plasmid pX330 (pSpCas9; Addgene plasmid ID 42230) or into plasmid pX335 (hSpCas9n D10A; Addgene plasmid ID 42335). Double-stranded DNA repair templates (targeting vector) containing the desired edited sequence, as well as additional homologous sequence immediately upstream and downstream (homology arms) of the edited sequence, were assembled. The size of the left and right homology arms of the targeting vector was 500 bp. To prevent CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage of the targeting vectors, a silent mutation destroying the PAM sequence that is present in the genomic DNA was introduced into them. Finally, a <italic>LoxP</italic>-flanked NeoR cassette was introduced in the intron that flanked the exon subjected to edition. Jurkat, Clone E6-1 cells were nucleofected using the Cell Line Nucleofector kit V program I-010 for Nucleofector II with 2.5 Âµg of linearized targeting vector, and 10 Âµg pX330-sgRNA or pX335-sgRNA plasmid. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h, and then subjected to G418 selection (2 mg/ml). Cells growing in G418 were then cloned by limiting dilution and screened for proper gene editing using PCR and genomic DNA sequencing. Transient expression of a Cre recombinase in correctly recombined Jurkat T cell clones allowed for the removal of the floxed Neo<sup>R</sup> cassette. Therefore, in addition to the intended mutation, each mutated allele contains a LoxP site in the 5â² or 3â² intron flanking the exon harboring the intended mutation. Clones with monoallelic mutation were defined as having PCR amplification of both the WT and mutated bands. Clones with biallelic mutation were defined as having PCR amplification of the mutated band and absence of the WT band. If a biallelic mutation was not obtained after a single round of nucleofection, clones lacking insertion-deletion (indel) in the untouched allele were subjected first to transient Cre expression to remove the Neo<sup>R</sup> cassette present in the properly targeted allele, and then to a second round of nucleofection using the same targeting vector and pX330-sgRNA plasmid.</p>
