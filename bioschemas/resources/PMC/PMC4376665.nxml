      <abstract>
        <p id="P4">Cell growth and proliferation are tightly linked to nutrient availability. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates the presence of growth factors, energy levels, glucose and amino acids to modulate metabolic status and cellular responses<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. mTORC1 is activated at the surface of lysosomes by the RAG GTPases and the Ragulator complex through a not fully understood mechanism monitoring amino acid availability in the lysosomal lumen and involving the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Here we describe the uncharacterized human member 9 of the solute carrier family 38 (SLC38A9) as a lysosomal membrane-resident protein competent in amino acid transport. Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator/RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, while loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid-sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR.</p>

    <p id="P5">Amino acids are essential for mTORC1 activity, as growth factors cannot efficiently activate mTOR in their absence<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding the growing number of proteins involved in the activation of mTOR at the lysosomal surface, the molecular nature of the amino acid sensing mechanisms have remained elusive<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Several members of the solute carrier (SLC) group belonging to families capable of transporting amino acids at the plasma membrane have been shown to regulate mTOR activity<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that SLCs may also be involved in the lysosomal sensing. We hypothesized the existence of an ubiquitously expressed SLC belonging to the a family competent for amino acid transport<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> with a subcellular localisation compatible with lysosomal amino acid sensing. Among the list of SLCs robustly expressed in two different cell lines, we focused on member 9 of the SLC38 family as it was completely uncharacterized, showed vesicular staining<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and had been associated to lysosomes by proteomic analysis<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). The SLC38 family contains eleven members, and is part of a phylogenetic cluster of amino acid transporters comprising the SLC32 and SLC36 families<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). SLC38A9 is predicted to encompass eleven transmembrane helices and a 120-residue cytoplasmic N-terminal region. Treatment with peptide-<italic>N</italic>-glycosidase (PNGase) F showed that SLC38A9 is highly glycosylated and enabled detection of the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a-b</xref>). Supporting a possible role in growth regulatory pathways, silencing of SLC38A9 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in HEK293T cells resulted in a reduction of cell size and cell proliferation, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c-d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To test whether SLC38A9 would associate with the complex regulating mTORC1, we engineered HEK293 cells to express tagged SLC38A9 in an inducible fashion and verified the localisation of the protein to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>). We purified endogenously assembled protein complexes using tandem affinity purification (TAP) coupled to one-dimensional gel-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCâMS/MS). The gel-free approach was critical as upon boiling SLC38A9 formed insoluble aggregates that failed to enter SDS-polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2e-f</xref>). The analysis identified all the five members of the Ragulator/LAMTOR complex and the four RAG GTPases as specific interactors of SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data 3d</xref>). Such collective high sequence coverage of all components of the Ragulator/RAG GTPases complex strongly indicated that SLC38A9 was an additional uncharacterized member. When co-expressed in HEK293T cells, SLC38A9 co-immunoprecipitated with LAMTOR1 and overexpressed LAMTOR1 bound endogenous SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-c</xref>). We validated complex membership entirely at the endogenous level in different cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of SLC38A9 resulted in the specific recruitment of endogenous RAGA and LAMTOR1 and, conversely, immunoprecipitated RAGA bound SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This association was not observed when SLC38A9 was silenced, confirming specificity. Association of endogenous SLC38A9 and RAGA was demonstrated in HeLa and K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-f</xref>) and in murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and RAW 264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2g-h</xref>). To further challenge specificity, we applied the identical proteomic strategy to the two highest expressed members of the SLC38 family, SLC38A1 and SLC38A2, and SLC36A1/PAT1, which has been previously associated with the Ragulator/RAG GTPase complex<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Despite very high bait recovery, none of the Ragulator/RAG GTPase complex members was identified among the interactors, highlighting that the association of SLC38A9 with this complex is a unique property of this family member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data 3d</xref>). Moreover, when we immunoprecipitated SLC38A9, SLC38A1, SLC38A2, SLC36A1/PAT1 as well as a lysosomal member of the SLC38 family, SLC38A7<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and a second member of the SLC36 family SLC36A4/PAT4, only SLC38A9 co-immunoprecipitated endogenous LAMTOR1, LAMTOR3, RAGA and RAGC, with both low and high expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Immunostaining of tagged SLC38A9 in HeLa cells revealed extensive colocalization with the late endosome/lysosome markers LAMP1, CD63 and the late endosome/multivesicular bodies lipid LBPA, but not with early endosome (EEA1) or Golgi (Giantin) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h-j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig 4a-b</xref>). This supports SLC38A9 being a lysosomal component of the Ragulator/RAG GTPase complex.</p>
    <p id="P8">Full membership to this multiprotein complex would entail physical association with any of the several detected members in reciprocal purifications. We performed affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry with LAMTOR1, 3, 4 and 5, as well as RAGA and RAGC GTPases. At the core of the interacting network obtained by combining the six independent purifications we found all the expected members of the Ragulator/RAG GTPases complex, RAPTOR as well as SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). The overall low sequence coverage of SLC38A9 could be ascribed to inefficient proteolytic cleavage of the inaccessible transmembrane portions of the protein as it mirrored the coverage obtained when SLC38A9 was used as bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5b-c</xref>). The interaction of endogenous SLC38A9 with all baits was confirmed by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>). The quality of the proteomic survey was also indicated by detection of the subunit VA0D1 of the v-ATPase complex<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and the FLCN-FNIP2 complex<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we did not detect any other SLC member of the amino acid transporter families in any of the purifications with the members of Ragulator/GTPases complex, indicating that SLC38A9 is, at least in this cellular system, the only prominently interacting SLC.</p>
    <p id="P9">Deletion studies indicated that the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of SLC38A9 (amino acids 1-112), devoid of any transmembrane region, was sufficient and required to bind the Ragulator/RAG GTPases complex, whereas this interaction was completely lost when the remaining eleven transmembrane-containing region (113-561), that retains lysosomal localisation, was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data 4c-d</xref>). We further mapped the minimal interacting region to amino acids 31-112 and identified four conserved motifs in this portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data 6a-b</xref>). Mutation of any of the first three motifs completely abolished binding, while disruption of the fourth had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data 6c</xref>). Importantly, none of the described mutations affected lysosomal targeting of SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data 4e-h</xref>). Whereas the N-terminal cytoplasmic region is evolutionary conserved across SLC38A9 proteins, we could not detect any significant homology with the N-terminal region of any other SLC38 family member. These results defined the unique cytoplasmic portion of SLC38A9 as responsible for the interaction with the lysosomal mTOR-activating machinery.</p>
    <p id="P10">SLC38 family are commonly competent for the transport of glutamine<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which, together with leucine and arginine, are considered the main amino acids involved in the regulation of mTORC1 <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. We monitored the transporter competence of SLC38A9 towards these amino acids in liposomes reconstituted with purified recombinant SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 7a</xref>). In proteoliposomes, the cytoplasmic tail located at the outside face of the vesicles corresponding to the orientation observed in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 7b</xref>). Addition of [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamine resulted in a time-dependent transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>) that required intraliposomal sodium, but not addition of external sodium, and was most active at acidic pH (pH 5.5-6.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 7c and 7e</xref>, not shown), consistent with the lysosomal localisation of the natural protein. Moreover, point mutation of the putative sodium-binding site (N128A)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> moderately affected transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 7d</xref>). Membrane potential artificially created by potassium gradients in the presence of valinomycin<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> both positive outside or inside did not influence the transport activity of SLC38A9 (not shown). Competition experiments showed that some polar amino acids were capable of competing efficiently for glutamine transport whereas MeAIB, an inhibitor of system A SLC38 family members, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 7f</xref>). Direct transport assays further revealed SLC38A9 competence for [<sup>3</sup>H]-arginine and [<sup>3</sup>H]-asparagine, but not for [<sup>3</sup>H]-leucine or [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). The low ability of arginine to compete with glutamine transport, as previously reported also for SLC38A7<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, may reflect differences in binding and/or transport properties for the two amino acids. The initial uptake rate calculated for 10 Î¼M glutamine was 0.42 Â± 0.10 nmol/mg of protein/minute, which is moderate when compared to other reconstituted transporters<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. If a physiological role of SLC38A9 is to assess the intralysosomal availability of amino acids, then it is also relevant to measure its efflux-enabling activity. We monitored efflux of [<sup>3</sup>H]-glutamine from proteoliposomes and measured a rate of 1.7 Â± 0.30 nmol/mg/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>), which is higher than the uptake but overall still lower than several other amino acid transporters measured with the same approach<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. This suggests that SLC38A9 may be a low capacity transporter similar to SLC38A7<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and resembling the properties of amino acid sensors described in yeast<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P11">The ability of RAG GTPase heterodimers to recruit mTOR by binding Raptor is critically dependent on the nucleotide loading status and the resulting conformation of the two GTPase partners<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. By immunoprecipitating different combinations of RAGA/B-RAGC nucleotide-binding mutant heterodimers we could recapitulate the regulated interactions with RAPTOR and LAMTOR proteins<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and observed that SLC38A9 binding to RAG GTPases was dramatically influenced by their mutational state, even more than what was observed for the Ragulator complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 8</xref>). The low affinity nucleotide binding mutants RAGA<sup>T21N</sup> and RAGB<sup>T54N</sup> showed a strong increase in SLC38A9 recruitment, contrasting with the behaviour of RAGC<sup>S75N</sup> that abolished the binding of SLC38A9 to the heterodimer. GTP-bound RAGA<sup>Q66L</sup>/B<sup>Q99L</sup> mutants showed also reduced SLC38A9 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 8</xref>). These results indicate that the interaction of SLC38A9 with the critical GTPases moieties of the complex is highly conformation specific. In cells stably expressing tagged SLC38A9, amino acid starvation strengthened the interaction between SLC38A9 and endogenous RAGC and, to a minor extent, RAGA, without significantly affecting LAMTOR1 and LAMTOR3 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3f</xref>). Similarly, amino acid stimulation reduced the amount of recruited RAGC and RAGA. Altogether, the amino acid-sensitive character of these binding properties are evocative of the ones exerted by Ragulator<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and Folliculin<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and point to a possible function of SLC38A9 in modulating the nucleotide status of the RAG GTPases. Amino acid sensitivity required the transmembrane region, as the recruitment of RAGC by the N-terminal region alone was not affected by amino acid availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3g</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that the eleven transmembrane helices-encompassing region is the moiety physically engaging amino acids and required to convey sensitivity.</p>
    <p id="P12">Withdrawal of amino acids results in rapid inactivation of mTORC1. Cells stably expressing SLC38A9 showed sustained mTORC1 activation upon amino acid starvation, as monitored by the phosphorylation of the substrates S6 kinase and ULK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 9a</xref>). This resulted in a delayed and reduced induction of autophagy upon amino acid starvation, as shown by quantification of LC3B relocalisation to autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 9b</xref>), as well as sustained phosphorylation and delayed nuclear translocation of the transcription factor TFEB<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 9c</xref>). Sustained mTOR activity triggered by SLC38A9 expression during starvation was inhibited by Torin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 9e</xref>). In contrast, the v-ATPase inhibitor Concanamycin A had no effect in this setting, whereas it efficiently blocked mTORC1 activation induced by amino acid stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 9e-f</xref>). This suggests that the v-ATPase complex and SLC38A9 concur in the control of mTORC1 activity by amino acids. Most likely, the high expression levels of SLC38A9 resulted in an active signalling state that bypasses the v-ATPase input. Indeed, expression of the N-terminal region appears to be sufficient to confer prolonged mTORC1 activation, suggesting that this moiety assumes an active conformation independently of the transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 9d</xref>). Altogether, the data indicate that SLC38A9 is an upstream positive regulator of mTORC1 function.</p>
    <p id="P13">Accordingly, silencing of SLC38A9 in HEK293T by shRNA resulted in a reduction of amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). Cells left in culture for longer times manifested a weaker phenotype possibly due to compensatory adaptive mechanisms (not shown). We therefore silenced SLC38A9 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and observed suppression of amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation in both HEK293T and HeLa cells with an efficiency that was comparable with knockdown of LAMTOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 10a</xref>). Depletion of SLC38A9 also impaired mTORC1 activation induced by cycloheximide, which mimics amino acid stimulation by blocking protein synthesis and thus inducing accumulation of intracellular amino acids<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e</xref>). This further suggests that SLC38A9 participates in mTORC1 activation at the lysosome rather than contributing to the import of extracellular amino acids at the plasma membrane. Moreover SLC38A9 levels did not appear to be induced upon amino acid starvation, in contrast to several SLCs responsible for importing amino acids at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 10b-c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P14">Altogether, the work presented here identifies SLC38A9 as a novel integral component of the lysosomal machinery that controls mTORC1 activity in response to amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>). SLC38A9 is the first member of the entire machinery shown to be competent for binding and transporting amino acids. As other solute carrier proteins, it should be eminently druggable<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We failed to observe a strong dependence on SLC38A9 in amino acid stimulation-induced mTOR lysosomal recruitment, which could be due to technical reasons or, more intriguingly, to separate, partly independent, mechanisms controlling localisation and activation of mTOR. Together with the adaptation observed upon prolonged SLC38A9 silencing, this suggests that additional sensing components are likely to operate in this pathway. Considering the low transport capacity and the physical association with the Ragulator/RAG GTPase complex, it is reasonable to consider SLC38A9 a transceptor-type of SLC<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, reminiscent of yeast amino acid sensors GAP1 and ssy1p, in which amino acid engagement is used for allosteric signal transduction rather than mere transport.</p>
