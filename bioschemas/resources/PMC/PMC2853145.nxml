      <abstract>
        <p>We have developed fluorescent probes for the detection of strand scission in the excision repair of oxidatively damaged bases. They were hairpin-shaped oligonucleotides, each containing an isomer of thymine glycol or 5,6-dihydrothymine as a damaged base in the center, with a fluorophore and a quencher at the 5â²- and 3â²-ends, respectively. Fluorescence was detected when the phosphodiester linkage at the damage site was cleaved by the enzyme, because the short fragment bearing the fluorophore could not remain in a duplex form hybridized to the rest of the molecule at the incubation temperature. The substrate specificities of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> endonuclease III and its human homolog, NTH1, determined by using these probes agreed with those determined previously by gel electrophoresis using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrates. Kinetic parameters have also been determined by this method. Since different fluorophores were attached to the oligonucleotides containing each lesion, reactions with two types of substrates were analyzed separately in a single tube, by changing the excitation and detection wavelengths. These probes were degraded during an incubation with a cell extract. Therefore, phosphorothioate linkages were incorporated to protect the probes from nonspecific nucleases, and the base excision repair activity was successfully detected in HeLa cells.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA is subjected to chemical reactions with both endogenous and exogenous factors in cells, and the resultant damaged nucleobases cause genetic mutations that lead to carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These lesions in DNA are repaired by several pathways to maintain the genetic integrity. Damaged base moieties with a relatively small change in the chemical structure, which are produced by hydrolysis, oxidation and alkylation, are removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), whereas those with a larger structural change, formed by exposure to ultraviolet light and reactions with carcinogens, are the substrates for nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In the former pathway, DNA glycosylases first recognize the damaged base and cleave its glycosidic bond. Some of these enzymes have an additional apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity that causes a strand break by Î²- or Î²,Î´-elimination at the AP site formed by the first reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In the case of the endonuclease (Endo) III-type enzymes, a <italic>trans</italic> Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) is reportedly formed by the Î²-elimination, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The Endo VIII-type enzymes catalyze the Î²,Î´-elimination to produce a 3â² phosphate at the cleavage site. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases without the associated AP lyase activity require another enzyme, AP endonuclease, to make an incision at the AP site. AP endonuclease and polynucleotide kinase remove the Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde and the phosphate, respectively, which are produced at the 3â²-end by the reactions of the bifunctional enzymes. Subsequently, the gap is filled with the correct nucleotide by DNA polymerase. In the case of the monofunctional enzymes, the remaining 2â²-deoxyribose 5â²-phosphate (dRP) and the flap structure formed as a repair intermediate are removed by the dRP lyase activity of DNA polymerase Î² and flap endonuclease, respectively. Finally, a phosphodiester linkage is formed by DNA ligase at the nick site, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.

The filled and open circles represent damaged and undamaged bases, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkq022f1"/></fig></p><p>The strand scission by the DNA glycosylases/AP lyases has been analyzed by using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotides. Usually, the 5â²-end of the damaged base-containing strand is labeled using [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, and then this oligonucleotide is hybridized to the unlabeled complementary strand. The obtained <sup>32</sup>P-labeled duplex is used as a substrate, and after the incubation with an enzyme, the product is analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by detection and quantification of the radioactive bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, there are some drawbacks in this type of experiment. In addition to the hazardous nature of the radioisotope, the substrates must be enzymatically labeled through a laborious procedure, and the half-life of <sup>32</sup>P is quite short. It is sometimes difficult to accurately determine the molar amount of the labeled oligonucleotide. The enzyme reaction with only a single substrate is monitored in one experiment, and, most importantly, the product must be separated from the intact substrate. In this study, we have developed probes for detecting the excision step of the BER reactions by fluorescence. For this purpose, lesion-containing oligonucleotides bearing a fluorophore and a quencher, which were originally used as molecular beacons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), were prepared, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. While the molecular beacon reports the existence of its target sequence, our hairpin-type BER probe emits fluorescence when the strand is cleaved by a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase. The principle is that the fluorophore-labeled 5â² fragment of our probe is short enough to dissociate from the quencher strand at the incubation temperature, upon enzymatic cleavage. Destabilization of the duplex upon enzymatic strand scission was used previously to analyze the reaction of a bifunctional enzyme, formamidopyrimidine glycosylase, but the reaction was monitored by hyperchromicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

One example related to this study is the use of uracil-containing probes for the analysis of uracil DNA-glycosylase reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The probes contained several uracil bases, and when uracil DNA-glycosylase, which is a monofunctional enzyme, hydrolyzed the glycosidic bonds of the uracil bases, the fluorophore- and quencher-strands were dissociated. This method was used for <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) analyses. In this study, we incorporated damaged bases induced by free radicals, namely thymine glycol (5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxythymine, Tg) and 5,6-dihydrothymine (DHT), only at a single site, and analyzed the reactions of two bifunctional DNA glycosylases, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Endo III and its human homolog, NTH1. The substrate specificity was successfully determined by this method. One of the probes was further modified by incorporating phosphorothioate linkages, which could prevent non-specific degradation, and was used to detect the initial step of BER in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Synthesis of oligonucleotide probes</title><p>Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 3400 DNA synthesizer, using the ultramild phosphoramidites (Glen Research) for the normal bases. The phosphoramidite building blocks for the incorporation of (5<italic>R</italic>)- and (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). To simplify the synthesis of the (5<italic>R</italic>)-Tg-containing oligonucleotides, a building block protected with acetyl groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) was prepared, as described in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>, and this building block was used for the synthesis of phosphorothioate-containing oligonucleotides. The building block of (5<italic>S</italic>)-DHT, the phosphoramidites for the attachment of fluorescein and cyanine dyes (Cy3<sup>TM</sup> and Cy5<sup>TM</sup>), the controlled-pore glass (CPG) for the 3â²-end modification with 4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene (Dabcyl), and the Beaucage sulfurizing reagent were purchased from Glen Research. BHQ-2Â® CPG was purchased from Biosearch Technologies. Chain assembly and deprotection were performed according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Cleavage from the support and removal of the alkali-labile protecting groups were simultaneously performed with ammonia water at room temperature for 2 h. The <italic>tert</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl group for the protection of the Tg was removed with triethylamine trihydrofluoride, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). After deprotection, the oligonucleotides were analyzed and purified on a Gilson HPLC system, using a Waters ÂµBondasphere C18 5 Âµm 300 Ã column (3.9 Ã 150 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate at pH 7.0. A Waters 2996 photodiode array detector was used for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of oligonucleotides</title><p>Aliquots of oligonucleotides were incubated with DNase I (50 U; Takara) in a buffer (30 Âµl), containing 40 mM TrisâHCl (pH 7.5), 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), at 37Â°C for 24 h. Then, a buffer (5 Âµl), containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.6), 2.8 M NaCl and 10 mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, water (10 Âµl), and S1 nuclease (5 Âµl, 800 U; Takara) were added, and the mixture was incubated again at 37Â°C for 24 h. This mixture was diluted with water (2.5 Âµl), and a buffer (14 Âµl), containing 0.5 M TrisâHCl (pH 9.0) and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and alkaline phosphatase (3.5 Âµl, 14 U; Takara) were added. After an incubation at 37Â°C for 2 h, the products were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Inertsil ODS-2 column (4.6 Ã 150 mm; GL Sciences) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 0 to 10% for 20 min) in 0.1 M triethylammonium acetate at pH 7.0.

Sample solutions (250 Âµl) contained each oligonucleotide (37.5 pmol) and <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III (the amounts are shown in the legend to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>), in a buffer consisting of 20 mM TrisâHCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). After an incubation at 37Â°C for 30 min, followed by heating to 95Â°C for 5 min, the mixtures were evaporated on a SpeedVac concentrator, and the residues were dissolved in water (10 Âµl). Each sample was mixed with 90% formamide (10 Âµl) containing bromophenol blue, heated to 95Â°C for 3 min and loaded onto a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 M urea, 89 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 2 mM EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant power of 35 W. The bands were detected on a FujiFilm FLA-7000 Bio-imaging system at Osaka University Radioisotope Research Center, using the Y520 and O580 filters for fluorescein and Cy3, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of fluorescence intensity</title><p>Human NTH1 was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Sample solutions (250 Âµl) contained each oligonucleotide (12.5 pmol) and the enzyme (the amounts are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, S4 and S5) in a buffer consisting of 20 mM TrisâHCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After an incubation at 37Â°C for 30 min, the fluorescence intensity was measured at 37Â°C on a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with an EHC 573 temperature controller. The excitation and emission wavelengths for each fluorophore are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The excitation and emission bandwidths for the measurement of fluorescein were 3 nm, and those for the cyanine dyes were 5 nm. The measurement was repeated three times, and the data were averaged. The 100% cleavage was defined as the fluorescence intensity obtained for 50 nM solutions of Y-ACGCGA, in which Y represents a fluorophore, at 37Â°C in the above-mentioned buffer.

The duplex must be sufficiently stable at the incubation temperature of 37Â°C, but the fluorophore-bearing oligonucleotide on the 5â² side of the damage site, which is the product of the enzyme reaction, must be able to dissociate from the rest of the molecule at this temperature. Since the melting temperature of 11-bp duplexes containing Tg in the center was reportedly about 25Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), we chose the 13-bp duplex that was used for our previous study on <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and linked the two strands with a tetrathymidylate loop, to avoid dissociation without chain cleavage by the enzyme. Three types of damaged bases, (5<italic>R</italic>)-Tg, (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg and (5<italic>S</italic>)-DHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), were incorporated at position X in the hairpin oligonucleotide shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. Tg is known to be a good substrate for Endo III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and it exists as either the 5<italic>R cisâtrans</italic> pair (5<italic>R</italic>,6<italic>S</italic> and 5<italic>R</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>) or the 5<italic>S cisâtrans</italic> pair (5<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>R</italic> and 5<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>S</italic>), as a result of epimerization at the C6 position in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). DHT is also reportedly recognized by Endo III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Three types of commercially-available fluorophores, fluorescein, Cy3 and Cy5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A</ext-link>), which had different excitation/emission wavelengths, were attached to the 5â²-end (shown as Y in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), differing with the lesion types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and the appropriate quenchers, Dabcyl and BHQ2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>), at the 3â²-end (shown as Z) were chosen according to the molecular beacon report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In addition to these three probes (Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg, Cy3-<italic>S</italic>Tg and Cy5-DHT), Fl-<italic>S</italic>Tg, in which fluorescein was attached to the (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg-containing oligonucleotide, was prepared to analyze the effect of the fluorophore type, and Fl-T containing undamaged thymine at position X was used as a negative control, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. These oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer, as described in the âMaterials and Methodsâ section. It was confirmed by gel electrophoresis that the probes could function as substrates for Endo III, as shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence analysis of Endo III and NTH1 reactions</title><p>Prior to the fluorescence analysis of the enzyme reactions, one of the probes, Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg, was dissolved in a pH 8.0 buffer, and its fluorescence was measured at various temperatures. The intensity changed only slightly when the temperature was lower than 50Â°C, but it increased steeply when the solution was heated to 50â65Â°C. Since this temperature dependence was identical to the transition from the hairpin structure to the single strand determined by ultraviolet (UV) absorption (data not shown), the increase in the fluorescence intensity was obviously caused by the dissociation of the stem region. A similar increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed when the same probe was incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III in a pH 8.0 buffer at 37Â°C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A (circles) shows the results after a 30-min incubation with various concentrations of the enzyme. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 494 nm, and the fluorescence was measured at 520 nm, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Since the chain cleavage by <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III under similar conditions was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, as shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>, it could be reasoned that the observed increase in the fluorescence intensity was caused by dissociation of the fluorescein-bearing fragment due to the thermal instability of the Endo III-cleaved probe, and, hence, the fluorescence increase could be correlated directly to the DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity of this enzyme. The vertical axes of the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> show the product yield, in which 100% cleavage was derived from the fluorescence intensity of Y-ACGCGA, measured under the same conditions. A very similar result was obtained when human NTH1 was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, circles), but such an increase was not observed for Fl-T, which did not contain a damaged base, in the cases of both <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III and human NTH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, A and B, diamonds). In order to analyze the effect of the fluorophore type, fluorescein/Dabcyl and Cy3/BHQ2 were attached to the same hairpin oligonucleotide containing (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg (Fl-<italic>S</italic>Tg and Cy3-<italic>S</italic>Tg, respectively), and the fluorescence was measured at the wavelengths shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. When these probes were incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III, the results were very similar to those obtained for Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg, regardless of the fluorophore type (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5, A and C</ext-link>). This result agreed with the observation that Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg and Cy3-<italic>S</italic>Tg were cleaved by <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III with similar efficiencies, as detected in the analysis by gel electrophoresis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>). In the case of human NTH1, only a small increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5, B and D</ext-link>), and this property was similar between Fl-<italic>S</italic>Tg and Cy3-<italic>S</italic>Tg, although the deviation was large at the highest enzyme concentration in the Cy3 case. These results confirmed that the fluorophore type did not affect the analysis by this method.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate specificity determined by fluorescence measurement</title><p>Although the fluorescence intensity was increased when Cy3-<italic>S</italic>Tg was incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, squares), the increase was small in the case of human NTH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, squares). A difference between the <italic>E. coli</italic> and human enzymes was also found for the other probe, Cy5-DHT. An incubation with <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III resulted in a very small increase in the fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, triangles), whereas the increase by human NTH1 was intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, triangles) between Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg (circles) and Cy3-<italic>S</italic>Tg (squares). In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the substrate specificities of Endo III and NTH1 were analyzed by gel electrophoresis using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrates. <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III recognized both (5<italic>R</italic>)-Tg and (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg well, although (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg was preferred to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). On the other hand, (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg was a very poor substrate for human NTH1, as compared to the 5<italic>R</italic> isomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The activity of the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme for DHT was extremely low, whereas DHT was a good substrate for mouse NTH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These results agreed with the substrate specificity of each enzyme determined by fluorescence measurements in this study. To confirm whether the preference of <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III for (5<italic>S</italic>)-Tg, which was observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), could be shown by using the fluorescent probes, we performed kinetic analysis of the enzyme reaction. Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg and Fl-<italic>S</italic>Tg were incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic> Endo III, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 1-min intervals to obtain the velocity at each substrate concentration. The parameters determined from LineweaverâBurk plots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>) are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. This analysis revealed that the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for the 5<italic>S</italic> probe was larger by one order of magnitude than that for the 5<italic>R</italic> isomer, mainly due to the difference in the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values, and this tendency was similar to the results obtained by using the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These identical substrate specificities and comparable kinetic parameters demonstrated that our method using the fluorophore/quencher oligonucleotide probes is reliable, even for a quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Dual-probe analysis of NTH1 reactions</title><p>Since each fluorophore is excited and detected at specific wavelengths, we expected that the enzyme reactions with two probes could be analyzed in a single tube, unless the emission band of one fluorophore overlaps with the excitation band of the other. To demonstrate that such an analysis could be performed successfully, Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg and Cy5-DHT, which were good and intermediate substrates for human NTH1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), were mixed at the same concentration (50 nM), and the NTH1 reactions were analyzed at the excitation/emission wavelengths for each fluorophore. In this case, the excitation wavelengths for fluorescein and Cy5 were sufficiently separated, so that each fluorophore could be excited independently. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, the chain cleavage of Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg was only slightly affected in the presence of Cy5-DHT, but the reaction with Cy5-DHT, which was recognized less efficiently by NTH1 than Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg, was inhibited to some extent, according to our expectation. Since this type of study cannot be performed with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrates, this new method provides various novel application possibilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of cellular BER using phosphorothioate-containing probes</title><p>The probes used in the above-mentioned experiments may be applied to the analysis of strand scission by the DNA glycosylases/AP lyases in cells because product separation is not required for the detection of the enzyme activity. Therefore, the probes were investigated by using a HeLa cell extract. First, an Fl-<italic>R</italic>Tg-type oligonucleotide without the quencher (Fl-Tg-PO in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) was prepared to facilitate the detection of the bands after gel electrophoresis, and this oligonucleotide was incubated with a HeLa cell extract. Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed that this type of oligonucleotide was degraded, probably by exonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 1â4). This result indicated that fluorescence would be detected non-specifically even when a damaged base is not present in the probe. Therefore, phosphorothioate linkages, which have been used to protect antisense oligonucleotides from nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), were incorporated. Considering the enzymeâphosphate interactions found in the crystal structure of a complex between <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> Endo III and its substrate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), five phosphodiester linkages around the damaged base in each strand were kept intact. An incubation of this phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotide (Fl-Tg-PS in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) with a cell extract generated several products, including the Fl-<italic>GCGC</italic>GA 6-mer and the Fl-<italic>GCGC</italic>G 5-mer, in which the italicized letters represent nucleoside 3â²-phosphorothioate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 5â8). The 6-mer is the product generated by the chain cleavage by a bifunctional enzyme, most likely NTH1 in this case, followed by the removal of the Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde by AP endonuclease, and the 5-mer is produced by hydrolysis of the phosphodiester linkage in the Fl-<italic>GCGC</italic>GA 6-mer by an exonuclease. Since non-specific degradation could be prevented by the phosphorothioate modification, the quencher was attached to the 3â²-end of Fl-Tg-PS, and this probe (Fl-Tg-PS-Dab1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) was treated in the same manner. In the analysis by gel electrophoresis, the bands showing the chain cleavage by a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase were detected, but an unquenched band was also detected, with a mobility similar to that of the full-length probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 9â12). This unexpected product was considered to be generated by hydrolysis of the phosphodiester linkage between the 3â²-end nucleoside and the Dabcyl linker. As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>, this linker had a hydroxyl group and a bridging oxygen, and was different from that of fluorescein. This oxygen-containing part might be recognized as a nucleoside. Therefore, the phosphodiester linkage at this site was changed into a phosphorothioate. This improved probe (Fl-Tg-PS-Dab2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) yielded only the expected products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 5â8).</p><p>Using Fl-Tg-PS-Dab2, the strand scission in the BER reactions in the HeLa cell extract was monitored by fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity increased depending on the incubation time, whereas no increase was observed for the negative control (Fl-T-PS-Dab), as shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7</ext-link>. In the experiments using purified enzymes, analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed that the products had the Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehyde (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq022/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>), and thus, the increase in the fluorescence intensity observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> showed only the chain cleavage of the probes. On the other hand, the reactions in the cell extract included the 3â²-end processing of the 5â² fragment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, although it did not affect the fluorescence. Finally, the Fl-Tg-PS-Dab2 probe, as well as the Fl-T-PS-Dab control, was transfected into HeLa cells. After 5 h, fluorescence emission was distinctly detected at the nuclei of the Fl-Tg-PS-Dab2-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), whereas fluorescence was hardly observed for the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).
