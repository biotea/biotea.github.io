      <abstract>
        <p>Endosomal protein sorting controls the localization of many physiologically important proteins and is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. VPS35 is a component of the retromer complex, which mediates endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of membrane proteins such as the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Furthermore, retromer is also required for the endosomal recruitment of the actin nucleation promoting WASH complex. The VPS35 D620N mutation causes a rare form of autosomal-dominant Parkinsonâs disease (PD). Here we show that this mutant associates poorly with the WASH complex and impairs WASH recruitment to endosomes. Autophagy is impaired in cells expressing PD-mutant VPS35 or lacking WASH. The autophagy defects can be explained, at least in part, by abnormal trafficking of the autophagy protein ATG9A. Thus, the PD-causing D620N mutation in VPS35 restricts WASH complex recruitment to endosomes, and reveals a novel role for the WASH complex in autophagosome formation.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The retromer complex is a conserved membrane-associated protein complex that functions in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway. Retromer consists of a cargo-selective complex (CSC) comprising VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29, along with a sorting nexin dimer consisting of SNX1 or SNX2 with SNX5 or SNX6. Many membrane proteins (often referred to as âcargoâ) depend on retromer for their respective localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A well-studied cargo protein for retromer-mediated endosome-to-Golgi retrieval is the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) that operates as a lysosomal hydrolase receptor, sorting acid hydrolases for exit from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) before returning to the Golgi via the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p>
    <p>Recently, it has been shown that retromer function is important for more than endosome-to-Golgi retrieval. The retromer complex is responsible for the endosomal recruitment of the WASH complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, a protein complex that, together with Arp2/3, mediates actin patch formation on endosomes to facilitate protein sorting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. WASH complex activity is especially important for the endosome-to-cell surface recycling of certain membrane proteins, including the Î²2-adrenergic receptor, Î±5Î²1 integrin, the glucose transporter GLUT-1, and the T-cell receptor in T-cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, reviewed previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Cargo proteins that require the activity of the WASH complex for their trafficking are therefore indirectly dependent on retromer, even if retromer does not participate directly in their sorting. The recruitment of the WASH complex to endosomes is mediated by interactions between the extended tail of the FAM21 protein of the WASH complex and VPS35 in the retromer CSC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, a protein called FKBP15 (also known as FKBP133 and WAFL), which has been implicated in nerve growth-cone collapse, interacts with both the FAM21 tail and VPS35, although its function with the WASH and retromer complexes is unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>Impaired endosomal protein sorting underlies many neurological diseases. One component of the WASH complex, strumpellin, is mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Mutation of another component of the WASH complex, KIAA1033 (also known as SWIP), results in autosomal recessive intellectual disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In addition, recent reports have revealed that Parkinsonâs disease (PD) can be caused by a rare autosomal-dominant <italic>VPS35</italic> mutation that results in an aspartate to an asparagine substitution at residue 620 (D620N)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The mechanism through which the D620N mutation exerts its effects is presently unknown.</p>
    <p>Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a degradative pathway by which the breakdown of cellular proteins releases amino acids necessary for survival, particularly under starvation or stress conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Autophagy also removes damaged mitochondria and certain intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Salmonella</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Moreover, autophagy is of profound importance in the clearance of intracytoplasmic aggregate-prone proteins, such as those formed by the polyglutamine-expanded repeats in huntingtin, the Huntingtonâs disease-causing protein, as well as Î±-synuclein, the major component of PD-associated Lewy bodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In fact, autophagy appears to be compromised in the brains of PD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and excess Î±-synuclein inhibits autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The autophagic pathway is especially sensitive to perturbations of endosomal protein sorting, and thus makes a plausible downstream target of defects associated with retromer-mediated sorting. In fact, depletion of yeast retromer components impairs autophagic activity, although results in mammalian cells are at present unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here we show that the PD-causing mutation in VPS35 destabilizes the retromerâWASH complex interaction, leading to reduced endosomal localization of the WASH complex. We further show that the WASH complex is necessary for autophagosome formation and that cells expressing the PD-causing <italic>VPS35</italic> allele exhibit defects in autophagy, as well as in the trafficking of the multipass transmembrane autophagy protein ATG9A. This provides important mechanistic insights into the pathology of the PD-causing <italic>VPS35</italic> mutation and demonstrates a novel role for the WASH complex in autophagy.</p>

        <title>VPS35 D620N exhibits impaired binding to the WASH complex</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref> shows human VPS35 residues 610â680 aligned with VPS35 homologues from other well-studied eukaryotes. The D620N mutation falls within the horseshoe-shaped region that comprises many helical repeats and folds around VPS29 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). We also highlight the recently identified H675R VPS35 mutation that abolishes binding to VPS29, an interaction that is required for the subsequent association of VPS35 and the WASH complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. As the D620N mutation lies within the VPS29-binding region, we tested whether it affected the interaction between VPS35 and VPS29, as well as with other retromer-interacting proteins.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type (WT) VPS35 or VPS35 D620N were lysed along with untransfected HeLa cells and incubated with anti-GFP antisera (lanes 1â3). Similarly, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a panel of GFP-VPS35 constructs, and lysates were incubated with anti-GFP to recover the expressed protein (lanes 4â9). Both stably and transiently transfected WT VPS35 co-immunoprecipitated the VPS26 and VPS29 retromer CSC subunits, along with strumpellin and WASH1 of the WASH complex as well as FKBP15 (lanes 2 and 4). The D620N mutant associated normally with both VPS26 and VPS29 but showed reduced associations with FKBP15 and the WASH complex proteins (compare lanes 2 with 3 and 4 with 6). The effect of the D620N mutant was not, however, as pronounced as that of the H675R mutant, which cannot bind VPS29 and completely fails to associate with the WASH complex (compare lanes 6 and 7). The VPS35 L108P mutation within the conserved PRLYL motif (lane 5) blocked binding to VPS26 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) but did not affect interactions with either VPS29 or the WASH complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Two truncation constructs of VPS35 confirmed that binding of the WASH complex and FKBP15 to VPS35 occurs independently of VPS26 but requires the carboxy-terminal region of VPS35 and proper interaction with VPS29.</p>
        <p>We next used antisera against VPS26 to immunoprecipitate the retromer CSC and determine the effect the D620N mutation on the association of the CSC with the WASH complex. Components of the WASH complex (FAM21, strumpellin and WASH1) were readily detected in association with the retromer CSC in HeLa cells, as well as cells stably expressing WT VPS29 or WT VPS35, but not in cells expressing VPS35 D620N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The reduced level of endogenous VPS29 that co-precipitated using the anti-VPS26 antibody in the VPS29-GFP lysate was due to the expression of the GFP-tagged VPS29 that competes for binding to VPS35 displacing the endogenous VPS29âan effect not observed when a mutant of VPS29 (V90D) that interacts weakly with VPS35 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) is expressed instead (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Besides competing with endogenous VPS29, the expression of VPS29-GFP does not affect the interactions of the retromer CSC.</p>
        <p>To test if the VPS35 D620N mutation affects its association with VPS29 using another approach, we employed cells stably expressing VPS29 V90D. We have previously reported that transient overexpression of WT VPS35 can overcome the VPS29 V90D mutation and enable the mutant VPS29 protein to co-immunoprecipitate both VPS26 and the WASH complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The VPS35 H675R mutant, however, fails to rescue VPS29 V90D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, cells stably expressing VPS29-GFP V90D were transiently transfected with mCherry-tagged WT VPS35, D620N or H675R as well as mCherry-FAM21 tail as an additional control. In lane 2, transient expression of WT VPS35 enabled VPS29 V90D to co-immunoprecipitate VPS26, FKBP15 as well as the WASH complex proteins FAM21 and strumpellin. The H675R mutant (lane 4) cannot interact with VPS29 and therefore could not rescue the VPS29 V90D mutant. The D620N mutant (lane 3) interacted with the VPS29 V90D mutant and promoted an association with VPS26 that was indistinguishable from WT VPS35, but markedly less FAM21 and strumpellin proteins (that is, WASH complex) as well as FKBP15 associated with the VPS29-GFP V90D protein. The expression of the mCherry-tagged FAM21 tail did not affect the interactions of VPS29 (lane 5).</p>
        <p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> suggest that the VPS35 D620N mutation does not affect VPS29 binding or CSC assembly, but reduces interaction with the WASH complex and FKBP15. To further explore these effects, cells stably expressing WT VPS35 or the D620N mutant were lysed using buffers of differing stringencies. The HEPES-based buffer has lower stringency, while the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lysis buffer has a higher stringency, as it contains more salt and detergent. Following lysis, samples of equal volume of the HEPES and PBS lysates were mixed to produce a lysate of intermediate stringency. To ensure that the GFP-tagged constructs could associate with FKBP15 or the WASH complex without competition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of endogenous VPS35. The GFP-tagged murine VPS35 constructs are resistant to the siRNA targeting endogenous VPS35. As before, WT VPS35 co-immunoprecipitated WASH complex components WASH1, FAM21, strumpellin, as well as FKBP15, with some reduction in the levels of WASH complex proteins and FKBP15 in the higher stringency PBS buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The D620N mutant, however, exhibited a marked reduction in both WASH complex and FKBP15 binding in the intermediate stringency buffer (H/P) and no association in the higher stringency PBS buffer (P). Levels of VPS26 and VPS29 did not change significantly, indicating that there was no destabilization of the retromer complex due to either the D620N mutation or the different lysis buffers.</p>
        <p>The sensitivity of the retromerâWASH complex association to different lysis buffer conditions was confirmed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>, where cells stably expressing either GFP-tagged VPS29 or the FAM21 tail were lysed with either HEPES, PBS or the mixed lysis buffer prior to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-GFP. In this experiment, interactions between retromer and both the WASH complex and FKBP15 are lost with increasing lysis buffer stringency, but the interactions that underpin assembly of the retromer CSC are retained.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>VPS35 binding to WASH complex is independent of FKBP15</title>
        <p>The D620N mutation affects binding of VPS35 to the WASH complex and almost abolishes association with FKBP15. To determine if loss of the VPS35-FKBP15 interaction is destabilizing the retromerâWASH complex interaction, cells expressing WT GFP-VPS35 were treated with siRNA to silence FKBP15 expression. Lysates were then generated using the buffers of differing stringency and GFP-tagged VPS35 recovered by IP. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, there was no pronounced change in the association of the WASH complex with WT GFP-VPS35 after FKBP15 depletion, indicating that the D620N-mediated loss of FKBP15 interaction with VPS35 does not cause the defective WASH complex association with the D620N VPS35 mutant.</p>
        <p>To further delineate the defects associated with the D620N mutant, the cells stably expressing GFP-tagged WT or D620N VPS35 were treated with siRNA to silence the expression of either endogenous VPS35, FKBP15 or the FAM21 or KIAA1033 components of the WASH complex. It has been shown previously that knockdown of one WASH complex protein affects the stability and levels of the others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Following knockdown, lysates were incubated with anti-GFP to recover VPS35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). For this experiment, twice the amount of material used in previous experiments was analysed using the HEPES-based buffer to create conditions that can be considered the most permissive for retaining retromerâWASH complex interactions. WT VPS35 interacted with the WASH complex in the absence of FKBP15, as demonstrated by the presence of strumpellin and WASH1 in lane 3. Similarly, FKBP15 co-immunoprecipitated with WT VPS35 after siRNA knockdown of FAM21 or KIAA1033, although at reduced levels (see lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the D620N mutant failed to co-immunoprecipitate FKBP15 in cells where the WASH complex was silenced but retained an interaction with WASH complex proteins when FKBP15 expression was abolished. Thus, binding of the WASH complex to retromer appears to occur largely independently of FKBP15. This is consistent with co-IP of WASH components by GFP-tagged VPS29 after knockdown of FKBP15, as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref> and in previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although FKBP15 is not strictly necessary for the retromerâWASH complex association, increasing levels of FKBP15 by transient transfection can enhance the retromerâWASH complex interaction in the higher stringency PBS lysis buffer for WT VPS35 but not for the D620N mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

        <title>VPS35 D620N impairs WASH complex recruitment to endosomes</title>
        <p>Retromer mediates the endosomal recruitment of both the WASH complex and FKBP15 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). VPS35 recruits the WASH complex through interactions with the FAM21 tail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To test the effect of the D620N mutation on the localization of FKBP15 and the WASH complex, cells stably expressing either WT GFP-VPS35 or the D620N mutant were treated with siRNA to silence endogenous VPS35 expression. After fixation, the cells were double-labelled with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody and antisera against FKBP15 or FAM21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Quantification of the fluorescence intensities indicates that the D620N-expressing cells have reduced endosomally localized FKBP15 and FAM21 compared with the WT cells, compatible with decreased endosomal recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
        <p>To more rigorously examine the effect of the D620N mutation on the membrane association of FKBP15 and the WASH complex, we separated cytoplasmic proteins in the supernatant (S) from membrane and membrane-associated proteins in the pellet (P) fraction by centrifugation. Cells expressing the D620N mutant had less membrane-associated FKBP15 and strumpellin both in the presence of endogenous VPS35 and most significantly when endogenous VPS35 was silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). The cells expressing WT VPS35 showed some reduction in the membrane association of FKBP15 and strumpellin when endogenous VPS35 was silenced, possibly due to minor inhibitory effects of the GFP moiety added to the amino terminus of VPS35. These data, taken together, demonstrate that the D620N mutation results in a reduction of the membrane association of FKBP15 and the WASH complex.</p>

        <title>VPS35 D620N expression mimics WASH-associated phenotypes</title>
        <p>Thus far, we have reported an impaired association of the D620N mutant for the WASH complex and FKBP15 but the functional significance has not been elucidated. Previous experiments have shown that siRNA knockdown of FKBP15 does not impede endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of a CD8-CIMPR chimera reporter protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Similarly, D620N-expressing cells exhibited apparently normal VPS26, SNX1, CIMPR, and LAMP1 localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2aâc</xref>).</p>
        <p>We observed a cell spreading defect in cells expressing VPS35 D620N, compared with their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), which we confirmed in independent clones. Cell spreading defects also occur in cells overexpressing the FAM21 tail, which competes with the endogenous WASH complex for binding to retromer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> or WASH1 knockdown cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Thus, the cell spreading defect in the VPS35 D620N cells is consistent with the reduced affinity of the mutant VPS35 for the WASH complex, resulting in WASH complex mislocalization. While CIMPR and retromer exhibited normal localization in the D620N-mutant cells, we observed altered localization of GLUT-1, membrane protein that requires the WASH complex for its steady-state localization to the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The cells expressing the VPS35 D620N mutant displayed reduced cell surface staining of GLUT-1 and increased intracellular staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). As the input lysates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref> showed that WASH1 levels remain essentially the same in both the VPS35 WT and D620N cell lines, the WASH-related phenotypes observed in D620N cells are not due to changes in the steady-state level of WASH1 but likely due to WASH complex mislocalization.</p>

        <title>VPS35 D620N impairs autophagy</title>
        <p>Proper endosomal function is important for autophagy, prompting us to test if the VPS35 D620N mutation affects this process. Autophagy can be measured by examining levels of LC3-II, the only protein known to associate specifically with autophagosomes, as its levels correlate with autophagosome numbers. Because changes in LC3-II levels and autophagosome numbers may be due to altered autophagosome formation or degradation, one can uncouple these processes using drugs like bafilomycin A1, which blocks autophagosome degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, thus allowing assessment of changes in formation alone. Interestingly, the stable GFP-VPS35 D620N cell lines showed lower LC3-II levels than their WT counterparts both with and without bafilomycin, indicating defective autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref> replicates this result in independent clones of GFP-VPS35 WT and D620N cells. In addition, knocking down endogenous VPS35 in both sets of clones stably expressing GFP-VPS35 wild type and D620N did not appear to alter the levels of LC3-II, as the difference between WT and mutant cells remained pronounced, regardless of the presence of endogenous VPS35 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4câe</xref>). Upon transient transfection of a fluorescent LC3 construct, we observed fewer punctate LC3 structures in cells expressing GFP-VPS35 D620N, compared with wild-type, indicating fewer autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm a functional defect in autophagy, we transfected the cell lines with a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged aggregation-prone model autophagy substrate, huntingtin exon 1 containing 74 glutamine repeats. The percentage of transfected cells with huntingtin aggregates correlates directly with huntingtin abundance, which is, in turn, autophagy dependent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The D620N-mutant cells consistently had a higher percentage of transfected cells containing aggregates, consistent with impaired autophagosome formation and autophagic clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Furthermore, cells expressing VPS35 D620N showed increased levels of another autophagy substrate, PD-variant Î±-synuclein A53T, relative to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>).</p>
        <p>VPS35 depletion by RNA interference only resulted in modest changes in LC3-II levels, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4hâj</xref>, consistent with recent data using VPS29 depletion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This is likely because loss of VPS35 destabilizes the entire retromer CSC and has wide-ranging effects on multiple pathways, including defects in CIMPR retrieval that impact cathepsin D trafficking and lysosome biogenesis. Consequently, VPS35 depletion will have pleiotropic consequences on endosomal protein sorting, resulting in the possible masking of the autophagosome formation defect by other compensatory effects.</p>

        <title>Perturbation of WASH complex binding disrupts autophagy</title>
        <p>As VPS35 D620N exhibits decreased affinity for the WASH complex, we mimicked this reduced binding by overexpressing the FAM21 tail, which displaces the endogenous WASH complex from retromer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. FAM21 tail overexpression reproducibly reduced LC3-II levels both with and without bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). The effect was not as pronounced as that in the stably expressing D620N cells, as FAM21 tail was transiently transfected and hence not present in every cell.</p>
        <p>In an epistasis experiment where the FAM21 tail was expressed in the VPS35 stable cell lines, we observed that overexpression of the FAM21 tail decreased autophagosome formation (as indicated by reduced LC3-II levels under bafilomycin-treated conditions) in WT cells but not in D620N-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). In the mutant line, WASH complex binding to retromer is already impaired and thus overexpression of the FAM21 tail has no additive influence, suggesting that the observed effects on autophagosome formation are indeed due to the decreased association between VPS35 and the WASH complex. The importance of WASH complex activity for autophagosome formation was underscored by finding that siRNA knockdown of WASH1 reduced LC3-II levels with and without bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). In addition, depletion of WASH1 leads to fewer GFP-LC3 vesicles, again pointing to the impaired autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p>
        <p>While the VPS35 D620N mutation hinders retromer binding not only to the WASH complex but also to FKBP15, knockdown of FKBP15 had a much less robust effect on autophagy than WASH1 depletion, as evidenced by only modest, non-statistically significant effects on endogenous LC3-II levels, no difference in GFP-LC3 vesicle numbers, and no difference in the percentage of cells with mutant huntingtin aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5hâj</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that FKBP15 is not an essential part of the complex and that that the WASH complex can still bind to retromer in the absence of FKBP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>).</p>

        <title>VPS35 D620N and WASH depletion affect trafficking of ATG9A</title>
        <p>The autophagy pathway requires multiple autophagy-related genes, including ATG9A, a multipass transmembrane protein. Under basal conditions, mammalian ATG9A localizes to the TGN and recycling endosomes, and redistributes to a more peripheral pool after autophagy induction by nutrient deprivation (reviewed by Zavodszky <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p>
        <p>We observed that some ATG9A colocalized with VPS35, which is known to reside primarily on sorting endosomes, suggesting that ATG9A may traffic through compartments at which retromer acts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). A proximity ligation assay, which yields a signal when two proteins of interest are within 40ânm of each other, indicated that ATG9 and VPS35 are found in the same compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). A signal is observed in untransfected cells, as well as cells stably expressing WT and D620N VPS35. The signal, although weak when compared with the signal obtained for anti-VPS35 and anti-VPS26, is specific and does not occur when anti-VPS35 is used alone. Furthermore, ATG9A colocalizes in part with WASH complex components at endosomes, thus suggesting that its trafficking may be perturbed by the WASH complex mislocalization associated with the VPS35 D620N mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
        <p>In cells stably expressing WT GFP-VPS35, ATG9A colocalized with both the TGN marker TGN46 and VPS35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1,2</xref>). However, the D620N cells showed increased colocalization between ATG9A and the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). In the D620N cells, the morphology of the TGNâand with it, ATG9Aâchanged dramatically from clusters to elongated perinuclear structures that were often circular or semicircular in shape. The aberrant TGN and ATG9A morphology in D620N cells was maintained under starvation conditions, and was present regardless of whether or not endogenous VPS35 has been depleted. Throughout a 2 h starvation period, ATG9A gradually dispersed from its basal perinuclear location in WT cells and fragmentation of the TGN was observed, consistent with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). However, in D620N-expressing cells, ATG9A and the TGN were maintained in the perinuclear area at all time points and did not undergo fragmentation. Aberrant Golgi morphology was confirmed with an independent TGN marker, Golgin-97, as well as the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). The gross morphological changes of the TGN and ATG9A and their increased colocalization both suggest that normal trafficking of ATG9A is perturbed in D620N-expressing cells, and perhaps ATG9A is trapped in an abnormal perinuclear compartment.</p>
        <p>Upon knockdown of WASH1 itself, colocalization of ATG9A with TGN46 once again was increased in the knockdown cells when compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 3â6</xref>). TGN46 and ATG9A morphology were also altered, although instead of elongated structures, we observed that ATG9A and TGN46 resided in tight clusters and remained so even upon starvation. This contrasts with control cells, where ATG9A noticeably dispersed upon starvation, and some fragmentation of the TGN46 marker was observed as well. Once again, other markers confirm an alteration of Golgi and TGN morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c</xref>). While the phenotype of WASH1-depleted cells does not perfectly mimic the morphological disturbance observed with VPS35 D620N, it is important to note that the PD mutation does not abolish all WASH complex binding to retromer, and it also does not result in a depletion of WASH1 levels. Thus, the scenarios are not identical, but both serve to illustrate that ultimately, the activity of correctly localized WASH1 is necessary for proper ATG9A localization and trafficking. These effects on ATG9A localization may contribute to the defective autophagosome formation caused by the D620N mutation, as previous studies have demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological manipulations that impede ATG9A redistribution from perinuclear compartments inhibit autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p>
        <p>ATG9A acts early in the autophagy pathway and traffics to compartments that become LC3-positive to interact with phagophores and autophagosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. ATG9A is thought to deliver membrane to growing phagophores, and its depletion has detrimental effects on autophagy initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In cells expressing WT GFP-VPS35, many of the LC3-positive autophagic structures also contained ATG9A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 7,8</xref>). However, a significantly smaller proportion of LC3 vesicles contained ATG9A in cells expressing the D620N-mutant form of VPS35. WASH1 depletion had a similar effect, as knockdown of this protein resulted in fewer GFP-LC3 puncta containing ATG9A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 9,10</xref>). Our results indicate that the VPS35 D620N mutation and WASH1 depletion both impair ATG9A trafficking to autophagosomes.</p>
        <p>Although ATG9A mislocalization is a likely contributor to the autophagosome formation impairment seen in VPS35 D620N cells and WASH1-depleted cells, it is unlikely to be the only mechanism by which autophagy is compromised. We examined another early key autophagy protein, ATG16L1, and found no gross alterations in the distribution or appearance of mStrawberry-ATG16L1-positive vesicles in either VPS35 D620N cells or WASH1 knockdown conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) However, it is interesting to note that in VPS35 D620N cells, we observed a decrease in the proportion of ATG16L1 vesicles containing ATG9A, echoing the phenotype observed with the diminished ability of LC3 vesicles to acquire ATG9A. A similar, although non-significant trend was observed upon WASH1 knockdown. Recent work has suggested that ATG9A and ATG16L1 vesicles, which enter the cell via distinct endocytic pathways, coalesce in recycling endosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In fact, the recycling endosome marker RAB11 also shows altered morphology in both VPS35 D620N cells and WASH1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p>
        <p>Autophagy is known to protect against pro-apoptotic insults, and autophagy disruption predisposes to cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. A previous study indicated that the D620N VPS35 mutation is associated with impaired protection of neuronal cells from the mitochondrial toxin MPP+ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). We found that knockdown of WASH1 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells decreases autophagosome formation and increases cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

      <p>The retromer complex recruits the WASH complex to endosomes through VPS35 binding to the FAM21 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Our data suggest that a major molecular effect of the VPS35 D620N mutation is to reduce retromer association with the WASH complex as well as FKBP15, without affecting CSC assembly. The WASH complex functions to promote F-actin patch formation on endosomes and its activity is associated with endosomal protein sorting of multiple cargo proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Indeed, we find that cells with the D620N VPS35 mutation have decreased membrane-associated WASH complex components and phenotypes such as impaired cell spreading and GLUT-1 mislocalization, seen in cells with compromised WASH-complex function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
      <p>The most obvious disease-relevant phenotype that we associated with the D620N mutation is impaired autophagosome formation. Similar autophagy defects were seen in WASH1 knockdown cells or in cells overexpressing the FAM21 tail, which inhibits association of the WASH complex with VPS35 by competition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. While disturbed retromerâWASH complex association may have multiple consequences for autophagosome formation, we have shown that the D620N mutation, as well as WASH1 depletion, affects ATG9A localization and trafficking. We recently showed that ATG9A is internalized from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and travels via early endosomes to the recycling endosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The data shown here indicate that the VPS35 D620N mutation or WASH1 depletion result in ATG9A becoming trapped in a perinuclear compartment positive for a TGN marker. It is, however, difficult to distinguish between proteins in the TGN and recycling endosomes even by electron microscopy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, raising the possibility that the ATG9A is retained in the recycling endosome and is unable to continue its normal trafficking to phagophores and autophagosomes. In fact, the recycling endosome marker RAB11 also shows perturbed morphology in both VPS35 D620N-expressing and WASH1-depleted cells. Alterations in ATG9A trafficking result in a smaller proportion of LC3-positive autophagic structures acquiring ATG9A and likely contributes to the decreased autophagy phenotype. Other perturbations that cause similar ATG9A trafficking defects also impair autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Interestingly, autophagosome formation deficits associated with defective ATG9A trafficking are also seen with Î±-synuclein overexpression, which models other autosomal-dominant forms of PD caused by Î±-synuclein gene duplications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Although no obvious changes were observed in the distribution of another important early autophagy protein, ATG16L1, it is possible that other autophagy components might be affected.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have reported that the D620N mutation in VPS35 can alter CIMPR localization and impair cathepsin D trafficking, resulting in lysosomal enlargement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. We found no alterations in CIMPR or LAMP1 staining between cells stably expressing WT or D620N-mutant VPS35. Furthermore, the decreases in LC3-II levels in the VPS35 D620N cells point to defective autophagosome formation, rather than degradation, which would be expected with lysosome perturbations. It is nonetheless possible that the VPS35 D620N mutation leads to additional phenotypesâincluding those affecting lysosomal function and/or phenotypes specific to neuronal cellsâthat are not explored here.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that the D620N mutation is a partial loss of function mutation of just one role of VPS35: that of binding the WASH complex and FKBP15, and not a generalized VPS35 hypomorph. Unlike a knockdown of VPS35 that abolishes retromer function and leads to mislocalization of many proteins that traffic between the endosome and either Golgi or cell surface, the D620N mutation appears to affect only those aspects of retromer function that are linked to the WASH complex. The GLUT-1 protein is especially dependent on the activity of the WASH complex for its localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and hence localization of GLUT-1 is perturbed in cells expressing the D620N mutation. Similarly, cell spreading is also tightly linked to WASH complex function and the D620N cells exhibit a cell spreading defect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The retromer complex can still function in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval without the WASH complex, as demonstrated in yeast where the WASH complex is not conserved and yet retromer works to retrieve Vps10p from endosomes to the Golgi.</p>
      <p>Patients carrying this D620N mutation only manifest disease in their 6th decade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. If the D620N mutant were to drastically affect the localization of a great many membrane proteins, one would expect a more severe disease and earlier onset. Nonetheless, we cannot formally exclude that the D620N mutation has other effects in addition to impaired WASH complex binding and a resultant autophagy deficiency, and that some of these unexplored phenotypes could be due to a gain of function of the mutant protein.</p>
      <p>The VPS35 mutation also exhibits defective binding to FKBP15 and our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the retromer CSC, WASH complex and FKBP15 form a tripartite complex. The precise function of FKBP15 remains to be determined and is likely to be multifaceted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Unlike the WASH complex, FKBP15 is not conserved in either <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our data suggest that FKBP15 is unlikely to be an important contributor to the autophagy phenotype. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the loss of retromerâFKBP15 interaction resulting from the D620N mutation may contribute to the pathology of PD in other ways.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, another PD gene, DNAJC13 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), encodes a protein that has recently been shown to associate with the FAM21 protein of the WASH complexâthe same subunit known to interact with VPS35 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Thus, the WASH complex associates with two known PD proteins, suggesting that WASH complex function may be especially important for the pathology of PD.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our data show that the D620N PD-causing VPS35 mutation impairs binding to the WASH complex and FKBP15. We found that loss of WASH complex binding was likely responsible for the impaired autophagosome formation resulting from the D620N VPS35 mutation. This autophagy defect was associated with abnormal ATG9A trafficking. Impaired autophagy is a highly plausible contributor to PD pathogenesis, as it would exacerbate many of the pathologies associated with PD, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial abnormalities, increased levels of reactive oxygen species and enhanced susceptibility to cell death.</p>

        <title>Proximity ligation assay</title>
        <p>The proximity ligation assay kit was obtained from Sigma and used according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded onto 13âmm coverslips and allowed to grow in culture for 24âh. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-VPS35 and either anti-VPS26 or anti-ATG9A. Following incubation with the primary antibodies, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to oligonucleotide primers. The primers were ligated and then rolling circle amplification was used to create a reaction product that is observable by microscopy due to hybridization of fluorescently labelled nucleotides. Successful production of a DNA product requires that the primary antibodies bind their respective antigens and reside within 40ânm of each other. Coverslips were mounted on slides and imaged by epifluorescence microscopy, as described in the previous section.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram showing an alignment of the human VPS35 sequence (residues 610â680) with homologues from other well-studied eukaryotes. The D620N mutation is highlighted along with the H675R mutation that blocks binding to VPS29. The position of the D620N mutation of VPS35 is shown on the three-dimensional structure along with the H675R mutation and the V90 and I91 residues of VPS29 that mediate binding to VPS35 (PDB ID. 2R17). (<bold>b</bold>) Cells stably expressing WT or D620N GFP-VPS35 or otherwise transiently transfected with a panel of GFP-VPS35 constructs were lysed and the respective GFP-tagged protein recovered by immunoprecipitation (IP). (<bold>c</bold>) Untransfected HeLa cells or cells stably expressing VPS29-GFP, GFP-VPS35 wild-type or GFP-VPS35 D620N were lysed and the lysates incubated with anti-VPS26 to IP the retromer CSC. (<bold>d</bold>) Cells stably expressing the VPS29-GFP V90D mutant that cannot assemble with VPS35 were transiently transfected with mCherry-tagged WT VPS35, D620N and H675R constructs, along with an additional control of mCherry-FAM21 tail. Cells were lysed 48âh post transfection, and VPS29-GFP V90D and associated proteins were recovered by anti-GFP native IP. Blots shown are representative of experiments replicated at least twice.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-VPS35 WT and D620N were transfected with mRFP-LC3 for 24âh, immunostained for endogenous ATG9A, and imaged by confocal microscopy. (<bold>b</bold>) Colocalization is expressed in terms of Manderâs coefficient M1 to indicate the proportion of LC3 intensities that also contain ATG9A intensities. A representative experiment of three independent experiments is shown, in which at least 33 cells were analysed per condition. Error bars indicate s.e.m., and ***<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 by 2-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test. (<bold>c</bold>) HeLa cells depleted of WASH1 were transfected with GFP-LC3 for 24âh, immunostained for endogenous ATG9A, and imaged by confocal microscopy. (<bold>d</bold>) Colocalization expressed as M1, as in <bold>b</bold>. A representative experiment of two independent experiments is shown, in which at least 24 cells were analysed per condition. Error bars indicate s.e.m., and ***<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 by 2-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test. Scale bars in (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>c</bold>), 10âÎ¼m. In <bold>b</bold>,<bold>d</bold>, colocalization was measured for the entire area of the cell slice in each image. In order to ensure that results were not confounded by diffuse nuclear staining often observed in the LC3 channel, the analyses were repeated with the nuclei excluded, and all of the results remained statistically significant.</p>
