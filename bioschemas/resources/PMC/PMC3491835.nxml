      <abstract>
        <p>Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia severely compromise quality of life and are poorly controlled by current antipsychotics. While 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor blockade holds special promise, molecular substrates underlying their control of cognition remain unclear. Using a proteomic strategy, we show that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors physically interact with several proteins of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, including mTOR. Further, 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor activation increased mTOR signalling in rodent prefrontal cortex (PFC). Linking this signalling event to cognitive impairment, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin prevented deficits in social cognition and novel object discrimination induced by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonists. In two developmental models of schizophrenia, specifically neonatal phencyclidine treatment and post-weaning isolation rearing, the activity of mTOR was enhanced in the PFC, and rapamycin, like 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonists, reversed these cognitive deficits. These observations suggest that recruitment of mTOR by prefrontal 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors contributes to the perturbed cognition in schizophrenia, offering new vistas for its therapeutic control.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>There is increasing recognition that cognitive deficits in schizophrenia severely compromise the real world function of patients. Despite their efficacy against positive symptoms, currently available antipsychotics are poorly effective against cognitive dysfunction. Accordingly, intensive efforts are being made to improve our understanding of pathological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and to identify novel strategies for its alleviation (Gray &amp; Roth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2007</xref>; Insel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2010</xref>; Millan et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Amongst mechanisms currently under study, 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors are of special interest, in as much as their blockade consistently enhances mnemonic performance in a broad range of procedures in rodents (Hirst et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2006</xref>; Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>; Marcos et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2008</xref>; Rogers &amp; Hagan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2001</xref>; Woolley et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2001</xref>), while 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor antagonists also promote the corticolimbic release of acetylcholine, glutamate and monoamines to favour cognitive processes (Codony et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2011</xref>). Further, there is preliminary evidence for pro-cognitive properties of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor antagonists in humans (Codony et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2011</xref>; Johnson et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2008</xref>; Mitchell &amp; Neumaier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2005</xref>). Nonetheless, the nature of signalling mechanisms mediating the influence of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors on cognition remains unclear, complicating analysis of their significance to the induction and control of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and other disorders. 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors stimulate Gs and adenylyl cyclase (Millan et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2008</xref>). They also activate extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1,2 via the Src-family tyrosine kinase Fyn (Yun et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2007</xref>). However, these pathways exert a positive influence on cognition (Millan et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2012</xref>). Hence, it is unlikely that their inactivation would transduce the pro-cognitive effects of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor antagonists, raising the possibility that alternative coupling mechanisms are involved.</p>
      <p>In light of recent evidence that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can interact with extensive protein networks, including proteins dedicated to signal transduction (Bockaert et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2004</xref>), we used a proteomic strategy to identify proteins potentially associated with 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors. Based on identification of several proteins of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (including mTOR itself, Raptor, Neurofibromin 1 and Vps34, a class III phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase), we then undertook an extensive suite of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies to determine whether 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor engagement of mTOR contributes to their deleterious influence upon cognition, specifically in developmental models of schizophrenia.</p>

        <title>5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors physically interact with the mTOR complex 1</title>
        <p>Due to the low density of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors in mammalian brain and the lack of an antibody permitting immunoprecipitation yields compatible with mass spectrometry analysis, we purified receptor-interacting proteins by co-immunoprecipitation with a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Functionality of HA-5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors was assessed by the ability of 5-HT and two synthetic 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonists, WAY181187 and WAY208466 (Schechter et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2008</xref>), to increase cAMP production (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). Analysis of affinity-purified proteins by SDSâPAGE revealed the presence of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor and that were not detected in control immunoprecipitations performed in the presence of HA peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1A</xref>). Correspondingly, systematic analysis by high-resolution nanoflow liquid tandem mass spectrometry of gel lanes identified 28 proteins, which specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B</xref> and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). These proteins were considered as potential partners of the receptor, though one cannot rule out the possibility that some of them do not interact with the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor but that their presence reflects some affinity for the anti-HA antibody. Compared with what would be expected by chance, the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor âinteractomeâ showed a remarkable enrichment in proteins implicated in intracellular signalling pathways, brain development, learning and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1C</xref>). These include several proteins of the mTOR pathway such as mTOR itself and Raptor, which together with GÎ²L, constitute the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1; Laplante &amp; Sabatini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2012</xref>; Swiech et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>; Wang &amp; Proud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>; Zhou &amp; Huang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2010</xref>). mTOR also forms the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which includes specific members (Rictor, mSin1 and Protor1/2) in addition to mTOR and GÎ²L but is insensitive to acute rapamycin treatment (Laplante &amp; Sabatini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2012</xref>; Swiech et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>; Wang &amp; Proud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>; Zhou &amp; Huang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2010</xref>). None of the proteins specific to mTORC2 were detected in the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor interactome, suggesting a specific recruitment of mTORC1 by this receptor. The 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor also recruited Tti1 and Tel2, two proteins critical for assembly and activity of mTORC1 and 2 (Kaizuka et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2010</xref>). In addition, two proteins of the pathways leading to mTOR activation were identified: the Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) Neurofibromin 1 and the class III phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase Vps34 (Swiech et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>; Zhou &amp; Huang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B</xref>). Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis confirmed the constitutive interaction of mTOR, Raptor and Neurofibromin 1 with the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor in HEK-293 cells and indicated that their recruitment was not further increased upon receptor activation by 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref>). Importantly, mTOR specifically co-immunoprecipitated with native 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor expressed in mice brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1E</xref>), indicating that they form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further supporting a specific association of mTORC1 with the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor, neither mTOR nor Raptor co-immunoprecipitated with the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor (another Gs-coupled 5-HT receptor) expressed in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1D</xref>). Likewise, mTOR did not co-immunoprecipitate with a truncated 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor deleted of the 49 carboxy-terminal residues (5-HT<sub>6</sub>Î49Ct, Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>), indicating a role of the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor C-terminal domain in its physical association with mTORC1. Nonetheless, other parts of the receptor sequence were necessary to mTORC1 recruitment as mTOR did not bind to the receptor C-terminus in GST pull-downs using the entire receptor C-terminal sequence as bait (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors activate the mTOR pathway in HEK-293 cells via a mechanism requiring both the canonical phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt/Rheb pathway and 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor/mTOR physical interaction</title>
        <p>Exposure of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-expressing HEK-293 cells to 5-HT (1 ÂµM) induced a transient (&lt;5 min) increase of mTOR phosphorylation at Ser<sup>2448</sup>, which reflects mTOR activation status, and of its substrate p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) at Thr<sup>389</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>). 5-HT induced a more sustained (â30 min) increase in the phosphorylation of two other downstream substrates of mTOR, 4EBP1 (at Ser<sup>65</sup>) and S6 (at Ser<sup>240/244</sup>). The 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of mTOR and its substrates was prevented by SB258585 (10 ÂµM), a specific 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor antagonist, and was reproduced by WAY181187 and WAY208466 (1 ÂµM each, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2B</xref>). 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-elicited mTOR signalling was comparable to that induced by insulin-like growth factor 1 or epidermal growth factor (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3</xref>) and was strongly decreased in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Î49Ct receptor, which did not co-immunoprecipitate with mTOR but fully activated cAMP production compared with cells expressing the wild-type receptor (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>In line with activation of mTORC1 by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors, phosphorylation of p70S6K (Thr<sup>389</sup>), 4EBP1 (Ser<sup>65</sup>) and S6 (Ser<sup>240/244</sup>) by WAY181187 were prevented by rapamycin, a specific mTORC1 inhibitor, whereas, as expected, phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser<sup>2448</sup>) was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2B</xref>). Moreover, and consistent with the 5-HT-elicited transient activation of Akt (assessed by phosphorylation at Ser<sup>473</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>) that paralleled mTOR phosphorylation, mTOR activation was dependent on the canonical class I phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling: phosphorylation of both mTOR (Ser<sup>2448</sup>) and S6 (Ser<sup>240/244</sup>) was strongly reduced in cells pretreated with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (100 nM) or LY294002 (20 ÂµM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3A</xref>). Activated Akt can phosphorylate tuberin (TSC2) (Dan et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2002</xref>; Inoki et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2002</xref>; Manning et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2002</xref>), which together with hamartin (TSC1) constitutes the tuberous complex (TSC1/2). TSC1/2 is a GAP for Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), a major upstream activator of mTORC1 (Garami et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2003</xref>; Inoki et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2003</xref>; Tee et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2003</xref>). Phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt inhibits GAP activity of the complex, resulting in increased levels of Rheb-GTP that in turn stimulates mTOR (Garami et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2003</xref>; Inoki et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2003</xref>; Tee et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2003</xref>). Rheb was not identified by mass spectrometry in the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor complex purified from HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B</xref> and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), likely due to its low expression in these cells. Nonetheless, GST pull-down followed by Western blotting showed recruitment of Rheb from mice brain by the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor C-terminus (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>). Moreover, Rheb contributed to 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-dependent mTOR signalling in HEK-293 cells: both mTOR (S<sup>2448</sup>) and S6 (S<sup>240/244</sup>) phosphorylations elicited by WAY181187 were prevented by expression of a Rheb-dominant-negative mutant (I39K, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, over-expression of wild-type Rheb itself increased phosphorylation of these residues, which was not further enhanced by WAY181187 exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

        <title>5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors activate mTOR signalling in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum</title>
        <p>Corroborating observations in HEK-293 cells, systemic administration of WAY181187 (10 mg/kg i.p.) to mice increased levels of phosphorylated mTOR (Ser<sup>2448</sup>) and S6 (Ser<sup>240/244</sup>), as assessed by Western blotting analysis, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a cerebral region involved in the modulation of social cognition by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor ligands (Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4A</xref>). This result was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, which revealed a strong increase in the number of phospho-Ser<sup>2448</sup>-mTOR and phospho-Ser<sup>240/244</sup>-S6-positive cells in the PFC of animals treated with WAY181187 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4B</xref>) or WAY208466 (10 mg/kg each, Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>) <italic>versus</italic> vehicle-treated animals. Phosphorylation of S6 by WAY181187 and WAY208466 was abolished by SB258585 (10 mg/kg, i.p., delivered 15 min before the agonists), which itself did not significantly affect S6 phosphorylation (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>). Further supporting engagement of the mTOR pathway by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor activation, phosphorylation of S6 by WAY181187 was likewise prevented by acute rapamycin administration (10 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min before agonist injections, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4A and B</xref>). Notably, this systemic administration of rapamycin was followed by its long-lasting (&gt;2 h after injection) accumulation within the brain (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). Consistent with data on receptor localization in PFC (Codony et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2011</xref>; Woolley et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2004</xref>), phospho-S6 immunoreactivity was detected in both GABAergic neurons [mostly dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP32)-negative] and non-GABAergic neurons (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S6 and S7</xref>). Robust 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-mediated activation of mTOR signalling was also detected in striatum (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>), the brain structure expressing the highest density of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors. Therein, more than 90% of phospho-Ser<sup>240/244</sup>-S6-stained cells were positive for DARPP32 and correspond to GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Rapamycin administration prevents deficits of social cognition and novel object discrimination induced by the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor agonist WAY181187</title>
        <p>As previously shown (Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>) and consistent with a role of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors in social cognition (<italic>i.e.</italic> the complex set of processes used to acquire, interpret and store information about a subject's social environment, including the identity, intentions and behaviour of others), systemic administration of WAY181187 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to adult rats significantly impaired social recognition in a procedure where a juvenile rat was presented to an adult for two consecutive 5 min sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4C</xref>). This action of WAY181187, which was abrogated by SB258585 (Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>), was prevented by rapamycin (10 mg/kg, i.p., administered 15 min before the agonist), which alone did not affect social recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4C</xref>). Rapamycin, like SB258585 (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8A</xref>), also abrogated the deficit induced by WAY181187 in the social novelty discrimination procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4D</xref>). Consistent with a specific role of mTOR in the cognitive impairment induced by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor activation, rapamycin did not block the deficit in social recognition induced by the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (1.25 mg/kg s.c., Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S9</xref>). In agreement with the documented improvement of recognition memory by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor antagonism (Woolley et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2004</xref>), systemic administration of WAY181187 to rats also impaired visual episodic-like memory in a non-spatial novel object discrimination (NOD) procedure, which was reversed by both rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4E</xref>) and SB258585 (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8B</xref>). Neither WAY181187, SB258585 nor rapamycin, alone or in combination, significantly altered total object exploration in this task (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S8B and S10</xref>), confirming their specific action on cognition. As previously shown for social cognition (Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>), local delivery of WAY181187 (bilaterally, 0.63 Âµg/side) into the PFC also impaired NOD, an effect prevented by peripheral rapamycin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that mTOR signalling mediates the cognitive impairments induced by activation of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors in PFC in two cognitive paradigms with clear relevance to the impairment of social cognition, attention and episodic memory observed in schizophrenia.</p>

        <title>Rapamycin administration prevents cognitive deficits in two developmental models of schizophrenia, neonatal phencyclidine treatment and post-weaning rearing in isolation</title>
        <p>We next examined the role of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-mediated mTOR signalling in rats that had received repeated injections of the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) during the neonatal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5A</xref>), a treatment that provokes cognitive and other behavioural changes characteristic of schizophrenia in the mature animal (Jones et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2011</xref>). A marked increase in phospho-S6-positive neurons was detected in PFC of adult rats treated as neonates with PCP compared with vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5B</xref>). Conversely, underpinning the specificity of this change, neonatal PCP treatment did not increase S6-phosphorylation in striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5B</xref>). S6 phosphorylation in PFC of PCP-treated rats was abolished by acute (30 min, i.p.) treatment with rapamycin (10 mg/kg) or SB258585 (2.5 mg/kg). These findings suggest that neonatal treatment with PCP leads to delayed increase in 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-mediated mTOR signalling specifically in the PFC, a structure critically implicated in the cognitive deficits relevant to those seen in schizophrenia. Correspondingly, the deficit in social discrimination observed in PCP-treated rats was abolished by either SB258585 or rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In the present study, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis of the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor complex in an effort to identify novel signalling mechanisms underlying its control of cognition. Six of the 28 proteins found to reproducibly interact with 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells are proteins of the mTOR pathway. These include two core components of mTORC1, mTOR itself and Raptor, which constitutively binds to mTOR and is involved in recruiting substrates for phosphorylation by the kinase domain of mTOR (Wang &amp; Proud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>). Physical association of mTOR with native 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors expressed in mice brain was further validated by co-immunoprecipitation, providing strong evidence that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor and mTORC1 form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a physical interaction of mTORC1 with a GPCR.</p>
      <p>Although several proteins of the mTOR pathway [<italic>e.g.</italic> GÎ²L, the third core component of mTORC1 (Wang &amp; Proud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>)] were not identified in our proteomic screen, the possibility that additional partners involved in mTOR signalling interact with 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors should not be discounted. Their absence in the identified interactome might reflect a transient interaction with the receptor complex, loss of interaction during receptor solubilization and/or insufficient expression in the heterologous system used. For instance, pull-downs performed from brain tissue, which express high levels of Rheb (presumably higher than in HEK-293 cells), clearly identified Rheb as a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor interacting protein, whereas Rheb was not identified by mass spectrometry in the initial proteomic screen.</p>
      <p>The precise architecture of the complex formed by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors and mTORC1 also remains to be established. Mass spectrometry analyses identified many more peptides in the mTOR sequence (42 unique peptides corresponding to 20.2% sequence coverage) than in the Raptor sequence (five unique peptides corresponding to 4.7% sequence coverage). This suggests that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors recruit larger amounts of mTOR than Raptor, since it is unlikely that these values only reflect a difference in the number of suitably ionizable tryptic peptides in both proteins. Accordingly, mTOR might be a direct partner of the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor, whereas Raptor might be recruited indirectly via mTOR. In addition, we showed that the 49 C-terminal amino acids of the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor were necessary for interacting with mTOR but that the receptor C-terminal domain alone was not capable of recruiting mTOR. This suggests that several domains of the receptor, including both its extreme C-terminus and residues located upstream to its C-terminal domain, contribute to receptor-mTOR interaction.</p>
      <p>The remarkable enrichment in proteins of the mTOR pathway in the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor interactome was complemented by observations of its engagement by the receptor both in transfected HEK-293 cells and <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing the first evidence of a functional link between serotonergic transmission and mTOR signalling. The PI3K/Akt/Rheb pathway classically involved in mTOR activation by insulin and other growth factors (Swiech et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>; Wang &amp; Proud, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>; Zhou &amp; Huang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">2010</xref>) was likewise implicated in the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-elicited mTOR signalling in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, the deletion of the 49 C-terminal residues of receptor, which prevented its interaction with mTOR, strongly reduced its ability to activate mTOR, without affecting its coupling to GÎ±s. This suggested that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-elicited mTOR signalling was critically dependent of their physical association with mTOR. The lack of a unique, well-localized mTOR-binding motif in the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor sequence precluded the use of an âinterfering peptideâ in order to disrupt its interaction with mTOR and to further explore the functional impact of this coupling. In any event, it is possible that constitutive physical interaction of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors with mTOR facilitates its engagement, via PI3K and Akt, upon receptor stimulation. It may also help in confining 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-elicited mTOR signalling to specific cellular domains, thereby permitting local regulation of mTOR down-stream targets by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors.</p>
      <p>Peripheral administration of a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor agonist markedly activated mTOR in striatal medium spiny neurons, which express the highest density of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors in the brain (Codony et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2011</xref>; Woolley et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2004</xref>). Activation of mTOR in striatum via Rhes, a striatal-specific small G protein, is known to mediate <sc>l</sc>-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (Santini et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>; Subramaniam et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2011</xref>). It has also been proposed that blockade of striatal mTOR signalling caused by the sequestration of Rhes by mutant Huntingtin might underlie the pronounced atrophy of the striatum in Huntington disease (Subramaniam &amp; Snyder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2011</xref>). Whether these processes are regulated by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors remains to be established.</p>
      <p>Administration of a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor agonist also stimulated mTOR signalling in neurons of PFC, the cerebral structure involved in their control of social cognition (Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>). Neurons exhibiting enhanced mTOR signalling upon 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor activation included GABAergic neurons consistent with data on receptor localization, which indicated that almost 20% of 5-HT<sub>6</sub>-immunoreactive neurons in cerebral cortex were GABAergic (Codony et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>The mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes, including cell proliferation, synaptogenesis and growth of dendrites and axons and its perturbation has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of two rare genetic forms of autism spectrum disorders, tuberous sclerosis and fragile X syndrome (Auerbach et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2011</xref>; Ehninger et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2008</xref>; Ehninger &amp; Silva, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2011</xref>; Swiech et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2008</xref>). These findings, together with our observations that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors engage mTOR in neurons of the PFC, a structure critical for numerous cognitive functions, encouraged us to explore the role of prefrontal mTOR in cognitive impairments induced by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonists. We found that systemic administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin prevented cognitive deficits induced by a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonist (also administered at the periphery) in models of social cognition (primarily involving olfactory cues) and NOD (visual cues). Further supporting a role of prefrontocortical mTOR activation, rapamycin administration also abolished the deficit in NOD induced by a local injection of a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonist in the PFC.</p>
      <p>We then reasoned that enhanced mTOR signalling in the PFC, under the control of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors, might underlie cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed an enhanced mTOR signalling (blocked by a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonist) in PFC of adult rats treated with PCP at a neonatal stage or housed in isolation after weaning from the dam. These two well-characterized and complementary developmental models of schizophrenia reproduce in adulthood several features of schizophrenia such as deficits in social cognition (neonatal PCP administration) and episodic memory (isolation rearing; Jones et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2011</xref>; Marsden et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2011</xref>). These cognitive deficits were abolished by an acute administration of rapamycin, mirroring the effects of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonists. In both models, the increased mTOR signalling was specifically detected in PFC, and not in striatum, contrasting with the effects induced by agonist treatment. These findings are consistent with the dysfunction of prefrontal GABAergic transmission in schizophrenia, which is associated with gene expression abnormalities in a subclass (paravalbumin-positive) of PFC GABAergic interneurons (Hashimoto et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2003</xref>). They support the notion that certain cognitive defects in schizophrenia reflect a disruption of PFC function and connectivity, itself related to anomalous activity of GABAergic interneurons and a loss of their synchronized modulation of pyramidal neurons (Lewis &amp; Gonzalez-Burgos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2008</xref>). Alterations in network connectivity might ultimately be related to a deregulation of mTOR signalling in the PFC, occurring at a critical period in post-natal brain development and persisting into adulthood.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present observations demonstrate that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors recruit and activate mTOR to compromise cognition both in pharmacological paradigms and in developmental models of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig 7</xref>). Accordingly, activation of mTOR may fulfil a broader role in the cognitive impairment of CNS disorders than hitherto appreciated. Indeed, our findings encourage an extension of clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors from patients presenting genetic forms of autism-related disorder, like tuberous sclerosis (Auerbach et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2011</xref>; Ehninger et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2008</xref>; Ehninger &amp; Silva, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2011</xref>), to more numerous populations of schizophrenic patients. They reciprocally suggest that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonists might profitably be evaluated in autism. Irrespective of the outcome, the present work may help to resolve and to inter-link two persistent conundrums: namely, the molecular substrates mediating the detrimental influence of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors on cognition and the cellular events accounting for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.</p>

          <p>The 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor physically interacts with proteins of the mTOR pathway, including mTOR itself and Raptor, which with GÎ²L constitute the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This interaction, together with the canonical class I PI3K/Akt/Rheb pathway, contributes to 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-elicited mTOR signalling, which underlies the cognitive deficits observed in two developmental models of schizophrenia, neonatal treatment with phencyclidine and post-weaning social isolation.</p>

        <title>Purification and identification of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry</title>
        <p>HEK-293 cells expressing HA-5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor were lysed in a buffer containing HEPES 20 mM, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 4 mg/ml dodecylmaltoside and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), for 1 h at 4Â°C. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Solubilized proteins (10 mg per condition) were immunoprecipitated with the agarose-conjugated HA antibody (100 Âµl per condition). Control immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of HA peptide (100 ÂµM). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDSâPAGE and stained with Page Blue Stain (Fermentas). Gel lanes were cut into 20 gel pieces and proteins digested in-gel using trypsin (Gold, Promega). Generated peptides were analysed online by nano-flow HPLC-nanoelectrospray ionization using a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex). Desalting and pre-concentration of samples were performed on-line on a PepmapÂ® precolumn (0.3 mm Ã 10 mm, Dionex). A gradient consisting of 0â40% A in 30 min, 80% B in 15 min (A = 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water; B = 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at 300 nl/min was used to elute peptides from the capillary (0.075 mm Ã 150 mm) reverse-phase column (PepmapÂ®). LC-MS/MS experiments comprised cycles of five events; an MS<sup>1</sup> scan with Orbitrap mass analysis at 30,000 resolution followed by CID of the five most abundant precursors. Fragment ions generated by CID were detected in the linear trap. Normalized collision energy of 35 eV and activation time of 30 ms were used for CID. All Spectra were recorded under positive ion mode using the Xcalibur 2.0.7 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass scanning range (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) was 400â2000 and the capillary temperature was 200Â°C. Source parameters were adjusted as follows: ion spray voltage, 2.40 kV; capillary voltage, 40 V and tube lens, 120 V. Spectra were acquired with the instrument operating in the information-dependent acquisition mode throughout the HPLC gradient.</p>
        <p>All MS/MS spectra were searched against the Homo sapiens entries of either SwissProt or TrEMBL databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/">http://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link>) by using the Mascot v 2.2 algorithm (Matrix Science, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com/">http://www.matrixscience.com/</ext-link>) with trypsin enzyme specificity and one trypsin missed cleavage. Methionine oxidation was set as variable modification for searches. A peptide mass tolerance of 5 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 Da were allowed for identification. Management and validation of mass spectrometry data, allowing discrimination of specific HA-tagged 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor partners, were performed using the myProMS v2.3. Web server (Poullet et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2007</xref>). Experiments were repeated four times to assess biological reproducibility. Only proteins identified with two or more peptides (threshold Mascot scores given corresponding to <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for two peptides/protein and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for three peptides or more/protein, respectively) in each replicate and not detected in control immunoprecipitations were considered as potential partners of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor.</p>
        <p>GO annotations and functional enrichment in the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor complex were analysed using BINGO (version 2.44), a Cytoscape plugin assessing overrepresentation of Gene Ontology categories in biological networks (Maere et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2005</xref>). The list of proteins interacting specifically with the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor was used as the input set and the whole annotation as the reference set. The <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated with the hypergeometric test. For multi-testing correction, we applied the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction with a level of significance of 0.05. To minimize the impact of multi-testing issues, we used the GOSlim ontologies.</p>

Studies using Lister Hooded rats (Charles River, UK) were performed in compliance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) 1986 ACT and local University of Nottingham ethical committee approval. For systemic administration of drugs, animals were injected i.p. or s.c. with drugs as indicated in the figure legends. WAY181187, WAY208466, SB258585 and rapamycin were dissolved in 5% DMSO/5% Tween 80. For combined treatments, rapamycin or SB258585 were administered 15â30 min before the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonist. Animals that did not receive drugs were injected with an equivalent amount of vehicle. WAY181187 was also delivered locally [0.63 Âµg per side in 1 Âµl vehicle (10% hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrine in a CSF)] by means of cannula implanted bilaterally in the PFC (AP: +3.0, L: Â±0.7, DV: â2.3), 1 week before the experiments. For administration of phencyclidine at the neonatal stage, rats were received at 3 days of age, grouped in 10 male pups per adult mother. Phencyclidine or vehicle (saline) was administered on post-natal days (PND) 7, 9 and 11. All pups of the same litter received the same treatment. The rats were weaned from their mother at PND 21, after which they were separated at random and housed in mixed-litter groups of four. Measurement of mTOR activation and social novelty discrimination experiments were carried out at 8â10 weeks of age.</p>

        <p>Activation of mTOR was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry using anti-phosphoSer<sup>2448</sup>-mTOR and anti-phosphoSer<sup>240/244</sup>-S6 antibodies. For Western blotting, mice were decapitated and their heads were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (for 12 s). The frozen heads were cut into 210-Âµm thick slices with a cryostat. Microdiscs (1.4 mm diameter) were punched out bilaterally from the median PFC and homogenized by the addition of a boiling solution of 1% SDS v/v and 1 mM Na<sup>+</sup>-orthovanadate in water, immediate sonication, and incubation at 100Â°C for 5 min to inactivate phosphatases and proteases. For immunohistochemistry, animals were rapidly anaesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg i.p., Ceva SA) and perfused transcardially with fixative solution containing 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing NaF (100 mM) and Na<sup>+</sup>-orthovanadate (1 mM). Glutaraldehyde (0.5% w/v) was added to the fixative solution in experiments using the anti-GABA antibody. Brains were post-fixed overnight in the same solutions and stored at 4Â°C. Fifty micrometer-thick sections were cut with a vibratome (Leica) and stored at 4Â°C in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PBS), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and incubated for 48 h at 4Â°C with the primary antibodies (phospho-Ser<sup>2448</sup>-mTOR, 1:50; phospho-Ser<sup>240/244</sup> S6, 1:500; DARPP32, 1:1500; NeuN, 1:1000; GABA, 1:500) in PBS containing 0.025% Triton X-100 and 20% goat serum. Sections were then incubated for 1 h with goat Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500, Jackson Laboratory) and/or goat Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) in PBS containing 20% goat serum. Immunofluorescent staining was observed with a Zeiss Axiophot2 microscope equipped with epifluorescence.

            <p>PROBLEM:</p>
            <p>Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia seriously compromise quality of life and are poorly controlled by currently available antipsychotic agents, which mainly correct positive symptoms. Complicating the development of improved therapy, cellular events underlying cognitive impairment in schizophrenia are incompletely understood. 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor blockade has emerged as a promising strategy for correcting these cognitive deficits, as 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonists increase mnemonic performance in a broad range of procedures in rodents and preliminary evidence indicates that they favour cognitive processes in human. However, the signalling mechanisms mediating the control of cognition by 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors remain largely unknown, an issue we addressed by a proteomic analysis of the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor complex.</p>
            <p>RESULTS:</p>
            <p>We show that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors physically interact with the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 and that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor activation elicits mTOR signalling in rodent PFC, a brain region critical for numerous cognitive processes. Correspondingly, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin prevented deficits of social cognition and NOD induced by a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> agonist in the rat. Moreover, rapamycin, like 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonists, rescued cognitive deficits in two complementary developmental rodent models of schizophrenia that reproduce in adulthood many features of the disease, neonatal treatment with phencyclidine and post-weaning housing in isolation.</p>
            <p>IMPACT:</p>
            <p>These studies identify a signalling complex physically associated with the 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor that underlies its deleterious influence upon cognition. They suggest a critical role of mTOR activation not only in rare autism-related genetic disorders, such as Fragile X mental retardation syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, as previously suggested, but also in schizophrenia, a more frequent, multi-factorial and debilitating disorder. These findings encourage an extension of clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors from patients presenting genetic forms of autism to populations of schizophrenic patients and reciprocally suggest that 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonists might be evaluated in autism.</p>

        <p>The social recognition test (ability of an adult rat to recognize a younger conspecific during the second of two 5-min sessions) was performed using a procedure without an intersession delay, as previously described (Loiseau et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>). For the social novelty discrimination test (ability of an adult rat to differentiate novel and familiar juveniles), one juvenile rat was introduced in the adult cage in a first 30-min session. The same juvenile rat was then presented together with a second novel juvenile to the adult in a second 5-min session. Time of investigation of each juvenile during the second session was recorded and the ratio of time spent in active social investigation of the novel to the time spent in investigating the familiar during the second session was calculated. We used a procedure without an inter-session interval to maximize discrimination performance (ratio â¥ 3 in vehicle-treated group). The specificity of drug effects on social recognition or social discrimination was analysed by two-way ANOVA, followed by either NewmanâKeuls test (social recognition) or Dunnett's test (social discrimination).</p>
        <p>The NOD test was performed as previously described (Watson et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2011</xref>). The inter-trial interval between familiarization and choice trials was 5 min, such that vehicle-treated animals were able to discriminate the novel and familiar objects. In experiments evaluating the impact of social isolation, each litter of Lister hooded rats was weaned on PND 24 and approximately half of each litter housed in either groups (3â4 per cage) or social isolation for 6 weeks. Isolated and group-housed rats were then subjected to the NOD test on PND 66. Injections were carried out 30 min prior to the familiarization trial. The interval between familiarization and choice trials was 2 h. Raw data were analysed by ANOVA with the exploration of novel and familiar object as the repeated within-subject factor and the treatment as the between-subject factor. D2 scores (exploration of novel object â exploration of familiar object/total object exploration) were analysed by two-way ANOVA followed by NewmanâKeuls test.</p>
