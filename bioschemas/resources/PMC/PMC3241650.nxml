        <p>Guanine-quadruplexes (G4) consist of non-canonical four-stranded helical arrangements of guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences. The bulky and thermodynamically stable features of G4 structures have been shown in many respects to affect normal nucleic acid metabolism. <italic>In vivo</italic> conversion of G4 structures to single-stranded nucleic acid requires specialized proteins with G4 destabilizing/unwinding activity. RHAU is a human DEAH-box RNA helicase that exhibits G4-RNA binding and resolving activity. In this study, we employed RIP-chip analysis to identify <italic>en masse</italic> RNAs associated with RHAU <italic>in vivo</italic>. Approximately 100 RNAs were found to be associated with RHAU and bioinformatics analysis revealed that the majority contained potential G4-forming sequences. Among the most abundant RNAs selectively enriched with RHAU, we identified the human telomerase RNA template TERC as a true target of RHAU. Remarkably, binding of RHAU to TERC depended on the presence of a stable G4 structure in the 5â²-region of TERC, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. RHAU was further found to associate with the telomerase holoenzyme via the 5â²-region of TERC. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that intramolecular G4-RNAs serve as physiologically relevant targets for RHAU. Furthermore, our results suggest the existence of alternatively folded forms of TERC in the fully assembled telomerase holoenyzme.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA and RNA sequences containing tandem repeats of guanine tracts can form G-quadruplex (G4) structures, non-canonical and thermodynamically stable four-stranded helical arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B2">2</xref>). The building block of G4 structures is the G-quartet, a square-planar assembly of four guanines held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. G4 structures result from the consecutive stacking of G-quartets and are further stabilized by alkali metal ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> that position along the helix axis and coordinate the O6 keto oxygens of the tetrad-forming guanines. G4 scaffolds are extremely polymorphic in the relative orientation of strands (parallel, anti-parallel or mixed configurations), length, sequence and conformation of the loops connecting the G-tracts. In addition, G4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic> can result from the assembly of one (intramolecular G4) or multiple (bi- or tetramolecular-G4) nucleic acid strands.</p><p>Biochemical and biophysical studies have shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that stable G4 structures can form spontaneously from G-rich regions of single-stranded nucleic acid under near physiological conditions. Genome-wide computational surveys have identified more than 300â000 potential intramolecular G4-forming sequences in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B4">4</xref>) and revealed a higher prevalence of these sequences in functional genomic regions such as telomeres, promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B6">6</xref>), untranslated regions [UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B8">8</xref>)] and first introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B9">9</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that G4 structures participate in regulating various nucleic acid processes, such as telomere maintenance or the control of gene expression. Nevertheless, because of the lack of evidence that such structures really exist <italic>in vivo</italic>, G4 structures have often been considered as a structural curiosity without relevance for living organisms. There is now reason to believe that G4 structures are not merely an <italic>in vitro</italic> artefact, as several recent findings concur with their existence in cells. First, both a G4-specific dye and antibodies raised against telomeric G4-DNA specifically stained telomeres in human and ciliate cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B10 gkr630-B11 gkr630-B12">10â12</xref>). In addition, several potential G4-forming sequences in promoters were shown to form intramolecular G4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic> and to affect gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B14">14</xref>). A possible contribution of G4 to regulating promoter activity was indicated by impairment of the transcriptional activity of several genes by G4-stabilizing ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B14">14</xref>) or a single-chain antibody specific for intramolecular G4-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B15">15</xref>), in a manner correlating with the occurrence of predicted G4 structures in the control regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Like DNA, RNA can also form G4 structures. Although, to date, G4-RNAs have not attracted as much attention as their DNA counterparts, the formation of G4 structures in RNA is emerging as a plausible regulatory factor in gene expression. RNA is more prone than DNA to form G4 structures due to its single-strandedness, and G4-RNAs have also proved to be more stable than their cognate G4-DNA under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B17 gkr630-B18 gkr630-B19">17â19</xref>). Bioinformatics analyses of human 5â²-UTR sequences revealed potential G4-forming motifs in as many as 3000 different RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B20">20</xref>). Moreover, the formation of G4 structures in 5â²-UTR was shown to impede translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B21 gkr630-B22 gkr630-B23">21â23</xref>). Given that potential G4 sequences have been identified near splicing and polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B24 gkr630-B25 gkr630-B26">24â26</xref>), G4 formation may also affect RNA metabolism at several different stages. Furthermore, formation of parallel G4-RNA structures has also been reported <italic>in vitro</italic> for telomeric RNA repeats [TERRA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B27 gkr630-B28 gkr630-B29">27â29</xref>)] and for the human telomerase template RNA [TERC, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>)], suggesting that G4-RNA formation also plays a part in regulatory processes at telomeres.</p><p>The discovery of proteins that positively or negatively stabilize such G4 structures is further indirect evidence for the existence of such structures <italic>in vivo</italic>. Among the many proteins from various organisms that bind to G4-DNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B31">31</xref>), several helicases show ATP-dependent G4-resolving activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B32 gkr630-B33 gkr630-B34 gkr630-B35 gkr630-B36">32â36</xref>) and have been clearly implicated in the maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B37 gkr630-B38 gkr630-B39 gkr630-B40">37â40</xref>). RHAU (alias DHX36 or G4R1), a member of the human DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, exhibits <italic>in vitro</italic> G4-RNA binding with high affinity for its substrate, and unwinds G4 structures much more efficiently than double-stranded nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B42">42</xref>). Consistent with these biochemical observations, RHAU was also shown to bind to mRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B43">43</xref>) and was identified as the main source of tetramolecular G4-RNA-resolving activity in HeLa cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B42">42</xref>).</p><p>Although considerable information is available on the enzymatic activity of RHAU <italic>in vitro</italic>, almost nothing is known about its biological function as a G4-binding/resolving enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this question, we sought RNAs bound by RHAU in living cells, surmising that the identification of RHAU-bound RNAs and understanding the effects of RHAU should provide important clues to its function <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we employed high-throughput gene array technologies to identify and quantify the co-purified RNAs on a genome-wide scale. With this screen, we identified about 100 RNAs significantly enriched by RHAU. Computational analysis of RNA sequences for potential intramolecular G4 structures revealed the preferential association of RHAU with transcripts bearing G4-forming motifs, suggesting direct targeting of G4-RNA by RHAU. Amongst the RNAs with the potential to form G4 structures and selectively enriched with RHAU, we identified TERC as a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of RHAU. Characterization of the RHAU-TERC interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> showed binding of TERC by RHAU to be strictly dependent on the formation of a G4 structure on the 5â²-extremity of TERC RNA. Finally, we have demonstrated that RHAU not only interacts with TERC <italic>stricto sensu</italic>, but is also part of the fully assembled telomerase complex through direct interaction with TERC G4 structure. Taken together, these data demonstrate that intramolecular G4-RNAs are naturally occurring substrates of RHAU <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, they provide indirect but strong support for the existence of a G4-RNA structure in the telomerase RNP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs, cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>The baculoviral expression vector employed for the expression of GST-RHAU and the plasmids used for the expression of the C-terminal FLAG-tagged recombinant RHAU proteins RHAU-FLAG and RHAU(ÎRSM)-FLAG were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B43 gkr630-B44 gkr630-B45">43â45</xref>). The pIRES.EGFP-myc-N1 vector expressing the C-terminal myc-tagged recombinant RHAU protein was derived from the previously described pIRES.EGFP-FLAG-N1/RHAU expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B43">43</xref>) by substituting the FLAG sequence with the myc epitope sequence. Human TERT cDNA (clone: IOH36343, mapped sequence: NM_198253) was obtained from ImaGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany) and subcloned by PCR amplification into the pSL1-FLAG-N1 mammalian expression vector. The pSL1-FLAG-N1 vector was derived from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) by replacing the EGFP open reading frame with the FLAG epitope sequence. The human TERC genomic region was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of HEK293T cells to yield a 2.1-kb fragment encompassing 1080âbp of the TERC promoter, its coding sequence, and 553âbp of the 3â² flanking genomic region. This fragment was blunt-cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) at the HincII/EcoRV sites. The G4 motif sequence of TERC was mutagenized using a variation of the classical QuikChangeÂ® (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis PCR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B46">46</xref>). To prepare templates for <italic>in vitro</italic> run-off transcription, the T7 or SP6 phage promoters were inserted upstream of the TERC coding sequence by PCR. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pSL1-FLAG-N1 vector at the NheI/AgeI sites. Following linearization with NarI or AgeI, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of these templates yielded the TERC (1â71 nt) and full-length TERC (1â451 nt) RNA fragments, respectively. Constructions of all these plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Sequences of oligonucleotides used in this work and detailed descriptions of the plasmid constructs are available upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Human cervical carcinoma HeLa and embryonic kidney HEK293T cell lines were maintained in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2âmM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine at 37Â°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

After gentle agitation for 5âh, the resin was recovered by centrifugation, washed 3Ã with 500âÎ¼l lysis buffer, followed by three washes with 500âÎ¼l IP-washing buffer [50âmM TrisâHCl (pH 7.5), 300âmM NaCl, 0.1%âvÂ·v<sup>â1</sup>âNonidet P-40, 5âmM EDTA, 0.4âUÂ·Î¼l<sup>â1</sup> RNasinÂ® Plus]. The resin was resuspended in 1âml TRIzol (Invitrogen) for protein analysis and RNA extraction. For microarray analysis, 100âng RNA was converted to cRNA according to the manufacturerâs guidelines and the reaction products hybridized to GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix). The resulting raw expression values were RMA-normalized using R/BioConductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B47">47</xref>) and the Oligo Package [version 1.14.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B48">48</xref>)]. Probesets were linked to Entrez Gene entries using Affymetrix annotation (NetAffx release 28, 11 March 2009), retaining a single probeset per gene. Genes not clearly detected in input samples [average log<sub>2</sub>(expression value)â&lt;â6.0] were discarded.

Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with a vector expressing FLAG-tagged or myc-tagged RHAU. Immunoprecipitations of non-cross-linked whole-cell extracts were carried out using anti-FLAG antibodies. Anti-FLAG IP from cells expressing myc-tagged RHAU was employed as an IP control (IP<sub>ctrl</sub>) to assess non-specific interactions that may occur during RIP.

The rationale was that if RHAU binds G4-RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, the proportion of potential G4-forming sequences should be higher among RNAs enriched by RHAU than among non-enriched RNAs. Of the various available methods for predicting intramolecular G4 motif sequences, we used QGRS Mapper that identifies and scores each potential G4-forming sequence according to their predicted stabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B50">50</xref>). Being aware that only limited experimental data so far support the scoring method of QGRS Mapper, we employed the algorithm to identify potential G4-forming sequences, but we also included the G4-score-based analysis as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>), since the two approaches provided similar results.

In addition, there was a weak (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>â=â0.10) but significant positive correlation between the predicted G4 motif density per transcript and the magnitude of RNA enrichment by RHAU. Randomization of RHAU target sequences, retaining single- or even dinucleotide frequencies of the original transcripts, significantly reduced the proportion of potential G4-forming sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F2">Figure 2</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2B</ext-link>). Thus, the proportion of G4 motif sequences among RHAU-associated transcripts cannot be explained by a mere bias in nucleotide composition.

However, after discarding these less-stable G4 structures from the analysis, we still observed a significant relationship between the proportion of sequences bearing potentially stable G4-forming sequences (composed of three or more stacked G-quartets) and the magnitude of RNA enrichment by RHAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Indeed, with more than half of the sequences presenting potentially stable G4-forming sequences, the group of 106 RNAs identified as true RHAU targets presents one of the highest incidences of potentially stable G4-forming motifs. In summary, the present data are consistent with preferential association of RHAU with transcripts containing potential G4-forming sequences, suggesting direct recognition of G4-RNA structures by RHAU. To further test this hypothesis, we selected one of the identified RHAU targets and addressed the molecular basis of its interaction with RHAU.</p></sec><sec><title>RHAU associates with TERC through its G4 motif sequence</title><p>Within the pool of transcripts enriched by RHAU and showing a high potential to form stable G4, TERC is the only RNA reported previously to form a stable and parallel G4 structure <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F3">Figure 3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>).

After 24âh, HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the TERC(WT) construct but not with the vector alone showed a substantial (~200-fold) increase in TERC abundance relative to endogenous TERC levels. Importantly, mutations of the G4 motif (G4-MT or ÎG4) did not influence the steady-state level of exogenous TERC expression in these cells since recombinant wild-type, G4-MT and ÎG4 forms of TERC accumulated to comparable levels.

As already shown for endogenous TERC, a substantial amount of overexpressed TERC(WT) was also recovered with endogenous RHAU, as evidenced by a 25-fold enrichment of TERC transcript over the mock transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F3">Figure 3</xref>D, compare lanes 4 and 2).

The drastic reduction in immunoprecipitation of the TERC mutants was not due to non-specific RNA degradation in these fractions. Indeed, comparable levels of non-specifically co-immunoprecipitated GAPDH RNA were found to contaminate all of these fractions.

To address this question <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed RNA electromobility shift assays (REMSA) using purified recombinant GST-tagged RHAU protein and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed radio-labeled full-length (1â451 nt) and 5â²-end (1â71 nt) TERC fragments.

Addition of increasing amounts of RHAU to both full-length and 5â²-end TERC fragments resulted in the appearance of a high-affinity (estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 10ânM) ribonucleoprotein complex of reduced mobility. In contrast, the stability of the RHAU-TERC interaction was strongly impaired (~20-fold reduction) when formation of the G4 structure was prevented by mutation of the G4 motif sequence (G4-MT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Similarly, conditions that are unfavourable to G4 stability (substitution of K<sup>+</sup> for Li<sup>+</sup>) impaired the RHAU-TERC interaction to comparable extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Replacing K<sup>+</sup> by Li<sup>+</sup> was indeed shown to strongly reduce the thermodynamic stability of the TERC G4 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>). Thus, these results demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between RHAU and TERC dependent on RNA folding into a stable G4 structure.

Upon transcription, nascent TERC is first bound by proteins dyskerin, NHP2 and NOP10 and subsequently joined by GAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B55">55</xref>). The co-transcriptional binding of this RNP complex is essential for the processing and accumulation of TERC transcripts. Finally, the catalytic protein component telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) assembles with the processed telomerase RNPs and forms the active telomerase holoenzyme. To determine whether RHAU was exclusively interacting with TERC during the transcriptional process or whether it was also part of the telomerase RNP, we performed co-IP assays and examined whether endogenous RHAU co-fractionated with endogenous dyskerin or FLAG-tagged TERT proteins. Immunoblot analysis showed that RHAU was present in both dyskerin and TERT immunoprecipitated fractions but absent in the control IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The association of RHAU with components of the telomerase holoenzyme proved to be strictly dependent on the ability of RHAU to bind the 5â²-end of TERC, since overexpression of wild-type but not the G4 motif mutated forms of TERC resulted in extensive enrichment of co-precipitating RHAU protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B, compare lane 2 to lanes 3, 4 and 5). Although mutations of the TERC G4 motif sequence severely impinged on the recruitment of RHAU to the telomerase, they had no apparent repercussions on the steady-state expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F5">Figure 5</xref>C) or on the assembly of the core components of telomerase. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F5">Figure 5</xref>D (compare lane 2 to lanes 3, 4 and 5), similar levels of TERT protein co-fractionated with dyskerin following transient overexpression of either wild-type or G4 motif mutated forms of TERC. These results suggest that RHAU does not strictly bind TERC in the course of its biogenesis but that a fraction of RHAU also associates with the fully assembled telomerase holoenzyme through direct interaction with the G4 motif sequence of TERC.

To address this further, immunopurified RHAU RNP complexes were analysed for telomerase activity by TRAP assay. In all the subsequent experiments, parallel immunopurification of dyskerin served as a positive control for telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B56">56</xref>).

To further examine the apparent significance of G4 binding by RHAU for its recruitment to the telomerase holoenzyme, we transiently expressed a FLAG-tagged mutant version of RHAU (ÎRSM, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>) that was unable to bind to G4 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B45">45</xref>).

As previously observed for endogenous RHAU, immunopurified FLAG-tagged RHAU(WT) efficiently recovered telomerase activity and co-precipitated TERC. In contrast, negligible telomerase activity and TERC signal were retrieved from the FLAG-tagged RHAU(ÎRSM) mutant, showing that G4 binding by RHAU is a prerequisite for RHAU binding to TERC. Altogether, these findings provide persuasive evidence that a fraction of RHAU associates with a subpopulation of the telomerase holoenzyme <italic>in vivo</italic> through direct interaction with the G4-motif sequence of TERC.

Depletion with RHAU antibody significantly ablated telomerase activity in an aliquot of the supernatant by 25%, while ~70% of the telomerase activity of the input fraction was lost following depletion of endogenous dyskerin. As a control, immunodepletion with control mouse IgGs produced no significant reduction in telomerase activity. Western blot analysis of the supernatants confirmed that both RHAU and dyskerin proteins were effectively depleted from the corresponding fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Furthermore, the quantification by RTâPCR of RNA levels in the immunodepleted fractions was consistent with the above findings. Indeed, approximately one quarter of input TERC, but not unrelated RNAs such as Î²-actin mRNA, vanished following depletion of endogenous RHAU. These results not only corroborate the association of RHAU with telomerase, but also show that the fraction of telomerase interacting with RHAU accounts for merely 25% of the total telomerase activity. Nevertheless, these data provide indirect but explicit evidence of the existence of an alternatively folded TERC structure bearing a G4 scaffold in the fully assembled telomerase holoenzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>ATPase-dependent interaction of RHAU with TERC</title><p>The fact that only one quarter of telomerase activity is linked to RHAU may reflect a dynamic interaction between RHAU and TERC. Indeed, most of the DEAH-box RNA helicases only transiently interact with nucleic acid, because they do not remain bound after the ATPase-dependent remodelling of their substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B57 gkr630-B58 gkr630-B59 gkr630-B60">57â60</xref>). To gain insight into the role of ATP-hydrolysis by RHAU in its interaction with TERC, we repeated gel mobility shift assays with 5â² TERC fragments in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or ATP or both. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F7">Figure 7</xref>A, ATP or Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone had little effect on the binding affinity of RHAU for TERC. In contrast, under conditions supporting ATP hydrolysis (MgÂ·ATP), RHAU displayed reduced binding affinity for TERC, as evidenced by a 10-fold increase in the apparent equilibrium <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Such a reduction in the affinity of RHAU for TERC was not observed when MgÂ·ATP was substituted with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue MgÂ·AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C). Thus, the present data suggest that intrinsic RHAU ATP hydrolysis rather than ATP binding is essential for disrupting the interaction of RHAU with TERC. To further validate this, we turned to the previously described RHAU(DAIH) mutant in which the E335A amino-acid substitution within the Walker B site abolishes RHAU ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B45">45</xref>). Unlike wild-type RHAU, the binding affinity of RHAU(DAIH) mutant for TERC was similar in the absence and presence of MgÂ·ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr630-F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C). The absence of RHAU helicase activity as a consequence of the loss of ATPase activity probably prevents RHAU dissociation from its substrate. In fact, a similar reduction in <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA binding dynamics after suppression of RHAU intrinsic ATPase activity was reported previously in studies of the shuttling of RHAU in cytoplasmic stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B43">43</xref>). Taken together, these data corroborate the idea that RHAU is not permanently associated with TERC but dissociates upon ATP hydrolysis.

These biochemical properties prompted us to test whether RHAU could catalyse the conversion of TERC G4 structure to ssRNA form. However, the faster rate of refolding of intramolecular G4 structures with regard to tetramolecular G4-RNAs made it technically difficult to monitor the G4-resolving activity of RHAU using standard non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The propensity of nucleic acid guanine-rich sequences to self-assemble into G4 structures <italic>in vitro</italic> has been recognized for several decades. Although RNA is also prone to form such structures, G4-RNA has not attracted as much attention as G4-DNA. Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence indicates a significant role for G4 structure formation during RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B61">61</xref>). As a consequence, G4 structures emerged as a plausible post-transcriptional means of regulating the function of coding and non-coding RNAs. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which G4-RNA formation is regulated in the cells. Indeed, only a few proteins have been reported so far to interact with G4-RNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B62 gkr630-B63 gkr630-B64 gkr630-B65 gkr630-B66">62â66</xref>) and, apart from FMRP and FMR2P, experimental data on their biological activity subsequent to their interaction with G4-RNAs is scarce. Of these G4-RNA binding proteins, RHAU is the only protein that exhibits robust <italic>in vitro</italic> ATPase-dependent G4-RNA resolving activity, in addition to a high affinity and specificity for its target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B42">42</xref>). These particular biochemical features promote RHAU as an ideal candidate for regulating G4-dependent RNA metabolism, although its <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA targets have not yet been determined. The present study aimed to identify naturally occurring RHAU targets with the emphasis on RNAs containing potential G4-forming sequences. By RIP-chip assays, 106 RNAs were found to be significantly enriched with RHAU. Importantly, more than half of these RNAs contained G-rich sequences with potential to form stable G4 structures. In addition, there was a weak but significant correlation between the predicted G4 motif density per transcript and the magnitude of RNA enrichment by RHAU. Nevertheless, because RHAU appears to show significant affinity for RNAs not bearing G4-forming sequences, we do not exclude the possibility that RHAU has affinity to other RNA structural features.</p><p>In-depth studies revealed that TERC, one of the identified RNAs, was a <italic>bona fide</italic> target of RHAU. Several independent RIP-chip assays using various cell lines further showed TERC to be one of the most abundant RNAs enriched by RHAU. TERC bears a 5â² G-rich sequence that was previously shown to adopt a stable intramolecular G4 structure <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>). Further investigations dissecting the basis of the interaction between RHAU and TERC showed RHAU binding to be strictly dependent on G4 structure formation in the 5â² region of TERC and to require the N-terminal RSM domain of RHAU, an ancillary domain necessary for specific recognition of G4 by RHAU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B45">45</xref>). Moreover, RHAU was found to interact transiently with TERC in a manner dependent on its own ATPase activity. Together, these data provide the first evidence of a specific and direct interaction between a G4-resolvase enzyme and a potentially relevant intramolecular G4-RNA substrate. Furthermore, in agreement with our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B45">45</xref>), these data attest that G4-RNAs are naturally occurring substrates of RHAU <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec><title>The 5â² extremity of TERC folds into an intramolecular G4 structure <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In agreement with the observations presented here, Mergny and co-workers reported previously the formation <italic>in vitro</italic> of a G4 structure in the 5â² region of human TERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>). However, as for the great majority of nucleic acid structures, direct experimental demonstration of G4 structures <italic>in vivo</italic> has proven very difficult. As such, our results do not directly prove the existence of G4 structures <italic>in vivo</italic>, but strongly support the notion that TERC can form a G4 structure in the cells. Notably, RHAU can only bind TERC provided that all conditions necessary for the formation of an intramolecular G4 structure (RNA sequence and ionic conditions) are met. Modifying any one of the conditions is sufficient to reduce substantially the affinity of RHAU for TERC. In addition, our data argue that TERC G4 structure can also be formed in a fraction of telomerase holoenzyme, since RHAU associates with TERT and dyskerin proteins and significant amounts of telomerase activity were recovered with RHAU. Based on the fraction of telomerase activity co-precipitating with RHAU, we can estimate that at least 25% of TERC in the human telomerase holoenzyme bears a 5â² G4 structure. Moreover, we predict that formation of a G4 structure in TERC is not exclusive to human cells, since the majority of the mammalian orthologues of TERC also harbours a potential 5â² G4-forming sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). Insofar as the G4-RNA binding and resolving activities of RHAU are conserved in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B45">45</xref>), it would not be surprising to find that RHAU is part of the telomerase holoenzymes of other mammals.</p><p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>), folding of the 5â² region of TERC into a G4 structure is likely to interfere with the widely adopted secondary structure of human TERC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). Indeed, according to the standard model of TERC secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B67">67</xref>), two of the guanine tracts that are part of the intramolecular G4 also form the P1a helix. As a consequence, the P1a helix and G4 represent two mutually exclusive structures and may correspond to different functional states of TERC. Insofar as helix P1 is required for template boundary definition in mammalian telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B68">68</xref>), formation of a G4 structure in TERC may be detrimental to telomerase activity. On the other hand, G4 structure formation may protect TERC from degradation during telomerase biogenesis. Such a scenario was suggested quite recently by Collins and co-workers, who found that nucleotide substitutions within the G4-forming sequence markedly reduced accumulation of the mature form of TERC, thereby causing telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B69">69</xref>). Similar to our data, they also found that RHAU associates with the G4-forming sequence of TERC <italic>in vivo</italic>, but in contrast to our finding, detected negligible telomerase activity with immunopurified RHAU fraction. Thus, further experiments are necessary to clarify the functional impact of G4 formation in TERC on telomerase biogenesis and activity.</p><p>In cells, the P1 duplex- and G4-folded forms of TERC are likely to coexist in dynamic equilibrium. However, under physiological conditions, restoration of helix P1 base pairing from the G4-folded conformation of TERC is likely to require a catalyst due to the high thermodynamic stability of the quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B30">30</xref>). The biochemical properties and substrate specificity of RHAU make it a likely candidate for catalysing such a reaction. Quite apart from its high affinity for TERC, RHAU manifests robust tetramolecular G4-RNA resolving activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B45">45</xref>) and was also shown to unwind various intramolecular G4-DNA structures <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B70">70</xref>). These data suggest that RHAU can resolve G4 structures irrespective of the strand stoichiometry of the G4 stem. Although unwinding of TERC G4 by RHAU has not yet been demonstrated experimentally, our observation that RHAU dissociates from TERC upon ATP-hydrolysis, but not upon ATP binding, supports the idea that RHAU couples ATP-hydrolysis to conformational changes of TERC, resulting in the resolution of the G4 and further release of RHAU from its target RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>RHAU may target other RNAs containing G4 structures</title><p>Apart from TERC, 54 further RNAs found to be associated with RHAU are predicted to form stable G4 structures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). The determination of the modalities and the significance of these interactions are essential issues to be addressed in the future. Nonetheless, the finding that RHAU associates preferentially with transcripts bearing potential G4-forming sequences strongly suggests that RHAU targets G4-RNA structures in cells. Although nearly three-quarters of these G4-forming sequences are located in 5â² or 3â² UTRs of mRNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>), it is important to stress that, to date, we have not observed any suppressive action of RHAU on translational repression by G4 formation in 5â²-UTRs. Therefore, RHAU is unlikely to function as a translational activator but may instead intervene in other aspects of mRNA metabolism, such as pre-mRNA processing or mRNA turnover. Indeed, RHAU localizes predominantly in the nucleus, where it concentrates in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B71">71</xref>). These are sites of high transcriptional activity and mRNA splicing. Furthermore, RHAU relocalizes to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to various cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B43">43</xref>). Although recruitment of RHAU to stress granules is mediated by interaction with RNA, we have not yet examined whether this phenomenon depends upon binding of RHAU to G4-RNA structures. However, considering that RSM-domain mutated forms of RHAU deficient in G4-RNA binding also show reduced relocalization to stress granules, it is likely that a fraction of RHAU binds G4 structures in stress granules.</p><p>Together with our previous findings that RHAU binds and exhibits robust resolvase activity on various types of G4 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr630-B70">70</xref>), the data presented here bring forth the idea that G4-RNAs and especially intramolecular G4-RNAs serve as physiologically relevant targets for RHAU. Identification of naturally occurring substrates of RNA helicases is a prerequisite to any further investigation of their biochemical properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, although most of the RNA helicases achieve highly specific tasks <italic>in vivo</italic>, they often show only little or even no nucleic acid binding specificity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Currently, our major limitation towards understanding the mechanisms, whereby RNA helicases melt nucleic acid structures stem from the difficulty of identifying such physiologically relevant substrates. Hence, few detailed molecular models available for studying RNA helicases <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, with the finding that the 5â² region of TERC constitutes a biologically relevant substrate, RHAU emerges as a novel and promising prototype of DEAH-box protein and deserves more investigations to explore its functions as a G4 resolving enzyme.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr630/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: <funding-source>Novartis Research Foundation</funding-source>.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
