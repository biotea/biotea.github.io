        <p>Mitochondrial nucleoids consist of several different groups of proteins, many of which are involved in essential cellular processes such as the replication, repair and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. The eukaryotic, ATP-dependent protease Lon is found within the central nucleoid region, though little is presently known about its role there. Aside from its association with mitochondrial nucleoids, human Lon also specifically interacts with RNA. Recently, Lon was shown to regulate TFAM, the most abundant mtDNA structural factor in human mitochondria. To determine whether Lon also regulates other mitochondrial nucleoid- or ribosome-associated proteins, we examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion profiles of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TFAM functional homologue Abf2, the yeast mtDNA maintenance protein Mgm101, and two human mitochondrial proteins, Twinkle helicase and the large ribosomal subunit protein MrpL32. Degradation of Mgm101 was also verified <italic>in vivo</italic> in yeast mitochondria. These experiments revealed that all four proteins are actively degraded by Lon, but that three of them are protected from it when bound to a nucleic acid; the Twinkle helicase is not. Such a regulatory mechanism might facilitate dynamic changes to the mitochondrial nucleoid, which are crucial for conducting mitochondrial functions and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mitochondria are some of the most important organelles of eukaryotic cells. Their proper function depends on both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, whose coordinated regulation of transcription and translation is crucial for cellular survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Nuclear DNA is commonly organized into a nucleoprotein structure called chromatin, while mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exists as nucleoids, somewhat less well-organized proteinâDNA complexes that more closely resemble the bacterial nucleoid rather than nuclear chromatin. Architecturally, these nucleoids consist of a relatively compact core, containing a number of packaging proteins, and a looser periphery, which is bound by a number of important regulatory and signalling proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The principal protein component of the nucleoids found in mammalian mitochondria is the DNA packaging protein TFAM (Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial), a high mobility group (HMG) protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It has been shown that the level of TFAM is linked to the mtDNA copy number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and that the protein has vital roles in mtDNA replication and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Fluctuations in TFAM levels have also been linked with changes in nucleoid morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A given mitochondrion often contains more than one nucleoid, and these nucleoids have been observed in two forms: a highly compacted form, which is presumably used for DNA storage, and a more elongated form, where replication and translation are probably occurring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. TFAM is released from DNA upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A, and TFAM not bound to DNA, whether phosphorylated or not, is a substrate for the ATP-dependent mitochondrial Lon protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. By controlling the levels of unassociated TFAM, Lon is one of the agents responsible for controlling mitochondrial nucleoid dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. There are other proteins which influence nucleoid dynamics, however, most obviously those responsible for mtDNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription, along with some needed for mtDNA packaging, division, and sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>The mitochondrial Lon protease itself has been identified as an integral nucleoid core factor in human mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, it is involved in selective protein turnover (including ribosomal proteins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and the ATP-dependent degradation of misfolded or damaged mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. It also has a chaperone-like function in the assembly of certain mitochondrial complexes, which persists even if its proteolytic activity is impaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Structurally, Lon is a dynamic protease with three functional domains (N-terminal, ATPase and proteolytic) on a single polypeptide chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To date, no complete 3D structure of mitochondrial Lon protease has been determined, although several X-ray crystal structures of separate domains are available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; recently a full-length cryo-electron microscopy structure of human Lon was determined, which showed the importance of the N-terminal domain for protease integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have shown that disruption of the <italic>LON</italic> gene in yeast is not lethal, but does led to an inability to synthesize respiratory chain subunits, the destabilization of the mitochondrial genome, the impairment of mitochondrial gene expression, and respiratory defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thin-section electron microscopy revealed that these cells tend to accumulate electron-dense inclusion bodies in the matrix space, which likely correspond to aggregated mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mammalian cells lacking functional Lon proteases were also observed to behave in a similar manner. These cells exhibited impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced membrane potential, resulting in diverse phenotypes depending on the organism and cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>Many substrates have been identified for this protease. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, these include the mitochondrial metabolic enzymes Ilv1, Ilv2, Lsc1, Lys4, and Aco1; the Î±, Î², and Î³ subunits of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATPase complex; both Î± and Î² subunits of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (individually, but not when combined in the MPPÎ±Î² heterodimer); and a number of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The recent proteomic study of Bayot <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> on Lon-depleted yeast cells identified several additional potential Lon substrates, which accumulated or appeared in oxidized forms in these cells, including three components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Pdb1, Lat1, and Lpd1), six other mitochondrial metabolic enzymes (Kgd2, CoQ5, Dld1, Ald4, Aim17, Ilv5), and four respiratory chain complex subunits (Qcr2, Rip1, Cox4, and Atp7). Fewer substrates are presently known from mammalian mitochondria, but they include important proteins like aconitase, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and TFAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we evaluate the potential of proteins known or expected to be involved in mtDNA packaging, replication, repair, and recombination to be substrates for the mitochondrial Lon protease. Both human and yeast proteins were assessed to determine how general Lonâs influence is likely to be across even quite unrelated eukaryotic species. In particular, we studied the primary yeast mtDNA packaging protein Abf2 and compared its behaviour to that of its human counterpart TFAM. We examined the ability of Lon to degrade the human Twinkle helicase, which forms the mtDNA replication complex together with PolÎ³<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We also considered yeast Mgm101 and human MrpL32. Some forms of the yeast mtDNA-binding protein Mgm101 have been shown to carry out the Rad52 DNA recombination activities of strand annealing and D-loop formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, while human MrpL32, a component of the 39S large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, is known to be important for proper ribosome assembly and, consequently, the proper synthesis and assembly of the mtDNA-encoded components of the oxidative phosphorylation respiratory complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>For each protein, the ability of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), or RNA (in the case of MrpL32) to protect it from degradation by Lon was explored. To verify that each protein was properly folded, DNA-binding and functional assays, where appropriate, were carried out. We found that all of these proteins could serve as Lon substrates, suggesting that the mitochondrial Lon protease could be involved in the regulation of such fundamental processes as nucleoid packaging, mtDNA replication, mtDNA maintenance and recombination, and the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes.</p>

        <title>Yeast Lon protease localizes to mitochondrial nucleoids</title>
        <p>Human Lon protease has been clearly shown to localize to the mitochondria and to be part of the mitochondrial nucleoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To confirm the localization of yeast Lon to the mitochondrial nucleoid, we expressed a GFP-fused Lon in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BY4742 cells. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial network was visualized by fluorescent DiOC<sub>6</sub> staining (Thermo Scientific) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The Lon-GFP fluorescence signals appeared as discrete foci within the yeast cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and overlapped with the DNA-specific DAPI-stained mitochondrial DNA (smaller red spots in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C,D</xref>). This coincidence of signals confirms that the mitochondrial localization of the yeast Lon protease is similar to the previously reported mitochondrial localization of its human homologue.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fluorescence microscopy showing the mitochondrial localization of yeast Lon protease.

        <title>Purification and activity assays of potential yeast Lon protease substrates</title>
        <p>To study the ability of Lon to degrade mitochondrial nucleoid-associated proteins in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we cloned and expressed a recombinant gene for the yeast mitochondrial mtDNA packaging protein Abf2 lacking the N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence and fused with a hexahistidine tag (6âÃâHis) using the pOPINJ expression system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Native Abf2 was obtained by treating the purified recombinant protein with PreScission protease to remove the N-terminal GST affinity tag; the shortened protein was subsequently isolated on a heparin column. A final purification step by size-exclusion chromatography confirmed that Abf2 forms a dimer in solution, similar to TFAM (Supplementary FigsÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) with fluorescently labelled DNA probes of various shapes (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) were used to test the DNA binding activity of Abf2 and to observe whether it shows any preference for a particular DNA structure. Six different fluorescent probes, 3â² overhang, 5â² overhang, Y-form, 3â² flap, 5â² flap and fork, were tested with increasing concentrations of protein and the resulting gel shifts were compared to those observed with ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Abf2 actively bound all tested DNA structures, with a slightly higher preference for dsDNA and probes having at least one free end (i.e. the 5â² overhang, 5â² flap and 3â² flap).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>EMSA of Abf2 with various DNA substrates. Increasing concentrations of Abf2 (0, 50, 100, 200 and 500ânM) were incubated with 75ânM fluorescently labelled DNA probes, whose structures are shown schematically above the corresponding lines. The asterisk (*) indicates the position of the Cy3 fluorescent dye. Samples were separated in 8% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5âÃâTBE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_632_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e571"/></fig>
</p>
        <p>Abf2 DNA-binding properties were more closely observed by comparing its tendency to bind ssDNA and dsDNA. The results presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show higher affinity for dsDNA than ssDNA, supported by the comparative EMSA assay shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>. Both experiments confirmed that Abf2 associates with both types of DNA, as found previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p>In addition to Abf2, we also studied another <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nucleoid-associated protein, the mitochondrial genome maintenance protein Mgm101. As for Abf2, we cloned and expressed a recombinant gene encoding Mgm101 without an N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence fused to a 6âÃâHis tag using a pET100/D-TOPO expression system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Mgm101 was obtained by affinity purification and gel filtration, and the activity of the isolated protein was then determined by its DNA-binding ability, according to Pevala <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Purification and activity assays of potential human Lon protease substrates</title>
        <p>To identify human mitochondrial nucleoid proteins that might be substrates for Lon protease, the gene corresponding to the human mitochondrial helicase Twinkle, lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence, was cloned into a plasmid containing a C-terminal 6âÃâHis-Halo7 purification tag and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This His-tagged form of Twinkle was isolated on an affinity column and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by removal of the tag with PreScission protease (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

The ATPase activity was measured as the amount of inorganic phosphate released in a set time using a modified form of the Lanzetta <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> method. Helicase activity was based on Twinkleâs ability to unwind a fluorescently-labelled dsDNA substrate with increasing concentration of enzyme added to the reaction mixture (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>).

        <title>Substrate digestion by Lon and the effect of nucleic acid binding</title>
        <p>A previous study on the regulation of TFAM levels by DNA and by phosphorylation in its HMG1 box showed that only DNA-free TFAM is a substrate for human mitochondrial Lon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Our control experiments confirmed both results: TFAM free of DNA was actively digested by <italic>h</italic>Lon and remained untouched when bound to either single- or double-stranded DNA (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12</xref>). Digestion of Abf2, the analogous mtDNA-packaging protein from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by <italic>Sc</italic>Lon was tested in the presence and absence of DNA. Purified Abf2 and <italic>Sc</italic>Lon were incubated in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> to confirm that Abf2 is degraded by <italic>Sc</italic>Lon (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Abf2 was also incubated with either ssDNA or a linear dsDNA fragment and <italic>Sc</italic>Lon degradation was then assayed. Because Abf2 is known to effectively bind mtDNA at various positions no effort was made to ensure that these fragments corresponded to any particular mtDNA sequence. The results showed that, like TFAM, Abf2 is also degraded by a Lon protease in the absence of DNA. dsDNA-bound Abf2 was also not degraded by <italic>Sc</italic>Lon, but ssDNA binding did not appear to protect Abf2 from digestion (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13A</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The course of Abf2 digestion by <italic>Sc</italic>Lon. 1.3âÎ¼g Abf2 were incubated with 2.4âÂµg <italic>Sc</italic>Lon in the presence or absence of a DNA probe in reaction mixtures containing 2âmM ATP and 10âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

        <p>Since Lon is known to bind ssDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, a control experiment was carried out in which <italic>Sc</italic>Lon digested Î²-casein under the same conditions as Abf2. The course of Î²-casein digestion by <italic>Sc</italic>Lon was unaffected by the presence of either ssDNA or dsDNA, which is consistent with the above results indicating that DNA has no influence on <italic>Sc</italic>Lonâs protease activity (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S14</xref>).</p>
        <p>We employed a similar approach to study another <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> nucleoid-associated protein, the mitochondrial genome maintenance protein Mgm101. <italic>Sc</italic>Lon-mediated proteolysis was again examined in the presence or absence of DNA, and we again observed the active degradation of the protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13B</xref>). This time, both DNA probes appeared to partially protect the substrate, with dsDNA more strongly blocking the <italic>Sc</italic>Lon proteolytic activity than ssDNA, but the effect was much weaker than for Abf2. Here, we also performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of Mgm101 presence in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria in various Lon-associated genetic backgrounds, which provided clear evidence that Mgm101 levels are decreased in <italic>Sc</italic>Lon protease-overproducing strain (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mgm101 digestion by <italic>Sc</italic>Lon. 1âÎ¼g Mgm101 was incubated with 2.4âÂµg <italic>Sc</italic>Lon in the presence or absence of a DNA probe in reaction mixtures containing 2âmM ATP and 10âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

        <p>Human Lon protease was earlier found to bind RNA as well as DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments with <italic>Sc</italic>Lon indicated that it degrades some ribosomal proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To examine the possible function of <italic>h</italic>Lon in ribosome dynamics, we tested the <italic>h</italic>Lon-mediated digestion of the human large ribosomal subunit protein MrpL32.

Bonn <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> further found that this processing is not dependent on particular cleavage sequences but rather on the actual shape of the protein. No information concerning the behaviour of human MrpL32 within human mitochondria is currently available, however.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we examined the ability of the ATP-dependent mitochondrial matrix protein Lon to degrade four mitochondrial proteins involved in, or expected to be involved in, mtDNA packaging (Abf2) and recombination (Mgm101) in yeast and mtDNA replication (Twinkle) and translation (MrpL32) in humans. We also studied human TFAM both to verify previous work on this protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and to more accurately compare it with Abf2. We verified the correct folding of each protein by conducting DNA-binding EMSA studies and functional assays, and we examined the ability of Lon to digest these proteins alone or when bound to nucleic acids. The <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion of Mgm101 was confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by an immunoblot analysis of the level of Mgm101 in <italic>Sc</italic>Lon-overproducing cells compared to wild-type cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We also tested the ability of each protein to stimulate Lonâs ATPase activity, a behaviour exerted by all known and characterized Lon substrates. A prerequisite for inferring that the results of these assays reflect events in the mitochondria is the verification that Lon does, in fact, localize to the mitochondria in these two organisms. Human Lon protease has been clearly shown to localize to the mitochondria and to be part of the mitochondrial nucleoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>; however, the localization of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Lon has not previously been clearly demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>. We here show that a yeast Lon does, in fact, localize with the mitochondrial nucleoid using a combination of GFP fluorescence to identify the positions of Lon and DAPI staining to locate the cellular DNA (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).</p>
      <p>Lon was originally observed to degrade oxidatively damaged, partially unfolded, and short-lived regulatory proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. More recently, the ability of Lon to regulate the levels of proteins responsible for various mitochondrial processes has been studied. The most through of these has been the exploration of the effect of the Lon proteolysis on the mtDNA packaging protein TFAM. In particular, it has recently been shown that proteolysis of TFAM by Lon is one part of a mechanism that rapidly modulates the levels of TFAM, and consequently of mtDNA, in mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The yeast counterpart of TFAM is Abf2. Although this protein has clearly been shown to be the yeast mtDNA packaging protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, it has not yet been shown to play a role in mtDNA replication and gene expression, which TFAM does<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Consequently, the role and the regulation of Abf2 in yeast might be different from the role and regulation of TFAM in humans. To address this question, we studied the DNA-binding and Lon digestion profiles of both proteins under identical conditions. We found that Abf2 actively binds a wide variety of DNA structures with apparently higher affinity for DNA probes resembling DNA recombination intermediates (i.e. the 5â² overhang and the 3â² and 5â² flaps). These observations are consistent with those of Diffley and Stillman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> who found that Abf2 showed comparable binding affinity for most DNA fragments except those possessing simple poly A sequences. Like TFAM, binding to dsDNA protected Abf2 from degradation by Lon (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), but unlike it, binding to ssDNA provided little to no protection. Since binding to the single-stranded transcription promoter is an important part of TFAMâs function, it is perhaps not unexpected that TFAM bound to ssDNA would resist Lon proteolysis in the same way that it does when bound to dsDNA. That Abf2 appears to bind more weakly to ssDNA than to dsDNA and is not protected from Lon by doing so suggests that Abf2 is not likely to serve as a transcriptional activator in the same way as TFAM.</p>
      <p>Disruption of the <italic>ABF2</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic> causes severe disintegration of mtDNA, which is noticeably less protected and exhibits increased sensitivity to nuclease attack and chemical damage by oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. These effects can be eliminated by the presence of other HMG proteins, including the yeast nuclear protein NHP6A, the human TFAM, and even the <italic>E. coli</italic> HU protein, when targeted to the yeast mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. At least two of these proteins, TFAM and HU, are known to be degraded by their respective organismâs Lon protease. Together with our demonstration that Abf2 is also a Lon substrate, these findings suggest that the ability of Lon to regulate the levels of mtDNA packaging proteins may be a general characteristic.</p>
      <p>For the remaining three proteins, we found that Mgm101 and MrpL32 were only partially protected when bound to DNA (either ss or ds) and RNA, respectively, while DNA binding appeared to offer no protection at all to the Twinkle helicase. In every case, it is possible to infer plausible mechanistic reasons why the given protein is completely, partially, or not at all protected from Lon digestion by nucleic acid binding. Lon prefers to cleave between hydrophobic residues which are normally buried in the core of folded proteins or within the interface of protein complexes but which become exposed either by unfolding or complex disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>; such regions spatially adjacent to charged areas seem to be particularly favoured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>It was previously suggested that Lon may target the HMG boxes in TFAM: they contain a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues which are shielded from solvent in the DNA complex, but may be exposed in unbound TFAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The TFAMâdsDNA crystal structure is consistent with this hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and it shows, moreover, that these residues are also flanked by a number of positively-charged residues, making this location appear likely to be a favoured Lon cleavage site (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S16</xref>). A homology model of Abf2 based on the TFAMâdsDNA structure prepared using the Phyre2 server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> shows that all these residues are largely conserved in the HMG box of Abf2 (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S16</xref>), suggesting a conserved cleavage site between TFAM and Abf2, and one presumably shared with all HMG box proteins.</p>
      <p>Recently, the 3.4âÃ electron microscopy structure of the human mitochondrial ribosome was reported, which includes the entire mature form of MrpL32 (residues 79â188)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In this structure, the N-terminal 49 residues are buried within the ribosome itself, leaving much of the rest of the proteins surface exposed. Of these 49, 23 are deeply buried in the 16S rRNA while the remaining 26 are sequestered by the MrpL3, MrpL17, MrpL22, and MrpL45 ribosomal proteins, which form a layer atop the 16S rRNA. This organization immediately suggests why RNA binding only partially protected MrpL32 from Lon, only part of the normally sequestered area was bound. It is worth noting that the area normally in contact with the ribosomal proteins lacks secondary structure (apart from an isolated Î²-bridge), and does contain a number of hydrophobic residues, making it a plausible location for a Lon cleavage site.</p>
      <p>Although no high-resolution structures are available for Mgm101 and the Twinkle helicase, their known biochemical characteristics can still be used to infer likely reasons for their Lon degradation profiles. The N-terminal region of Mgm101 appears to be intrinsically disordered, making it a possible Lon-recognition region; this region is thought to be important for the recognition of other mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Whether this region is involved in DNA binding is not clear: there is clear evidence that part of the C-terminal region is involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, that there is some sort of large-scale structural change when DNA binds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and that the N-terminus is necessary for the formation of the large-scale structure of Mgm101<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but it has not been shown either that the N-terminus binds DNA or what, exactly, the role of the N-terminus is in forming the large-scale structure. Mgm101 appears to be involved in recombination-mediated DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, presumably in concert with other proteins. The proteins which make up this recombination complex are still unknown, but since Mgm101 cannot catalyse strand recombination by itself, they must exist. Consequently, Mgm101, like MrpL32, exerts its biological function in a complex containing both proteins and nucleic acids, meaning that DNA binding alone is presumably not enough to shield all potential Mgm101 Lon target sites.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Twinkle helicase is known to be one of the proteins necessary for mtDNA replication, though the actual details of this process remain unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. A low-resolution electron microscopy structure of Twinkle shows that it has a two-layer hexameric structure, with a fairly well-ordered layer formed by interactions between the C-terminal helicase domains and a more variable layer formed by the N-terminal pseudo-primase domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>; these two domains appear to be connected by a flexible linker. If Twinkle works like other hexameric helicases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, then it would be expected to operate as part of a larger mtDNA replication complex; the DNA binding site, normally through the center of the hexamer, would also be expected to be separate and distinct from the part associated with other replisome proteins. Structures of hexameric replicative helicases bound to DNA (e.g. DnaC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>) suggest that DNA binding does not change the conformation of the helicase in such a way that previously exposed regions become protected from Lon recognition.</p>
      <p>Taking all of this together, we see that the level of protection DNA or RNA binding offers a given substrate is related to how closely the resulting proteinânucleic acid complex is to the proteinâs putatively complete functional complex. The more complete the likely functional form, the greater the degree of protection to the constituent protein. Thus TFAM and Abf2, which are in their complete functional forms when DNA-bound, are the most protected, Mgm101 and MrpL32, which are in partially assembled forms, are only partially protected, and Twinkle, which is active but outside the context of a replisome, is not protected at all. In these four cases, Lon can be seen exercising its previously known function of degrading the individual components of non-assembled protein complexes. These four proteins are all involved in mtDNA replication (and therefore indirectly in gene expression), repair and recombination, and translation, making the Lon protease an important tool for regulating these processes in mitochondria.</p>
      <p>To summarize, we have shown that a yeast Lon localizes to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial nucleoid and have identified <italic>in vitro</italic> four new substrates for the Lon protease, two each from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and humans. We have shown that yeast Abf2, though it has some differences from human TFAM, is degraded by Lon under many of the same conditions, suggesting that the regulatory model for TFAM might also be applicable to Abf2. We have also found that yeast Mgm101 and human MrpL32 are degraded by Lon, but are partially protected by binding, respectively, DNA and RNA, suggesting that the DNA and RNA binding regions of these proteins are adjacent to those regions where they associate with other proteins in their functional complexes. Finally, we found that the human Twinkle helicase is not protected at all by DNA binding. Since all four of these proteins are involved in mtDNA replication, repair, recombination, translation, or packaging, we have shown that the Lon protease is likely to play an important role in the regulation of all of these processes, and therefore also in nucleoid dynamics.</p>

A PCR amplification was carried out using the Abf2 pOPINJ FW and Abf2 pOPINJ RV primers (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). All plasmid constructs used in this study may be found in Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. This construct was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells induced with 20âÂµM IPTG overnight at 18âÂ°C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50âmM ammonium acetate, pH 7.3, 1âM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with the addition of 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.2âmg/ml lysozyme followed by a 15-minute room temperature incubation and sonication on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 20âminutes at 100,000âÃâg and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with five column volumes of solubilization buffer A containing 40âmM imidazole and five column volumes of buffer B (50âmM ammonium acetate, pH 7.3, 500âmM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 40âmM imidazole.
