      <abstract>
        <p>Integrins connect the extracellular matrix with the cell interior, and transduce signals through interactions of their cytoplasmic tails with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a novel splice variant (filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>) of the filamentous actin cross-linking protein, filamin-B, that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin Î²1A and Î²1D subunits. RT-PCR analysis showed weak, but wide, expression of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> and a similar splice variant of filamin-A (filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>) in human tissues. Furthermore, alternative splice variants of filamin-B and filamin-C, from which the flexible hinge-1 region is deleted (ÎH1), were induced during in vitro differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts. We show that both filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> bind more strongly than their wild-type isoforms to different integrin Î² subunits. The mere presence of the high-affinity binding site for Î²1A is not sufficient for targeting the filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> construct to focal contacts. Interestingly, the simultaneous deletion of the H1 region is required for the localization of filamin-B at the tips of actin stress fibers. When expressed in C2C12 cells, filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) accelerates their differentiation into myotubes. Furthermore, filamin-B variants lacking the H1 region induce the formation of thinner myotubes than those in cells containing variants with this region. These findings suggest that specific combinations of filamin mRNA splicing events modulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the binding affinity for integrins.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Filamins are â¼560-kD dimeric proteins that, based on their conserved actin-binding domain (ABD)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> and actin cross-linking activities, belong, similar to Î±-actinin, spectrin, and dystrophin, to the family of actin-binding proteins. Filamins organize filamentous actin (F-actin) into either orthogonal networks or parallel bundles, depending on the relative actin/filamin ratio and the source of purified filamin. In humans three filamin isogenes have been identified: FLNA, FLNB, and FLNC (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Stossel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">van der Flier and Sonnenberg, 2001a</xref>). Filamin-A is also named ABP-280 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gorlin et al., 1990</xref>) or filamin-1, and filamin-B is also named ABP-278/276 (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>), Î²-filamin (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takafuta et al., 1998</xref>), or filamin-3. Filamin-C has been cloned as Î³-filamin, ABPL (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 1998</xref>), or filamin-2 (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>The first â¼275 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids of filamin contain an ABD, composed of two calponin homology domains. This domain is followed by 24 repetitive, 100-residue segments, interrupted by two â¼30âamino acid flexible loops (hinge-1 [H1] and -2), which show little homology among the products of the filamin isogenes. The H1 loop, between repeats 15 and 16, is lacking in some splice variants of filamin-B and filamin-C (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). It has been suggested that in the dimeric filamin molecule, the flexible H1 regions are essential for the separation of its ABDs and thus for its ability to promote orthogonal cross-linking of actin filaments (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gorlin et al., 1990</xref>). The H2 loop between repeats 23 and 24 is present in all filamin isoforms, and the COOH-terminal repeat 24 is essential in the tailâtail dimerization of the filamin molecule (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gorlin et al., 1990</xref>). In addition to its ability to cross-link actin filaments, filamin-A serves as a docking site for various transmembrane cell surface molecules such as GP-IbÎ±, Fc-Î³RI, tissue factor, and the Î²2 and Î²1A integrin subunits (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfaff et al.,1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 1999</xref>). Filamin-B binds to GP-IbÎ± (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takafuta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>), whereas the muscle-associated filamin-C binds to sarcoglycans (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>) and a number of muscle-specific proteins (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">van der Ven et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Takada et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, intracellular signal transduction proteins, such as the small GTPases RalA, RhoA, Rac-1, Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 1999</xref>), the guanidine-exchange factor Trio (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bellanger et al., 2000</xref>), the tumor necrosis factor receptorâassociated factor-2 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi et al., 2000</xref>), and the membrane-associated proteases, furin and presenilin, bind to filamin (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). These interactions point to a scaffolding function of filamin, rather than a distinct role as an actin filamentâorganizing molecule. Analyses of melanocytic cell lines deficient in filamin-A (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 1992</xref>), as well as of patients with the neuronal migration disorder periventricular heterotopia (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sheen et al., 2001</xref>), indicate a role for filamin-A in cell motility during stabilization of the cell membrane. However, relatively little is known about the specific roles of filamin variants in the properties of cells and the regulation of cellular processes.</p>
      <p>Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors that provide a structural link between proteins of the extracellular matrix (e.g., fibronectin, laminin, and collagen) and the intracellular cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">van der Flier and Sonnenberg, 2001b</xref>). In addition, integrins play a role in several different signaling events (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>). Although the small (20â50 amino acids) cytoplasmic tails of the integrin Î± and Î² subunits have no intrinsic catalytic domains or obvious proteinâprotein interaction domains, studies combining biochemical and genetic approaches, have led to the identification of a range of cytoskeletal, adaptor, and signaling molecules, which interact with the integrin cytoplasmic tails and are therefore implicated in integrin function (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">van der Flier and Sonnenberg, 2001b</xref>). Cytoskeletal proteins, such as the actin cross-linking proteins talin, Î±-actinin, and filamin-A (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Critchley, 2000</xref>), interact with integrin Î² subunits. These molecules have been implicated in the linking of actin stress fibers to the cell membrane at specialized structures, known as focal adhesions or focal contacts, which are formed at cellâsubstrate contact sites. Binding to Î² subunits of this class of proteins was originally shown in biochemical experiments and was recently confirmed in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 1998</xref>). Another category of proteins that interact with integrins are signaling molecules, including the ARF-GEF protein, cytohesin-1, the WD-repeat proteins Rack1 and WAIT-1, ICAP-1, and integrin-linked kinase (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hannigan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kolanus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Liliental and Chang, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Rietzler et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>This study originated with the desire to identify cytoplasmic proteins that bind to the integrin Î²1D subunit, specifically in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Using the yeast two-hybrid technique, we isolated a new splice variant of filamin-B. Characterization of the interactions in yeast two-hybrid analyses and biochemical assays indicated that this filamin variant has a high binding activity and a broad specificity for integrin Î² subunits. Subsequent analysis of filamin mRNA splicing during in vitro myogenesis revealed that the H1 region of filamin-B and filamin-C is removed during the differentiation of myoblasts. Transfection studies with different filamin-B variants tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that the interaction with integrins and the cellular localization of the various filamin variants is different, and they affect myotube morphology and the pace of in vitro myogenesis of C2C12 cells in a variant-specific manner.</p>

        <title>A novel filamin-B splice variant interacts with the Î²1D integrin subunit in yeast</title>
        <p>To identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Î²1D, specific for cardiac and skeletal muscle, we screened a human skeletal muscle cDNA library for interacting clones, using the Î²1D cytoplasmic domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Approximately 6 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> clones were screened. From 67 positive clones, two identical clones encoding the 5 COOH-terminal repeats of filamin-B (amino acids 2027â2602) were isolated. Strikingly, in both filamin-B clones, 41 amino acids were deleted from the region between filamin repeats 19 and 20 (residues 2082â2122). This filamin variant was named filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>. In a yeast two-hybrid screen for clones interacting with Î²1A, using a human keratinocyte cDNA library (29 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> clones), we isolated, from 16 positive clones, 4 identical filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> clones. The other isolated clones encoded either false positives or will be described elsewhere. Additionally, a filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> clone encoding EST was published under GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="W40525">W40525</ext-link> (pancreatic islets). These results show that filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> binds to the cytoplasmic domains of both Î²1A and Î²1D, and the expression of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> is not restricted to skeletal muscle.</p>

        <title>Expression and genomic determination of novel filamin-B splice variants</title>
        <p>To explore the expression pattern of the transcript for filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>, cDNAs of multiple human tissues were analyzed in a PCR reaction, using primers that flank repeats 19 and 20 of filamin-B. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A shows that the cDNA encoding the previously reported filamin-B wild-type sequence was amplified from all tissues tested (683-bp product). In addition, a smaller PCR product of 560 bp, corresponding to the filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> specific part, was detectable in heart, lung, and skeletal muscle. Nested PCR analysis revealed a weak expression of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> in all tissues tested (unpublished data). A similar splice variant lacking the corresponding region (amino acids 2127â2167) in human filamin-A, filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>, was also detected by (nested) PCR analysis (unpublished data). Two additional filamin-Bâspecific PCR products of 830 (filamin-B<sub>var-2</sub>) and 753 bp (filamin-B<sub>var-3</sub>) were detected in cardiac tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Cloning and sequencing of these PCR fragments revealed that they represent two partially overlapping cardiac filamin-B cDNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Intriguingly, in filamin-B<sub>var-2</sub>, the insertion of a 147-bp sequence results in a truncated protein with a unique COOH-terminal sequence of 24 amino acids. The insertion in filamin-B<sub>var-3</sub> of only the first 70 of the 147 bp inserted in filamin-B<sub>var-2</sub> leads to a frameshift, and as a result, four more amino acids are encoded COOH-terminally in this protein. Hence, both cardiac-specific filamin-B transcripts encode truncated filamin-B proteins that lack the four COOH-terminal repeats, including the 24th dimerization domain.</p>

Furthermore, we found that the cDNA sequence of filamin-B<sub>var-2</sub>, specific for heart, is encoded by a 147-bp exon, exon 40B/C. Alternative RNA splicing at the internal splice site, located in exon 40B/C, produces the filamin-B<sub>var-3</sub> transcript.</p>

        <title>Filamin isoforms and their variants determine specificity for association with Î² subunits</title>
        <p>We next tested the interaction of the COOH-terminal domain, i.e., repeats 19â24 of filamin-B and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> with different Î² subunits, using the yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, we tested the homologous regions of filamin-A and filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>. The results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A) show that the COOH-terminal domain of wild-type filamin-B(19â24), containing repeats 19â24, interacts only with Î²1A. In contrast, an equivalent construct encoding filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24), which lacks amino acids 2082â2122 that span repeats 19 and 20, and an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal deletion mutant of filamin-B, truncated at amino acid 2123 (filamin-B, 20*â24), bind not only to Î²1A but also to the Î²1D, Î²3, and Î²6 subunits. Similar results were obtained with proteins from the original isolated filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> clones that contain amino acids 2027â2602 (unpublished data). Quantitative Î²-galactosidase activity assays indicated that filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24) bound two to three times more strongly to Î²1A than did wild-type filamin-B(19â24) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). The binding of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24) to Î²3 was weaker and comparable to that of wild-type filamin-B(19â24) to Î²1A, and that of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24) to Î²1D was of intermediate strength.</p>

        <p>In contrast to filamin-B(19â24), the corresponding filamin-A(19â24) construct did not bind to Î²1A or any other Î² subunit. However, filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24) and the shorter filamin-A(20*â24) construct (amino acids 2168â2647) interacted strongly with Î²1A and weakly with Î²3 and Î²6, but neither of them interacted with Î²1D. None of the aforementioned filamin constructs interacted with the Î²2 cytoplasmic domain (unpublished data). Taken together, these data show that the affinity of filamin-B for Î²1A is strongly increased when the stretch of 41 amino acids is deleted from it. Similarly, the removal of the same region from filamin-A induces binding to Î²1A. Furthermore, both variants become capable of binding to other integrin Î² subunits.</p>
        <p>Analysis of a series of filamin-B constructs truncated at the NH<sub>2</sub> or COOH terminus indicates that repeat 21 is necessary, but not sufficient, for interaction with Î²1A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). It is possible that the presence of repeat 24 facilitates the dimerization of filamin, and thus of repeat 21, thereby greatly increasing the strength of the binding to Î²1A. The interaction of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> with Î²3 and Î²6 was abolished by the deletion of repeats 23â24, whereas it did not affect binding to Î²1A or Î²1D. Interactions of both Î²1A and Î²1D with filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19 and 20) could still be demonstrated, although the binding appeared to be weaker than that of a construct containing repeat 21, filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â21). These data suggest that deletion of the 41âamino acid region in filamin-B leads to either the removal of inhibitory sequences in repeat 19 or to the introduction of a new binding site for Î²1A and Î²1D in the remaining part of repeat 20 (amino acids 1995â2185). The presence of repeat 21 increases binding activity, which is consistent with the data showing that this repeat is necessary for efficient binding of filamin-B to Î²1A and contributes to the binding activity of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> (19â21) to Î²1 integrins. As may be the case for the binding of filamin-B to Î²1A, binding of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> to Î²3 and Î²6 probably requires dimerization mediated by repeat 24.</p>

        <title>Biochemical interaction of filamin variants with integrins</title>
        <p>To confirm the interactions between the different filamin splice variants and the Î²1A and Î²1D subunits observed in yeast, we expressed the regions containing repeats 19â24 of filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> or filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>, or the corresponding regions of wild-type filamin-A(19â24) or filamin-B(19â24), in COS-7 cells. The proteins were tagged at their NH<sub>2</sub> terminus with hemagglutinin A (HA) and expression of equivalent amounts of proteins in COS-7 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Binding of the filamin constructs to Î²1A and Î²1D was tested in a pull-down assay using glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of these integrin subunits, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C, GSTâÎ²1A bound to filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24) and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24), but not to the corresponding fragments of the wild-type filamin isoforms (filamin-A, 19â24, and filamin-B, 19â24). Binding of GSTâÎ²1D to the different filamin-A and filamin-B constructs was either undetectable or very weak. The interaction between Î²1A and filamin-B(19â24) detected in yeast could not be confirmed in the pull-down assay, probably because it is too weak. Interestingly, we found that a truncated filamin-B construct that lacks the first 14 amino acids of repeat 19 (filamin-B, 2009â2602) could be efficiently precipitated with GSTâÎ²1A (unpublished data). Thus, it appears that not only the deletion of COOH-terminal residues of repeat 19, as in the variant-1 protein, but also the deletion of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residues of repeat 19 results in stronger binding of filamin-B to Î²1A. Together, these data suggest that repeat 19 contains an inhibitory element for binding of filamin-B to Î² subunits.</p>

        <title>Identification of the binding sites for filamins on Î²1A and Î²1D</title>
        <p>Next, we determined the binding sites for filamin-B and the splice variants of filamin-A and filamin-B on the cytoplasmic domains of the Î²1A and Î²1D subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) . Swapping the COOH-terminal residues of Î²1A and Î²1D in Î²1A/D<sup>796</sup> (EGK to GRKAGL) and Î²1A/D<sup>792</sup> (NPKYEGK to NPNYGRAGL) had no effect on their binding to filamin-B(19â24), filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â24), and filamin-A(20â24). A swap involving the membrane-proximal region of Î²1D, where the G<sup>778</sup> and A<sup>786</sup> residues in Î²1A are replaced by the corresponding Q<sup>778</sup> and P<sup>786</sup> residues from Î²1D, leads to complete abolition of the interaction with filamin-B(19â24) and filamin-A(20*â24). Binding of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> (19â24) could still be detected, although it was weaker. These results indicate that the specificity of the binding of filamin-B and filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> with Î²1A depends on the two residues, G<sup>778</sup> and A<sup>786</sup>, that have been substituted in Î²1D by Q<sup>778</sup> and P<sup>786</sup>. Although a role for Q<sup>778</sup> cannot be excluded, we propose that P<sup>786</sup>, by its ability to create a bend or a rigid kink in polypeptide chains, changes the conformation of the Î²1D cytoplasmic domain in such a way that it can no longer bind to filamin-B or filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>.</p>

        <p>Analysis of deletions of the cytoplasmic domain of Î²1A shows that for binding to filamin-B, almost the complete cytoplasmic domain of Î²1A is required. Only the last 10 COOH-terminal amino acids of Î²1A can be deleted without causing a loss of interaction. The binding site for filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> on Î²1A comprises both the NPXY motifs and the intervening sequence, whereas on Î²1D additional membrane proximal sequences are needed. Similarly, the minimal binding site for filamin-A(20*â24) on Î²1A comprises the two NPXY motifs and the intervening sequence, which resembles the binding site for filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>. Thus, it appears that the binding site on Î²1A for the low-affinity interaction with filamin-B is distinct from the one mediating high-affinity binding to filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>. The sequence requirements for the binding of Î²1D to filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> resemble those for the low affinity interaction of Î²1A to filamin-B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Alternative splicing of filamins during in vitro myogenesis</title>
        <p>During differentiation of mouse C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, the expression of Î²1D is induced, whereas that of Î²1A is downregulated (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Belkin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">van der Flier et al., 1997</xref>). We investigated whether this switch is paralleled by changes in the expression of filamin isoforms and/or their variants. Total RNA was isolated at different time points of myogenic differentiation, and the expression of filamin isoforms was analyzed by RT-PCR using appropriate primers. We studied the splicing of the region encoding the 41 amino acids in filamin-A and filamin-B, as well that of the H1 region of filamin-A, filamin-B, and filamin-C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). The latter were included because variants of human filamin-B and filamin-C, lacking the H1 region, have been described previously (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, BâD</xref>, shows that C2C12 myoblasts express all three murine filamin isoforms. In addition, whereas the H1 region is present in filamin-A throughout differentiation, this region is absent from the filamin-B and filamin-C isoforms. This deletion appears to precede the switch from Î²1A to Î²1D that occurs during myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, we detected in C2C12 cells and among several murine and human cDNAs (unpublished data) a third filamin-B transcript that encodes a variant with a shorter H1 (H1s) region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D). This transcript arises as a result of the usage of intrinsic splice-donor and acceptor sites that are present in the murine and human filamin-B genes (position 5280 and 5312, respectively; GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. NM_001457). We did not detect the filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> transcripts.</p>

        <title>GFP COOH-terminal tags do not interfere with filamin dimerization</title>
        <p>Before initiating studies to define the cellular localization of the different splice variants of filamin-B, we examined whether the addition of GFP at the COOH terminus of filamin influences the ability of this protein to form dimers. To this end, a filamin-B(19â24) construct with GFP at the COOH-terminal end, and a control construct, tagged with HA at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end, were transiently expressed in CHO cells. After 2 d, cell lysates and intact cells were treated with the chemical cross-linking reagent dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate (DSP) at two concentrations. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> , the addition of increasing amounts of cross-linker led to a shift from monomeric to dimeric tagged filamins, as visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against HA or GFP. The similar dimerization capacity of HA- and GFP-tagged filamin-B(19â24) indicates that the GFP tag had no effect on dimerization. The same samples under reducing conditions, which disrupt the disulfide bond, only contained filamin monomers. Specificity of the cross-linking reaction was checked using the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal HA-tagged filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(19â23) construct, which did not form dimers due to truncation of the COOH-terminal repeat 24, which is required for dimerization.</p>

These include the previously reported filamin-B and filamin-B lacking H1 (filamin-B[ÎH1]), as well as the novel identified filamin-B lacking the 41 residues between repeats 19 and 20 (filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>), and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> without H1 (filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>[ÎH1]). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, the latter two filamin-B variants are expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, including heart, lung, testis, spleen, thymus, and leukocytes. Several cell types were retrovirally transduced, and after fluorescence-activated cell sorting for filamin-GFPâexpressing cells, the stable expression of the different filamin fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting. In all cell lines, full-length GFP-tagged filamin-B variants migrating at â¼300 kD could be detected (shown for C2C12, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). Filamin-B expression levels were consistently lower than those of the other variants, which were comparable to each other. Occasionally, smaller protein degradation products were detected, which varied in size and quantity, depending on the transduced cell line and the filamin variant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). GST pull-down assays confirmed that deletion of the variant-1 region from full-length filamin-B increases binding to Î²1 integrins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). Only the two filamin-B constructs, filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> (ÎH1), in which the variant-1 region had been deleted, but not filamin-B or filamin-B(ÎH1), were precipitated by GSTâÎ²1A (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). Binding of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) to Î²1D again proved to be weak and could only be demonstrated after long exposures of the film.

Thus, the GFP tag did not interfere with the normal localization of filamin-B. Filamin-B was localized at actin stress fibers but was not appreciably concentrated in focal contacts.

Neither endogenous filamin-B (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B) nor any of the filamin-B variants (unpublished data) were enriched in lamellipodia. The expression of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) in focal contacts did not have an apparent effect on the composition and localization of these structures. They were confined at the end of actin stress fibers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, JâL, and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> F) and in addition to vinculin, they contained talin, phospho-tyrosine, and paxillin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, A, B, and D</xref>). We did not detect Î±-actinin in focal contacts (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> C). Lastly, in GD25-Î²1D cells expressing filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) there was also a prominent staining of some focal contacts (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Filamin-B variants affect myoblast differentiation in vitro</title>
        <p>The functional significance of the developmentally regulated splicing of the H1 region in filamin-B, as well as the deletion of the 41âamino acid region, was explored by analyzing the effects of ectopic expression of the four different filamin-B splice variants on myogenesis of C2C12 cells. Myogenic differentiation was induced by switching the culture to a medium containing 2% horse serum (differentiation medium). Interestingly, C2C12 cells expressing filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) fused into myotubes within 2 to 3 d after the medium switch, which is 1â2 d earlier than the fusing of cells from the other transduced cell lines (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> A). Furthermore, the myotubes formed by the cells expressing the filamin-B variants lacking the H1 region (filamin-B[ÎH1] and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>[ÎH1]) were thinner than those formed by the other transduced cell lines or GFP control cells. This difference in morphology was more obvious when the myotubes were stained for MHC (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figs. 11</xref> and <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>) .</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, we have identified novel distinct splice variants produced by the filamin-A and filamin-B genes, and report on functional differences between filamin isoforms and their variants. We found that the deletion of 41 amino acids encoded by exon 40 from filamin-A and filamin-B, which generates the variants filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>, greatly influences their interaction with integrin Î² subunits. The role of two additional heart-specific filamin-B variants, filamin-B<sub>var-2</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-3</sub>, which lack the last four repeated sequences of filamin-B, including the putative dimerization domain, remains elusive. COOH-terminal truncated filamin variants of <italic>Drosophila</italic> filamin-240 have also been reported (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Sokol and Cooley, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the recent identification of truncated variants of several other high molecular weight proteins that cross-link actin: i.e., dystropin/utrophin, dystonin, and plectin (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs and Yang, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Blake and Kroger, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Zuellig et al., 2000</xref>), raises the interesting possibility that these variants play an unprecedented role in the regulation of actin dynamics and the modification of F-actin organization.</p>
      <p>Finally, analysis of the splicing of mRNAs for filamins during in vitro myogenesis of C2C12 cells revealed that the H1 region of filamin-B and filamin-C is removed during myotube formation. The biological consequences of these modifications are discussed below.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Specific interactions of filamin variants</title>
        <p>The novel filamin-B variant, filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>, is the fourth reported Î²1D-binding protein identified in a yeast two-hybrid scree; the other three are MIBP, melusin, and skelemin (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brancaccio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1999a</xref>). The yeast two-hybrid interaction assays indicated that filamin-A does not bind to any integrin Î² subunit, whereas filamin-B only interacts with Î²1A. On the contrary, the splice variants filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> bind strongly to Î²1A and weakly to Î²3 and Î²6. Additionally, a moderate binding of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> to Î²1D was observed. These results provide evidence that isoforms and variants of filamins specifically bind to different integrin Î² subunits, which render the interpretation of biochemical studies with filamins more complicated. Furthermore, subcellular localization and morphological and myogenic effects were found to be determined by the type of the expressed filamin variant.</p>
        <p>Previously, it has been shown by coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays that various integrin Î² subunits have different capacities to bind cytoskeletal proteins. The results of these assays showed that the affinity of Î²1D for talin is greater than that of Î²1A, which could result in Î²1D having a stronger link with the cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Belkin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfaff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zent et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, the affinity of the Î²7 integrin subunit for filamin appeared to be high, whereas that of Î²1A and Î²1D was found to be intermediate and low, respectively (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfaff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zent et al., 2000</xref>). Our data suggest that Î²1 integrins hardly interact with filamin-A or filamin-B and that most of their binding activity toward these filamin isoforms is with the variant-1 forms. In agreement with previous findings, we observed that the binding of Î²1A to filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> is stronger than that of Î²1D. <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al. (1998)</xref> has previously reported that filamin-A can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Î²1A. However, their conclusion was based on the binding of Î²1A to a construct containing the COOH-terminal 478 amino acids of filamin-A. This fragment corresponds to filamin-A(20*â24), whose binding properties resemble those of filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub>. However, a longer filamin-A protein, extending 176 amino acids at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, does not bind to integrin Î² subunits. Thus, the apparent discrepancies between these reported data and ours might be due to the fact that those studies were concerned with the interaction of Î²1A with a splice variant of filamin-A rather than with wild-type filamin-A. Similarly, the filamin proteins previously identified in pull-down experiments using dimerized integrin cytoplasmic domains presumably do not represent wild-type filamin, but filamin splice variants (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pfaff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Calderwood et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
        <p>The discrepancy between our pull-down interaction results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and those of yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) on the interaction of filamin-B variants with Î²1D probably can be reduced to a difference in sensitivity between these two assays; the yeast two-hybrid assay being more sensitive than the pull-down assay. Indeed, we found in the Î²-galactosidase assays that binding of Î²1D to filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> is weaker than that of Î²1A. An alternative explanation might be that in the GSTâÎ²1D fusion protein, the Î²1D cytoplasmic sequences are not readily accessible for binding.</p>
        <p>Based on the immunoglobulin-like folding of several filamin repeats that are present in the gelation factor of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fucini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et al., 1999</xref>), it is likely that as a result of the 41âamino acid deletion, three Î²-strands of the two adjacent repeats 19 and 20 (strand G from repeat 19 and strands A and B from repeat 20) were lacking in the filamin-A and filamin-B variants. Removal of this stretch of 41 amino acids probably led to the exposure of one or more cryptic binding sites for integrin Î² subunits in the remaining part of repeat 20 of filamin-A and filamin-B. Alternatively, the disruption of repeat 19 may have removed elements inhibiting the binding of filamin-B to Î²1A. Finally, together with the deleted 41 amino acids in human filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>, a conserved cAMP-kinase consensus site (serine 2150) was removed that, when phosphorylated in filamin-A, confers an increased resistance to calpain cleavage at residues 1761â1762 in the H1 region (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gorlin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Jay et al., 2000</xref>). This suggests long-range conformational effects by the 19 and 20 repeat region of filamin and, although serine 2150 is not conserved in murine filamin-B, deletion of this region may have additional effects beyond the modulation of the strength and specificity of filamin-Î²âintegrin interactions. Interestingly, filamin-C contains an insertion of 82 amino acids, exactly juxtaposed to the homologous variant-1 region, which could give specific features to this filamin variant associated with striated muscle (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>). Evidence of alternative splicing of mRNA has not yet been reported for this region (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Specialized cellular roles and specific cellular localization of filamin-B variants</title>
        <p>Several previous reports have indicated complex expression patterns of filamin variants during myogenesis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gomer and Lazarides, 1981</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">1983a</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we extended those data by the identification of additional filamin-B<sub>var</sub> and H1 splice variants. We demonstrate that removal of the H1 region from filamin-B and filamin-C is induced during myogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, the presence or absence of the H1 region in filamin-B affects the morphology of the formed myotubes. Filamin-B variants lacking H1 form thinner myotubes in contrast to the more pouch-like tubes formed by H1-containing filamins.</p>
        <p>Deletion of the H1 region from both filamin-B and filamin-C might determine the type of actin filaments with which these filamin isoforms interact. This would explain why during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, a process that is associated with a dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton, the splicing of the mRNA for this region is regulated and why forced expression of it has such a dramatic effect on the morphology of the formed myotubes. Parallel bundles of actin filaments might become more tightly packed by the loss of the H1 region of filamin, because the flexibility of the filamin dimer lacking the H1 region is reduced, as has been anticipated by <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gorlin et al. (1990)</xref>. Our observation that filamin-B variants lacking the H1 region show the tendency to be more polarized at the ends of actin stress fibers supports this hypothesis. The identification of shorter filamin-B(ÎH1s) alternative splice variants in several murine and human tissues provides additional possibilities for the modulation of the H1 region, and subsequent effects on the organization of the F-actin network.</p>
        <p>Indeed, several studies have shown the effects of differences in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton on myoblast morphology and differentiation. For example, expression of dystrophin, or its homologue utrophin, in dystrophin-deficient <italic>mdx</italic> mice affects the type of fibers present in muscle (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rafael et al., 2000</xref>). Also, RhoA-mediated induction of stress fibers increases myoblast differentiation, in contrast to the inhibitory effects on myogenesis by Rac-1 and Ras (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gallo et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
        <p>By transfecting filamin-B variants into cells, it was shown that the colocalization of filamin with Î²1-integrinâcontaining focal adhesions is not solely dependent on the presence of an integrin-binding site on filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>. Only the filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) variant, in which a high affinity binding site for Î²1A and Î²1D is combined with the absence of the H1 region, is concentrated at the tips of actin stress fibers, where it is colocalized with Î²1 integrins. Two previously described chicken filamin variants could resemble filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Pavalko et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tachikawa et al., 1997</xref>), because of their localization at the ends of stress fibers in focal adhesions or at the dense plaques in smooth muscle cells. It is possible that the effect induced by the loss of the H1 region permits the linkage of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) with special organized actin stress fibers in focal contacts, thereby facilitating binding of the variant-1 site to integrins. However, there are other possible explanations, e.g., similar to the deletion of the var-1 region, the deletion of the H1 region may have induced a binding site for one or more focal contact proteins that, together with Î²1, mediate the localization of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) in focal contacts.</p>
        <p>Our finding that filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) is present together with talin in focal contacts raises the question of which of these two proteins is actually associated with Î²1. Filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) and talin bind to overlapping sites on the Î²1 cytoplasmic domain and, therefore, it seems unlikely that these two proteins simultaneously bind to Î²1. We believe it is reasonable to assume that a proportion of Î²1 is associated with talin, whereas other Î²1 subunits interact with filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> (ÎH1). An alternative possibility, which we consider to be less likely, but nevertheless cannot formally be excluded, is that only filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) is associated with Î²1 and talin is retained in focal contacts by an interaction with vinculin.</p>
        <p>Previous reports have indicated a critical role for integrins in myogenic differentiation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Menko and Boettiger, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sastry et al., 1996</xref>) and muscle integrity (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Volk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 1998</xref>). Conceivably, the acceleration of myogenesis observed in C2C12 cells expressing filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) might be due to an altered interaction of this filamin variant with the Î²1 integrins. An increased interaction may help to stabilize the expression of integrins at the cell surface by firmly anchoring them to the actin cytoskeleton. For example, the reexpression of filamin-A, in filamin-Aâdeficient melanoma cells, has been associated with an increase in the surface levels of both the GP-IbÎ± and Î²1 integrins (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>). However, we did not detect, by FACS<sup>Â®</sup> analysis, any changes in surface expression levels of Î²1 integrins upon the ectopic expression of filamin-B variants (unpublished data). This discrepancy could be due to the complete lack of filamin-A in the M2 cells used by <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. (1998)</xref>. If cells contain endogenous filamin, the ectopic expression of filamin has no detectable effects. The effects of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) on myogenesis may also be the consequence of a different localization and/or function of integrins in C2C12 cells. Indeed, as already mentioned, the distribution of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) is typically polarized in differentiating C2C12 cells and is localized together with Î²1 in focal contacts in GD25-Î²1A cells. However, whatever the underlying mechanism for the effect of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>(ÎH1) on myogenesis is, the physiological significance of it remains uncertain, because it could not be demonstrated that this variant is expressed in C2C12 cells.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that alternative mRNA splicing controls the cellular localization of filamins and their interaction with integrins. This indicates that individual filamin variants could be specialized in linking integrins or other transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, comparable to the filamin-Câspecific (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>) and dystrophin-mediated connection with the sarcoglycan adhesion complex in muscle cells. Ultimately, these specific activities of filamin variants modulate cell morphology and differentiation.</p>

        <title>Yeast two-hybrid screen and plasmid constructs</title>
        <p>The Î²1D (amino acids 752â798) or Î²1A cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 752â801) were fused to the Gal4 DNA BD in pAS2.1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). These constructs were used as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens of a human skeletal muscle and a human keratinocyte library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.; HL4010AB and HL4024AB, respectively) in the yeast Gal4 transcriptional AD expression vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Plasmids were introduced into the yeast host strains PJ69â4A (a gift from Dr. P. James, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">James et al., 1996</xref>) or Y190 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) by transformation. The yeast two-hybrid library screen was performed essentially according to the CLONTECH Laboratory, Inc. two-hybrid manual.</p>
        <p>To analyze the proteinâprotein interactions of truncated filamin-A and filamin-B with several integrin cytoplasmic tails, mutants, and truncated filamins, pACT (-derived) and pAS (-derived) constructs were cotransformed into the yeast strain PJ69â4A. Interaction was assayed by selection for growth on plates containing SC-LTHA, a yeast synthetic complete medium lacking the vector markers Leu and Trp, as well as the interaction markers His and Ade, and containing 2 mM 3-aminotriazole (Sigma-Aldrich; A8056) to suppress residual histidine synthesis in the strain PJ69â4A, as described previously (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Geerts et al., 1999</xref>). Interaction was scored as the percentage of the plating efficiency on SC-LTHA containing 2 mM 3-aminotriazole compared with the plating efficiency on SC-LT, a medium lacking only the vector markers Leu and Trp, when grown for 5 or 10 d at 30Â°C. Quantitative determination of Î²-galactosidase activities was performed in triplicate using of three independent clones grown in SC-LT with <italic>O</italic>-nitrophenyl B-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) as the substrate, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
        <p>All filamin-A and filamin-B deletion constructs (starting at the amino acids as indicated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; for amino acid alignment see <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">van der Flier and Sonnenberg, 2001a</xref>) were generated by PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Filamin-A and filamin-B deletion constructs were cloned in the modified yeast expression vector, pACT2.4 (Gal-4[AD], a derivative of pACT2.1) or pAS2.1 (Gal4[BD]). The Gal4(BD) Î²1A, Î²1D, Î²2, Î²3A cytoplasmic domain and Î²1A truncation constructs in the pAS2.1 have been described previously (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Wixler et al., 2000</xref>). The Î²6 cytoplasmic domain construct in pAS2.1 was a gift of S. Spong (Lung Biology Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA). The Î²1 chimeric cytoplasmic domains Î²1A/D<sup>792</sup>, Î²1A/D<sup>796</sup>, and Î²1D/A<sup>787</sup> were generated by PCR and cloned into pAS2.1. All plasmid constructs were checked by sequencing, and the expression of fusion proteins in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting with Gal4(BD)- and (AD)-specific antibodies. None of the filamin constructs used activated the reporter genes autonomously in yeast, nor did they bind to any of several different integrin Î±-subunits tested.</p>

        <title>Genomic PCR and RT-PCR analysis</title>
        <p>RT-PCR analysis was performed on Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel I and II (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) using Taq DNA polymerase and primers deduced from the human filamin-B sequence.</p>
        <p>The following primer sets were used to detect the human filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> cDNA: either BV1/BV2 or nested PCR using primers BV9/BV11 on the BV9/BV10 PCR products. BV11 specifically amplifies the filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> cDNA because it spans the 123-nt deleted sequence with one basepair at its 3â² end. Similarly, human filamin-A<sub>var-1</sub> was detected using the nested primers AV1/AV3 on the AV1/AV2 PCR product. Human filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> (ÎH1) transcripts with or without the H1 region were detected using primers BV12/BV13. Genomic sequences encoding repeats 19 and 20 of human filamin-B were determined by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase on human genomic DNA isolated from two different cell lines, using a standard procedure and combinations of the primers BV1âBV8 as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C. All BV primers are numbered according to the filamin-B sequence data available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. NM_001457, except primers BV7 and BV8, which are numbered according to sequence data submitted under accession no. AF353666. Numbering of AV primers is according to the filamin-A sequence available under accession no. NM_001456.

        <title>Cloning of HA-tagged and GFP fusion proteins</title>
        <p>Truncated forms of filamin-A and filamin-B were fused to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal HA epitope tag in pcDNA3-HANII, a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). pCI-puro-eGFPc was generated by inserting an eGFP PCR product, using pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) as a template, into pCI-puro(ÎXbaI/NotI), a pCI-neoâderived (Promega) vector in which the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene was replaced by the gene for puromycin-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl transferase, which induces puromycin resistance. LZRS-eGFPc-IRES-zeo was constructed by subcloning the eGFP fragment from pCI-puro-eGFPc into the retroviral expression vector LZRS-ms-IRES-zeo (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kinsella and Nolan, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">van Leeuwen et al., 1997</xref>). The four fusion proteins of full-length filamin-B variants and GFP as depicted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A were generated by a three point ligation into the XbaI/NotI sites of pCI-puro-eGFPc. All four possible combinations between one 5â² filamin-B fragment (XbaI/SacII), either containing or not containing the H1 region, and one 3â² filamin-B fragment (SacII/NotI), either wild-type or variant-1, were prepared. Retroviral expression constructs were obtained by recloning the above filamin-B variants from pCI-puro-eGFP into the retroviral vector LZRS-eGFPc-ms-IRES-zeo. The 5â² filamin-B fragment containing the H1 region was obtained by XbaI/SacII digestion of wild-type filamin-B (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Takafuta et al., 1998</xref>). A 3â² filamin-B fragment containing a 3â² NotI site for in-frame fusion with GFP was generated by PCR, using primer set D4/U5 and full-length filamin-B as template. A 5â² filamin-B fragment lacking H1 (amino acids 1704â1727) was generated by fusion PCR. In brief, two PCR products were obtained using D1/U1 and D2/U2 primer pairs. Products were annealed through overlapping sequences (underlined) and reamplified with D1/U2 to yield the H1 deletion. This PCR product was then used to replace the MunI/SacII fragment of wild-type filamin-B. A 3â² fragment of filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub>, containing an intrinsic SacII and an in-frame 3â² NotI site was generated by fusion PCR. One PCR product was obtained using primer set D4/U4 and wild-type filamin-B as template. The other PCR product was obtained using primer set D5/U5 and filamin-B<sub>var-1</sub> cDNA as template. The final fusion PCR product was obtained after reannealling the two obtained products and reamplification using primer set D4/U5. The primers used are under GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no.

        <title>Binding to GST fusion proteins</title>
        <p>For pull-down assays, Î²1A and Î²1D cytoplasmic domains were fused with GST in the bacterial expression vector pRP261, a derivative of the pGEX-3X vector. The recombinant proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) and purified from bacterial lysates by the use of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Constructs encoding NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally truncated filamins were transfected in COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (two 10-cm Petri dishes with 10<sup>6</sup> seeded cells were used for three pull-down assays). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed for 20 min in 1 ml ice cold lysis buffer (10 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 150 mM sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 Î¼g/ml calpeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 10 Î¼g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 U/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, and subsequently diluted 10 times in dilution buffer (10 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 150 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Diluted lysates were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with 15 Î¼l glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads containing 50 Î¼g GST fusion proteins. The beads were washed with the same lysis buffer and centrifuged through a sucrose cushion (10 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 800 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. For GST precipitations of full-length COOH-terminally GFP-tagged filamins, stable retrovirally infected C2C12 or GD25-Î²1A cells were lysed and incubated with the various GST fusion proteins. Expression of the full-length GFP-tagged filamin-B variants was increased by preincubating the cells overnight with 5 mM sodium butyrate. GST fusion protein loading of the beads was checked by Coomassie brilliant blue staining, and the filamin fusion proteins were visualized by immunoblotting, as described previously (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Geerts et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

        <p>CHO cells were transfected with NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal HA-tagged or COOH-terminal GFP-tagged truncated constructs of full-length filamin-B (FLN-B[19â24] <sup>2009â2602</sup> or FLN-B<sub>var-1</sub>[19â23] <sup>2027â2047</sup>), using a cationic lipid-based DNA delivery protocol (Lipofectamin; Life Technologies). After a 3-h incubation, the lipofectamin reagent was replaced by fresh growth medium. 2 d later, transfected cells were lysed in 0.5 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min on ice and subsequently subjected to cross-linkage for 1 h on ice by adding different concentrations (0, 0.25, or 1 mM) of DSP (Pierce Chemical Co.; 25 mM stock in DMSO). Alternatively, the intact cell monolayer was treated with 1 mM of the cell-permeable cross-linker, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, for 1 h. Subsequently, the cross-linking reaction in the cell lysate was stopped by adding 25 Î¼l of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), whereas the intact treated cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. All cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and 1/12 portions of the total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7% gels under both nonreducing and reducing (5% Î²-mercaptoethanol) conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>
