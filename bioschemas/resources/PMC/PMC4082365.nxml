      <abstract>
        <p>We describe the characterization of a gene for mild nonsyndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ID) in two unrelated families, one from Austria, the other from Pakistan. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis enabled us to define a region of homozygosity by descent on chromosome 17q25. Whole-exome sequencing and analysis of this region in an affected individual from the Austrian family identified a 5 bp frameshifting deletion in the <italic>METTL23</italic> gene. By means of Sanger sequencing of <italic>METTL23</italic>, a nonsense mutation was detected in a consanguineous ID family from Pakistan for which homozygosity-by-descent mapping had identified a region on 17q25. Both changes lead to truncation of the putative METTL23 protein, which disrupts the predicted catalytic domain and alters the cellular localization. 3D-modelling of the protein indicates that METTL23 is strongly predicted to function as an <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase. Expression analysis of METTL23 indicated a strong association with heat shock proteins, which suggests that these may act as a putative substrate for methylation by METTL23. A number of methyltransferases have been described recently in association with ID. Disruption of METTL23 presented here supports the importance of methylation processes for intact neuronal function and brain development.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>About 1% of children worldwide are affected by intellectual disability (ID) (<xref rid="DDU115C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which can have a devastating impact on many aspects of the lives of the affected individuals, their families and communities, and is a major challenge at the clinical level. The clinical presentation and etiology of ID is complex and has a high degree of heterogeneity, which leads to a poor rate of molecular diagnosis resulting in below satisfactory clinical management. Although recent advances in sequencing technology have accelerated the rate of gene discovery for ID, even where family sizes are small, the majority of ID genes remain undetected. ID can be divided into two groups: nonsyndromic ID is characterized as the only clinical feature in patients, whereas syndromic ID occurs in combination with one or more additional clinical features (<xref rid="DDU115C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A recent review suggested that â¼40 genes for nonsyndromic autosomal recessive ID (NS-ARID) have been identified to date, but estimates there may be in excess of 2500 autosomal ID genes in total, with the majority being recessive (<xref rid="DDU115C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Although the physiological roles of ID genes are heterogeneous, increasing numbers of methyltransferases are being implicated in ID, stressing the essential role that methylation plays in the development and function of the central nervous system. For instance, ID has been linked to mutations in the methyltransferases <italic>NSUN2</italic> (<xref rid="DDU115C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DDU115C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) <italic>EHMT1</italic> (<xref rid="DDU115C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), <italic>FTSJ1</italic>, (<xref rid="DDU115C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and <italic>TRMT1</italic> (<xref rid="DDU115C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which have diverse molecular substrates. Here, we report the identification of methyltransferase-like 23 gene (<italic>METTL23</italic>) truncating mutations in two nonsyndromic ID families, one Austrian and the other Pakistani family, and discuss potential substrates for this protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The Austrian ID family (LFKK1) has five children. In four affected siblingsâtwo male and two femaleâa delay in developmental milestones was noted after the first year of life, and ID was diagnosed, whereas one sister was unaffected. All four affected siblings have a relatively high level of functioning, and a detailed clinical description is given in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddu115/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p><p>The phenotypes and the degree of ID in the two affected girls of the Pakistani family (PK31) had a striking similarity to the Austrian family (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddu115/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> for detailed clinical descriptions). Photographs for the two affected Pakistani girls are shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F1">1</xref>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was available for individual PK31-II:1 and II:22. For II:2, MRI showed increased volume of the subcallosal gray matter, and decreased delineation of the basal ganglia-regions strongly implicated in affect regulation, which may correlate with the aggression documented for this individual (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F1">1</xref>).
<fig id="DDU115F1" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 1.</label><caption><p>Magnetic resonance images: Two independent experts in neuroimaging (Christian Enzinger, Franz Fazekas) inspected the MRI scans blinded to clinical information and detected increased volume of the subcallosal area (SA), which was particularly evident in patient PK31 II:2 (<bold>A</bold>: red circles; in comparison with patient II:1 in <bold>D</bold>: green circles). On axial T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences, this led to decreased identifiability of the basal ganglia (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold> red arrows (II:2); compared with <bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold> (II:1), green arrows). The SA is commonly attributed to the limbic system, belongs to a phylogenetic old-brain area, is located in the vicinity of strategically important areas such as the hypothalamus and mamillar bodies and has been implicated in affect regulation. Interestingly, clinical information revealed that patient II:2 had demonstrated aggressive behavior and disturbed impulse control. Photos of PK31 II:2 (<bold>G</bold> and <bold>H</bold>) and II:1 (<bold>I</bold> and <bold>J</bold>) are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddu11501"/></fig></p><p>For Austrian family LFKK1, a single large homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) region of about 4.8 Mb on chromosome 17q25.1âq25.3 was identified (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F2">2</xref>); this area contained 107 genes. No other HBD stretch present in all affected family members and not in unaffected members could be identified. One possible candidate gene within the HBD region on 17q was <italic>TSEN54</italic>, which encodes one subunit from the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex.<sup>21</sup> Mutation in this gene causes pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2A (OMIM #277470) and type 4 (OMIM #225753)-neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disorders with chorea, dystonia or spasticity (<xref rid="DDU115C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="DDU115C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, Sanger sequencing of all exons of <italic>TSEN54</italic> identified no mutation. After whole-exome sequencing for LFKK1 individual II:5, selection for homozygous exonic mutations in the 17q HBD region and exclusion of entries of the dbSNP131 database, only two genetic changes remained: A synonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) (chr17:74392666G&gt;A; NM_022066.3:c.2352C&gt;T; p.Ala784Ala) in the <italic>UBE2O</italic> (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2O) gene and a 5 bp frameshift deletion (chr17:74729256_74729260delAAGAT; NM_001206983.1: c.281_285delAAGAT; p. (Gln94Hisfs*6) resulting in a predicted 98 amino acids METTL23 protein) in exon 3 of the C17orf95 (<italic>METTL23</italic>, methyltransferase-like protein 23) gene (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F2">2</xref>). As the synonymous SNV is a known SNP (rs145605062; dbSNP build 138; MAF = 0.58%), it is not predicted to affect splicing (analyzed through BDGP: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.fruitfly.org">www.fruitfly.org</uri>), and therefore seems unlikely to be disease related. In contrast, small indels have frequently been associated with severe, sporadic nonsyndromic ID (<xref rid="DDU115C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and therefore we focused on investigating <italic>METTL23</italic> further. In addition to this, all known genes associated with NS-ARID were screened for compound heterozygosity in our exome data (<xref rid="DDU115C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The homozygous <italic>METTL23</italic> variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in all four affected family members, whereas the unaffected sister and the parents were all heterozygous. For controls, we analyzed 200 unrelated, unaffected Austrian individuals for variants in <italic>METTL23</italic> coding exons (exons 2â5) by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). In three samples, we identified the known SNV rs138247613 (c.G496A, p.D166N) in exon 5 with a comparable frequency of 2% for the heterozygous G/A genotype in the European population. However, we detected no other variants in this cohort.

Transcript variants 1, 2 and 3 encode the protein isoform 1 (190 amino acids) and the transcripts 4, 5 and 6 for the shorter protein isoform 2 (123 amino acid). The mRNAs have different length because of differing sizes of the non-coding first exon or because of alternative splicing of exon 2.

Accordingly, we modeled the 3D structure of human METTL23. The final model has optimal confidence scores along the entire sequence length (190 residues, i.e. isoform 1) and is shown in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F4">4</xref>A. Based on this homology model, possible ligands and their binding sites in METTL23 were predicted using the server 3DLigandSite (<xref rid="DDU115C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In total, 22 similar structures were identified in the PDB, which all contain either <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) or <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) as a cofactor. Twenty-five residues of METTL23 were predicted to build up the SAM/SAH-binding site (colored green in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F4">4</xref>A), â¼50% of which were completely conserved among this set of SAM/SAH-binding proteins. According to this structural bioinformatics analysis, it is very likely that METTL23 isoform 1 adopts a 3D fold typical for methyltransferases and contains a binding site for the methylation cofactor SAM. Thus, we conclude that METTL23 is indeed functioning as a methyltransferase. Both truncation variants, on the other hand, are predicted to lack a significant portion of the core fold (central Î²-sheet) of the protein (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F4">4</xref>B). Therefore, it is very likely that these variants are not properly folded and thus do not show methyltransferase activity.

We then generated the protein in the presence of chaperones (e.g<italic>.</italic> GroEL) yielding soluble METTL23. Interestingly, affinity purification of his8-tagged METTL23 and size exclusion chromatography showed that the protein co-eluted with the chaperone (SDSâPAGE: fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F5">5</xref>B). Attempts to release METTL23 from the chaperone, for example by addition of ATP, were unsuccessful indicating that METTL23 is tightly bound. This finding is in accordance with the suspected association of METTL23 with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (as shown in Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU115F6">6</xref>). On the other hand, Cloutier and coworkers (<xref rid="DDU115C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) recently reported that several human methyltransferases interact with molecular chaperones and regulate their activity by methylation of a conserved lysine residue.

Interestingly, a homozygous 4-bp deletion (c.169_172delCACT) in the <italic>METTL23</italic> gene was very recently described in a consanguineous family of Arab origin (<xref rid="DDU115C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In contrast to our two families, Reiff <italic>et al</italic>. noted some dysmorphic features in their affected family members. Clinical findings common to all affected individuals included flat occiput, large eyes, depressed nasal bridge, short upturned nose, long philtrum, thin lips and incomplete syndactyly. The cognitive impairment was classified as âsevere, with autistic symptomsâ in one individual and as âmoderateâ in two other affected family members. Altogether, this suggests that truncating mutations can lead to nonsyndromic ARID as well as ARID with dysmorphic or syndromic features. The cognitive impairment also seems to be milder in families LFKK1 and PK31, as the affected individuals of both families have a relatively high degree of comprehension, including long sentences, and have at least very simple reading, writing and math abilities. There was no evidence of autistic traits. As the three mutations found thus far in <italic>METTL23</italic> are different and present with different severity of ID, a genotype/phenotype correlation seems probable. Importantly, the mutation reported by Reiff <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="DDU115C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) is located in an exon that is only coding in isoform 1 (and is in a 5â² untranslated region in isoform 2), whereas the mutations in LFKK1 and PK31 are truncating for both isoforms. This perhaps represents something of a paradox, as the symptoms associated with the mutation that is exclusive to isoform 1 are severer.</p><p>Localization studies suggest that wild-type (WT) METTL23 isoform 1 is likely to function in the ER, whereas isoform 2 has a nuclear localization. Expression of the mutant (truncated) protein appeared to result in cytoplasmic protein aggregates. It is likely that these aggregates are a secondary effect related to the hydrophobicity and overexpression of the protein, rather than being the primary effect of the mutation. Protein aggregation and inclusion bodies are frequently associated with neurodegeneration; however, there is no evidence of a gain-of-function associated with the two <italic>METTL23</italic> mutations identified as a pathogenic mechanism in these two families. It is most likely that the neurodevelopmental phenotype in our two families is a result of a deficit in the enzymatic function of the methyltransferase.</p><p>Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to diverse substrates, including nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins and lipids. They have been grouped into superfamilies according to their structural properties. Today, 208 proteins in the human proteome, representing â¼0.9% of human gene products, are already characterized as putative methyltransferases, and â¼30% of these have already been linked to diseases (<xref rid="DDU115C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). By modifying their targets, they essentially influence multiple cellular regulatory mechanisms. Via epigenetic effects, methyltransferases are involved in tissue differentiation and proliferation, and have therefore been associated with a variety of diseases including cancer and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref rid="DDU115C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="DDU115C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Many genes encoding demethylases and methyltransferases have now been implicated in syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of ID. These include histone demethylases, histone methyltransferases, tRNA and rRNA methyltransferases (<xref rid="DDU115C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="DDU115C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Epigenetic events influenced by methylases and demethylases have been shown to have a substantial involvement in development and function of the central nervous system, and mutations in the underlying genes may result in cognitive impairment and intellectual disabilities. In the case of METTL23, it appears likely that abnormal methylation may also result in disrupted neuronal development via other (non-epigenetic) pathways. The METTL group of genes is likely to contain many more ID-related genes yet to be discovered.</p><p>A newly uncovered group of distantly related lysine methyltransferases preferentially interact with molecular chaperones to regulate their activity (<xref rid="DDU115C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our data suggest tight binding of METTL23 to a chaperone protein, GroEL, which is highly homologous to human heat shock protein HSP60 (known to be mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia; MIM 605280). Thus, studies of the interaction of METTL23 with various chaperones may eventually lead to the discovery of the cognate substrate(s) of the enzyme. Currently, we are investigating this putative function of METTL23 and developing heterologous expression systems that will yield soluble protein for further characterization of its enzymatic properties.</p><p>In summary, we present two different families with <italic>METTL23</italic> mutations, one of them located in Europe, i.e. Austria, the other in Pakistan, which extends the geographical distribution and prevalence of <italic>METTL23</italic> as a gene affecting cognitive function. In fact, our study suggests that the prevalence of mutations in this gene in individuals with ID may be relatively high. Our study adds to the known phenotypic consequences of mutations in <italic>METTL23</italic>. In contrast to the study by Reiff and coworkers (<xref rid="DDU115C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), our mutations resulted in a nonsyndromic and mild form of ID. We also describe MRI results, which revealed some minor abnormalities in affected individuals. It remains to be determined whether METTL23 isoform 2, as predicted, has a physiological role. Since the mutation reported in Reiff and coworkers (<xref rid="DDU115C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) only disrupts isoform 1, yet the resulting phenotype is more severe, we conclude that the function of isoform 2 may be restricted.

For transfection, we used 6.5 Âµg of DNA from WT and mutant constructs and added OptiMEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies) and FuGENE (R) HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) to CHO-K cells. The transfection was performed in duplicates, and 26 h later analyzed using inverted fluorescence microscopy (TE2000, Nikon Corporation).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddu115/-/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This research was supported by a grant from the <funding-source id="cs1" rid="cn1">Canadian Institutes of Health Research</funding-source> (<award-id id="cn1" rid="cs1">#MOP-102758</award-id>) and the <funding-source id="cs2" rid="cn2">Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</funding-source>
