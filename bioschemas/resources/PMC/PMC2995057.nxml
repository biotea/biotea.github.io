        <p>CPEB3 is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and represses translation of its target mRNAs in neurons. Here, we have identified a novel function of CPEB3 as to interact with Stat5b and inhibit its transcription activity in the nucleus without disrupting dimerization, DNA binding and nuclear localization of Stat5b. Moreover, CPEB3 is a nucleocytoplasm-shuttling protein with predominant residence in the cytoplasm; whereas activation of NMDA receptors accumulates CPEB3 in the nucleus. Using the knockdown approach, we have found <bold>the receptor</bold> tyrosine kinase<bold>, EGFR, is a target gene transcriptionally activated by Stat5b and downregulated by CPEB3 in neurons.</bold> The increased EGFR expression in CPEB3 knockdown neurons, when stimulated with EGF, alters the kinetics of downstream signaling. <bold>Taken together, CPEB3 has a novel function in the nucleus as to suppress Stat5b-dependent EGFR gene transcription. Consequently, EGFR signaling is negatively regulated by CPEB3 in neurons.</bold></p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Long-term memory requires synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) to strengthen synaptic efficacy and consequently consolidate memory. RNA-binding proteins play indispensable roles to control spatial-temporal PRP production by regulating transport, localization, translation and/or degradation of PRP RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1â4</xref>). <underline>C</underline>ytoplasmic <underline>p</underline>olyadenylation <underline>e</underline>lement <underline>b</underline>inding protein (CPEB)-like proteins, CPEB2, CPEB3 and CPEB4, in vertebrates likely influence PRP synthesis for the following reasons. CPEB3 and CPEB4 are expressed predominantly in neurons and CPEB3-repressed translation of a reporter RNA is abrogated by the activation of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). CPEB3 and CPEB4 mRNAs are elevated in the hippocampus after kainate-induced seizure, indicating they are immediate early gene products upon synaptic activation and likely modulate neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Importantly, Orb2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is required for long-term conditioning of male courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), implicating that its mammalian homologs, CPEBs2â4, may also have roles in memory. A recent study has shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CPEB3 gene is associated with human episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>CPEBs2â4 were first identified based on sequence similarity with CPEB (or CPEB1) in the carboxyl terminal RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, CPEBs2â4 could interact with RNA sequences identified from a SELEX (<underline>s</underline>ystematic <underline>e</underline>volution of <underline>l</underline>igands by <underline>ex</underline>ponential enrichment) screen that are different from the conventional CPEB1-binding site (UUUUA<sub>1-2</sub>U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Despite CPEB1-controlled translation is characterized at the molecular details and plays important roles in development, cell cycle, neuronal plasticity and cellular senesce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), much less is known about the functional entities of CPEBs2â4 once they bind to RNAs. A previous study has shown that CPEB3 repressed translation of a reporter RNA and Glu2 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, a prion-like property has been observed in Orb2 as well as <italic>Aplysia</italic> CPEB in yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and a recent study has shown that multimeric state of CPEB is required for maintaining long-term facilitation in <italic>Aplysia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Nonetheless, whether any mammalian CPEB possesses prion-like change to modulate its target RNA translation is still in question. To understand how CPEB3 regulates translation, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify its binding partners. Unexpectedly, the screen identified a transcription factor, signal transducer activated transcription (Stat) 5b, interacted with CPEB3. Stat5b is one of the seven Stat family members of which transcriptional activity are modulated by Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs), that are activated by cytokines and hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Translocation of dimerized Stat to the nucleus activates target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Using promoter assays, CPEB3 inhibits Stat5b-dependent transcription without affecting DNA binding, nuclear translocation and dimerization of Stat5b. Moreover, CPEB3 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and activation of NMDARs increases nuclear level of CPEB3, suggesting that neuronal activity regulates CPEB3â²s roles in transcription and translation.</p><p>One target gene transcriptionally regulated by Stat5b and CPEB3 interaction identified from this study is the receptor tyrosine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Upon ligand binding, the receptors become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within their cytoplasmic kinase domain and activated which then initiate several downstream signaling pathways, such as JAK-Stat, mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt. The elevated EGFR level in CPEB3 knockdown neurons, when stimulated with EGF, results in extended and amplified downstream signaling measured by phosphorylation of Stat5b and Akt. Although EGFR has been studied extensively in cell proliferation (including neurogenesis), anti-apoptosis and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16â18</xref>), its function in post-mitotic neurons is less characterized. In the EGFR null mice, abnormal astrocyte development and neuronal death impede the study of EGFR function in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), but it has been demonstrated that EGF enhances long-term potentiation in the hippocampal slices and dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats after tetanic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), suggesting its corresponding receptor, EGFR, may function as a neuronal modulator. Using pharmacological approach, activation or deprivation of EGFRâs kinase activity by infusing EGF or gefitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), respectively, in the brain, affects spatial learning and memory performance in mice. Together, this study first identifies a novel transcriptional function for the CPEB family members besides their characterized roles in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). By interacting with Stat5b, CPEB3 downregulates the expression of EGFR of which kinase activity modulates learning and memory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies used for the study are, Akt (cat #4691), pT308-Akt (cat #2965), pY1068-EGFR (cat #2236S) and pY699-Stat5 (cat #9359) from Cell Signaling; EGFR (cat #SC-03) and Stat5b (cat #SC1656) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; synaptophysin (cat #MAB5258) and MAP2 (cat #MAB378) from Chemicon and flag epitope (cat #F1804) from Sigma-Aldrich.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screen</title><p>Matchmaker Two-Hybrid Library Construction and Screening Kit (Clontech) was used to construct a random-primed adult mouse brain cDNA library.

Further analysis showed that the amino acids 639â700 between Src-homology (SH2) and transactivation domain (TAD) of Stat5b were crucial for its association with the N-terminus of CPEB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

When myc-tagged full length (myc-CPEB3) and C-terminal RNA-binding domain (myc-CPEB3C) of CPEB3 along with flag-tagged Stat5b were expressed in 293T cells, myc-CPEB3 but not myc-CPEB3C was co-precipitated with flag-Stat5b in the presence of RNase A treatment, indicating this interaction is mediated through the CPEB3âN-terminus in an RNA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Furthermore, using cortical neuronal lysate to perform reciprocal immunoprecipitation, endogenous CPEB3 was pulled down in the Stat5b immunoprecipitate and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

The transcriptional activity of Stat5b is enhanced when the denoted tyrosine 699 (Y699) is phosphorylated upon growth hormone stimulation. When asparagine 642 mutated to histidine (N642H), it improves Stat5bâs activity by hindering dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Y699.

The nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of SV40 large T antigen, PKKKRKVG, was appended to the C-terminus of CPEB3 to facilitate its nuclear localization since CPEB family proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, immunostained pictures). The wild-type (WT) and constitutively active (CA) forms of Stat5b, carrying the N642H mutation that hindered dephosphorylation of Y699 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), were employed for the assay. The <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase plasmid was included to normalize variation in transfection efficiencies. The ratio of normalized luciferase activity (i.e. firefly/<italic>Renilla</italic>) obtained in the presence of CA versus WT Stat5b was considered as fold of transcriptional activation caused by phosphorylated Y699 (p-Y699) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This approach mimics cytokine-induced Stat5b phosphorylation-activated transcription while avoids simultaneously activating other signaling molecules to compromise the promoter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In the presence of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, a control), a 3-fold transactivation was observed in the wild-type but not the mutant promoter. Such activation was decreased to 2.2-fold with myc-CPEB3 and further reduced to 1.5-fold with nucleus-localized form of CPEB3 (myc-CPEB3NLS). In contrast, myc-CPEB3C, which was predominantly nuclear, did not affect Stat5b-induced transcription since it did not bind Stat5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Because Stat5bWT and Stat5bCA interact similarly with myc-CPEB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), the N642H replacement and Y699 phosphorylation have no effect on Stat5bâs association with CPEB3.

Moreover, growth factor-induced Y699 phosphorylation does not change Stat5bâs self-dimerization and association with CPEB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Because p-Y699 is evidently detected in Stat5bCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), Stat5b is constantly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in 293T cells even without growth factor stimulation. To test whether CPEB3 could inhibit the transcription mediated by non-phosphorylated Stat5b, the Y699F mutant was used. The nuclear form of CPEB3 further diminished Stat5b-mediated transcription regardless of the phosphorylation status of Y699 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). To confirm that CPEB3-mediated suppression does not require interference with Stat5bâs DNA binding, Stat5b and a control, FoxP2, were fused to Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD) that bound to the Gal4-binding promoter sequences. In the presence of myc-CPEB3, myc-CPEB3NLS or myc-CPEB3C expression, the transactivation ability of Gal4DBD-Stat5b but not that of the controls was perceptibly inhibited by nucleus-localized CPEB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Because CPEB3-NLS represses Stat5bâs activity greater than CPEB3, it is unlikely such inhibition is caused by sequestering Stat5b in the cytoplasm. Thus, CPEB3 suppresses Stat5b-dependent transcription without disrupting DNA binding, dimerization and nuclear localization of Stat5b and such a negative regulation is not dependent on Y699 phosphorylation of Stat5b.

Hippocampal neurons of day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 12 were stimulated with various glutamate receptor agonists, Î±-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA), NMDA and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), for 30âmin and immunostained with affinity-purified CPEB3 antibody. Five hundred neurons were scored with the staining signal greater in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus categorized as cytoplasm-localized; while the rest was considered as nucleus-localized. The majority of unstimulated neurons showed a stronger CPEB3 signal in the cytoplasm with &lt;10% of cells displaying nuclear distribution. AMPA and NMDA induced &gt;60% of cells exhibited stronger or similar CPEB3 signals in the nucleus (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and quantified results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). To confirm the above observation was not caused by antibodyâs cross-reactivity or changes in nuclear permeability, neurons expressing myc-CPEB3 and a control flag-FKBP8 were stimulated. Both AMPA and NMDA stimulations shifted the distribution of myc-CPEB3 but not flag-FKBP8 from cytoplasmic to nuclear dominance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2A</ext-link>). KCl depolarization which triggered presynaptic release of glutamate and subsequently activated postsynaptic glutamate receptors, also resulted in nuclear CPEB3 accumulation in a NMDAR-dependent manner since the addition of NMDAR blocker, (2<italic>R</italic>)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), but not the AMPAR antagonist, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzoquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (NBQX), was sufficient to prevent this event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, the AMPA effect on CPEB3 distribution was mediated through NMDAR signaling because it was blocked not only by NBQX but also by APV. Therefore, it appears that AMPAR activation, similar to KCl treatment, results in depolarization of neurons that potentiates synaptic release of glutamate and expels Mg<sup>2+</sup> clogs from NMDARs, hence facilitates NMDAR activation. A translation inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX), did not affect KCl-induced CPEB3 redistribution, so the nuclear accumulated CPEB3 is not newly synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Despite the NLS and nuclear export sequence (NES) in CPEB3 have not been identified, nuclear export was mediated by chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) since blocking CRM1 by leptomycin B (LMB) induced nuclear accumulation of CPEB3. Moreover, application of LMB in COS cells expressing GFP-tagged CPEB3 also caused GFP-CPEB3 retained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), suggesting CPEB3 constantly shuttles between nucleo-cytoplasmic compartments and activation of NMDARs modulates its distribution equilibrium. In contrast, Stat5b was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm and the stimulation with AMPA, NMDA and DHPG did not change its distribution (data not shown). Although NMDAR signaling increased nuclear CPEB3, it did not affect Stat5b distribution (see immunostaining in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2B</ext-link> and biochemical fractionation in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>), indicating the two factors were unlikely co-transported in response to neuronal activity. Moreover, the co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that CPEB3 and Stat5b remained associated in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts isolated from neurons treated with NMDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>).

Hippocampal neurons of DIV6 were infected overnight with lentivirus containing or lacking a short hairpin sequence for rat CPEB3 or Stat5b. The infected neurons were harvested on DIV11 for RNA and protein analysis. The RNA levels of EGFR, CPEB3 and Stat5b were measured by quantitative PCR following reverse transcription (RTâQPCR). If EGFR transcription is activated by Stat5b whose transactivation ability is offset by CPEB3, a decrease and an increase in EGFR RNA level is expected, respectively, in Stat5bKD and CPEB3KD neurons as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A. These changes are results of transcription since EGFR RNA stability is similar in the control and knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, normalized curves). To ascertain that Stat5b binds to the EGFR promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Stat5b-binding sites in the proximal 3âkb EGFR promoter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>) were predicted by MATCH analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Formaldehyde-fixed cortical neurons were lysed and precipitated with Stat5b antibody. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, an extra immunostained band of higher molecular weight likely represents crosslinked dimeric Stat5b as it was not observed when using unfixed neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The promoter regions spanning the predicted Stat5b-binding sites at â2694, â2234, â2035 and â1804 were preferentially PCR-amplified from the Stat5b IgG-precipitated substance. In contrast, the areas around â1437, â1250, â1102, â470, â467, â181 as well as a control region spanning intron 24 and exon 25 of EGFR gene were not. The same Stat5b-binding regions in the EGFR promoter were also identified in another ChIP assay (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). Finally, the EGFR protein level was examined using CPEB2, CPEB3, CPEB4 and Stat5b knockdown neurons. As expected, a reduction in CPEB3 leads to an increase in EGFR synthesis whereas a deficiency in Stat5b results in a decrease in EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). The elevated EGFR expression in CPEB3 KD neurons could be rescued with the expression of full length human CPEB3 (hCPEB3), to a lesser extent with the N-terminus but not the C-terminus of hCPEB3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>). Intriguingly, the knockdowns of CPEB2 and CPEB4 have no obvious effect on EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Since the nuclear history of mRNA could influence its expression pattern later in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), we determined if CPEB2 and CPEB4 did not regulate EGFR synthesis because of lacking interaction with Stat5b. In 293T cells that expressing flag-Stat5b along with various myc-tagged CPEBs, only myc-CPEB3 was co-immunoprecipitated with flag-Stat5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). The inability of CPEB2 and CPEB4 to bind Statb5b is not due to their failure to translocate to the nucleus, as when CRM1-mediated export was blocked, GFP-CPEB2 and GFP-CPEB4 were accumulated in the nucleus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7</ext-link>).

To assess whether EGFR is a PRP that functions in learning and memory, pharmacological treatment of mice with EGF ligand and the inhibitor gefitinib was used. EGF-induced EGFR activation in the cultured neurons was effectively suppressed by gefitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A).

No difference in swimming speed of all drug-treated animals was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Animals infused with EGF trended towards enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and latency of locating the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).

All CPEBs, originally thought to be localized in the cytoplasm, are now proteins shuttling between nucleocytoplasmic compartments. Two recent studies have shown that CPEB1 shuttles to the nucleus where it possibly plays a role in ribosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). One nuclear function of CPEB3 is to downregulate Stat5bâs transcriptional activity; whereas the roles of nuclear CPEB2 and CPEB4 remain to be determined. Interestingly, NMDAR signaling reorganizes CPEB3 distribution from cytoplasmic to nuclear prevalence, suggesting neuronal activity could regulate and partition CPEB3â²s functions between the two compartments to control gene expression. One target gene transcriptionally regulated by CPEB3 is EGFR of which function in modulating learning and memory has been pharmacologically demonstrated in the present study.</p><p>The classical cytokine-Stat-signaling draws a paradigm in which cytokine-induced phosphorylation on a critical tyrosine residue of cytoplasmic Stats is the prerequisite to initiate dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation of Stats. Thus, this phosphorylation is essential to transduce the extracellular signal to the nucleus and to activate Stat-dependent gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, the finding that non-phosphorylated Stat1 (Y701F mutant) could bind to and activate the low molecular weight polypeptide-2 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and accumulating evidences have subsequently demonstrated this phosphorylation event is not necessarily required for Statâs dimer formation, constitutive transit in and out of nucleus and transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) that are in accordance with our findings in this study. Silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), which binds to the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of STAT5 and suppresses the induction of STAT5 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) is the only identified transcriptional co-repressor of Stat5. Here, we have uncovered CPEB3 as another negative regulator for Stat5b without affecting Stat5bâs dimerization, nuclear localization and DNA binding. The activation domains of transcription factors are known to activate gene transcription via association with a diverse array of coactivators, some of which promote chromatin remodeling, whereas others, such as TFIID and mediator complexes, direct activator recruitment to the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43â45</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the binding of CPEB3 to a region next to the Stat5bâs activation domain likely interferes the association of Stat5b with other coactivators to repress Stat5b-activated transcription. Thus, identification of which coactivator complexes are involved in integrating Stat5b signal and convey it to activate the basal transcription apparatus needs to be first investigated prior to testing our hypothesis.</p><p>Although several RNA-binding proteins, such as Pbx-regulating protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and FUSE-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), are also able to bind DNAs and function as transcription factors, to our knowledge, nothing is known for a translational repressor in complex with a transcription factor to regulate gene expression. A recent study has identified ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a KH domain RNA-binding protein, was in complex with NF-ÎºB and enhanced NF-ÎºB-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Although RPS3 is a subunit of 40S ribosome and has a role in general translation, no specific mRNA has been identified to associate with RPS3. Despite CPEB2 and CPEB4 share identical RNA-binding specificity with CPEB3 and constantly shuttle between nucleocytoplasmic compartments, they have no obvious influence on the level of EGFR once knocked down in neurons. Since CPEB2 and CPEB4 do not associate with Stat5b, it appears that the interaction between a translation regulator and a transcription factor may help CPEB3 has regulatory roles in a spectrum of genes different from CPEB2 and CPEB4. The nuclear import of Stat5b is not influenced by CPEB3 and NMDA. Because the fact that Stat5b activates transcription of EGFR gene and CPEB3 offsets its activity, it seems illogical for CPEB3 and Stat5b to import simultaneously to the nucleus. Moreover, CPEB3 and Stat5b interaction is not disrupted by NMDA treatment and a nuclear form of CPEB3, CPEB3NLS, has stronger suppression effect on Stat5b-dependent transcription than CPEB3 in the promoter assays, so it is expected that NMDA-induced nuclear accumulation of the repressor CPEB3 is likely to further downregulate Stat5b-dependent EGFR gene transcription in neurons. Nonetheless, due to the long half-life of EGFR mRNA (&gt;4âh, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B) and prolonged NMDAR activation-induced neuronal toxicity, we can not directly demonstrate that EGFR transcription is downregulated by NMDA stimulation in a CPEB3-dependent manner. It remains to be identified the specific importins and non-canonical nuclear localization sequences in CPEB3 responsible for its import to further address the physiological significance of NMDA-induced nuclear accumulation of CPEB3.</p><p>Because pharmacological intervention of the kinase activity of EGFR in the brain affects spatial memory, EGFR is a PRP that modulates learning and memory. Hence, there should be caution regarding potential cognitive side-effects when using EGFR-targeted drugs to treat brain tumors. Since EGFR signaling leads to parallel activation of several processes, such as MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways that have been demonstrated to play important roles in plasticity and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52 B53">50â53</xref>), even a subtle change in EGFR expression likely has significant impact on plasticity. In CPEB3-deficient neurons, the EGFR level is elevated. Interestingly, EGFR expression was found upregulated in forebrain regions of schizophrenics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) and EGF administration in neonatal rats induced various behavioral hallmarks of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Generation of conditional CPEB3 knockout mice is in process to address whether aberrant EGFR expression will cause abnormal signaling and aberrant behaviors in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq634/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Science Council and National Health Research Institute in Taiwan</funding-source>; National Research Program for Genomic Medicine Grants for the RNAi Core.
