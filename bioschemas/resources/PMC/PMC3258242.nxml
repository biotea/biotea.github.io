          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We found that several major cell cycle regulatory genes were differentially expressed upon STOX1A stimulation and knockdown in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. This includes STOX1A dependent differential regulation of cyclin B1 expression, a cyclin which is known to regulate mitotic entry during the cell cycle. The differential regulation of cyclin B1 expression by STOX1A is direct as shown with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Results furthermore suggest that mitotic entry is enhanced through the direct upregulation of cyclin B1 expression effectuated by STOX1A.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mammalian cell division is controlled by the expression of cyclins and activation of their associated cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). While the CDK components are generally expressed ubiquitously during the cell cycle, expression of cyclins accumulate periodically during distinct phases (G1, S, G2 and M phase) of the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0029769-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In each phase, binding of cyclins with their corresponding CDK forms an active cyclin/CDK complex. In general, G1 to S phase progression is controlled by CDK2 bound to S-phase cyclins <xref rid="pone.0029769-Woo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> (E- and A-type) whereas G2 to M phase is triggered by CDK1 associated with mitotic cyclins <xref rid="pone.0029769-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (A- and B-type). Active cyclin/cdk complexes can phosphorylate several substrates, which subsequently trigger cell cycle progression <xref rid="pone.0029769-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0029769-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Many of these cyclin/cdk complex substrates and regulators of the cell cycle machinery itself have been characterized in detail, and recently it was shown to include a group of proteins belonging to the forkhead transcription factors. These transcription factors are characterized by a 100 amino acid DNA-binding motif termed the winged helix domain <xref rid="pone.0029769-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Several studies have confirmed the role of forkhead transcription factors in regulating the transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes during the cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0029769-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Additionally, it has been shown that multiple members of the forkhead transcription factors are regulated by components of the cell cycle itself. These include FOXM1 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, FOXO1 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and FOXK2 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, Storkhead box 1A (STOX1A), a transcription factor structurally and functionally related to the forkhead family of transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0029769-vanDijk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029769-vanDijk2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, has been shown to be expressed abundantly in the brain and found to be upregulated in advanced stages of Late Onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD, Braak 3â6). Secondly, STOX1A was found to be expressed at the centrosomes of dividing cells <xref rid="pone.0029769-Loffler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Centrosomes serve as reaction centres for several key regulators of the cell cycle machinery <xref rid="pone.0029769-Doxsey1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029769-vanDijk3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, where in particular G2 to M-phase transition is triggered by cyclin B1-CDK1 <xref rid="pone.0029769-DeSouza1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029769-Jackman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Together with the increasing evidence that neurons, generally in a non-dividing state called G0, re-express a multitude of cell-cycle regulators in Alzheimer's disease (AD) <xref rid="pone.0029769-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0029769-Moh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, let us to explore the involvement of STOX1A in cell cycle related events. Here we show that in the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line STOX1A directly regulates the expression of the mitotic cyclin B1. Hereby we show that STOX1A, in addition to other members of the forkhead transcription factors, is directly involved in regulating the cell cycle. Upregulated expression of STOX1A in LOAD therefore potentially influences neuronal cell cycle re-entry.</p>

        <title>Expression analysis of SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with STOX1A during distinct phases of the cell cycle</title>
        <p>To identify the expression pattern of STOX1A in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells we performed immunofluorescence using an antibody against the Halotag attached to the STOX1A recombinant protein. During interphase we observed primarily nuclear and to a lesser extend cytoplasmic STOX1A staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) which confirms the model of STOX1A nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling as previously described by our lab <xref rid="pone.0029769-vanDijk2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Nuclear localization represents the active form of STOX1A.</p>

        <p>To investigate the expression pattern of STOX1A during mitosis, cells were arrested at the G2/M-phase boundary. As also observed for the forkhead transcription factor FOXK2 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, STOX1A shows a non-overlapping immunofluorescence pattern with DNA (STOX1A-halotag/DAPI merge) shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown in prometaphase. The non-overlapping immunofluorescence pattern is best seen during metaphase and anaphase until cytokinesis occurs when STOX1A immunofluorescence overlaps with DNA (DAPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). As shown previously by us <xref rid="pone.0029769-vanDijk3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, STOX1A is concentrated at the centrosomes during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, white arrows).</p>

        <title>STOX1A regulates cell proliferation in SH-SY5Y cells</title>
        <p>As the results above indicate that STOX1A is involved in mitosis, the effect of STOX1A on cell proliferation was tested by using STOX1A siRNA knockdown in comparison to scrambled siRNAs in the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Knockdown of STOX1A resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation compared to the scrambled siRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In parallel, at each time point, the amount of death cells were counted. However we did not found significant differences in cell death between STOX1A siRNA or scrambled siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, left graph). In concordance with the reduction in cell proliferation upon STOX1A siRNA transfection, cells that were stably transfected with STOX1A showed a significant increase in cell proliferation compared to empty vector (MOCK) transfected SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In parallel, at each time point, the amount of death cells were counted. No significant differences in cell death between STOX1A and MOCK transfected cells were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, left graph). Knockdown and stable overexpression of STOX1A in the SH-SY5Y cell-line was confirmed at the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Reduced cell proliferation by STOX1A siRNA knockdown and increased cell proliferation by STOX1A overexpression suggest STOX1A dependent cell cycle regulation. To test this we measured mRNA levels of four major mammalian cell cycle regulatory genes; cyclin A2 (CCNA2, involved in the S to G2 phase and G2 to M phase progression <xref rid="pone.0029769-Pagano1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>), cyclin B1 (CCNB1, involved in G2 to M phase progression <xref rid="pone.0029769-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>), cyclin C (CCNC, involved in G0 to G1 phase progression <xref rid="pone.0029769-Sage1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>) and cyclin E1 (CCNE1, involved in G1 to S phase progression <xref rid="pone.0029769-Ohtsubo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>). In stably STOX1A transfected cells we found that CCNA2 and CCNB1 mRNA levels were significantly increased. CCNC mRNA levels were significantly downregulated but no significant differences in mRNA levels were seen for CCNE1 compared to stably MOCK transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). STOX1A siRNA knockdown resulted in significantly decreased mRNA levels of CCNA2, CCNB1 and CCNE1 and significantly upregulated CCNC mRNA levels compared to scrambled controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Since CCNB1 is the cyclin involved in mitosis, CCNB1 reduction upon STOX1A knockdown was also confirmed on westernblot. The CCNB1 associated kinase CDK1 showed reduced activity upon reduced CCNB1 protein levels as measured on westernblot using an antibody specifically recognizing the active form of CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In contrast, comparable protein levels of total CDK1 were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0029769-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we show, in addition to other members of the forkhead transcription factors, that STOX1A is directly involved in controlling the cell cycle via CCNB1. CCNB1 expression is directly regulated via STOX1A by binding to a region previously characterized as the 5â² upstream regulatory region of the CCNB1 gene <xref rid="pone.0029769-Pines2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029769-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. While CCNB1 is known to be a key regulator for mitotic entry <xref rid="pone.0029769-Bassermann1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the direct up-regulation of CCNB1 by STOX1A let us to speculate if this would have an effect on this phase of the cell cycle. Indeed, in stably STOX1A transfected SH-SY5Y cells that were released from an S-phase block an earlier appearance of the specific mitosis marker PhosH3 (ser10) in parallel with higher CCNB1 protein levels was found. These results show that STOX1A transfected cells progress more rapidly into mitosis compared to control transfected cells. The finding that knockdown of STOX1A causes a decrease in CCNB1 protein levels and that the activity of CDK1 is also dramatically reduced elucidates a role for STOX1A in mitotic entry.</p>
      <p>Enrichment of the 5â² upstream regulatory region of the CCNB1 gene in STOX1A transfected SH-SY5Y cells growing asynchronously was significantly higher than in cells synchronized at the G2/M-phase boundary. This implies that during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle the transcriptional potential of STOX1A is temporarily lost. We therefore speculate that STOX1A is necessary for the entry of mitosis but transcriptional activity is transiently lost during mitosis. This is likely happening in metaphase and anaphase. During these phases STOX1A is not bound to DNA. This has also been shown for the forkhead transcription factor FOXK2 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and is in general also found for most other transcription factors which temporarily lose their transcriptional potential during mitosis. This is in contrast to FoxI1 which continually remains associated with DNA during mitosis <xref rid="pone.0029769-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The translocation of STOX1A away from DNA in these specific phases during mitosis, thereby losing the potential to activate or repress target gene transcription, is possibly necessary for proper mitotic progression or exit.</p>
      <p>CCNB1 concentrates at the centrosomes in metaphase during mitosis <xref rid="pone.0029769-Jackman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. While centrosomes serve as reaction centres for several key regulators of the cell cycle machinery <xref rid="pone.0029769-Doxsey1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0029769-vanDijk3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and several forkhead transcription factors have been shown to physically interact with the cyclin B1 protein <xref rid="pone.0029769-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, we hypothesize that STOX1A also interacts with the cyclin B1 protein. Indeed, preliminary data using co-immunoprecipitation suggest this interaction (data not shown). This interaction further suggests that CDK1, the active binding partner of CCNB1, is potentially capable of regulating the transcriptional activity of STOX1A by phosphorylation. Previously, CDK1 has been shown to phosphorylate FOXM1 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, FOXO1 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and FOXK2 <xref rid="pone.0029769-Marais1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> thereby influencing their activity.</p>
      <p>While we studied the effect of STOX1A on CCNB1 in detail, it is likely that other cell cycle associated proteins are also directly or indirectly differentially affected by STOX1A. Significant changes of CCNA2 and CCNC1 mRNA levels upon STOX1A overexpression and knockdown, and significant downregulation of CCNE1 upon STOX1A knockdown suggest that STOX1A is also involved in regulating other checkpoints of the cell cycle.</p>
      <p>As STOX1A is highly expressed in the brain and upregulated in LOAD makes exploration of STOX1A expression in neuronal cells in combination with cell cycle events very interesting; STOX1A might have a role in cell cycle re-entry as observed in AD.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we show for the first time that STOX1A is involved in regulating cell cycle events by binding to CCNB1 thereby regulating mitotic entry.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
        <p>SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Canada). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Cells were subcultured in medium every 2â3 days following harvesting by trypsinization (HBSS containing 5% trypsin). The ORF (Open Reading Frame) of the STOX1A gene was subcloned into the pF5K-neomycin CMV Flexi vectors according to the manufacturers protocol (Promega) and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells. For transfection the calcium phosphate method was used <xref rid="pone.0029769-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Briefly, at the time of transfection, cells were at 70% confluence. By vortexing 2Ã HEBS (HEPES-buffered saline) with a solution of 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 Âµg of plasmid DNA a co-precipitate of DNA and CaPO<sub>4</sub> was allowed to form. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the precipitate was added to the cells and the medium was changed after 24 h. For stable transfections SH-SY5Y cells were transfected either with the pF5K-STOX1A or empty pF5K constructs. Selection of positive clones was possible due to the presence of the neomycin resistant gene present in the constructs. Positive clones were maintained in complete IMDB medium supplemented with 800 Âµg/ml G418 (Roche) until reaching confluence and subcultured every 2â3 days for about 4 weeks. A population of positive clones was harvested for further analysis. As confirmed with qRT-PCR (See below) using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) for STOX1A, 3 stable SH-SY5Y cell-lines with an at least 10 fold STOX1A over-expression compared to mock transfected cells were selected. Additionally, plasmid DNA quantification using qPCR (see below) with primers and probe specific for the constructs backbone showed similar copy numbers between STOX1A and MOCK transfected cells.</p>
        <p>Knockdown of STOX1A was performed by transfecting 4 siRNA's against STOX1A and control siRNA (Qiagen) in SH-SY5Y cells with Lipofectamineâ¢ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufactures protocol. Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and RNA was isolated as described in the Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR section.</p>
