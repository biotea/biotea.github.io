        <p id="P1">Genes associated with human microcephaly, a condition characterized by a small brain, include critical regulators of proliferation, cell fate, and DNA repair. We describe a syndrome of congenital microcephaly and diverse defects in cerebral cortical architecture. Genome-wide linkage analysis in two families identified a 7.5 Mb locus on chromosome 19q13.12 containing 148 genes. Targeted high throughput sequence analysis of linked genes in each family yielded &gt; 4000 DNA variants and implicated a single gene, <italic>WDR62</italic>, as harboring potentially deleterious changes. We subsequently identified additional <italic>WDR62</italic> mutations in four other families. MRI and postmortem brain analysis supports important roles for <italic>WDR62</italic> in proliferation and migration of neuronal precursors. WDR62 is a WD40 repeat-containing protein expressed in neuronal precursors as well as postmitotic neurons in the developing brain and localizes to the spindle poles of dividing cells. The diverse phenotypes of WDR62 suggest central roles in many aspects of cerebral cortical development.</p>

    <p id="P2">A first pedigree (LIS-900) with <underline>m</underline>icro<underline>c</underline>ephaly with <underline>s</underline>implified <underline>g</underline>yri (MCSG) from Mexico consists of distantly related parents with three affected children and one healthy sibling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The children showed severe microcephaly, developmental delay, and seizures (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note, Clinical Data</xref>) but no other syndromic features. A second family (LIS-2600) from Turkey showed similar clinical features and has been described before<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Subsequent to the identification of the responsible gene, four other families were identified with similar clinical features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1câf</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note, Clinical Data</xref>). Brain MRI of the six families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1gâp</xref>), revealed small brains, markedly simplified gyral patterns, corpus callosal abnormalities, plus a diversity of additional cortical malformations including polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and subcortical heterotopia (arrested neurons), sometimes with asymmetry in the same brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note, Clinical Data and Supplementary Movie 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">Genome-wide linkage screens of LIS-900 showed a single 11.9 Mb region on chromosome 19q13 (D19S431; D19S217) homozygous in all 3 affected patients and not homozygous in the normal sibling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). SNP genotyping of LIS-2600 confirmed the homozygosity and narrowed the interval to â 7.5 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) (peak combined multipoint LOD score of 3.84, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). SNP analysis of MC-1400 and MC-1600 confirmed the candidate region but did not reduce it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">Because of the high gene density of the linked region, we employed an array capture approach<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> followed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing in two affected individuals, LIS-903 and LIS-2602. A custom array was designed with oligonucleotide probes targeting the exons of all 148 predicted UCSC genes in the interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) plus non-exonic DNA from a smaller candidate subregion suggested by microsatellite mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). DNA bound to the array was amplified and used to generate sequencing libraries. 36â40 million paired-end sequence tags (&gt;1.4 Gb of raw sequence) were generated per patient and mapped (hg18) using BWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>)<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. 50â60% of sequence reads were on-target, and average depth of target coverage was 230X and 224X, with 88% and 90% of bases covered by â¥ 10 reads.</p>
    <p id="P5">Single nucleotide variants and microinsertions/microdeletions were called and filtered for quality and mapping confidence<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, revealing &gt;2000 potential sequence variants from each proband (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of SNP calls with Affy 5.0 genotype data showed &gt;99.8% concordance. Variants were filtered out if they were present in dbSNP130<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or the 1000 genomes project (1000G), and categorized by their predicted functional effects using GMCC. Of 2310 variants in LIS-903, 262 (11%) were not in dbSNP130 or 1000G, 93 were potentially pathogenic (4.0%); five met both criteria. Of 2570 variants in LIS-2602, 323 (12%) were absent from dbSNP and 1000G, and 99 (3.8%) were potentially pathogenic; seven variants met both criteria. A single gene, <italic>WDR62</italic>, showed novel, pathogenic mutations in both families, making it a strong candidate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Sanger sequencing confirmed <italic>WDR62</italic> mutations in the two families, and identified four additional alleles in four other families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). A homozygous single basepair insertion in exon 30 (c.3936_3937insC) in LIS-2602 produced a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). All three affected patients in family LIS-900 showed a homozygous single basepair deletion in exon 4 (c.363delT), creating a frameshift mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Pedigree analysis confirmed appropriate segregation of <italic>WDR62</italic> mutations in both families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In LIS-2500, the affected individual showed a homozygous mutation one basepair downstream of exon 8 (c.1043+1G&gt;A), disrupting the highly conserved GT consensus splicing sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In MC-1400, the affected child was homozygous for a 4 bp deletion after exon 23 (c.2867+4_c2867+7delGGTG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) that removes the conserved +4 and +5 positions of the intron and is predicted to disrupt the splice donor<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (reference â¦CAG|gtg<underline>ggtg</underline>tcâ¦; mutation â¦CAG|gtg----tcâ¦). In MC-1600, the affected child was homozygous for a deletion of 17 bp in the 30<sup>th</sup> exon (c.3839_3855delGCCAAGAGCCTGCCCTG), causing a frameshift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In PH-16900, all three siblings with microcephaly were homozygous for a missense V65M change (c.193G&gt;A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) that alters a residue conserved in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). An unaffected sibling (PH-16907, with mild speech delay and articulation difficulties but normal head circumference and normal MRI) was homozygous for the wildtype allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Two additional unaffected siblings were homozygous wildtype and heterozygous, respectively (not shown). None of these mutations were found in over 1000 normal chromosomes.</p>
    <p id="P7"><italic>WDR62</italic> encodes a 1518 amino acid protein with multiple WD40 repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, but little is known about its function. A proteomic study identified WDR62 as a binding partner of the centrosomal protein CEP170<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, which is of interest given the involvement of other centrosomal proteins in microcephaly<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Another report identified WDR62 as a binding partner for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), suggesting that it potentiates JNK activity<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization with a probe to mouse <italic>WDR62</italic> showed widespread expression in the developing brain at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), with highest expression in forebrain.

Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous WDR62 in HeLa cells with an anti-WDR62 antibody revealed punctate, perinuclear expression during interphase, suggesting localization to the Golgi apparatus and confirmed by GM130 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). In contrast, in HeLa or HEK cells in M phase, WDR62 is found at the spindle poles as demonstrated by double-labeling with gamma-tubulin and dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>). Close inspection of recombinant HA-tagged WDR62 protein demonstrated subcellular localization closely matching that of CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>) and surrounding LIS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>), a pattern similar to that previously demonstrated for ASPM<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and other microcephaly proteins<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Bilguvar and colleagues<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> recently described mutations in WDR62 with brain malformations and reported nuclear localization of WDR62 in cortical progenitor cells. While we cannot rule out nuclear localization in some cells, our data, as well as previously published data<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> suggest a major centrosomal role.</p>
    <p id="P9">Postmortem analysis of LIS-2601, an affected sibling in the LIS-2600 family<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, suggests roles for WDR62 in neuronal proliferation and migration. The 27-week fetus showed a small cranial cavity enclosing a profoundly small brain (50g, compared to a normal of 127 +/â 20 g for this age and size fetus). The surface of the hemispheres was largely smooth (not shown), with poorly defined Sylvian fissures and few sulci<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The cerebellum appeared remarkably preserved (not shown), whereas the cerebral cortex was severely abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5aâg</xref>). The outermost cortical layer (layer I) appeared generally normal, but remaining cortical neuronal layers were thinner than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b, c</xref>). There was an almost complete lack of small- to medium-sized pyramidal neurons in their normal location (layers II and III), suggesting profoundly defective neurogenesis. Neurons located beneath layer I were primarily medium- to large pyramidal neurons, followed by a cell-sparse zone and a third layer of multipolar neurons at the deepest layer of the cortex, an appearance consistent with layers V and VI, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). Neurons in the medium-to-large pyramidal layer retained an immature radial columnar organization and also exhibited abnormal, non-radial clumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In some sections, the pial surface was interrupted by microscopic extrusions of cells into the subarachnoid space, forming heterotopia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Heterotopia were also sometimes found in the intermediate zone, arranged in streaks particularly in posterior frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>), corresponding to the localization of subcortical heterotopia seen on MRI. There were also clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>) of small round cells in the outer subventricular zone (SVZ) suggestive of progenitor cells. These findings support a proliferative defect in brains of patients with <italic>WDR62</italic> mutations, potentially affecting the outer SVZ (precursors to upper layer cortical neurons)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> as well as defective neuronal migration, in some ways evocative of the dual roles in proliferation and migration seen for <italic>LIS1</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P10">Our results suggest that mutations in <italic>WDR62</italic> cause microcephaly, simplified gyral pattern, callosal abnormalities, and a wide range of additional cortical abnormalities, including polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and subcortical heterotopia. <italic>WDR62</italic> lies within the <italic>MCPH2</italic> locus<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> a gene-rich locus that has resisted gene identification for &gt; 10 years, and appears to be allelic to <italic>MCPH2</italic> (see accompanying paper).

Genome-wide screens for Family LIS-2600 were performed at Childrenâs Hospital Boston using ~400 markers in the ABI linkage mapping set MD v2.5 at ~10 cM average density (Applied Biosystems). In addition, families LIS-900, LIS-2600, LIS-2500, MC-1400 and MC-1600 were genotyped on Affymetrix 5.0 SNP chips at the Broad Institute.</p>

        <title>Microarray sequence capture and sequencing</title>
        <p id="P14">After flanking recombinant markers defined the candidate interval, a tiled microarray (Roche Nimblegen) was designed to target all exons of the 148 genes in the region, as well as most of the nonrepetitive intronic DNA for the 85 genes in the center of the linkage peak. A total of 3.5 Mb of the ~7.5 Mb region was targeted. From each patient, 20ug of genomic DNA was randomly fragmented to 350â400bp, and the ends were repaired and ligated to Nimblegen gSel adaptors. This library was hybridized to the custom array using the manufacturerâs recommended conditions, and nonbound DNA was washed off. Bound DNA was eluted and subjected to PCR amplification. QPCR demonstrated 355X target enrichment for LIS-903 and 1346X for LIS-2601. Nimblegen-captured DNA fragments were then blunted using T4 DNA Polymerase and Klenow fragment using standard conditions, phosphorylated using T4 DNA kinase, and ligated to form concatamers. The concatamers were then randomly fragmented using a Covaris S2 device, and ends were repaired and ligated to Ilumina paired end sequencing adaptors. Ligated products were gel-purified, and PCR-amplified to enrich for adapter-containing fragments. Finally, the purified DNA was subjected to clustering and 40 cycles of paired-end sequencing using the Illumina GA II. Sequencing and subsequent image processing and basecalling were performed per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.</p>

Briefly, BWA version 0.5.7<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> was employed to align short reads to the human genome (reference build hg18).

Candidate mutations were identified by starting with a list of all variants from the targeted homozygous region, removing those present either in dbSNP130 or a pilot 1 release of the 1000G database, and selecting for coding nonsynonymous, frameshift, or splice site changes. Sequence data were visualized using either the UCSC genome browser<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> or the Broad Institute Integrated Genome Viewer.

Common findings include microcephaly (hâk, mâp), anomalies of the corpus callosum (small splenium in h and k, absent splenium in i, thick body in k), simplification of the normal gyral pattern (h, i, k, m, n, p) as well as more variable features such as mild asymmetries of cortical size (p), possible heterotopia and cortical clefts (not shown, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note, Clinical Data</xref>).

(a) Homozygosity analysis in four pedigrees (LIS-900, LIS-2600, MC-1400 and MC-1600) revealed a 7.5 Mb interval on chr19, bounded by SNP markers rs17581484 and rs4802998. Homozygous SNPs are shown in red or blue, heterozygous SNPs are shown in yellow, and SNPs for which no genotype could be assigned are shown in white. The homozygous region contained 148 annotated UCSC genes. (b) Custom Nimblegen microarrays were designed to target all coding and noncoding regions of the 85 genes in the center of the linkage peak and all exonic regions of the remaining 63 genes (upper green track; the location of probes on the array is shown on the lower track). These were used to capture genomic DNA and generate sequencing libraries from two individuals, LIS-903 and LIS-2602. (c) Libraries were sequenced on a Illumina GA II to an average depth of &gt;200X and completeness of 88â90% (bases covered by &gt;= 10 reads).

        <p id="P40">Six <italic>WDR62</italic> mutations reported in association with microcephaly with simplified gyri. (a) Alterations are shown in genomic, coding DNA, and protein contexts. The human <italic>WDR62</italic> gene consists of 32 exons shown as boxes, and encodes a protein of 1518 amino acids containing 15 WD40 repeats. Black shaded boxes represent untranslated regions, open boxes represent coding regions, and gray shaded boxes represent alternatively spliced exons. Lines connecting boxes represent introns. The diagram is drawn to scale. Five of the six alleles (from families LIS-900, LIS-2500, LIS-2600, MC-1400, MC-1600, and LIS-2600) disrupt splice sites or cause frameshifts resulting in protein truncations and are likely nulls. The sixth allele, found in PH-16900, is a missense alteration of V65M, a conserved residue. (b) Illustration of the c.3936_3937insC mutation in LIS-2602 by high throughput sequencing, and representative Sanger traces confirming proper segregation. High throughput sequencing data is shown using the Integrated Genome Viewer. Aligned reads are shown as gray tags shaded by quality score, SNPs are identified by the letter code of the substituted base, and the position of the LIS-2602 single basepair insertion is denoted by the letter I. Representative Sanger traces confirm this change in the affected individual and show that both parents are heterozygous for the insertional event. Similarly, representative Sanger traces illustrate the c.363delT mutation in LIS-903 and the carrier status of both parents.</p>
