        <p id="P2">The mechanistic interconnectivity between circadian regulation and the genotoxic stress response remains poorly understood. Here we show that the expression of <italic>Period 2 (Per2)</italic>, a circadian regulator, is directly regulated by p53 binding to a response element in the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. This <italic>p53</italic> response element is evolutionarily conserved and overlaps with the E-Box element critical for BMAL1/CLOCK binding and its transcriptional activation of <italic>Per2</italic> expression. Our studies reveal that p53 blocks BMAL1/CLOCK binding to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter leading to repression of <italic>Per2</italic> expression. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), p53 expression and its binding to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter are under circadian control. <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the SCN is altered by p53 deficiency or stabilization of p53 by Nutlin-3. Behaviorally, <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice have a shorter period length that lacks stability and they exhibit impaired photo-entrainment to a light pulse under a free-running state. Our studies demonstrate that p53 modulates mouse circadian behavior.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P3">It is recognized that circadian function and the genotoxic stress response are interconnected. This is thought to be an evolutionary adaption of the organism to sunlight irradiation on earth. The transcription factor p53 is known as the âguardian of the genomeâ<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The majority of all human tumors have mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene which encodes the p53 protein<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The roles of stress-induced p53 in cellular responses are well studied. For example, cell cycle arrest and the DNA damage response are among the biological processes that are regulated by stress-induced p53<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Circadian rhythms are the daily oscillations of biological processes driven by endogenous molecular clocks<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The known core clock genes include <italic>Clock, Npas2, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, CK1Îµ, CK1Î´, Rev-ErbÎ±, and RORÎ±</italic>. Typically, the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer binds to the E-box in the promoter region of their target genes, leading to activation of the expression of these genes, including <italic>Per1, Per2, Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>. The protein products of these core clock genes regulate each otherâs expression in feedback loops. Recently, we showed that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein regulates the circadian clock by interacting with PER2 and enhancing BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. PML is essential for formation of PML nuclear bodies (NBâs)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. It is thought that PML-NBs recruit specific proteins and regulate their activity by modulating their post-translational modification. To date, a growing list of PML interacting proteins has been reported<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Among them are both positive and negative regulators involved in the circadian clock mechanism including PER2, BMAL1, SIRT1, CBP, WDR5 and SIN3A<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These findings led us to screen other PML associated proteins for a possible role in modulating BMAL1/CLOCK mediated <italic>Per2</italic> transcription. Among the PML associated proteins examined was p53, which is known to localize with the PML nuclear body. Studies have shown that acetylation and deacetylation of p53 by CBP and SIRT1, respectively, are PML-NB dependent<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P4">Here, we show that p53 modulates the circadian behavior of mice by modulating <italic>Per2</italic> expression, acting as a direct competitor of BMAL1/CLOCK binding to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. This mechanistic interaction may represent a key regulatory link between the p53-mediated cellular stress response and the circadian clock-regulated cellular pathways.</p>

        <title>p53 represses BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription of <italic>Per2</italic></title>
        <p id="P5">A number of PML-associated proteins were screened for their potential ability to modulate BMAL1/CLOCK mediated <italic>Per2</italic> promoter transcription. Expression constructs for p53, WRN, RB, and RARÎ± were individually examined using a <italic>Per2-Luc</italic> reporter assay for their ability to up or down regulate BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription. Among these expression constructs, we observed that the one encoding p53 strongly repressed BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether this apparent repression of <italic>Per2</italic> transcription by p53 was mediated through BMAL1/CLOCK. High levels of p53 can induce apoptosis of tumor cell lines and this could result in an apparent non-specific transcriptional repression<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. To rule out this possibility, we compared wildtype mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with HeLa cells using a Luc-reporter assay driven by either the <italic>Bmal1</italic> or <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. In both wildtype MEF and HeLa cells, the expression of p53 did not repress RORÎ³ mediated transcription of the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter but repressed <italic>Per2</italic> promoter transcription mediated by BMAL1/CLOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P6">The endogenous p53 level is stabilized and enhanced by Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor of MDM2<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. MDM2 is the major negative regulator of p53 and facilitates p53 degradation<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter was repressed in wildtype, but not in p53<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells when treated with Nutlin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Transfection of a p53 expression construct into <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells restored the repression of BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter in the presence of Nutlin-3. Western analysis with anti-p53 and anti-PER2 antibodies showed a time-dependent increase in the levels of endogenous p53, accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in endogenous PER2 in wildtype MEF cells following Nutlin-3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). No decrease in PER2 levels by Nutlin-3 treatment was observed in <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). This inverse relationship between p53 and PER2 levels was further examined in a Nutlin-3 titration experiment. After a 16 h treatment, endogenous p53 levels correlated with increases in Nutlin-3 concentration, and were inversely correlated with PER2 levels in wildtype MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). No change in PER2 levels was observed when <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells were treated with Nutlin-3 at a similar concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). Genotoxic stress such as Î³-irradiation is known to rapidly stabilize p53 protein in some cells, including MEF and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Western analysis of human U2OS cells and wildtype MEF treated with Î³-irradiation displayed a rapid rise in p53 and a reciprocal decline in PER2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This decline in PER2 level was not observed in p53<sup>â/â</sup> MEF cells that were similarly treated with Î³-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i</xref>). Together, these studies show that the cellular level of PER2 is inversely correlated with that of p53.</p>

        <title>The <italic>Per2</italic> promoter contains a conserved <italic>p53</italic> response element</title>
        <p id="P7">The inverse correlation between p53 and PER2 suggests that p53 is repressing BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. To map the putative response element for <italic>p53</italic>, BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription, reporter assays were carried out using serial deletion constructs of the mouse <italic>Per2</italic> promoter at â2811 to â105 bp from the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). The repression by p53 of BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter was intact in all of these deletion constructs suggesting that the putative <italic>p53</italic> response element is within the â105 bp region of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. Using the NBLAST program, comparison of this 105 bp mouse sequence with <italic>Per2</italic> promoter sequences of human, dog and rat from Genebank revealed a highly conserved 48 bp sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Sequence analysis with the TFBIND program revealed a putative <italic>p53</italic> response element. The <italic>p53</italic> response element is a motif of two tandem decamers separated by 0â13 nucleotides. The consensus sequences can be depicted as 5'-RRXCXXGXYX-N(0â13)-XRXCXXGXYY-3', where R= A/G, Y= C/T and X= A/G/C/T <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This putative <italic>p53</italic> response element is upstream to the transcription start site of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter, and its proximal decamer overlaps with the critical E-box sequence for BMAL1/CLOCK binding. Mutation of nucleotides adjacent to the E-box severely dampened BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter. These observations are consistent with previous findings that BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter requires a segment about 20 bases from the transcription start site<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, mutation of nucleotides in the distal decamer of the putative <italic>p53</italic> response element did not significantly affect BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription while the strong repression by p53 was relieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b, 2c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8">To further characterize the region upstream of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter initiation site, sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the mouse <italic>Per2</italic> promoter sequence from +7 to â45 bp were synthesized, annealed and cloned into a luciferase reporter vector to generate â45bp<italic>Per2</italic>-Luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Transcriptional activation by BMAL1/CLOCK and repression by p53 of expression from the â45bp<italic>Per2</italic>-Luc and â105bp<italic>Per2</italic>-Luc reporter constructs were comparable, indicating that the â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA promoter sequence contained both the <italic>p53</italic> response element and the E-box of BMAL1/CLOCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) we observed that recombinant p53 protein binds to â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). The binding of p53 to biotin-labeled â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA was competitively reduced by unlabeled â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA. Some antibodies to p53 are known to induce a super-shift of the p53/DNA complex. We tested two commercial p53 antibodies and they both generated the expected super-shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Further, the super-shift was competitively reduced by unlabeled â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA. However, when the unlabeled â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA contained a mutated sequence in the distal decamer, the super-shift binding was not reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">The <italic>Per2</italic> genomic locus has five described E-box elements (E1-E5), and the one most critical for BMAL1/CLOCK binding is E2 located in the promoter region<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays with anti-p53 antibodies were performed using genomic DNA that had been fragmented to 0.5 Kb on average. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that p53 pull-down of E2 was significantly enhanced in wildtype when cells were treated with Nutlin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). In contrast, p53 pull-down of E5, about 3 Kb away from E2, was not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Next, we determined whether BMAL1/CLOCK binding to the E2 region of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter was disrupted by p53. Transfection of <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF with expression constructs for FLAG-tagged <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic> in the presence or absence of a p53 expression construct was carried out. ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that in the absence of p53, pull down of FLAG-CLOCK by the anti-FLAG antibody was significantly higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">We then investigated whether p53 binding to the E2 region of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter also occurs in the SCN <italic>in vivo</italic>. SCN from wildtype mouse brains were dissected at six zeitgeber time (ZT) points over 24 h for ChIP analysis. ChIP-qPCR with anti-p53 antibodies showed a peak level of endogenous p53 binding to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter in the SCN between ZT4-ZT8 and a nadir at ZT16-ZT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). These studies demonstrate that p53 is expressed in the SCN and its interaction with the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter is under temporal control <italic>in vivo</italic>. Next, the level of p53 or BMAL1/CLOCK binding to the E2 region of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter was examined using wild type and <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mouse thymus obtained at ZT8 and ZT20. Thymus was chosen since it expresses detectable levels of p53 under normal physiological conditions. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that p53 binding to the E2 region was about 2.5X higher at ZT8 than ZT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2i</xref>). BMAL1 binding to the E2 region in <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF was significantly elevated compared with wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2j</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">To investigate whether p53 directly competes with BMAL1/CLOCK for binding to â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA, nuclear extracts from WT, <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF and <italic>Bmal1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> fibroblasts were prepared for EMSA. Unlike nuclear extracts from WT and <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF, those from <italic>Bmal1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> fibroblasts did not display a prominent protein/DNA complex on EMSA with â45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA indicating that this complex is BMAL1 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2k</xref>). Further, transfection of expression plasmids for <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Flag-Clock</italic> into <italic>Bmal1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> fibroblasts restored the BMAL1/CLOCK:-45bp<italic>Per2</italic> protein/DNA complex in nuclear extracts. Treatment with either anti-BMAL1 or anti-FLAG antibodies significantly reduced this protein/DNA complex. Consistent with results from ChIP-qPCR analysis, nuclear extracts from <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF and thymus showed an increased level of the BMAL1/CLOCK:-45bp<italic>Per2</italic> protein/DNA complex when compared to wildtype samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2k, 2l</xref>). Adding recombinant p53 to the <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> nuclear extract reduced the level of the BMAL1/CLOCK:-45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2m</xref>). This observation shows that p53 competes with BMAL1/CLOCK for binding to the DNA probe. Collectively, these studies show that the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter contains a functional <italic>p53</italic> response element that overlaps with the E-box for BMAL1/CLOCK binding that is critical for transcription of the <italic>Per2</italic> gene.</p>

        <title>p53 levels regulate <italic>Per2</italic> transcription in the SCN</title>
        <p id="P13">To gain insight into the relevance of the <italic>p53</italic> response element in the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter to clock function, p53 levels in the SCN, the master clock structure in mammals, were investigated under temporal conditions. Previous studies have shown that in peripheral tissues, the <italic>p53</italic> protein level is under temporal control<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescence analysis with anti-p53 antibodies showed that the level of p53 in the SCN from wildtype mice peaks at ZT4-ZT8 and reaches a nadir at ZT16-ZT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a, 3b</xref>). There was no p53 staining in the SCN of p53<sup>â/â</sup> mice. This observation is consistent with results from the ChIP assay that showed peak levels of p53 binding to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter occurred at about ZT4-ZT8.</p>

        <p id="P16">Next, we examined whether p53 regulates circadian rhythm behavior of mice. The circadian behavior of inbred male <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and wildtype (C57BL/6) mice was analyzed by monitoring their wheel running activity. Both <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and wildtype mice entrained to an LD cycle and were rhythmic throughout our studies. The <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mouse period lengths were 22.8 Â± 0.1 h (mean Â± SEM, n=12) and were significantly shorter than wildtype period lengths of 23.3 Â± 0.1 h (mean, Â± SEM, n=10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a, 4b</xref>). In addition, the <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice had a more widely distributed period that exhibited sudden and unpredictable changes during free-running conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a, 4c</xref>). To assess this phenotype further, the same <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and wildtype mice were re-entrained to an LD cycle followed by a second release into free-running conditions. For wildtype mice, the changes in period measured from the second release into DD were all within 0.06 Â± 0.01 h (mean Â± SEM, n=8) of their first measurements. In contrast, <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice had periods that differed significantly from the first measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c, 4d</xref>). Both lengthening and shortening of periods were observed. Comparing the longest and shortest period length of an individual mouse measured by linear regression sampled over at least 10 days revealed an average difference of 0.43 Â± 0.1 h (mean Â±SEM, n=7) for <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice.</p>

The level of phase delay in response to a CT14 light pulse averaged â1.4 Â± 0.1 h (mean Â± SEM n=3) in wildtype, whereas <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice displayed a significantly enhanced phase delay response that averaged â2.3 Â± 0.1 h (mean Â± SEM n=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e, 4f</xref>).

        <title>Nutlin-3 phase shifts the circadian behavior of mice</title>
        <p id="P18">Nutlin-3 is currently in clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies showed that Nutlin-3 has apparent low toxicity and can be given daily to mice<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Our molecular studies raised the possibility that Nutlin-3 can alter <italic>Per2</italic> expression via stabilization of p53 and thus reset the circadian clock. To investigate this possibility, we examined whether Nutlin-3 or vehicle (DMSO) can phase shift circadian rhythm in wildtype mice during free-running DD conditions. CT9 and CT21 were chosen due to the approximate peak and nadir levels of endogenous p53 in the SCN, respectively. Both vehicle and Nutlin-3 treated mice displayed a temporary reduction of locomotor activity although the effect of Nutlin-3 persisted longer in some animals. However, no phase shift response was observed in vehicle treated wildtype or Nutlin-3 treated <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice whether treated at CT9 or CT21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a, 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). In contrast, a phase advance response was observed when wildtype mice were treated with Nutlin-3 at CT9 or CT21. The effect of Nutlin-3 was also examined using a different protocol for phase shift response in the presence of a lighting cue. In this protocol, delivery of vehicle or Nutlin-3 was carried out on the last day of the LD cycle entrainment followed by free-running conditions<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. This protocol showed that vehicle treated mice did not display phase shift behavior while Nutlin-3 given at ZT9 induced a robust phase advance response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c, 5d, 5e</xref>). In contrast, <italic>p53<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice treated with vehicle or Nutlin-3 displayed no phase shift response.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P19">The circadian clock mechanism governs the rhythmic activities that allow a living organism to anticipate and respond to opportunities and challenges presented in a daily diurnal rhythmic fashion. For this coordinated control to happen at all levels, from physiological processes to molecular signaling pathways, there must be a pervasive and effective mechanistic connection between the clock network and other cellular networks. It is now recognized that the clock mechanism or specific components of the clock are involved in responses to cellular stress including DNA damage response, checkpoint arrest and apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. p53 regulated genes are involved in diverse biological pathways including the cell cycle, DNA damage response, apoptosis and glucose metabolism<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. However, the link between p53 controlled pathways such as the cell cycle and the circadian clock regulators is thought to be indirect or âopportunisticâ<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P20">Our present study has shown that p53 directly binds to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter and represses its transcriptional activation by BMAL1/CLOCK. We mapped a p53 response element with two characteristic decamers to an evolutionarily conserved region within â45 bp of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter transcription start site. This p53 response element overlaps with the major E-box element necessary for BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription. Both EMSA and reporter assay with â45bp<italic>Per</italic>2DNA demonstrate p53 binding and repression of BMAL1/CLOCK mediated transcription. Independently, by ChIP-qPCR analysis, we showed that CLOCK/BMAL1 binding to the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter is inhibited by the expression of p53. Four modes of p53 transcriptional repression are now recognized<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. One of these modes is the overlap of the p53 response element with the binding site of another transcription factor, allowing p53 to compete with that transcription factor for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with this mode of transcriptional repression, EMSA results show that the formation of a BMAL1/CLOCK:-45bp<italic>Per2</italic> DNA complex was significantly reduced by addition of recombinant p53.</p>
      <p id="P21">Our studies show that the physiological p53 level oscillates in the SCN of wildtype mice with peak expression around ZT8. In the SCN of p53<sup>â/â</sup> mice, <italic>Per2</italic> expression was significantly elevated but remained under temporal control. These observations suggest that p53 regulates the amplitude of <italic>Per2</italic> transcription. Indeed, the <italic>p53</italic> response element of the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter is within a region previously delineated to be important for the generation of amplitude<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The p53<sup>â/â</sup> mice display abnormal circadian behavior, exhibiting a shorter period length with reduced precision and altered phase shift response to a light pulse. Interestingly, transgenic mice that overexpress <italic>Per2</italic> also display a shorter period length than wildtype mice<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Period length is also controlled by PER2 phosphorylation state since it regulates PER2 turnover<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Our current findings show that when the levels of p53 are elevated by Nutlin-3 treatment, Î³-irradiation or by expression construct transfection in cultured cells, <italic>Per2</italic> expression is significantly dampened. In the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, Nutlin-3 injection into mice produced elevated p53 protein and repressed <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the SCN, resulting in phase advancement of the circadian clock. These findings suggest that both physiological and elevated levels of p53 regulate <italic>Per2</italic> expression. The importance of physiological levels of p53 for other biological processes has been recently recognized. For example, physiological levels of p53 regulate CD44 expression and epithelial proliferation<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. In addition, under non-stress conditions, p53 regulates adult neural stem cell proliferation<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Under stress conditions, stabilized p53 represses expression of <italic>Per2</italic> that in turn could modulate the expression of other clock genes to help reset the clock. BMAL1/CLOCK mediated <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Cry1</italic> expressions also appear to be repressed by p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>), though it is unclear if these genes are direct targets of p53 inhibition or if this is secondary to <italic>Per2</italic> repression by p53. It was previously shown that loss of PER2 leads to highly dampened <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Cry1</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P22">This study shows that p53<sup>â/â</sup> mice displayed an increased phase delay and an absence of phase advance response to a light pulse at CT14 and CT22, respectively. Mice deficient in PER2 function exhibited enhanced phase advance and a weak phase delay response indicating that PER2 plays a major role in phase shift control<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>â<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. <italic>Per2</italic> expression is differentially induced by light over the span of the phase response curve. A light pulse given during early, but not late subjective night, induced <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the SCN<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that relative to the phase response curve, increased induction of PER2 is associated with phase delay while a lack of induction of PER2 is associated with the phase advance response. This correlation of rapid reduction of PER2 levels with phase shift advance is supported by cell culture studies showing that DNA damage induced by methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) or UV-irradiation caused clock phase advancement as a result of a rapid decrease in PER2 levels<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Genotoxic agents such as UV or Î³-irradiation rapidly induce p53<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Our studies show that Î³-irradiation caused rapid p53 stabilization that was associated with decreased PER2 levels. This decline in PER2 was not observed in p53<sup>â/â</sup> MEF treated with Î³-irradiation, indicating that it is a p53 dependent effect. Consistent with these findings, mice treated with Î³-irradiation also displayed phase advancement of their circadian clock<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Conversely, it has been observed that known casein kinase 1 (CK1) inhibitors when given during free-running conditions induce a phase delay response in mice<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. This phase shift effect of CK1 inhibitors is thought to be caused by increased stabilization of PERIOD proteins particularly PER2<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Our observation that Nutlin-3 induced p53 mediated repression of <italic>Per2</italic> expression and phase advancement of the clock is consistent with a phase advance response resulting from a reduced induction of PER2 levels by a light pulse at ZT22.</p>
      <p id="P23">Previously, it had been observed that mice heterozygous for constitutively active p53 displayed an enhanced aging phenotype that included enhanced loss of soft tissues and development of spinal kyphosis<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Further, overactive p53 activities caused by the expression of the p53 isoform ÎN-p53 (p44) also resulted in a similar premature aging phenotype<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Interestingly, similar premature aging phenotypes, including progressive loss of soft tissues and spinal kyphosis, were observed in <italic>Per2</italic> deficient mice<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. These premature aging phenotypes in hyperactive p53 and <italic>Per2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice are supportive of our findings that p53 suppresses <italic>Per2</italic> expression.</p>
      <p id="P24">Current evidence suggests that there is an inter-regulatory loop between p53, PML and <italic>Per</italic>2. PML is involved in the regulation a p53 acetylation and function<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, PML is a p53 target<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Both p53 and PML are under circadian control<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Our studies showed PML and p53 can directly regulate the circadian clock via <italic>Per</italic>2. Clearly, the mechanistic detail of their inter-regulation is complex and remains to be fully deciphered.</p>
      <p id="P25">In summary, our earlier study suggested that functional PER2 is important for p53-mediated stress signals to reach the circadian clock network.

Then 8 Âµm sections were obtained and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed as described previously<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> with some modifications. Briefly, paraffin sections were treated with 1 Âµg/ml protease K in PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) at 37 Â°C for 15 min, washed, fixed with 4% performic acid at room temperature for 15 min, washed, and then incubated with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes in buffer containing 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 5 x SSC, 50 Âµg/ml tRNA, and 20 mg/ml heparin at 55Â°C overnight. The probe for <italic>Per2</italic> was described previously<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Hybridized sections were washed with Buffer A containing 50% formamide, 1% SDS, and 5 x SSC twice at 55 Â°C for 30 min each and then washed with Buffer B containing 50% formamide and 2 x SSC three times at 55 Â°C for 30 min each. After washing with TBS-T (pH7.6, 0.1% Tween 20) three times, sections were blocked with 0.5% Blocking Reagent (#11096176001, Roche) for 1 h and incubated with anti-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (#11093274910, x1000, Roche) at 4 Â°C overnight. Sections were washed three times with TBS-T and immersed in NTMT buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mM levamisol. Sections were then developed with NBT/BCIP reagents.</p>

        <title>Model of p53 repression of <italic>Per2</italic> expression and modulation of the circadian clock</title>
        <p id="P43">p53 levels are regulated by many factors such as circadian timing, cellular stress, and MDM2. Both physiological and stress induced p53 binds to the p53 response element of <italic>Per2</italic> promoter which overlaps with the BMAL1 / CLOCK binding site (E-box) and suppresses BMAL1 / CLOCK mediated transcription of <italic>Per2</italic> thereby modulating the circadian clock.</p>
