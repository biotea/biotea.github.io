      <abstract>
        <p>Myelinating Schwann cells specifically express L-periaxin (L-PRX) in the mammalian peripheral nervous system. Several loss-of-function mutations in periaxin have been described and linked to autosomal recessive Dejerine Sottas neuropathy and to demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The localization of L-periaxin is developmentally regulated in the nucleus and the plasma membrane of Schwann cells. In this study, L-periaxin, which contains a PDZ domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain, a repeat domain, and an acidic domain, was localized in the cytoplasm of RSC96 cells. By contrast, a mutant L-periaxin with a deleted PDZ domain was localized mainly in the nucleus of RSC96 cells. After a nuclear cyclin A1, which is localized exclusively in the nucleus, was fused with the PDZ domain, cyclinA1was found in the cytoplasm of RSC96 cells. Treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export mediated by leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), also causes nuclear accumulation of wild-type L-periaxin. Double leucine mutation (L83, 85Q) in the putative NES in the PDZ domain prevented L-periaxin nuclear export and induced nuclear accumulation. These results suggested that the localization of L-periaxin in the cytoplasm is supported by NES in the PDZ domain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Periaxin is a non-compact myelin protein in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) <xref rid="pone.0091953-Gillespie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Periaxin gene has been characterized in Dejerine-Sottas <xref rid="pone.0091953-Boerkoel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and Type 4F Charcot-Marie-Tooth degenerating peripheral neuropathies <xref rid="pone.0091953-Kijima1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-GuilbotA1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. L-periaxin has been proposed as a marker of devil facial tumor disease, which is a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm of Schwann cell origin <xref rid="pone.0091953-Tovar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Periaxin has two isoforms, namely, L-periaxin (147 kDa) and S-periaxin (16 kDa) generated by alternative mRNA splicing <xref rid="pone.0091953-Dytrych1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. L-periaxin and S-periaxin contain a PDZ domain at the N-terminus. The PDZ domain, named after post-synaptic density protein (PSD)-95, <italic>Drosophila</italic> discs-large protein (Dlg), and zonula occludens protein (ZO)-1, is a motif containing 80 to 100 amino acids found in single or multiple sets of membrane-bound and cytoplasmic proteins <xref rid="pone.0091953-Saras1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. PDZ domains are involved in linking receptors to effector molecules and in clustering ion channels and receptors via interactions <xref rid="pone.0091953-Saras1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Gomperts1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Similar to other proteins that contain a PDZ domain, L-periaxin is localized in the plasma membrane of myelinating Schwann cells. By contrast, S-periaxin is diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm. L-periaxin stabilizes the dystroglycan glycoprotein complex (DGC) by directly interacting with dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) in a macromolecular complex that may provide a link between the extracellular matrix and the Schwann cell <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Masaki1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In contrast to L-periaxin, DRP2 is not a component of Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, or cytoplasm-filled channels in PNS myelin <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Quantitative studies have shown that periaxin comprises 16% by weight of PNS myelin protein, whereas DRP2 contains 0.2% <xref rid="pone.0091953-Patzig1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These values are inconsistent with an exclusive stoichiometric relationship between periaxin and Drp2 in a dystroglycan complex, suggesting that periaxin has other functions in addition to PDG complex formation and appositions <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. L-periaxin forms homodimers via a PDZ domain and clusters PDG complexes in the Schwann cell plasma membrane.In ÎPDZ-PRX mice, it reduced Schwann cell elongation and retarded but not prevented development of normal conduction velocities to a maximum value <xref rid="pone.0091953-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>L-periaxin is also expressed in lens fibers and exhibits maturation dependent redistribution, clustering discretely at tricelluar junction in mature fiber cells. In the lens, L-periaxin is present as a part of ezrin, periaxin, periplakin, and desmoyokin complex and functions in cell adhesive interactions, which is required for hexagonal geometry and membrane organization of mature lens fibers <xref rid="pone.0091953-Straub1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>L-periaxin protein can be observed in a selected nucleus of Schwann cells as early as embryonic age (E) 14.5 in the mouse sciatic nerve; this finding is consistent with the presence of a nuclear localization signal in a specific protein. However, L-periaxin is mostly associated with the plasma membrane of Schwann cells at E 17.5. Postnatal periaxin expression is further upregulated in myelination-involved cells <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Scherer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In these cells, periaxin expression is initially observed adaxonally and then becomes localized in particular regions associated with the abaxonal Schwann cell membrane as myelination occurs <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Scherer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In other words, the localization of L-periaxin in Schwann cells changes after a spiralization phase of axon ensheathment is completed, this finding has suggested that L-periaxin participates in membrane-protein interactions required to stabilize the mature sheath <xref rid="pone.0091953-Scherer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These observations have also suggested that the subcellular distributions of L-periaxin are governed by distinct molecular determinants. In this study, a functional nuclear export signal (NES) was identified in the PDZ domain of L-periaxin. We also found that the cytoplasmic localization of L-periaxin was supported by NES. Disruption of NES or treatment with Leptomycin B (LMB) impaired the nuclear export activity and induced accumulation of L-periaxin in the nucleus.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of the full-length L-periaxin and its deleted mutants</title>
        <p>The expression plasmids encoding the full-length L-periaxin (L-PRX) and the mutant without a PDZ domain (DPDZ-L-PRX) were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To ensure that the visualized proteins are not free GFP, or GFP fused to a truncated protein, Western blotting was performed to detect all the GFP fusion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). All of the constructs were tagged at the N-terminus with an EGFP to detect expression products under a Delta Vision microscope. The RSC96 cells transfected with these plasmids were subjected to fluorescence analysis and revealed that L-PRX was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). By contrast, DPDZ-L-PRX was expressed in RSC96 cells and mainly localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The PDZ domain was probably involved in the cytoplasmic localization of L-periaxin because the mutant lacked a region (residues 18â102) containing a PDZ domain.</p>

        <title>Cytoplasmic localization of cyclin A1 fused with the PDZ domain of L-periaxin</title>
        <p>To determine whether or not the PDZ domain of L-periaxin can localize in the cytoplasm of a nuclear protein, we constructed plasmids encoding the following EGFP-tagged proteins: cyclin A1 and a cyclin A1 chimeric protein with the PDZ domain of L-periaxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

        <title>Nuclear export of L-periaxin is inhibited by LMB</title>
        <p>LMB is an antifungal compound that potently and specifically prevents NES-dependent nuclear protein export by inhibiting the interaction of NES with the export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1)/exportin <xref rid="pone.0091953-Kudo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, we used LMB in this study to determine whether or not the same mechanism mediates the release of L-periaxin from the nucleus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> shows that LMB blocked the export of L-periaxin and PDZ-cyclin A1 (second and fourth panels).

The results indicated that LMB treatment reduced the distribution of EGFP-L-periaxin and EGFP-PDZ-cyclin A1 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g003">Fig.3B and 3C</xref>).

        <title>Nuclear export of L-periaxin is mediated by a leucine-rich NES</title>
        <p>To identify the sequence motifs that possibly mediate the binding of L-periaxin-PDZ domain to the export receptor CRM1, we applied a two-step approach: <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of candidate NES (cNES) and predicted cNES experiment.</p>
        <p>NES is characterized by a short peptide sequence enriched in regularly spaced hydrophobic residues defined as Î¨X<sub>2â3</sub>Î¨X<sub>2â3</sub>Î¨XÎ¨, where Î¨ is leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, or methionine and X is any amino acid <xref rid="pone.0091953-laCour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The primary amino acid sequence of the L-periaxin PDZ domain was analyzed using a web-based NES prediction program: NetNES <xref rid="pone.0091953-laCour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. An NES was identified in the amino acid sequence of L-periaxin PDZ domain between residues 73 and 86 by using the NetNES program. Known âleucine-richâ NESs (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), zyxin, HIV.Rev, c-Abl, LIM-kinase 1) were compared with the sequences found in L-periaxin PDZ domain. The results indicated the presence of leucine-rich stretches with the consensus X<sub>n</sub>Î¨X<sub>n</sub>Î¨XÎ¨ (where Î¨ corresponds to hydrophobic residues and X corresponds to any amino acid), which is similar to the sequences that function as NES in numerous proteins <xref rid="pone.0091953-laCour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this regard, the amino acid sequence (VFFENFKYEDA<underline>L</underline>R<underline>L</underline>L) between residues 73 and 86 in the L-periaxin PDZ domain is significantly similar to the NES sequences reported for MAPKK, zyxin, HIV.Rev, c-Abl, and LIM-kinase 1, sharing underlined hydrophobic (leucine) properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine whether or not the NES in the same PDZ domain contributes to the cytoplasmic localization of L-periaxin, we transfected the mutants of full-length L-PRX and PDZ-cyclin A1, namely, L-periaxin (L<sub>83,85</sub>/Q) and PDZ-cyclin A1 (L<sub>83,85</sub>/Q), respectively [in which two hydrophobic residues (Leu-83 and Leu-85) in NES were replaced with glutamine to destroy the nuclear-export activity of NES], to RSC96 cells. We then examined the localization of these mutants in the transfected cells. In contrast to the wild-type L-periaxin and PDZ-cyclin A1, L-periaxin (L<sub>83,85</sub>/Q) and PDZ-cyclin A1 (L<sub>83,85</sub>/Q) were localized mainly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g005">Fig.5B</xref>), and the distribution of EGFP-L-periaxin and EGFP-PDZ-cyclin A1 in the cytoplasm were reduced in L-periaxin (L83,85/Q) and PDZ-cyclin A1 (L83,85/Q) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091953-g005">Fig.5C and 5D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we demostrated that PDZ domain of L-periaxin might play an important role in its translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm. L-periaxin is targeted to the nucleus of embryonic Schwann cells and redistributed to plasma membrane processes of the myelinating Schwann cell, where it is believed to functioning in signaling complex. There are at least two possible mechanisms to localize the protein in the cytoplasm, a cytoplasmic retention mechanism by which the protein is tethered to particular cytoplasmic anchor proteins, and a nuclear export mechanism by which the protein is forcibly excluded from the nucleus to the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0091953-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We speculated whether L-periaxin should aslo possesses nuclear export signal (NES) that could allow it to shuttle from the nucleus to cytoplasm. Some PDZ domain proteins, such as Zo-1, Zo-2, MAGI-1c, and LIM-kinase 1, can be redistributed between the cell cortex and the nucleus. This event possibly demonstrates their function to transmit regulatory signals between the cell surface and the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0091953-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Dobrosotskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-Gottardi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For example,tight junction protein ZO-2 contains four putative NES, in which two are located at the second PDZ domain (NES-0 and NES-1) and the other two are found at the GK region (NES-2 and NES-3) <xref rid="pone.0091953-GonzlezMariscalL1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. LIM-kinase 1 contains two functional leucine-rich NESs in its PDZ domain <xref rid="pone.0091953-YangN1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Although the reason for such redistribution is unknown, this finding is possibly considered as a response to the movement of these scaffolding proteins into and out of the nucleus.</p>
      <p>The present study showed that L-periaxin contained an NES similar to previously characterized leucine-rich NESs in the PDZ domain <xref rid="pone.0091953-GonzlezMariscalL1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091953-YangN1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The nuclear export activity of L-periaxin can be inhibited by malfunctional NES mutation or by LMB treatment that can induce changes in the localization of L-periaxin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This finding indicated that the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of L-periaxin, under normal conditions, is crucially supported by this NES.</p>
      <p>Although it is not yet clear what the interaction net of L-periaxin might be, L-periaxin is included in the list of proteins redistributed in the nucleus as well as in cortical signaling and adhesion complexes. Based on its localization to the Cajal bands of Schwann cells and the dymyelinating neuropathy phenotype associated with the gene knockout mouse model,periaxin has been confirmed to play an essential role in stabilization of the Schwann cell-axon unit <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We suppose that nuclear targeting of L-periaxin in embryonic Schwann cells may play any role in nulear or sequester L-periaxin from inappropriate interactions in the cytoplasm untill the correct ligand becomes available at the cell cortex of the maturing myelin forming Schwann cell. Once ligand, such as dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) can be available, L-periaxin will be interact with DRP2 to provide a link between the extra celluar matrix and Schwann cell by CRM1-dependent nuclear export <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Perixain is the only protein in the database that shares a significant degree of homology with the repeated domain of AHNAK <xref rid="pone.0091953-Sussman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Like AHNAK,L-periaixn might be transmitting signals from the cell periphery to the nucleus or even physically transferring proteins to the required locales within the cells. The stimulus or signal transduction that influences the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of L-periaxin should be a further research.</p>
