        <p>The primary cilium has evolved as a multifunctional cellular compartment that decorates most vertebrate cells. Cilia sense mechanical stimuli in various organs, but the molecular mechanisms that convert the deflection of cilia into intracellular calcium transients have remained elusive. Polycystin-2 (TRPP2), an ion channel mutated in polycystic kidney disease, is required for cilia-mediated calcium transients but lacks mechanosensitive properties. We find here that TRPP2 utilizes TRPV4 to form a mechano- and thermosensitive molecular sensor in the cilium. Depletion of TRPV4 in renal epithelial cells abolishes flow-induced calcium transients, demonstrating that TRPV4, like TRPP2, is an essential component of the ciliary mechanosensor. Because TRPV4-deficient zebrafish and mice lack renal cysts, our findings challenge the concept that defective ciliary flow sensing constitutes the fundamental mechanism of cystogenesis.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia function as sensory organelles that detect a variety of chemical and physical stimuli. The cilia of renal epithelial cells are exposed to fluid flow that bends this microtubule-based organelle, eliciting an increase in intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Praetorius and Spring, 2001</xref>). The calcium transient is contingent on the presence of the polycystin-1âTRPP2 protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). TRPP2, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, assembles with the PKD1 gene product polycystin-1, a large integral membrane protein with distant homology to TRP channels, to form a receptorâion channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">KÃ¶ttgen, 2007</xref>). Mutations in polycystin-1 or TRPP2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and deletion of either of the two proteins causes multiple developmental abnormalities in mice, most notably fluid-filled cysts in the kidney, liver, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu and Zhou, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). How polycystin-1 and TRPP2 exert their diverse biological functions has remained largely unknown. Both proteins localize to the primary cilium but assume other distinct subcellular localizations that are regulated by multiple adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hidaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">KÃ¶ttgen and Walz, 2005</xref>). The flow-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient requires the presence of functional TRPP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>) and has been implicated in the regulation of tubular polarity and morphology. Because functional and structural defects of the primary cilium cause polycystic kidney disease, it is currently widely accepted that the loss of tubular flow sensing constitutes the fundamental mechanism of cystogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ong and Wheatley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torres and Harris, 2006</xref>). Although the localization and calcium permeability of TRPP2 make it an attractive candidate for the ciliary calcium entry pathway, the homomeric channel lacks mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Giamarchi et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that TRPP2 assembles with an auxiliary subunit to form a mechanosensitive channel complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>TRPV4 localizes to the cilium and interacts with TRPP2</title><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the TRPV channel OSM-9 is involved in transmitting multiple sensory stimuli, including olfaction, osmosensation, and mechanosensation. Specificity is provided by interaction with specific OSM-9 and capsaicin receptor-related (OCR) ion channels, and signaling depends on the correct targeting of these ion channels to the cilium of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tobin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kahn-Kirby and Bargmann, 2006</xref>). Because human TRPV4 is related to OSM-9, rescues the avoidance defects of OSM-9âdeficient worms in response to hyperosmotic stress and nose touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liedtke et al., 2003</xref>), and is expressed in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tian et al., 2004</xref>) as well as the zebrafish pronephros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mangos et al., 2007</xref>), we postulated that TRPV4 may access the ciliary compartment in the kidney of vertebrates. Recently, TRPV4 was found in cilia in cholangiocytes and the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Teilmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gradilone et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with its expression pattern in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and these mammalian tissues, TRPV4 localized to the cilia of polarized MDCK cells, where it colocalized with TRPP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, AâD</xref>; and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805124/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805124/DC1</ext-link>). Accordingly, we investigated whether TRPV channels are involved in flow-mediated calcium signaling and found that flow-triggered calcium transients in ciliated MDCK cells were completely abrogated by 500 nM of the polycationic ruthenium red (RR), a compound that inhibits TRPV channels (Fig. S2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voets et al., 2002</xref>). These observations led us to speculate that TRPP2 may interact with TRPV4 to mediate tissue-specific functions such as ciliary mechanosensation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TRPV4 and TRPP2 interact and colocalize in primary cilia.</bold> (A) Subcellular localization of native TRPV4 and TRPP2 in polarized MDCK cells.

Bars, 5 Î¼m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820437f01"/></fig><p>Because TRP channels are known to engage in heteromeric interactions that generate channels with novel functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schaefer, 2005</xref>), we tested whether TRPP2 physically interacts with TRPV4. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, the carboxy terminus of TRPP2 immunoprecipitated wild-type TRPV4 as well as the carboxy terminus of TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Conversely, precipitation of the carboxy terminus of TRPV4 immobilized wild-type TRPP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). To confirm these coimmunoprecipitation assays, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to test whether the carboxy-terminal domains of TRPP2 and TRPV4 associate within living cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (HâJ</xref>), fusion of CFP and YFP to full-length TRPP2 and TPRV4, respectively, resulted in FRET, which provides further evidence that TRPP2 and TRPV4 form heteromultimers. FRET was not observed when using TRPC6-YFP as a negative control (Fig. S1, GâI).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional interaction between TRPP2 and TRPV4</title><p>To study whether TRPP2 and TRPV4 also interact functionally, we expressed both channels in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes for electrophysiological analysis. TRPV4 is activated by a variety of stimuli, including hypotonicity-induced cell swelling, which is akin to a mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liedtke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nilius et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2004</xref>). Because a carboxy-terminal acidic cluster precludes the expression of TRPP2 at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">KÃ¶ttgen et al., 2005</xref>), only TRPV4, but not TRPP2, raised the steady-state inward currents in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes. Hypotonic cell swelling further increased TRPV4 currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Coexpression of TRPV4 and TRPP2 significantly augmented the swelling-activated currents in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes, whereas steady-state currents remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The swelling-induced conductance was more than doubled in TRPV4/TRPP2-expressing cells in comparison with TRPV4-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Neither water nor TRPP2-injected oocytes showed any swelling-activated currents (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The currentâvoltage relationship revealed a slight outward rectification of the TRPV4 currents that was not substantially influenced by coexpression of TRPP2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). Increasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration led to a significant increase in whole-cell currents in TRPV4-expressing oocytes. This effect was dramatically augmented in oocytes coexpressing TRPP2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Thus, TRPP2 alters the functional properties of TRPV4. We also observed a functional interaction between TRPP2 and TRPV4 in HEK 293 cells (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805124/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805124/DC1</ext-link>). To address the question of whether the TRPP2 effect on swelling-activated currents is simply mediated through increased surface expression of TRPV4, we inserted a V5 tag into the first extracellular loop of TRPV4 and TRPP2, respectively, and monitored either ion channel at the cell surface using a modified ELISA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wegierski et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, coexpression of TRPV4 significantly increased TRPP2 surface expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>), whereas TRPP2 reduced both TRPV4 surface expression and TRPV4 total protein levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 I</xref>). Thus, the increases in swelling-induced conductance are not the result of increased TRPV4 surface expression but rather caused by altered channel properties through formation of TRPP2/TRPV4 heteromers.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Functional interaction of TRPP2 and TRPV4 in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes.</bold> (A) Analysis of TRP channel whole-cell currents under voltage clamp (V<sub>c</sub>) conditions.

We never observed cystic kidneys in TRPV4-deficient mice up to an age of 12 mo (<italic>n</italic> = 10). To investigate the role of TRPV4 in another animal model for cystogenesis, we studied the development of the pronephros during early zebrafish embryogenesis. Microinjection of a morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) directed against Zebrafish TRPP2 (pkd2MO) induces pronephric cysts that are detectable 48 h postfertilization (hpf; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Obara et al., 2006</xref>).

The zebrafish results are consistent with the lack of renal cysts in the TRPV4-deficient mice, which suggests that TRPV4, although an essential component of the ciliary mechanosensor in MDCK cells in vitro, does not play an important role in cystogenesis in mouse or zebrafish. The question then arises of whether there is any evidence that TRPV4 is required for flow-induced calcium transients in vivo. Flow-dependent potassium secretion is a calcium-dependent process that is completely abolished in TRPV4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taniguchi et al., 2007</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that flow-induced calcium transients are absent in at least the distal nephrons of adult TRPV4-deficient mice and question the importance of flow-mediated calcium signaling in cystogenesis. We cannot exclude the possibility that flow sensing plays a role in regulating tubular morphology during embryonic development. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no direct experimental evidence supporting a role for flow sensing during development because the role of polycystin-1 and TRPP2 was also studied in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The TRPP2âTRPV4 complex functions as a thermosensor in vivo</title><p>Given the lack of epistasis between TRPP2 and TRPV4 in the zebrafish pronephros model, we chose another approach to investigate whether TRPP2 and TRPV4 form a sensory complex in vivo.

To test whether TRPV4 and TRPP2 form a complex that is activated by warm temperatures, we expressed both proteins in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes. The activation of TRPV4 by warm temperatures (39Â°C) was doubled in the presence of TRPP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, AâD</xref>), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the TRPV4âTRPP2 channel complex exerts a thermosensory function. Using a tail immersion assay, we detected that TRPP2<sup>+/â</sup> mice display a thermosensation profile that closely resembles the abnormalities described for TRPV4<sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). Latencies in the tail immersion assay were significantly increased at 44Â°C and 46Â°C in TRPP2<sup>+/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>) but were comparable to wild-type mice at higher temperatures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). No differences were detected between wild-type and TRPV4<sup>+/â</sup> mice; however, the additional loss of one TRPP2 allele (transheterozygous animals) drastically augmented the thermosensory defect at 44Â°C and 46Â°C, exceeding the latencies for either TRPV4<sup>â/â</sup> or TRPP2<sup>+/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). These findings provide clear genetic evidence that TRPV4 and TRPP2 collectively mediate thermosensation at moderately warm temperatures in the mouse. Our findings demonstrate that TRPP2 and TRPV4 jointly mediate thermosensation at moderate temperatures.

Using progressively complex model systems, we demonstrate that coupling between two TRP channels, TRPP2 and TRPV4, creates a polymodal sensory channel complex, both in vitro and in vivo. Because TRPP2 is expressed in nearly all tissues, our results point toward a mechanism by which TRPP2 promiscuously exploits other TRP channel members to exert tissue-specific functions. This mechanism is also used by <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where OSM-9 provides the multifunctional TRP channel subunit that mediates responses to different sensory stimuli. It is tempting to speculate that TRPP2 utilizes TRPV4 to mediate mechano- and osmosensory signals required for TRPP2 functions such as systemic osmotic and blood pressure regulation that are impaired in polycystic kidney disease before the onset of renal failure. This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that TRPV4 may also play a role in shear stress detection besides its role as an osmosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Although both channels localize to the cilium of tubular epithelial cells and are required for flow-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, the lack of renal cysts in TRPV4-deficient animals indicates that activation of the ciliary polycystin-1âTRPP2 complex by a mechanism other than flow-induced deflection of the cilium might be critical for the regulation of tubular morphology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>TRPP2 constructs have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnould et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">KÃ¶ttgen et al., 2005</xref>).

The use of 458-nm excitation only strongly reduced the excitation of the TRPV4-YFP constructs. After nine excitation cycles (every 5 s) with 458-nm excitation used as baseline intensity values, five excitation cycles with an additional photobleach pulse with 514 nm (maximum laser power) followed, then 458-nmâonly excitation cycles were used until a total recording time of 100 s was reached.

The signal of the seven emission channels was spectrally unmixed into the CFP- and YFP-related components using the LSM 510 software and reference spectra recorded at identical recording conditions from TRPP2-CFPâ and TRPV4-YFPâonly transfected cells as well as background correction. The unmixing process resulted in two images containing the unmixed CFP and YFP signals and a third channel containing residual signal, which could not be accounted to CFP or YFP. We quantified the percentage change of CFP (donor) or YFP (acceptor) fluorescence after bleach of the acceptor, YFP. The maximal CFP signal or YFP signal reached during any time point of the single experiment was used as the 100% reference value.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Western blot analysis and coimmunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnould et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">KÃ¶ttgen et al., 2005</xref>).

The morpholinos for single and double injections were diluted in 100 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, and 0.1% Phenol red (Sigma-Aldrich). The injections were performed using a microprocessor-controlled nanoliter injector (Nanoliter 2000; World Precision Instruments, Inc.) under stereomicroscopical control (MZ16; Leica).

Animals of different genotypes were obtained by mating of TRPP2<sup>+/â</sup> animals with TRPV4<sup>+/â</sup> or TRPV4<sup>â/â</sup> animals, and genotypes were determined by PCR. Age-matched male mice 11â17 wk of age were individually housed at least 1 h before behavioral assays. Ambient temperature was maintained at 25 Â± 1Â°C, with a light cycle from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. All behavioral assays were performed between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m. A single cohort of animals was used in all experiments.

After a 30-min acclimation in a Plexiglas box, the tail of a gently restrained mouse was immersed in a water bath set at a single temperature from 44â52Â°C, and the time to tail flick was recorded. This assay was performed with the investigator blinded to genotype. Latencies at a given temperature were recorded during three trials separated by at least 1 d and averaged.
