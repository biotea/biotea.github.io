        <p id="Par1">The identification of specific drug targets guides the development of precise cancer treatments. Compared with oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes have been poorly studied in the treatment of breast cancer. We integrate the microRNA expression array from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) databases in clinical breast cancer tissues, and find that miR-27a is significantly upregulated and correlated with poor survival outcome and tumor progression. Transmembrane protein 170B (TMEM170B), a new functional target of miR-27a, is identified via target prediction and experimental validation, suppressing breast cancer proliferation, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, TMEM170B overexpression promotes cytoplasmic Î²-catenin phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of Î²-catenin stabilization, reduction of nuclear Î²-catenin levels and downstream targets expression. Clinically, TMEM170B or Î²-catenin expression is significantly correlated with overall survival ratio in breast cancer patients. Thus, these results highlight TMEM170B as a novel tumor suppressor target in association with the Î²-catenin pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for human breast cancer therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Breast carcinoma (BRCA) remains one of the top three most frequently diagnosed forms of carcinomas and the most aggressive type of tumors in women. It has been estimated that BRCA accounted for 29% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Despite the potential of clinical combination therapy, we must acknowledge that poor prognosis and high recurrence rates seriously restrict clinical treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for treatment of BRCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Carcinogenesis is a complex process that involves oncogenes and suppressor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Currently, numerous breast cancer oncogenes have been reported and extensively characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, whereas relatively few studies have focused on tumor suppressor genes. Thus, novel suppressor genes and the molecular pathways underlying BRCA progression and metastasis need to be identified and validated.</p>
      <p id="Par3">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that can bind to the 3â²-untranslated regions (3â²-UTRs) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to mRNA degradation and translational suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence has indicated that some miRNAs are abnormally expressed, and may function as onco-miRNAs or suppressor miRNAs in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. miRNA-27a belongs to the microRNA-27 family, and it is located at chromosome 19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. New evidence indicates that miRNA-27a is abnormally expressed and regulates epithelialâmesenchymal transition and metastasis in various cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, previous studies have shown that miR-27a is an activator of the Wnt signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The important role of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in breast cancer metastasis and the stem cell process has been confirmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, these results have prompted the search for the direct targets of miR-27a and an understanding of how the molecular regulation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway occurs.</p>
      <p id="Par4">In this study, using bioinformatics analysis of different public databases (including mRNA and miRNA sequencing data) combined with experimental assays, we confirmed that the transmembrane protein TMEM170B, is a novel direct target of miR-27a, and that it is significantly downregulated in breast cancer. TMEM170B, a member of TMEM170 family is comprised of 132 amino acids, and the sequences are highly conserved from invertebrates to mammals. However, its function in biological processes, especially in cancer progression, is unknown. Thus, understanding the function of TMEM170B and the signaling pathway connected with the miR-27a/TMEM170B axis are essential for the development of more effective strategies for treating breast cancer malignancy. We have also analyzed the association of TMEM170B expression with the clinical overall survival (OS) ratio and associated pathological features to explore its prognostic and therapeutic value in preventing breast cancer progression.</p>

        <title>TMEM170B, a direct target of miR-27a, is downregulated in breast cancer</title>
        <p id="Par5">We first analyzed multiple miRNA expression profiling data sets of breast tumor samples (NCBI/GEO/GSE 26659/40525/68085), and we found that miR-27a was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer compared with normal breast tissues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In the TCGA cohort, miR-27a expression was also upregulated in the BRCA tissues compared to paired normal breast tissues (<italic>n</italic>â=â104, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Moreover, KaplanâMeier analysis revealed that the BRCA patients with high miR-27a levels had worse OS time (15% vs. 37%, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.05, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Real-time PCR analysis showed that miR-27a expression was markedly increased in the breast cancer cells compared with the normal mammary cells MCF10A (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). To further examine the role of miR-27a in breast cancer, we performed overexpression and knockdown functional assays in breast cancer cells using miR-27a mimic and inhibitor (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b and c</xref>). The overexpression of miR-27a significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion in MCF7 cells (low metastatic cells, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, g</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>), whereas the knockdown of miR-27a significantly attenuated the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells (high metastatic cells, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, h</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). All of these results showed that the miR-27a levels were positively associated with breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>TMEM170B as a direct target of miR-27a, is downregulated in breast cancer</title><p><bold>a</bold> Expression profiles of miRNA-27a in primary breast cancer and normal breast tissues of published GEO profiles (NCBI/GEO/GSE 26659/40525/68085). <bold>b</bold> Differential expression of miR-27a in breast cancer and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues from the TCGA database. <bold>c</bold> KaplanâMeier survival analysis of the overall survival in 1071 BRCA patients with different miR-27a expression. <bold>d</bold> The miR-27a expression of the breast cancer cells were detected by real-time PCR. <bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Cell proliferation of MCF7 cells transfected with miR-27a mimic (<bold>e</bold>) or MDA-MB-231 cells with miR-27a inhibitor (<bold>f</bold>). <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold> Cell migration assays of MCF7 cells transfected with miR-27a mimic (<bold>g</bold>) or MDA-MB-231 cells with miR-27a inhibitor (<bold>h</bold>). <bold>i</bold>, <bold>j</bold> The schematic sequence of constructs used in the dual-luciferase reporter assay and the potential miR-27a binding site with TMEM170B. <bold>k</bold> The luciferase reporter activity in 293T cells transfected with miR-27a mimic or control and luciferase reporters containing TMEM170B wild type or mutant. <bold>l</bold> RNA pull-down analysis of relative fold enrichment of TMEM170B using biotin-labeled miR-27a or fold enrichment of miR-27a using biotin-labeled TMEM170B. <bold>m</bold>, <bold>n</bold> Relative enrichment of miR-27a and TMEM170B in the RIP assay using anti-Ago2 antibody. <bold>o</bold> Differential expression of TMEM170B between breast cancer and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues in the TCGA database. <bold>p</bold> The correlation of TMEM170B and miR-27a expression in TCGA cohort. <bold>q</bold>, <bold>r</bold> KaplanâMeier survival analysis of the overall survival in 1071 BRCA patients with different TMEM170B expression (<bold>q</bold>) or miR-27a/TMEM170B expression patterns (<bold>r</bold>).

        <p id="Par6">Over the past decade, computational target prediction programs including MiRanda (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org/">http://www.microrna.org/</ext-link>), TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/archives.html">http://www.targetscan.org/archives.html</ext-link>), PicTar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pictar.bio.nyu.edu">http://pictar.bio.nyu.edu</ext-link>), RNAhybrid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/">http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/</ext-link>), and StarBase v2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/">http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/</ext-link>) have provided putative binding sites for miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, target prediction still remains a challenge due to the unavailability of analytical programs. Full combination with experimental validation is important to increase the prediction accuracy. We performed bioinformatics analysis of the data from the miRDB, Targetscan, Pictar, and miRanda websets to explore the molecular mechanism of miR-27a as an oncogenic molecule in breast cancer, and found that six genes are overlapped, namely <italic>TMEM170B</italic>, <italic>GPAM</italic>, <italic>PPAP2B</italic>, <italic>ST6GALNAC3</italic>, <italic>EYA1</italic>, and <italic>PPARG</italic> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). To determine whether miR-27a targets these genes, we generated luciferase reporter plasmids that harbor miR-27a target sequences in the 3â²-UTR of these genes. By using these luciferase reporter plasmids, we found that miR-27a mimic did not significantly inhibit the activities of 3â²-UTR luciferase reporters of <italic>GPAM</italic>, <italic>PPAP2B</italic>, <italic>ST6GALNAC3</italic>, <italic>EYA1</italic>, or <italic>PPARG</italic> gene (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1gâk</xref>). However, expression of miR-27a mimic caused significantly strong inhibition of the activities of 3â²-UTR luciferase reporter of <italic>TMEM170B</italic> gene, which did not occur with the mutant (<italic>MUT</italic>) reporter vector (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i, k</xref>). The sequence of the miR-27a-binding site within <italic>TMEM170B</italic> 3â²-UTR was depicted by the Targetscan webset (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1l</xref>). The same seed sequence is present in the highly conserved TMEM170B protein sequence of eukaryotic phyla (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1m</xref>), which suggests the importance of TMEM170B in different species.</p>
        <p id="Par7">In addition, the specific interaction between miR-27a and TMEM170B was further verified using the biotin-avidin pull-down system (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1j</xref>). TMEM170B was pulled down by the biotin-labeled miR-27a, but not the miR-27a mutant. In a reciprocal manner, miR-27a was also precipitated by wild-type TMEM170B but not by the TMEM170B mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>). Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays showed that miR-27a directly bound to TMEM170B mRNA (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1m, n</xref>) in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Together, these results suggest that miR-27a downregulates TMEM170B expression by directly targeting its 3â²-UTR.</p>
        <p id="Par8">The TMEM170B expression in the TCGA cohort (<italic>n</italic>â=â104) was also downregulated in the BRCA tissues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1o</xref>). Consistently, a significantly negative correlation was observed between TMEM170B and miR-27a in the BRCA tumors (<italic>r</italic>â=ââ0.714, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.0001, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1p</xref>). In addition, using StarBase 2.0, we found that TMEM170B expression in the BRCA samples with low miR-27a levels was significantly increased compared with those with high miR-27a levels (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1n</xref>). KaplanâMeier analysis revealed that the BRCA patients with low TMEM70B levels had a lower OS ratio (23% vs. 40%, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.01, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1q</xref>). Moreover, the BRCA patients with the low TMEM70B and high miR-27a levels had the worst OS ratio (10%, <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.001, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1r</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of TMEM70B may contribute to the malignant progression of breast cancer.</p>
        <p id="Par9">Intriguingly, TMEM170B levels were downregulated by miR-27a mimic, as well as upregulated by miR-27a inhibitor (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1o and p</xref>). However, no significant difference in miR-27a expression was detected after ectopic expression or deficiency of TMEM170B (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1q and r</xref>). Collectively, these results revealed that TMEM170B was a direct target of miR-27a, but there was no feedback regulation between TMEM170B and miR-27a.</p>

        <title>TMEM170B exerts an inhibitory effect on breast cancer growth</title>
        <p id="Par10">We first examined the TMEM170B levels in different breast cancer cells by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting to investigate the functional roles of TMEM170B in breast cancer progression (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To determine the specificity of the TMEM170B antibody, we conducted immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2a and b</xref>) and IHC (immunohistochemistry) assays (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2c</xref>) with different concentrations of TMEM170B antibody, and using human serum albumin as negative control, the results showed that the antibody had highly specificity at the appropriate concentration. Consistent with the RT-PCR results, IHC analysis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) revealed that the TMEM170B expression levels in MCF7 cells (low metastatic cells) were dramatically higher than that in MDA-MB-231 cells (highly metastatic cells). In addition, we analyzed the subcellular localization of TMEM170B with immunostaining and subcellular protein fractionation as described in the previous <italic>MUC1</italic> report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

        <title>TMEM170B performs as an endogenous inhibitor of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in breast cancer</title>
        <p id="Par13">We measured Wnt signaling in breast cancer cells after stable overexpression or knockdown of TMEM170B, which is a direct target of miR-27a, to investigate the regulation of TMEM170B on the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. We first detected the effect of TMEM170B on the endogenous Wnt/TCF activity in breast cancer. As expected, TMEM170B knockdown significantly increased Wnt/TCF activity in MCF7 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), whereas TMEM170B overexpression dramatically inhibited Wnt/TCF activity in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). We further studied the expression of reported Wnt targets using RT-PCR and immunoblotting.

        <p id="Par14">In the canonical Wnt pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the Wnt ligand brings together a Frizzled receptor and an LRP co-receptor, which represses Î²-catenin phosphorylation and increases Î²-catenin protein stability, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator of the TCF/LEF family. Based on the observed effect of TMEM170B on activated Î²-catenin levels, we further investigated the effect of TMEM170B on Î²-catenin nuclear translocation. Analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts showed that knockdown of TMEM170B markedly inhibited the levels of Î²-catenin phosphorylation in the cytoplasm and induced its nuclear translocation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). In contrast, TMEM170B overexpression notably induced the levels of Î²-catenin phosphorylation in the cytoplasm and inhibited nuclear translocation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). However, the total Î²-catenin expression levels were not affected by TMEM170B. Since Î²-catenin phosphorylation requires GSK3Î², we studied the GSK3Î² activities following the knockdown or overexpression of TMEM170B. Interestingly, neither TMEM170B nor miR-27a altered total GSK3Î² expression, but the levels of GSK3Î² phosphorylation was modulated by miR-27a (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g, h</xref>), indicating that TMEM170B may directly regulate Î²-catenin expression independently of GSK-3Î². The negative regulation of Î²-catenin nuclear translocation by TMEM170B was also confirmed by immune-fluorescence (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>). Additionally, the shTMEM170B MCF7 xenografts displayed higher expression levels of nuclear Î²-catenin (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>), whereas xenografts overexpressing TMEM170B MDA-MB-231 had lower expression levels (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par15">To further address the regulatory mechanism of TMEM170B, we performed endogenousÂ IP assays using an anti-Î²-catenin antibody. Interaction between endogenous TMEM170B and Î²-catenin was detected in MCF7 cells, and knockdown of TMEM170B decreased these interaction levels (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>). In addition, MCF7 cells with stable TMEM170B knockdown were transfected with si Î²-catenin to explore the role of Î²-catenin in TMEM170B-mediated breast cancer progression. RT-PCR and immunoblotting assays showed that silencing of Î²-catenin could significantly reduce Wnt/TCF activity, antagonizing the effects of the TMEM170B knockdown (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m and n</xref>). These results showed that TMEM170B suppressed breast cancer progression by acting as an endogenous inhibitor of Î²-catenin destabilization in the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.</p>

        <title>TMEM170B is a clinical prognostic hallmark for breast cancer patients</title>
        <p id="Par16">To determine whether TMEM170B expression levels are related to the clinical breast cancer progression, we analyzed the association between TMEM170B and the clinicopathological status of breast cancer patients in the TCGA cohort (Supplementary TablesÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and cohort 2 (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

In cohort 2 with 140 clinical BRCA patients and 46 normal breast tissues, the TMEM170B expression and Î²-catenin levels were examined using IHC assay. We found that TMEM170B expression was more abundant in the normal tissues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), while Î²-catenin expression occurred mainly in breast cancer tissues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).

Correlation regression analysis showed that the downregulation of TMEM170B was significantly correlated with the pathological stage (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.035) and the TNMÂ (tumor, node and metastasis) status (T status, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.028), and upregulated Î²-catenin expression was significantly correlated with the pathological stage (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.014, Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the pathological stage, TMEM170B and Î²-catenin expression were independent prognostic factors for OS in the breast cancer patients (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par17">Despite improvements in the treatment of breast cancer, novel markers and therapeutic targets are urgently needed for the early diagnosis, and prevention of metastasis and for the effective treatment of human breast cancer. In this study, our results revealed several unexpected findings with possible clinical implications. Importantly, we searched publicly recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> high-throughput RNA sequencing databases for cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy. Based on the combination of various bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase assays, we unexpectedly discovered that TMEM170B was a new direct target of miR-27a. The in vitro and in vivo results in the present study indicate that TMEM170B may be an endogenous tumor suppressor of BRCA, and play a critical role in multiple tumorigenesis processes, including proliferation, migration, and metastasis. However, other powerful in vivo models, such as dynamic live imaging with luciferase signal, which can track the metastatic colonization in real time would help better explain the importance of TMEM170B in tumor metastasis in vivo.</p>
      <p id="Par18">TMEM170B is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the TMEM170 family, and its important paralog is TMEM170A. A recent study showed that TMEM170A is a new regulator of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and nuclear envelope morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, the function and molecular mechanism of TMEM170B has not been elucidated. Due to previous publications on the relationship between miR-27a and Wnt signaling, it is known that aberrant Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activation initiates transcriptional activation of proteins that are responsible for tumor cell proliferation and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Our study disclosed a novel mechanistic link between TMEM170B and Wnt/TCF activity through its specific interaction with Î²-catenin, which results in Î²-catenin phosphorylation. Notably, Î²-catenin acts as a transcription co-activator that accelerates target genes, including TCF4, CD44, c-myc, and cyclin D1. Interestingly, miR-27a, and not TMEM170B altered the phosphorylation state of GSK3Î², indicating that miR-27a may involve other cross-talk points to regulate the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Thus, our results identified TMEM170B as a novel regulator that links Î²-catenin nuclear translocation to the suppression of BRCA progression and metastasis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). In addition, the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is also critical for many other developmental events, including cell differentiation, stem cell self-renewal, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Thus, in future studies, it will be interesting to investigate other (Î²-catenin-dependent) cellular processes and mechanisms by which TMEM170B exerts its suppressive effects on cancer.</p>
      <p id="Par19">Currently, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher rates of distant recurrence and worse prognosis compared to other subtypes of breast cancer. The treatment of TNBC patients has been challenging due to the absence of well-defined molecular targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Our analysis showed that miR-27a expression in TNBC patients was higher than that in non-TNBC patients (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5d</xref>), whereas TMEM170B levels in breast cancer patients with TNBC were lower than that in non-TNBC patients (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5e</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that TMEM170B could be a signature of TNBC. Future research will be needed to clarify whether TMEM170B can be a therapeutic target in TNBC patients.</p>
      <p id="Par20">In conclusion, our results revealed that TMEM170B, as a functional target of miR-27a, is important for balancing the deregulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in breast cancer. This study also identified that high expression of TMEM170B was negatively correlated with the poor prognosis of breast, uterine, and renal cell carcinoma patients. Thus, TMEM170B could be regarded as a novel target in cancer progression. Future research efforts to design novel drugs to activate TMEM170B will provide a new therapeutic strategy to improve breast cancer treatment.</p>
