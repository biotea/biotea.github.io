      <abstract>
        <p>BRCA1 promotes DNA repair through interactions with multiple proteins, including CtIP and FANCJ (also known as BRIP1/BACH1). While CtIP facilitates DNA end resection when de-acetylated, the function of FANCJ in repair processing is less well defined. Here, we report that FANCJ is also acetylated. Preventing FANCJ acetylation at lysine 1249 does not interfere with the ability of cells to survive DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). However, resistance is achieved with reduced reliance on recombination. Mechanistically, FANCJ acetylation facilitates DNA end processing required for repair and checkpoint signaling. This conclusion was based on the finding that FANCJ and its acetylation were required for robust RPA foci formation, RPA phosphorylation, and Rad51 foci formation in response to camptothecin (CPT). Furthermore, both preventing and mimicking FANCJ acetylation at lysine 1249 disrupts FANCJ function in checkpoint maintenance. Thus, we propose that the dynamic regulation of FANCJ acetylation is critical for robust DNA damage response, recombination-based processing, and ultimately checkpoint maintenance.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The BRCA1âFanconi anemia (FA) pathway is required for both tumor suppression and cell survival, particularly following treatment with DNA damaging agents that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). ICL processing by the BRCAâFA pathway includes promotion of homologous recombination (HR) and DNA damage tolerance through translesion synthesis. However, little is known about how the BRCAâFA pathway or these ICL processing mechanisms are regulated. Here, we identify acetylation as a DNA damageâdependent regulator of the BRCAâFA protein, FANCJ. FANCJ acetylation at lysine 1249 is enhanced by expression of the histone acetyltransferase CBP and reduced by expression of histone deacetylases HDAC3 or SIRT1. Furthermore, acetylation on endogenous FANCJ is induced upon treatment of cells with agents that generate DNA lesions. Consistent with this post-translation event regulating FANCJ function during cellular DNA repair, preventing FANCJ acetylation skews ICL processing. Cells have reduced reliance on HR factor Rad54 and greater reliance on translesion synthesis polymerase polÎ·. Our data indicate that FANCJ acetylation contributes to DNA end processing that is required for HR. Furthermore, resection-dependent checkpoint maintenance relies on the dynamic regulation of FANCJ acetylation. The implication of these findings is that FANCJ acetylation contributes to DNA repair choice within the BRCAâFA pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The hereditary breast cancer associated gene product, BRCA1 is an essential tumor suppressor. To promote genomic stability, BRCA1 interacts with multiple protein partners. In particular, through its C-terminal BRCT repeats, BRCA1 directly interacts with Abraxas, CtIP and FANCJ (also known as BRIP1 or BACH1 (BRCA1-associated C-terminal helicase 1)). These BRCT-interacting proteins contribute to the function of BRCA1 in the DNA damage response (DDR). Abraxas serves to localize BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage and CtIP promotes the initiation of DNA end resection, which is critical for HR <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Sobhian1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002786-Sartori1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. FANCJ also participates in localizing BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage, in DNA repair, and in checkpoint signaling; however, its distinct function is less clear.</p>
      <p>Elucidating how FANCJ functions in the DDR is important, as mutations in the <italic>FANCJ</italic> gene are associated with hereditary breast cancer as well as with the rare cancer prone syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA) within the FANCJ patient complementation group (FA-J) <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Cantor1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As a DEAH-family helicase, it is expected that FANCJ metabolizes DNA substrates to facilitate DNA repair. Consistent with this idea, recombinant-FANCJ is a 5â²-3â² helicase and translocase that can unwind D-loops and displace RAD51 <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In cells, FANCJ also localizes to sites of DNA damage. Furthermore, when FANCJ is absent, catalytically inactive, or lacks BRCA1 binding, cells display defects in double strand break repair (DSBR) and HR <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Cantor2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002786-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Recently, FANCJ was identified as a factor essential for maintaining the DNA damage induced checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation <xref rid="pgen.1002786-CottaRamusino1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite these findings, FANCJ-deficient cells are only mildly sensitive to agents that induce DSBs <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Peng2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To explain these findings, it has been proposed that FANCJ functions in DSBR, but has a more significant role in processing replication forks stalled at lesions, such as DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). In support of this idea, FANCJ-null cells, similar to other FA patient cells, are extremely sensitive to agents that induce ICLs, such as cisplatin, melphalan, or mitomycin C (MMC) <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Litman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Levitus1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Levran1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This sensitivity is reversed by complementation of FA-J cells with wild-type FANCJ (FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>), but not with catalytically inactive FANCJ mutants <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Cantor2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Wu2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, the mechanism by which FANCJ mediates ICL processing is regulated by BRCA1 binding. HR is favored when BRCA1 binds FANCJ. When BRCA1 binding is prevented, lesion bypass is favored by a mechanism requiring the translesion synthesis polymerase polÎ· <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, complementation of FA-J cells with a BRCA1-interaction defective mutant FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> reverses ICL sensitivity but does not fully restore FANCJ function.</p>
      <p>Here, we present evidence that FANCJ contributes to lesion processing by promoting a robust DDR. Essential for this function is FANCJ acetylation on a specific lysine residue. As such, preventing FANCJ acetylation suppresses DNA end resection that normally serves to engage recombination-based processing. Thus, both BRCT-interacting proteins, CtIP and FANCJ undergo DNA damage induced changes in acetylation that further regulates their function in the DDR to promote genomic stability.</p>

        <title>FANCJ is acetylated by CBP and deacetylated by HDAC3 or SIRT1</title>
        <p>As observed for CtIP, FANCJ binds directly to the BRCT domains of BRCA1 <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Cantor2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Given that CtIP function is inactivated by acetylation <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Kaidi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we addressed whether FANCJ was similarly modified. For this analysis, myc-tagged FANCJ was co-transfected with various Flag- or HA-tagged histone acetyltransferases. In an immunoblot probed with a pan-acetyl lysine antibody, we found that the precipitated FANCJ was acetylated only when CBP was over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, FANCJ acetylation was induced by CBP in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

            <p>A. CBP expression promotes FANCJ acetylation. Myc-tagged FANCJ was co-transfected with HA- or FLAG-tagged acetyltransferase (CBP, p300, PCAF, Tip60, or MOF) into 293T cells. As detected by immunoblot of whole cell extracts (WCE), acetyltransferases were expressed (upper panel), however only CBP promoted FANCJ acetylation as shown by FANCJ immunoprecipitation (lower panel). B. FANCJ acetylation is induced by CBP in a dose dependent manner. Myc-tagged FANCJ was co-transfected with increasing amounts of CBP and lysates were used for immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. C. FANCJ deacetylation was prevented by both TSA and NAM. 293T cells co-expressing Myc-tagged FANCJ and CBP were exposed to TSA, NAM, TSA+NAM, or neither and lysates were used for immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. D. FANCJ was deacetylated by both HDAC3 and SIRT1. Myc-tagged FANCJ was co-transfected with CBP and Flag-tagged deacetylase (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, SIRT1, or SIRT6) into 293T cells and lysates were immunobloted with the indicated antibodies. E. When SIRT1 (0.01 Âµg) and HDAC3 (4 Âµg) were similarly expressed (upper panel), HDAC3 promoted more FANCJ deacetylation (lower panel). Cell lysates were collected and analyzed for expression and/or acetyation following immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies.</p>

        <p>FANCJ acetylation was preserved most effectively by the inclusion of two types of deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin-A (TSA) and nicotinamide (NAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we considered that more than one class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) could deacetylate FANCJ. TSA inactivates class 1 and class II HDACs, whereas NAM inactivates the nicotinamide adenoine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent sirtuin (class III) family of HDACs (including SIRT1 to SIRT7) <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Marks1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. FANCJ acetylation was reduced more when either Flag-tagged-HDAC3 or SIRT1 were overexpressed in 293T cells than observed upon overexpression of HDAC1, HDAC2, or SIRT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Titration of the SIRT1 expression vector transfected into 293T cells revealed that 0.01 Âµg of the SIRT1 construct matched the expression level of 4 Âµg of the HDAC3 construct. At this similar level of expression, HDAC3 more efficiently deactylated FANCJ than did SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, these data implicate that FANCJ can be acetylated by CBP and deacetyated by HDAC3 as well a SIRT1 when over-expressed.</p>

        <title>FANCJ is acetylated at lysine residue 1249</title>
        <p>To identify the FANCJ acetylation site(s), myc-tagged C-terminal FANCJ truncation mutants were co-transfected with CBP into 293T cells. By Immunoblot analysis using the pan-acetyl antibody, we found that acetylation of FANCJ required amino acids 1239 to 1249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g002">Figure 2A, 2C</xref>). Consistent with this region being modified, a C-terminal domain of FANCJ similar to a C-terminal p53 control was acetylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by a HAT-domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g002">Figure 2B, 2C</xref>). To determine, which of three lysine (K) residues in this C-terminal region were required for acetylation, we generated three independent FANCJ mutant constructs that converted lysines 1240, 1242, or 1249 to arginine (R). Further transfection experiments revealed that the K1249 was the dominant site for FANCJ acetylation, a lysine that is not conserved in chicken or <italic>C. elegans</italic> FANCJ species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g002">Figure 2D, 2E</xref>).</p>

        <p>Next, we sought to provide more conclusive evidence that CBP-induced acetylation on FANCJ was at the K1249 site. We purified FANCJ from 293T cells transfected with a C-terminal myc-tagged FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> or the FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant species by immunoprecipitation using a myc antibody. Isolated proteins were then digested with trypsin and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). FANCJ-derived peptides covering the entire sequence were analyzed, and acetylation sites were identified using MASCOT search algorithm. Most of the acetylated lysine residues were detected in overlapping peptides derived from at least two independent protein preparations. In the FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>, one of these sites was K1249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, even though by antibody detection, the FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant scores unmodified as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g002">Figure 2D</xref>; FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> and FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant had three additional acetylation marks detected by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002786.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, the K1249R mutant had five additional acetylated lysines not found in wild-type FANCJ, suggesting that these sites are not available when K1249 is acetylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002786.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, immunoblot and mass spectrometry analysis confirm that the very last amino acid of FANCJ, lysine 1249 is acetylated.</p>

        <title>FANCJ acetylation is enhanced by certain forms of DNA damage</title>
        <p>Given that DNA damage reduces CtIP acetylation <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Kaidi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we addressed whether DNA damage could alter FANCJ acetylation. Endogenous FANCJ acetylation was enhanced in MCF7 cells treated with zeocin, camptothecin (CPT), or hydroxyurea (HU) as compared to ultraviolet radiation (UV), MMC, or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) at the dose and time-post treatment analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, zeocin had a more robust induction of FANCJ acetylation despite the dose of zeocin, CPT, or UV having similar affect on cell survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002786.s002">Figure S2</xref>; data not shown). As found previously, DNA damage did not measurably alter FANCJ co-precipitation with BRCA1 with the exception of UV damage, which could reflect the UV-induced BRCA1 degradation <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Peng2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Zhan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). DNA damage also induced FANCJ acetylation in HeLa cells, in response to not only CPT, but also MMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In response to DNA damage, we also noted that FANCJ protein levels were sometimes enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To clarify whether acetylation or our ability to detect acetylation was induced by DNA damage, we sought to induce DNA damage in cells in which our ability to detect FANCJ acetylation was not limiting. Indeed, the amount of acetylation on similar levels of exogenous FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> achieved with low dose CBP expression was considerably enhanced following treatment with zeocin or CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). Interactions with BRCA1 and MLH1 were not required for the CBP-induced acetylation of FANCJ, because BRCA1- and MLH1-interaction-defective mutants, FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> and FANCJ<sup>K141/142A</sup> were readily modified (data not shown). In contrast, following treatment with CPT, acetylation was not detected on the FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that DNA damage-induced FANCJ acetylation requires the C-terminal K1249 residue. It remains to be determined, however if FANCJ acetylation is induced by a distinct type of DNA damage.</p>

        <title>FANCJ acetylation mutants are functional</title>
        <p>The enhanced FANCJ acetylation following DNA damage led us to hypothesize that this modification facilitated FANCJ function in DNA repair. To address this possibility, we made use of this lysine to arginine FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant that prevents acetylation and also generated a lysine to glutamine FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> mutant to structurally mimic acetylation.

        <title>FANCJ acetylation contributes to the mechanism of lesion processing</title>
        <p>Previously, complementation of FA-J cells with a BRCA1-binding defective mutant, FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> gave the semblance of FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> function. In particular, MMC resistance was restored <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, in contrast to FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>, FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> provides resistance to MMC by a mechanism dependent on the DNA damage tolerance pathway. Within this tolerance pathway, translesion synthesis polymerases can bypass DNA lesions such as unhooked ICLs and intra-strand crosslinks generated by UV, but not DSBs generated by zeocin. Evidence that FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> skewed lesion processing towards DNA damage tolerance was based on several findings. First, the sensitivity to MMC in these cells was restored upon depletion of the essential tolerance factor, Rad18 or the translesion polymerase polÎ·, but not upon depletion of the HR protein, Rad54. Second, in comparison to FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>, cells expressing FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> were hyper-resistant to UV, a phenotype that was reversed upon polÎ·-depletion. Third, in comparison to FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>, FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup>-expressing cells were sensitive to zeocin, indicating reduced DSBR <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, we sought to determine whether similar to the BRCA1-binding mutant, the acetylation mutants also functioned differently from FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>. To test this idea, the FA-J cell lines were left untreated or treated with increasing doses of MMC, zeocin, or UV. In comparison to the other FA-J cell lines, the FA-J cell line expressing the acetylation mutant FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> was hyper-resistant to UV, but unable to restore normal levels of zeocin resistance. In contrast, the FA-J cell line expressing the acetylation mimic FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> displayed greater resistance to zeocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002786.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

        <p>To further validate these results, we targeted recombination or DNA damage tolerance pathways by using siRNA reagents to Rad54 or polÎ·. Significantly, depletion of Rad54 suppressed the zeocin resistance of the FA-J cell line expressing FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g005">Figure 5A, 5C</xref>).

        <p>To address whether the contribution of FANCJ acetylation to DNA end resection was sufficient to enhance HR, we next analyzed Rad51 foci formation. In response to CPT, we found that Rad51 foci were the most robust in FA-J cells complemented with FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> or the FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> mutant. Instead, Rad51 foci in the FA-J cells with vector or FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> were more anemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, a greater number of FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> expressing FA-J cells were positive for Rad51 foci as quantitated between 2â16 h after CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, the Î³-H2AX foci did not have a significant difference between the FA-J cells lines.

        <p>Given these findings and the recent identification that FANCJ promotes checkpoint maintenance <xref rid="pgen.1002786-CottaRamusino1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, we considered that FANCJ acetylation could be essential for maintaining the checkpoint. Defects in checkpoint maintenance were evaluated by determining if CPT treated FA-J cells traversed prematurely to mitosis. FA-J cells lacking FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> entered mitosis by 24 h post-CPT as indicated by a positive histone H3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results are consistent with FANCJ acetylation supporting checkpoint maintenance. However, FA-J cells expressing FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> or FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> also failed to maintain the checkpoint, showing H3 phosphorylation by 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Substantiating this finding, at time points greater than 4 h post-CPT treatment, both mutants had reduced Chk1 phosphorylation as compared to FA-J cells expressing FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that FANCJ acetylation enhances the initial DDR to facilitate recombination-based repair and limit translesion synthesis. Checkpoint maintenance however, requires FANCJ and its dynamic regulation by acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we identify acetylation as a DNA damage-dependent regulator of the BRCA-FA protein, FANCJ. We show that acetylation at lysine 1249 is a critical regulator of FANCJ function during cellular DNA repair. We analyzed the expression of two FANCJ mutants that mimicked either the constitutive deacetylated FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> or acetylated FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> protein isoforms. While the mutants functioned similar to FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> in several assays and restored MMC resistance and exit from an abnormal G2/M checkpoint response to FA-J cells, the mutants were distinct from FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> with respect to lesion processing. Notably, FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mutants differentially relied on repair and tolerance factors for resistance to DNA damaging agents. Our findings further demonstrate that FANCJ has the ability to potentiate HR and DNA damage induced acetylation is important for this function.</p>
      <p>Another BRCA1-BRCT interacting protein, CtIP is acetylated and functions in DNA end resection. Thus, we considered that recombination-based lesion processing by the FANCJ acetylation mimic, FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> resulted from a function for FANCJ acetylation in DNA end resection. To test this idea, the FA-J cells were treated with CPT, which generates breaks in S-phase. Indeed, FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mutants were distinct in the initial response to CPT. Specifically, FA-J cells expressing the FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup>, but not FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup>, promoted DNA end resection post-CPT exposure as measured by presentation of RPA foci or its phosphorylation at serine residues 4 and 8. Furthermore, FA-J cells expressing the FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup>, as compared to FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> had 2.5-fold more cells with CPT-induced Rad51 foci. This more robust DDR could reflect a role for FANCJ acetylation in loading RPA, as shown for FANCJ in response to HU <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our data do not implicate a global role for FANCJ in DNA end resection given that FANCJ-deficiency did not affect the amount of RPA phosphorylation following zeocin, an agent that induces DSBs independent of replication. However, FANCJ is acetylated when cells are exposed to CPT or zeocin. Thus, DSB-induced FANCJ acetylation that is not associated with stalled or broken replication forks may contribute to some other aspect of the DDR, such as checkpoint maintenance.</p>
      <p>In fact, we find that FANCJ as well as its acetylation are essential for checkpoint maintenance. Specifically, in the absence of FANCJ or its DNA damage induced acetylation, Chk1 phosphorylation was induced, but not maintained and correspondingly cells underwent a more rapid transit into mitosis post-CPT. Interestingly, we found that similar to FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mutant FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup>, FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mimic FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> failed to maintain the checkpoint despite an initial DDR to CPT. Thus, some other aspect of checkpoint signaling is perturbed in FA-J cells that express the acetylation mimic. Perhaps this mutant fails to mediate a protein interaction or act upon a DNA substrate important for checkpoint maintenance. Instead FANCJ acetylation could serve as a switch, in which acetylation and de-acetylation is essential to maintain the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002786-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistently, a role for FANCJ in checkpoint maintenance was reported in a recent study <xref rid="pgen.1002786-CottaRamusino1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It follows that defects in initiating the DDR, engaging HR, and maintaining the checkpoint impact cellular DNA damage resistance. Reduced DNA repair and/or checkpoint maintenance defects could explain why FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mutant FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> were sensitive to zeocin. Defects in repair and in maintaining the checkpoint may not increase cellular sensitivity if backup lesion processing mechanisms serve to process or bypass the lesion. Compensatory pathways could explain the lack of CPT-sensitivity in the FA-J cells with or without acetylation mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002786.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In support of this idea, our data reveal that FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mutant were resistant to DNA damage by relying on tolerance factors. As such, depletion of polÎ· in FA-J cells expressing the non-acetylatable FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant reversed the UV and MMC resistance. Instead, FA-J cells expressing the acetylation mimic FANCJ<sup>K1249Q</sup> maintained zeocin and MMC resistance in a Rad54-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the toxicity to ICLs lesions as found in cells deficient for FANCJ is avoided because FANCJ enzyme active acetylation mutants facilitate recombination in S phase or translesion synthesis bypass of unhooked ICL lesions perhaps in mitosis. In the absence of a maintained checkpoint, however recombination similar to translesion synthesis bypass is likely to be error-prone.</p>
      <p>Previously, we found that BRCA1 binding to FANCJ altered FANCJ function in HR and translesion synthesis pathways. Indeed, we find that similar to FA-J cells expressing the acetylation FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant, FA-J cells expressing the BRCA-interaction defective mutant, FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> were hyper-resistant to UV induced damage, sensitive to zeocin induced damage, and relied on polÎ· for MMC resistance <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Litman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Data also indicate that similar to FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup>, the FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> mutant fails to maintain the checkpoint. In response to melphalan treatment, FA-J cells expressing the FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> mutant, as compared to FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>, underwent a reduced and more rapid G2/M checkpoint exit <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Litman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These similar outcomes do not reflect common defects in BRCA1 binding or acetylation. Indeed, the FANCJ<sup>S990A</sup> mutant was acetylated upon co-transfection of CBP to levels similar to those observed for FANCJ<sup>WT</sup> (data not shown). Moreover, co-precipitation experiments demonstrated that the FANCJ<sup>K1249R</sup> mutant bound BRCA1 as well as FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>. Thus, BRCA1 binding and acetylation of FANCJ may be distinct events. Nevertheless, defects in BRCA1 binding at serine 990 or acetylation at lysine 1249 could have similar outcomes for FANCJ function because both mutants fail to maintain a robust checkpoint and Rad51-based repair is reduced <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A stalled replication fork with exposed single stranded and double stranded regions could provide an ideal DNA substrate for FANCJ. Indeed, FANCJ requires several nucleotides for binding and metabolizing DNA <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. FANCJ function in replication fork processing could also be similar to other 5â²-3â² DNA helicase/translocases such as <italic>Ecoli</italic> RecD and yeast Rad3. Rad3 facilitates exonucleolytic degradation of DNA ends, which restricts recombination between short homologous sequences <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Bailis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, RecD regulates resection and recombination by changes in helicase speed, which can also facilitate a polymerase swap, in which bypass polymerases diminish fork break down <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Dillingham1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Conceivably, enhanced FANCJ enzyme activity or altered substrate preference due to acetylation could generate more single-stranded DNA to elicit checkpoint responses such as RPA loading as proposed <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Alternatively, checkpoint maintenance could require reduced FANCJ enzyme activity so that FANCJ does not displace proteins from lesions, such as RAD51 or interacting partners BRCA1, RPA and BLM helicase <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Cantor2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Sommers1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002786-Suhasini1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this context, it is worth noting that changes in motor speed have been associated with FANCJ clinical mutants. The breast cancer associated mutant, M299I is enzyme activating and both unwinds and translocates DNA more efficiently than FANCJ<sup>WT</sup>, whereas the P47A mutant is enzyme inactivating <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Cantor3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Gupta3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Whether changes in FANCJ function derive from acetylation and/or partners that bind via this modification remains to be determined. Furthermore, based on our current data, it is unclear if distinct DNA lesions selectively induce FANCJ acetylation.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings indicate that FANCJ has the ability to potentiate HR through dual roles in DNA end processing and checkpoint maintenance. These two functions require FANCJ lysine 1249, a site not conserved in FANCJ orthologues such as chicken FANCJ and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Dog-1. Interestingly, unlike in human cells, FANCJ does not function in HR in chicken and C-elegans systems <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Bridge1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Youds1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is not surprising that regulators of FANCJ acetylation state, HDACIII, SIRT1, and CBP have roles in DNA repair and genomic stability <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Bhaskara1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1002786-Iyer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It remains to be determined, however, whether associated repair defects are related to failure to regulate FANCJ acetylation. Complicating this analysis, HDACIII, SIRT1, and CBP have many other histone and non-histone protein substrates that also have role in DNA repair and genomic stability. For example, SIRT1 deacetylation plays an important role in regulating the function of DNA double strand break repair proteins, such as Ku70 <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Jeong1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, WRN <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and NBS1 <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Moreover, p300/CBP functions to regulate the activities of multiple proteins at the replication fork including PCNA <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Naryzhny1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. CBP also regulates the activity of other helicases, including WRN <xref rid="pgen.1002786-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Whether HDAC or HAT associated defects derive from a failure to regulate FANCJ acetylation will be an important question for future studies.</p>
