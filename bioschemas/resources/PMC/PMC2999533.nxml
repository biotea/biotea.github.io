      <abstract>
        <p>The DEAD box helicase DDX3 assembles IPS-1 (also called Cardif, MAVS, or VISA) in non-infected human cells where minimal amounts of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein are expressed. DDX3 C-terminal regions directly bind the IPS-1 CARD-like domain as well as the N-terminal hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein. DDX3 physically binds viral RNA to form IPS-1-containing spots, that are visible by confocal microscopy. HCV polyU/UC induced IPS-1-mediated interferon (IFN)-beta promoter activation, which was augmented by co-transfected DDX3. DDX3 spots localized near the lipid droplets (LDs) where HCV particles were generated. Here, we report that HCV core protein interferes with DDX3-enhanced IPS-1 signaling in HEK293 cells and in hepatocyte Oc cells. Unlike the DEAD box helicases RIG-I and MDA5, DDX3 was constitutively expressed and colocalized with IPS-1 around mitochondria. In hepatocytes (O cells) with the HCV replicon, however, DDX3/IPS-1-enhanced IFN-beta-induction was largely abrogated even when DDX3 was co-expressed. DDX3 spots barely merged with IPS-1, and partly assembled in the HCV core protein located near the LD in O cells, though in some O cells IPS-1 was diminished or disseminated apart from mitochondria. Expression of DDX3 in replicon-negative or core-less replicon-positive cells failed to cause complex formation or LD association. HCV core protein and DDX3 partially colocalized only in replicon-expressing cells. Since the HCV core protein has been reported to promote HCV replication through binding to DDX3, the core protein appears to switch DDX3 from an IFN-inducing mode to an HCV-replication mode. The results enable us to conclude that HCV infection is promoted by modulating the dual function of DDX3.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) encode cytoplasmic RNA helicases <xref rid="pone.0014258-Yoneyama1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0014258-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> that signal the presence of viral RNA through the adaptor, IPS-1/Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)/Caspase recruitment domain (CARD) adaptor inducing interferon (IFN)-beta (Cardif)/Virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) to produce IFN-beta <xref rid="pone.0014258-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0014258-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. IPS-1 is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane through its C-terminus <xref rid="pone.0014258-Seth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Increasing evidence suggests that the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3, which is on the X chromosome, participates in the regulation of type I IFN induction by the RIG-I pathway.</p>
      <p>DDX3 acts on the IFN-inducing pathway by a complex mechanism. Early studies reported that DDX3 up-regulates IFN-beta induction by interacting with IKKepsilon <xref rid="pone.0014258-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> or TBK1 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Soulat1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> in a kinase complex. Both TBK1 and IKKepsilon are IRF-3-activating kinases with NF-kappaB- and IFN-inducible properties. DDX3 has been proposed to bind IKKepsilon, and IKKepsilon is generated after NF-kappaB activation <xref rid="pone.0014258-Kravchenko1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Yeast two-hybrid studies demonstrated that DDX3 binds IPS-1, and both are constitutively present prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Ultimately, DDX3 forms a complex with the DEAD-box RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which are present at only low amounts in resting cells, and are up-regulated during virus infection. Previously we used gene silencing and disruption, to show that the main function of DDX3 is to interact with viral RNA and enhance RIG-I signaling upstream of NAP1/TBK1/IKKepsilon <xref rid="pone.0014258-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Hence, DDX3 is involved in multiple pathways of RNA sensing and signaling during viral infection.</p>

          <title>DDX3 is a RNA-binding protein.</title>
          <p>(A) DDX3 is a polyU- and polyI:C-binding protein. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated that DDX3 binds polyI:C- and polyU-Sepharose, although PKR binds polyI:C but not polyU. The rough data from MASCOT and one representative of six trials are shown. (B) DDX3 binds dsRNA, RIG-I and HCV core protein. Expression vectors for Flag-tagged RIG-I and HA-tagged DDX3 were transfected into HEK293 cells using lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, extract from transfected cells were mixed with biotin-conjugated dsRNA. RNA-protein complex were recovered by pull-down assay using streptavidin-Sepharose. The protein within the pull-down fraction was analyzed by western blotting. The results are representative of two independent experiments.</p>

      <p>DDX3 resides in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0014258-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and has been implicated in a variety of processes in gene expression regulation, including transcription, splicing, mRNA export, and translation <xref rid="pone.0014258-Rocak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A recent report suggested that the N-terminus of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein binds the C-terminus of DDX3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, , and this interaction is required for HCV replication <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ariumi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although DDX3 promotes efficient HCV infection by accelerating HCV RNA replication, the processes appear independent of its interaction with the viral core protein <xref rid="pone.0014258-Angus1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. HCV seems to co-opt DDX3, and require DDX3 for replication. In addition, the association between DDX3 and core protein implicates DDX3 in HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma progression <xref rid="pone.0014258-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Therefore, DDX3 could be a novel target for the development of drugs against HCV <xref rid="pone.0014258-Schroder2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A number of reports have demonstrated the formation of the DDX3-core protein complex in the cytoplasm, but the functional relevance of DDX3-core protein interaction is not known. In this report, we show evidence that the HCV core protein participates in suppression of DDX3-augmented IPS-1 signaling for IFN-Î² induction. Several possible functions of DDX3 are discussed, focusing on its core protein association and IPS-1-regulatory properties.</p>

        <title>DDX3 binds RNA species</title>
        <p>We have performed proteome analyses of RNA-binding fractions in human dendritic cell lysate eluted from polyU and polyI:C Sepharose. 127 cytoplasmic proteins were reproducibly identified as polyI:C-binding proteins (Watanabe and Matsumoto, unpublished data). Four of them are DEAD/H box helicases. In this setting, we found DDX3 is a RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

        <title>PolyU/UC but not replicon enhances IFN-Î² induction via IPS-1/DDX3</title>
        <p>A polyU/UC sequence is present in the 3â²-region of the HCV genome, and serves as a ligand for RIG-I in IPS-1 pathway activation <xref rid="pone.0014258-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

HCV polyU/UC promoted IPS-1-mediated IFN-beta induction, and this was further enhanced by forced expression of DDX3/IPS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

In IPS-1/DDX3-expressing MEF cells, polyU/UC IFN-induction was almost totally abrogated by the lack of RIG-I, suggesting that the trace RIG-I protein in the IPS-1 complex is required for DDX3 enhancement of the polyU/UC-mediated IFN response.</p>

            <p>(A) IFN-Î² induction by polyU/UC is augmented by DDX3. IPS-1 (100 ng), DDX3 (100 ng) and p125luc reporter (100 ng) plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells in 24-well plates with or without the HCV 3â² UTR poly U/UC region (PU/UC) RNA (0, 25 or 50 ng/well), synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> by T7 RNA polymerase. HCV RNA-enhancing activation of IFN-beta promoter was assessed by reporter assay in the presence or absence of the DDX3-IPS-1 complex.

MEF from wild-type and RIG-I â/â mice were transfected with plasmids of IPS-1, DDX3 and p125luc as in panel A, and stimulated with polyU/UC (0, 25 or 50 ng/well). Reporter activity was determined as in panel A. (C) Knockdown of DDX3. Negative control or DDX3 targeting siRNA (20 pmol), DDX3 si-1, was transfected into HEK293 cells, and after 48 hrs, expression of endogenous DDX3 mRNA was examined by real-time RT-PCR. DDX3 si-1-mediated down-regulation of the DDX3 protein was also confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). (D) DDX3 enhances RIG-I-mediated IFN-beta promoter activation induced by polyU/UC.

After 48 hrs, cells were stimulated with polyU/UC (5â¼50 ng/ml) with lipofectamin 2000 reagent for 6 hrs, and activation of the reporter p125luc was measured.

Control or DDX3-silinced cells were transfected with increasing amounts of polyU/UC and IFN-beta promoter activation was determined by luciferase assay. DDX3 loss-of-function resulted in a decrease of promoter activation by intrinsic polyU/UC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). The result was confirmed with cells over-expressing RIG-I and exogenous polyI:C stimulation. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid for the expression of RIG-I and stimulated with polyI:C, an activator of the IPS-1 pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). IFN-beta reporter activation was suppressed in si-1-treated cells that expressed RIG-I, since polyI:C lots often contain short size duplexes that can activate RIG-I <xref rid="pone.0014258-Oshiumi3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, DDX3 augmented the IFN-beta response in cells expressing MDA5/IPS-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). Thus, DDX3 was also crucial for IPS-1-mediated IFN-beta promoter activation.</p>
        <p>We next determined whether the HCV replicon triggers IPS-1/DDX3 IFN promoter activation, using human hepatocyte lines with the HCV replicon (O cells) or without it (Oc cells). In O cells with the HCV replicon, IPS-1/DDX3 expression showed minimal enhancement of IFN-beta promoter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), while in control Oc cells with no replicon, DDX3 facilitated IFN-beta promoter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similarily, an augmented IFN promoter response to polyU/UC was observed in control Oc cells, but not in O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g003">Figs. 3C and 3D</xref>). HCV RNA was prepared from O cells, and its ability to activate the IFN-beta reporter was tested in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). The HCV RNA of O cells had a high potency to induce reporter activation, and this activity was largely abrogated by si-1 siRNA treatment. Therefore, DDX3 augments IPS-1-mediated IFN-beta promoter activation in hepatocyte O cells, and HCV RNA, presumably the 3â²UTR, participates in this induction. However, no IFN-beta reporter activation was detected in O cells which harbor HCV replicon. Therefore, an unidentified viral factor appeared to participate in suppressing virus RNA-mediated IFN-beta induction, which occurred in O cells overexpressing DDX3/IPS-1.</p>

        <title>HCV core protein inhibits IPS-1 signaling through DDX3</title>
        <p>What HCV proteins participate in IFN-beta induction was tested in a pilot study using protein expression analysis. We found that expression of HCV core protein as well as NS3/4A led to suppression of IFN-beta reporter activity in Oc cells (data not shown). The HCV core protein physically binds DDX3 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ariumi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and co-localizes with DDX3 in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells transfected with HCV core protein <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, we showed that DDX3 binds IPS-1, which resides on the mitochondrial outer membrane, and assembles into RNA-sensing receptors. Since some populations of the HCV core protein localize on the mitochondrial outer membrane <xref rid="pone.0014258-Schwer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, we tested if HCV core protein affects IPS-1 signaling by binding to DDX3.

        <p>Although some endogenous DDX3 was present in the cytoplasm without DDX3 transfection, only IPS-1 transfection permitted minimal induction of IFN-beta. It is notable that high doses of the HCV JFH1 core protein was needed to inhibit the IPS-1-mediated IFN-beta-induction signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4C, left panel</xref>). Since the imaging profile of DDX3 is not always monotonous in human cells, its distribution may be biased in the cytoplasm, which may reason that only a high dose of HCV core involves preoccupied DDX3 protein to inhibit the IPS-1 pathway. This is consistent with earlier reports on an NS3-independent mechanism to block IFN induction using HCV-infected Huh 7 cells <xref rid="pone.0014258-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
        <p>IPS-1 transduces a RNA replication signal to result in IFN-beta output using downstream proteins, such as NAP1 and IKKeysilon. If the HCV core protein interferes with IPS-1 function through DDX3, the core should not inhibit over-expressed downstream molecules. As predicted, HCV core protein did not suppress the IKKepsilon- or NAP1-mediated IFN-beta-inducing signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, center and right panels). Hence, the core protein blocks the action of endogenous DDX3 and overexpressed IPS-1 to facilitate minimal IFN-beta promoter activation, and this IFN-beta blocking function of core does not target IKKepsilon or NAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). An upstream molecule of IKKepsilon and NAP1 is predicted to be the target of the HCV core protein, which is in line with the fact that the HCV core protein interacts with DDX3 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ariumi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further confirm this model, we examined whether the HCV core protein inhibits the physical interaction between IPS-1 and DDX3. Full length IPS-1 and the C-terminal fragment of DDX3, which binds to the IPS-1 CARD-like region, were transfected into HEK293 cells, with or without the HCV core protein, and the DDX3 fragment was immunoprecipitated. Expression of HCV core proteins strongly inhibited interaction between the DDX3 C-terminal fragment and IPS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). JFH1 core appeared to show greater inhibition to DDX3-IPS-1 interaction than HCVO. We then examined this IFN-beta blocking function of JFH1 core in a similar cell condition plus polyU/UC. DDX3/IPS-1-enhanced p125luc reporter activity in cells stimulated with polyU/UC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>) was decreased in cells expressing HCV core. The results suggest that the role of the core in HCV-infected cells is to remove DDX3 from IPS-1, and facilitate its interaction with HCV replication complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>PolyU/UC HCV RNA activates the IFN-beta promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), and this activity was inhibited by expression of the HCV core protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). PolyI:C/RIG-I-mediated IFN-Î² promoter activation was similarly suppressed by the core protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>). MDA5-dependent IFN-beta promoter activation was also suppressed by the core expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of the core protein on DDX3-IPS-1 interaction was further confirmed using an 1b core isoform isolated from a patient. This HCV core protein also reduced interaction as well as IPS-1-mediated IFN-beta promoter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The blocking effect was relatively weak in cells expressing IPS-1 and full-length DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). We presume that this is because there are multiple binding sites for IPS-1 in the DDX3 whole molecule <xref rid="pone.0014258-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For binding assay, we used DDX3 2-3c (across a.a. 199â¼662, longer than 224â¼662) instead of the whole DDX3. In fact, DDX3(199-662)-IPS-1 interaction was blocked by the additional expression of core protein (HCVO, JFH1 or 1b core) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>. Ultimately, HCV core protein suppresses IPS-1 signaling by blocking the interaction between the C-terminal region of DDX3 and the CARD-like region of IPS-1, and this inhibition apparently causes the disruption of the active RIG-I/DDX3/IPS-1 complex that efficiently induces IFN-beta production signaling.</p>

Using O and Oc cells, we tested the localization of the core protein and DDX3 in comparison with IFN-inducing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). In O cells with full-length HCV replicon, DDX3 was localized proximal to the lipid droplets (LD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7A</xref> top panel) around which HCV particles assembled <xref rid="pone.0014258-Miyanari1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. HCV core protein and DDX3 were partly colocalized in the HCV replicon-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7A center panel</xref>). The results were confirmed with HCV replicon-expressing O cells where endogenous core and DDX3 were stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> upper panel). Partial merging between core and DDX3 was reproduced in this case, too. In contrast, sO cells, which possess a subgenomic replicon lacking the cording region of the core protein, showed no merging profile of DDX3 and LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7A</xref> bottom panel). Likewise, Oc cells barely formed assembly consisting of LD (where the core assembles) and overexpressed DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7A</xref> bottom panel) or endogenous DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7B</xref> lower panel). O cells expressing DDX3 tended to form large spots compared to Oc cells (with no replicon) and sO cells (core-less replicon) with DDX3.</p>

Ultimately, overexpressed IPS-1 did not facilitate efficient merging with DDX3 in O cells with replicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g006">Fig. 6B,C</xref>) compared to Oc cells or Huh7.5 cells with no replicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014258.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The results on the functional and immnoprecipitation analyses, together with the imaging profiles, infer that the IPS-1-enhancing function of DDX3 should be blocked by both NS3/4A-mediated IPS-1 degradation and the HCV core which translocates DDX3 from the IPS-1 complex to the proximity of LD in HCV replicon-expressing cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We investigated the effect of the HCV core protein on the cytosolic DDX3 that forms a complex with IPS-1 to enhance the RIG-I-mediated RNA-sensing pathway. We demonstrated that the core protein removes DDX3 from the IFN-Î²-inducing complex, leading to suppression of IFN-Î² induction. DDX3 is functionally complex, since its protective role against viruses may be modulated by the synthesis of viral proteins. DDX3 acts on multiple steps in the IFN-inducing pathway <xref rid="pone.0014258-Mulhern1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In addition, DDX3 interacts with the HCV core protein in HCV-infected cells and promotes viral replication <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ariumi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This alternative function is accelerated by the HCV core protein, resulting in augmented HCV propagation <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ariumi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. More recently, Patal et al., reported that interaction of DDX3 with core protein is not critical for the support of viral replication by DDX3, although DDX3 and core protein colocalize with lipid droplet <xref rid="pone.0014258-Angus1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. If this is the case, what function is revealed by the interaction between DDX3 and HCV core protein remain unsettled. At least, HCV replication is not blocked by this molecular interaction <xref rid="pone.0014258-Angus1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g004">Fig. 4C</xref> why higher doses of JFH1 core protein are required to inhibit enhancement of IPS-1 signaling by endogenous DDX3 than by exogenously overexpressed DDX3. One possibility is that endogenous DDX3 is preoccupied in a molecular complex other than the IPS-1 pathway since DDX3 is involved in almost every step of RNA metabolism and its localization affects its functional profile <xref rid="pone.0014258-Schroder2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Mulhern1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Together with these findings, the results presented here suggest that the HCV core inactivates IPS-1 in a mode different from NS3/4A <xref rid="pone.0014258-Meylan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The core protein may switch DDX3 from an antiviral mode to an HCV propagation mode. The core protein localizes to the N-terminus of the HCV translation product, and is generated in infected cells before NS3/4A proteolytically liberates non-structural proteins and inactivates IPS-1. Our results on how the HCV core protein interferes with the interaction between DDX3 and IPS-1 add several possibilities to notions about the HCV function on the IFN-beta-inducing pathway <xref rid="pone.0014258-Schroder2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>DDX3 appears to be a prime target for viral manipulation, since at least three different viruses, including HCV <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, Hepatitis B virus <xref rid="pone.0014258-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and poxviruses <xref rid="pone.0014258-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, encode proteins that interact with DDX3 and modulate its function. These viruses seem to co-opt DDX3, and also require it for replication. The viruses are all oncogenic, and may confer oncogenic properties to DDX3. DDX3 is also involved in human immunodeficiency virus RNA translocation <xref rid="pone.0014258-Yedavalli1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The DDX3 gene is conserved among eukaryotes, and includes the budding yeast homolog, Ded1 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The Ded1 helicase is essential for initiation of host mRNA translation, and human DDX3 complements the lethality of Ded1 null yeast <xref rid="pone.0014258-Owsianka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Mamiya1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Another function of DDX3 is to bind viral RNA to modulate RNA replication and translocation. Constitutive expression of the HCV core or other DDX3-binding proteins may impede IFN induction and promote cell cycle progression. These reports are consistent with the implication of DDX3 in various steps of RNA metabolism in cells that contain both host and viral RNAs.</p>
      <p>A continuing question is the physiological role of the molecular complex of DDX3 and IPS-1 during replication of HCV in hepatocytes. HCV proteins generated in host hepatocytes usually induce an HCV-permissive state in patients, for example in the IFN-inducing pathways. NS3/4A protease induces rapid degradation of IPS-1 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Meylan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and TICAM-1/TRIF <xref rid="pone.0014258-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. NS5A interferes with the MyD88 function <xref rid="pone.0014258-Abe1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Viral replication ultimately blocks the STAT1-mediated IFN-amplification pathway <xref rid="pone.0014258-Heim1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. PKR may be an additional factor by which HCV controls type I IFN production <xref rid="pone.0014258-Arnaud1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our results add to our knowledge of the mechanism of how HCV circumvents IFN induction in host cells: HCV core protein suppresses the initial step of IFN-beta induction by interfering with DDX3-IPS-1 association. Indeed, the core protein functions as the earliest IFN suppressor, since it is generated first in HCV-infected cells, and rapidly couples with DDX3 to retract it from the IPS-1 complex, resulting in localization of DDX3 near the LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). It is HCV that hijacks this protein for establishing infection. Although gene disruption of DDX3 makes mice lethal, this issue will be further tested using IPS-1 â/â hepatocytes expressing human CD81 and occludin <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ploss1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, in which HCV replication would proceed.</p>
      <p>DDX3 primarily is an accelerating factor for antiviral response through IPS-1-binding. Many host proteins other than DDX3 may positively regulate HCV replication in hepatocytes in association with the IPS-1 pathway. In this context, we know LGP2 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and STING <xref rid="pone.0014258-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> act as positive regulators in virus infection. Peroxisomes serve as signaling platforms for recruiting IPS-1 with a different signalosome than mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0014258-Dixit1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It appears rational that HCV harbors strategies to circumvent these positive regulators in the relevant steps of the IFN-inducing pathway.</p>
      <p>Imaging studies suggest that the complex of IPS-1 involving the membrane of mitochondrial/peroxisomes differ from that free from the membrane. Although IPS-1 is liberated from the membrane by NS3/4A having largely intact cytosolic domain, it loses the IFN-inducing function <xref rid="pone.0014258-Meylan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014258-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our results could offer the possibility that the clipped-out form of IPS-1 immediately fails to form the conventional complex for IRF-3 activation any more <xref rid="pone.0014258-Yasukawa1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> or is easily degraded further to be inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014258-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Indeed, there are a number of mitochondria-specific molecules which assemble with IPS-1 <xref rid="pone.0014258-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Formation of the molecular complex on the mitochondria rather than simple association between IPS-1 and DDX3 may be critical for the DDX3 function.</p>
      <p>Evidence is accumulating that HCV checks many steps in the IFN-inducing pathway throughout the early and late infection stages, and suppresses IFN production by multiple means. Disruption of IPS-1 function by both NS3/4A and core protein may be crucial in HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells, even though the cells harbor dysfunctional RIG-I <xref rid="pone.0014258-Binder1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Type I IFN suppresses tumors by causing expression of p53 and other tumor-suppressing agents <xref rid="pone.0014258-Takaoka1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These unique features of the HCV core protein require further confirmation, and should be minded in investigation of HCV persistency, chronic infection and progression to cirrhosis and carcinoma.</p>
