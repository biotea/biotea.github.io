      <abstract>
        <p>Hyperactivation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is one of the major causes of human colorectal cancer (CRC). A hallmark of Wnt signaling is the nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin. Although Î²-catenin nuclear import and export have been widely investigated, the underlying mechanism of Î²-catenin's nuclear retention remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Twa1/Gid8 is a key nuclear retention factor for Î²-catenin during Wnt signaling and colorectal carcinogenesis. In the absence of Wnt, Twa1 exists together with Î²-catenin in the Axin complex and undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. Upon Wnt signaling, Twa1 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds and retains Î²-catenin. Depletion of Twa1 attenuates Wnt-stimulated gene expression, dorsal development of zebrafish embryos and xenograft tumor growth of CRC cells. Moreover, nuclear Twa1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues, correlating with the nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin and poor prognosis. Thus, our results identify Twa1 as a previously undescribed regulator of the Wnt pathway for promoting colorectal tumorigenesis by facilitating Î²-catenin nuclear retention.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Canonical Wnt signaling plays pivotal roles in many biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell fate determination and stem cell maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>. Dysfunction of the Wnt cascade is implicated in a variety of human diseases, most prominently in colorectal cancer (CRC). Mutation in the <italic>adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (<italic>APC</italic>) gene, a key component of this pathway, is thought to be an initiating event in human colorectal carcinogenesis. In mouse models, inactivation of the <italic>APC</italic> gene causes intestinal hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>A hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling is the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>. In the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic Î²-catenin is constitutively degraded by the Axin complex, which is composed of APC, Axin, casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). CK1 and GSK3 sequentially phosphorylate Î²-catenin, resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the Wnt ligand triggers the inactivation of the Axin complex to stabilize Î²-catenin, which subsequently translocates into the nucleus to form a transcriptional complex with T-cell factor (TCF) to activate Wnt target gene expression. Previous studies have reported that some proteins, including forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), mucin-1, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and B-cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9), facilitate Î²-catenin import into the nucleus, whereas other proteins, such as APC, Axin, Ran binding protein 3 (RanBP3) and Chibby, actively promote Î²-catenin export out of the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that the nuclear Î²-catenin level is fine-tuned at multiple layers, such as protein stability and nuclear import and export. However, little is known about whether and how nuclear retention might provide another layer of regulation to control Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation.</p>
      <p>Here we show that Twa1 (two hybrid-associated protein no.1 with RanBPM), also known as Gid8 (glucose-induced degradation protein 8 homolog), is a key nuclear retention factor for Î²-catenin during Wnt signaling and colorectal tumorigenesis. Twa1/Gid8 (Twa1) was initially described in the hunt for the proteins that can interact with Ran binding protein M (RanBPM), but its biological function remains largely unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. Using a comprehensive approach, we find that Twa1 is not only significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues, but also that this correlates with a poor prognosis for CRC patients. In response to Wnt signaling, Twa1 directly binds to Î²-catenin and promotes its nuclear retention. We exemplify the functions of Twa1 by showing its requirement for the dorsal development of zebrafish embryos and for the growth of CRC cells in a xenograft model. Although Twa1 associates with Î²-catenin in the nucleus, it does not interact with either TCF4 or Wnt-responsive elements (WREs), suggesting a chromatin-independent retention mechanism that is indispensible for the Wnt transcriptional program.</p>

        <title><italic>Twa1</italic> is upregulated in human CRC tissues</title>
        <p>To explore the molecular mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis, we analyzed the global gene expression profile of a cohort of human CRC tissues from the Oncomine database (GSE9348)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>. The results showed that the expression of 2 549 genes in CRC tissues was significantly changed when compared to nontumor tissues (fold change &gt; 2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1A</xref>). As expected, there were a number of well-known CRC-associated genes, including <italic>fork-head box Q1</italic> (<italic>FoxQ1</italic>), <italic>c-Myc</italic> and <italic>leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor</italic>
<italic>5</italic> (<italic>LGR5</italic>), in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>. Among the changed genes, a poorly defined gene, <italic>Twa1</italic>, was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues (<italic>P</italic> = 8.76e-10). To confirm the upregulation of <italic>Twa1</italic> in CRC tissues, we analyzed the RNA-seq data from the TCGA database and found that <italic>Twa1</italic> mRNA expression levels were also significantly higher in CRC tissues than their pair-matched nontumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, we validated that both <italic>Twa1</italic> mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in our own set of CRC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-1E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Twa1 expression is associated with colorectal tumorigenesis.</p>

        <title>Twa1 is required for nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin during Wnt activation</title>
        <p>To determine the regulation of Twa1 in colorectal carcinogenesis, we first examined several important signaling pathways involved in CRC by dual luciferase reporter assays and observed that Twa1 depletion selectively impaired Wnt signaling in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup>. Further analyses showed that knockdown of <italic>Twa1</italic> by two shRNAs targeting different regions of <italic>Twa1</italic> mRNA significantly inhibited lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-luciferase (LEF-Luc) activity and reduced the mRNA levels of Wnt target genes, <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). These effects were efficiently reversed by ectopic expression of RNAi-resistant Twa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Thus, these results imply that Twa1 plays an important role in canonical Wnt signaling.</p>
        <p>To investigate the role of Twa1 in the Wnt pathway, we continued to examine the Î²-catenin protein level in Twa1-depleted HEK-293 cells. In response to Wnt3a, <italic>Twa1</italic> knockdown did not obviously change the levels of Wnt-induced Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-2D</xref>), but substantially reduced the levels of nuclear Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which was confirmed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G</xref>). Similar results were also observed in RKO cells that are commonly used for Wnt signaling studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S4</xref>). Further co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments verified that the interaction between Î²-catenin and the transcription factor TCF4 was also decreased in Twa1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In addition, silencing of Twa1 considerably suppressed Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation and Wnt target gene expression induced by the GSK3Î² inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S5</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of Î²-catenin had no apparent effect on nuclear Twa1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting that Twa1 is critical for Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation, but not <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p>

        <title>Twa1 facilitates Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation through its CRA domain</title>
        <p>To explore the mechanism of Twa1-dependent Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation, we first investigated the association between Twa1 and Î²-catenin. An <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assay showed that purified GST-Twa1 directly interacted with His-Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7A</xref>). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that either endogenous or ectopically expressed Twa1 interacted with endogenous Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S7C</xref>). Importantly, Wnt3a treatment not only increased the levels of nuclear Twa1 and Î²-catenin, but also enhanced their interaction in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S7D</xref>).</p>
        <p>To delineate the region of Twa1 responsible for its interaction with Î²-catenin, we performed GST pull-down and co-IP experiments and discovered that the conserved CRA (CT11-RanBPM) domain of Twa1 was required for its interaction with Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. To test whether the CRA domain of Twa1 is required for Wnt activation, we ectopically expressed RNAi-resistant wild-type or mutant Twa1 in HEK-293 cells depleted of Twa1. Without Wnt stimulation, wild-type or mutant Twa1 was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Upon Wnt3a induction, wild-type Twa1 and Twa1 mutants containing the CRA domain translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and this restored Î²-catenin nuclear localization in Twa1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). However, the Twa1 mutant lacking the CRA domain (Twa1-ÎCRA), which was unable to interact with Î²-catenin, was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and failed to restore nuclear localization of Î²-catenin upon Wnt3a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, Twa1-ÎCRA not only reduced nuclear Î²-catenin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but also was incapable of enhancing Wnt target gene expression in response to Wnt3a induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm if Twa1 promotes Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation through its CRA domain, we forced wild-type or mutant Twa1 to accumulate in the nucleus by fusing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence at their C-terminus. Ectopic expression of nuclear-localized Twa1 (Twa1-NLS) and Twa1 mutants containing the CRA domain not only obviously induced nuclear translocation of exogenous or endogenous Î²-catenin, but also enhanced Wnt reporter activity and target gene expression even without Wnt3a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-3J</xref>). In contrast, even though the Twa1-CRA-NLS was dominantly localized in the nucleus, it was still unable to increase nuclear Î²-catenin levels and activate Wnt target gene expression. Collectively, these data suggest that Twa1 facilitates Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation through its CRA domain.</p>

        <title>Twa1 promotes Î²-catenin nuclear retention</title>
        <p>To distinguish whether Twa1 facilitates Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation through either nuclear import or nuclear retention, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments by bleaching GFP-Î²-catenin in HEK-293 cells expressing RFP-Twa1-NLS (RFP-fused Twa1-NLS) or RFP-Twa1-ÎCRA-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). After photobleaching of GFP-Î²-catenin in the nucleus, no significant differences were observed in the recovery of nuclear GFP-Î²-catenin among RFP-NLS-, RFP-Twa1-NLS- and RFP-Twa1-ÎCRA-NLS-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), implying that Twa1 does not influence Î²-catenin nuclear import. In contrast, after photobleaching of cytoplasmic GFP-Î²-catenin, reduction of nuclear GFP-Î²-catenin was significantly less in RFP-Twa1-NLS-expressing cells compared with RFP-NLS or RFP-Twa1-ÎCRA-NLS expressing cells, suggesting a role for Twa1 in Î²-catenin nuclear retention. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> transport assays in digitonin-permeabilized cells revealed that addition of purified Twa1-NLS protein did not affect Î²-catenin nuclear import but significantly enhanced Î²-catenin nuclear retention, which was abolished by deletion of the CRA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, after Wnt3a stimulation and subsequent removal of Wnt3a, ectopic expression of Twa1-NLS, but not Twa1-ÎCRA-NLS, prolonged Î²-catenin nuclear retention in HEK-293 cells in the presence of SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor to block the nuclear translocation of Î²-catenin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>.

        <title>TCF4 competes with Twa1 for Î²-catenin binding</title>
        <p>It is well established that nuclear Î²-catenin associates with TCF4 on WREs to activate target gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup>. Given that Twa1 binds and retains Î²-catenin in the nucleus, we assumed that Twa1 might also directly participate in Î²-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that only TCF4 was constitutively bound to the WREs of <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> in the absence of Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). In response to Wnt3a treatment, Î²-catenin, but not Twa1, was recruited to WREs of <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Cyclin D1</italic>. Further reciprocal co-IP experiments revealed that there was no detectable interaction between Twa1 and TCF4 upon Wnt activation even though Î²-catenin was associated with both Twa1 and TCF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-5E</xref>), indicating that Twa1 and TCF4 may form mutually exclusive complexes with Î²-catenin. To test whether TCF4 competes with Twa1 for Î²-catenin binding, we performed co-IP experiments in HEK-293 cells and found that the interaction between Twa1 and Î²-catenin was gradually reduced with increasing expression of TCF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> binding experiments further confirmed that when the amount of Î²-catenin was maintained at constant levels; the more TCF4 associated with Î²-catenin, the more Twa1 disassociated from Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These results strongly suggest that Twa1 does not directly interact with TCF4 and WREs to participate in Î²-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription.</p>

        <title>Twa1 is degraded by the Axin complex in the absence of Wnt stimulation</title>
        <p>Wnt signaling has been demonstrated to stabilize Î²-catenin and promote its nuclear translocation through inactivation of the Axin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup>. Since our data showed that Wnt3a treatment increased Twa1 protein level and its nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we investigated whether Wnt regulates Twa1 via a similar mechanism. Endogenous Twa1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of HEK-293 cells without Wnt stimulus. Upon Wnt3a-CM treatment, Twa1 was translocated into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S8</xref>). Further co-IP experiments revealed that either exogenous or endogenous Twa1 interacted with components of the Axin complex, including Axin, GSK3 and Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-6C</xref>). In sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, endogenous Twa1 appeared to co-sediment with Axin, GSK3Î² and Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To test for the simultaneous presence of Axin, GSK3Î² and Twa1 within the same complex, we performed sequential immunoprecipitation and found that Twa1 formed a complex with Axin and GSK3Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To examine whether the Axin complex is involved in the regulation of Twa1 protein levels, we depleted Axin in HEK-293 cells and discovered that knockdown of <italic>Axin</italic> resulted in increased Twa1 levels in whole-cell lysates, as well as in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Knockdown or KO of <italic>APC</italic> also raised Twa1 protein levels and enhanced Twa1 nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S9</xref>). Since the Axin complex restrains Î²-catenin levels by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup>, we asked if the Axin complex modulates Twa1 levels in a similar manner. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 efficiently increased the protein levels of Twa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In the absence of a Wnt signal, Twa1 was ubiquitinated through lysine 48 (K48)-linked, but not K63-linked, poly-ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). We next depleted Axin to determine the effect of the Axin complex on Twa1 ubiquitination and discovered that knockdown of <italic>Axin</italic> inhibited Twa1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), resembling the effect of Wnt3a-CM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that in the absence of Wnt signal, Twa1 is targeted by the Axin complex for ubiquitination and degradation.</p>

In zebrafish, <italic>Twa1</italic> has two homologous genes: <italic>Twa1a</italic> and <italic>Twa1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S10A</xref>). Both <italic>Twa1a</italic> and <italic>Twa1b</italic> were ubiquitously expressed in the early developmental stages of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S10C</xref>). We therefore injected zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage with <italic>Twa1a</italic>-morpholino (<italic>Twa1a</italic>-MO) or <italic>Twa1b</italic>-MO to knock down the expression of these two proteins. We found that both <italic>Twa1a</italic> and <italic>Twa1b</italic> morphants resembled <italic>Î²-catenin 2</italic> morphants and exhibited loss or reduction of dorsal structures, characteristics of embryonic ventralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S11</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, the <italic>Twa1a</italic> morphants showed reduced expression of the dorsal markers <italic>chordin</italic>, <italic>goosecoid</italic> and <italic>otx2</italic>, and expanded expression of the ventral markers <italic>eve1</italic> and <italic>gata2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we provide evidence that Twa1 is a critical Î²-catenin nuclear retention factor during Wnt signaling. In the absence of Wnt signals, both Twa1 and Î²-catenin are degraded via ubiquitination by the Axin complex. In response to Wnt stimulation, both cytoplasmic Twa1 and Î²-catenin are stabilized and translocated into the nucleus, where Twa1 retains Î²-catenin to ensure a sufficient amount of Î²-catenin for TCF4 binding, but does not directly participate in Î²-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>). We exemplify the roles of Twa1 in development by showing its requirement for dorsal development of zebrafish embryos. This further supports a role for Twa1 in mediating the nuclear retention of Î²-catenin as an essential part of Wnt signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, Twa1 is a previously uncharacterized component of the Wnt signaling pathway that promotes Î²-catenin nuclear retention.</p>
      <p>The molecular regulation of Î²-catenin nuclear accumulation during Wnt signaling remains enigmatic. Several steps have been implicated to be necessary for the nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin: stabilization of Î²-catenin in the cytoplasm, its transport into the nucleus and subsequently its retention in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>. Î²-catenin does not contain NLS or nuclear export signal (NES) sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and earlier studies have shown that Î²-catenin enters into the nucleus by directly interacting with the nuclear pore complex, independently of the Ran GTPase or importin-mediated mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup>. Recent reports demonstrate that some NLS-containing proteins, including mucin-1, IRS-1, BCL9 and FoxM1, are able to directly bind to Î²-catenin and transport Î²-catenin into the nucleus via the classical import pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>. On the other hand, some NES-containing proteins, such as APC, Axin and Chibby, have been shown to associate with Î²-catenin and promote the export of nuclear Î²-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p>It is well-established that nuclear Î²-catenin directly binds to TCF family members such as TCF4 and LEF1 to activate Wnt target gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>. Overexpression of TCF4 shifts ectopic cytoplasmic Î²-catenin to the nucleus and slows its rate of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup>. Downregulation of LEF1 selectively reduces the chromatin-retained pool of nuclear Î²-catenin in NIH-3T3 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup>. Although nuclear Î²-catenin is captured by the chromatin-bound TCF family members on chromatin, recent kinetic ChIP analyses have shown that unlike TCF4 which maintains a steady state on WREs, Î²-catenin dynamically cycles on and off WREs during Wnt activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup>. It is unclear how nuclear Î²-catenin that is dissociated from chromatin is retained in the nucleus to maintain sufficient levels for TCF4 binding.</p>
      <p>Here our data clearly show that Twa1 suppresses Î²-catenin nuclear export, but has no significant effect on its nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although Twa1 interacts with Î²-catenin in the nucleus, we did not detect the interaction between Twa1 and either TCF4 or WREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-5E</xref>), suggesting that Twa1 and TCF4 may form mutually exclusive complexes with Î²-catenin. Moreover, if the amount of Î²-catenin is kept constant, the more TCF4 associates with Î²-catenin, the more Twa1 disassociates from Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Twa1 does not directly participate in Î²-catenin/TCF4-mediated transcription, but only retains Î²-catenin in the nucleus. This mechanism may ensure that sufficient nuclear Î²-catenin is available for TCF4 binding through previously unrecognized chromatin-independent retention for Wnt signaling. It is possible that Twa1 could function as a scaffold protein to bridge Î²-catenin to other nuclear retention factors, or that it could inhibit the nuclear export of Î²-catenin by interfering with the action of nuclear export factors. Future work on identifying the factors that function together with Twa1 will provide insight into how Twa1 promotes the nuclear retention of Î²-catenin.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have reported Twa1 to be a partner of RanBPM in a yeast two-hybrid assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. RanBPM functions as a scaffolding protein in several signaling pathways and mediates multiple cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup>. However, unlike most members of the Ran-binding protein family, RanBPM does not contain the consensus domain for Ran binding <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup>, consistent with its lack of involvement in nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it will still be of interest to examine whether RanBPM participates in Twa1-mediated nuclear retention of Î²-catenin.</p>
      <p>In human CRC, aberrant Wnt activation is usually caused by mutations in genes encoding Wnt signaling components that increase the stability and nuclear levels of Î²-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup>. A high level of nuclear Î²-catenin is frequently found in CRC tissues and is correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup>. Our results indicate that Twa1 is an essential Î²-catenin nuclear retention factor that contributes to colorectal carcinogenesis. Twa1 deficiency not only decreases Î²-catenin nuclear levels and Wnt target gene expression in CRC cells, but also inhibits the proliferation and tumorigenicity of CRC cells in nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-8I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S12</xref>). More importantly, nuclear Twa1 is highly expressed in human CRC tissues and this significantly correlates with nuclear Î²-catenin levels and the poor survival of CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J-8M</xref>), suggesting that Twa1 may be a potential new target for CRC therapy.</p>
