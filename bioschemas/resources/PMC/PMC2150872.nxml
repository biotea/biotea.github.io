      <abstract>
        <p>Keratin filaments arise from the copolymerization of type I and II sequences, and form a pancytoplasmic network that provides vital mechanical support to epithelial cells. Keratins 5 and 14 are expressed as a pair in basal cells of stratified epithelia, where they occur as bundled arrays of filaments. In vitro, bundles of K5âK14 filaments can be induced in the absence of cross-linkers, and exhibit enhanced resistance to mechanical strain. This property is not exhibited by copolymers of K5 and tailless K14, in which the nonhelical tail domain has been removed, or copolymers of K5 and K19, a type I keratin featuring a short tail domain. The purified K14 tail domain binds keratin filaments in vitro with specificity (kD â¼2 Î¼M). When transiently expressed in cultured cells, the K14 tail domain associates with endogenous keratin filaments. Utilization of the K14 tail domain as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen pulls out type I keratin sequences from a skin cDNA library. These data suggest that the tail domain of K14 contributes to the ability of K5âK14 filaments to self-organize into large bundles showing enhanced mechanical resilience in vitro.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Keratins (40â70 kD) are the major structural proteins of epithelial cells, where they occur as intermediate-sized filaments in the cytoplasm. The &gt;49 functional keratin-encoding genes in the human genome (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hesse et al., 2001</xref>) occur as two major types, I and II. Keratin filaments are built from lateral and longitudinal interactions involving heterodimers, and most keratin genes are regulated in a pairwise and differentiation-related fashion within epithelia. A major function of keratin intermediate filaments (IFs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> is to endow epithelial cells with mechanical resilience. Mutations in keratin proteins result in fragility states whereby the cell type(s) affected ruptures when subjected to trauma (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs and Cleveland, 1998</xref>). Bundles represent the preferential form of keratin filaments in complex epithelia. Whether they are examined in situ or in primary culture, basal keratinocytes of the skin exhibit loosely packed bundles of keratin filaments in their cytoplasm. However, there is no known cross-linking activity that is keratin filamentâspecific in the cytoplasm of these and many other epithelial cells in which keratin occurs as bundled arrays (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Coulombe et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>In vitro, keratin filaments can be induced to form large bundles after minor changes to the buffer conditions, in the absence of exogenous proteins. As expected, this significantly enhances the mechanical resilience of keratin gels (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). Along with other data (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Coulombe et al., 2000</xref>), this suggests that keratin IFs can modulate their organization and mechanical properties though self-interaction. Here we provide evidence that the nonhelical tail domain of K14, the predominant type I keratin in basal cells of skin epithelia, binds keratin filaments in vitro and ex vivo, and contributes to the remarkable properties of keratin filaments.</p>

        <title>The nonhelical tail domain contributes to the mechanical properties of cross-linked keratin gels</title>
        <p>Polymerization of K5âK14 in low ionic strength buffer adjusted at pH 7.0, or at pH 7.4 with 10â20 mM NaCl added, results in the formation of large bundles of filaments that can be seen using DIC light microscopy. Rheological assays show that suspensions of bundled keratin filaments maintain their elasticity and solid-like character even when subjected to large deformations. These data (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2001</xref>) imply that stable filamentâfilament interactions, which depend upon cis-acting elements, occur under these conditions.</p>
        <p>There is evidence suggesting that the COOH-terminal tail domain of cytoplasmic IF proteins may influence filamentâfilament interactions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann and Aebi, 1998</xref>). Moreover, the tail domain of K14 is not required for efficient copolymerization with K5 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Coulombe et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>). We compared the properties of wt K5âK14 and K5âK14ÎT assemblies at pH 7.0 to assess the role of K14's tail domain toward bundling. Whereas wt K5âK14 displays the texture of a gel under this condition, the K5âK14ÎT polymer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A) flows like a liquid. In a high-speed pelleting assay designed to measure polymerization efficiency, &gt;95% of both the wt K5âK14 and K5âK14ÎT protein pools are retrieved in the pellet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). In a low-speed pelletting assay devised to assess the formation of cross-linked networks (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Pollard and Cooper, 1982</xref>), nearly all the wt K5âK14 proteins end up in the pellet, compared with only â¼20% for K5âK14ÎT. DIC light microscopy confirms the presence of extensive bundling in the wt K5âK14 sample, whereas few bundles can be seen for K5âK14ÎT (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>In rheological studies, the wt K5âK14 and K5âK14ÎT assemblies produced at pH 7.0 both display properties typical of viscoelastic solids when subjected to small deformations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). K5âK14ÎT displays a slightly larger phase shift compared with wt K5âK14 (12Â° vs. 6Â°, respectively), indicating subtle differences in the solid-like character of these samples when in the linear regime. However, significant differences are seen when these samples are subjected to larger deformations. Whereas wt K5âK14 maintains its elasticity up to deformations exceeding 300% and shows a âbumpâ characteristic of strain hardening before softening, K5âK14ÎT begins to soften at 10% strain and shows comparatively less strain hardening before yielding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Strain hardening can be captured in real time through a faster-than-linear increase of the shear stress Ï(t) when it is monitored continuously while a fixed oscillatory deformation Î³ (of amplitude 100%) is applied to the sample (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). In pH 7.0 assembly buffer, wt K5âK14 displays significant strain hardening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). In contrast, the K5âK14ÎT polymer shows little of this behavior (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D).</p>
        <p>The K14ÎT protein we used has a 12-amino-acid-long epitope tag at its COOH terminus (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albers and Fuchs, 1987</xref>). To rule out that its rheological properties stem in part from this short tag, we repeated these studies with wt K5âK19 polymer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fradette et al., 1998</xref>). K19 features a short tail domain (13 amino acids) and is coexpressed with K5 in a subset of progenitor basal cells in the skin (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Stasiak et al., 1989</xref>). Rheological studies show that K5âK19 behaves like a weak viscoelastic solid when subjected to small deformations at pH 7.0. However, as is the case for K5âK14ÎT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), the K5âK19 polymer rapidly softens when subjected to progressively larger deformations. At 200% strain amplitude, for instance, the wt K5âK14 and K5âK19 assembled at 0.2 mg/ml (4 Î¼m) exhibit elastic moduli Gâ² of 38 Â± 7 and 4.2 Â± 0.2 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Interestingly, immunoelectron microscopy studies involving human skin epithelia showed that K5âK19-rich basal cells exhibit a looser keratin network than K5âK14-rich basal cells (Dr. Lucie Germain, personal communication). The data we report here suggest that although the nonhelical tail domain of K14 is dispensable for 10-nm filament assembly, it contributes to the intrinsic potential of K5âK14 for interaction with self, which enhances its ability to withstand large deformations.</p>

        <title>The purified K14 tail domain binds to keratin filaments in vitro</title>
        <p>To assess whether the short nonhelical tail domain of K14 (â¼50 residues) can interact directly with keratin filaments, we added an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal histidine (His) tag to facilitate its purification. Purified His-T14 migrates with a mass of â¼7 kD on SDS-PAGE, reacts with antibodies directed against the His tag and the K14 COOH terminus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A), and behaves as a monomer with an extended shape in solution (unpublished data). His-T14 cosediments with wt K5âK14 filaments produced under standard buffer conditions at pH 7.4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and B</xref>â², kD â¼2 Î¼M). In contrast, His-NPT (control for His tag) and insulin (size control) do not cosediment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B), establishing specificity. His-T14 also cosediments with K8âK18 filaments and K5âK14ÎT filaments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C), but not with vimentin filaments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C) or F-actin (unpublished data). Therefore, the tail domain of K14 binds directly to determinant(s) shared between K5âK14 and K8âK18 filaments.</p>

His-T14 was mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio with preformed filaments (10 Î¼M; left) or not (right). As controls, His-NPT or insulin do not cosediment with wt K5âK14 under the same conditions.

(C) Assessment of His-T14 binding to other IF polymers. His-T14 binds reconstituted K8âK18 filaments (10 Î¼M) and K5âK14ÎT filaments (10 Î¼M) but not vimentin filaments (10 Î¼M). (D) Impact of adding purified His-T14 on the low pH-induced bundling of wt K5âK14 filaments (10 Î¼M), as assessed by a low-speed centrifugation assay. P, pellet; S, supernatant. Under such conditions, the bulk of K5-K14 is retrieved in the supernatant when assembled at pH 7.4, and in the pellet when assembled at pH 7.0. Addition of His-T14 at a 1:4 stoichiometry partially inhibits the low pH induced sedimentation. Paradoxically, adding His-T14 at a higher stoichiometry (1:1.5) has no effect.</p>

        <p>The outcome of the binding studies predicts that an excess of purified His-T14 should inhibit the gelation of keratin filaments induced by lower pH or added salt. We tested His-T14:keratin stoichiometries ranging from 1:8 to 3:1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> Bâ²). Bundle formation was scored through a low-speed centrifugation assay (10,000 Ã <italic>g</italic>, 20 min). In the absence of His-T14 and at pH 7.0, virtually all of the K5âK14 pool is retrieved in the pellet fraction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). Adding His-T14 at low stoichiometry (i.e., 1:4) caused a redistribution of wt K5âK14 to the supernatant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). This effect was not seen at the higher concentrations of His-T14 tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). The reasons for this observation are unclear. These studies show that addition of the His-T14 can partially inhibit the gelation of wt K5âK14 induced by low pH under some conditions.</p>

        <title>The K14 tail domain associates with keratin filaments in epithelial cells in culture</title>
        <p>We performed transient transfection assays with constructs in which the K14 tail domain is fused to a myc epitope tag. In PtK2 cells, an epithelial cell line that displays keratin and vimentin IF networks, Myc-T14 is detected in the cytoplasm, where it occurs as a filamentous pattern, as well as in the nucleus, where it does not exhibit any pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Double-immunofluorescence staining shows that in the cytoplasm, the signal for myc-T14 colocalizes with K8âK18 filaments to a significant extent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A</xref>â², Aâ³, Bâ², and Bâ³), but not with vimentin IFs (unpublished data). The best instances of colocalization involved bundles of keratin filaments whose shape and organization are reminiscent of stress fibers. Dual immunostaining of untransfected PtK2 cells for F-actin and K8âK18 shows that the two types of filaments are closely apposed in a significant fraction of cells, indicating that this phenomenon is not a function of myc-T14 expression (unpublished data). Myc-T14 may thus show a greater affinity for a specific subset of keratin filaments, or weakly promote the formation of straight K8âK18 bundles. Alternatively, this observation may simply stem from the sensitivity of the assay. Transfected myc-PTE1, used as a control, exhibits a punctate cytoplasmic pattern that is independent from keratin filaments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, CâCâ³).

Myc immunostaining (A and B) localizes to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where it occurs in a fibrous pattern that coaligns to a significant extent with the endogenous keratin filament network (A' and B'), as shown in the merged images (A'' and B''). (CâC'') Expression of myc-PTE1 in Ptk2 cells. Myc immunostaining (C) shows a puncate pattern in the cytoplasm that is clearly distinct from the endogenous keratin filament network (C' and C''). (DâD'' and EâE'') Coexpression of K5, K14, along with either myc-T14 (DâD'') or myc-PTE1 (EâE'') in BHK-21 cells. Myc-T14 distributes to both the nucleus (N) and the cytoplasm; in this latter instance, it colocalizes with keratin polymers (D' and D''). In contrast, the localization of Myc-PTE1 (E) and keratin polymers (E') are clearly distinct (E'').</p>

        <p>We next performed triple transfection assays in BHK-21 fibroblasts, a cell line that does not contain any keratin filaments. In cells coexpressing K5, K14, and Myc-T14, there is a significant spatial correspondence between the signals for myc and for K14 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>, DâDâ³). Again, a significant fraction of the myc signal is localized to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). In contrast, the transfected myc-PTE1 localizes both to the nucleus and cytoplasm, but is clearly distinct from K5âK14 filaments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, EâEâ³). We conclude that the nonhelical tail domain of K14 can specifically bind keratin filaments in the cytoplasm of various cell lines in culture.</p>

        <title>The K14 tail domain interacts with type I keratin sequences in a yeast two-hybrid screen</title>
        <p>In an effort to isolate tail domain binding proteins, the COOH termini of both human K14 and K16 were used as baits in a yeast two-hybrid screen involving a human cDNA library made from a squamous cell carcinoma of the leg. Among 2,000,000 cfus screened with the K14 tail domain, 121 scored positive for both growth on His-minus medium and <italic>lacZ</italic> expression. Among the 40 clones sequenced, 32 (80%) corresponded to type I keratin sequences, and an additional 2 clones corresponded to a keratin-related sequence. The 5â² boundary of all the interacting type I keratin clones is given in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A. These findings can be interpreted in two ways. First, the K14 tail domain binds multiple sites along type I keratin sequences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Some of these sites would be shared among them (i.e., linker L12), and others potentially unique (e.g., the head domain of K14). Second, the tail domain binds a restricted number of sites, perhaps a single one, located within the COOH-terminal half of the rod domain of many type I sequences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). In this case, the heterogeneity observed at the 5â² end would reflect the manner with which the reverse transcriptase operated while making the library. Of note, all type I sequences contained at least coil 2 from the rod, and no type II keratin clones were pulled out. Among 3,500,000 cfus screened with the K16 tail domain, 581 scored positive. Among 143 clones that were sequenced, 132 encoded elongation factor 1 Î³, and none encoded a keratin. The complete results of this screen will be published elsewhere. Meanwhile, these studies provide genetic evidence that K14's tail domain, but not K16's, can bind sequence determinant(s) shared by several type I keratins. These findings are interesting given the functional differences observed between K14 and K16 in the context of a protein replacement study in transgenic mouse skin (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Paladini and Coulombe, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Wawersik and Coulombe, 2000</xref>). These differences are, in part, due to the COOH-terminal 105 amino acids in these two homologous type I keratins. We have rheological evidence that suspensions of K5âK16 filaments are mechanically weaker than K5âK14 ones when prepared and tested under bundling-promoting conditions (unpublished data).</p>

<bold>Outcome of yeast two-hybrid screen and model for tail domain-mediated bundling.</bold> (A) List of keratin sequences found to interact with the K14 tail domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen. All are type I keratins. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal boundary of the individual clones, and the domain to which it maps to (B), are indicated. Full-length human K14 exhibits 472 amino acid residues. (B) Schematic depicting the secondary structure of type I keratin proteins. The central rod domain is dominated by Î±-helical subsegments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) separated by short linker regions (L1, L12, and L2). The rod is flanked by nonhelical head and tail domains at the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-termini. (C) Modeling the interaction mediated by the K14 tail domain between two closely apposed keratin filaments. Coiled-coil heterodimers involving K5 and K14 are depicted near the filament-filament interface. For the sake of clarity, the nonhelical head domains of K5 and K14 and the tail domain of K5 are omitted, whereas the subdomain 1A of K5 is shown in black. An antiparallel tetramer (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann and Aebi, 1998</xref>) is shown in filament 1. It should be noted that, on average, mature cytoplasmic IFs are comprised of 16 dimers in cross-section, that the coiled-coil central rod domain is 42â44 nm long, whereas the filaments themselves are 10â12 nm wide (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann and Aebi, 1998</xref>). Individual elements are therefore not drawn to scale in this schematic. On average, 16 copies of the K14 tail domain should be present per 44â50-nm filament length. We postulate that a subset of these copies of the K14 tail domain are surface-exposed and engaged in a direct interaction with type I keratins in subunits from a closely apposed neighboring filament (*). These interactions would assist in the process of keratin filament bundling. The portion of the â¼50 residueâlong K14 tail domain mediating those interactions is unknown, but steric considerations along with lack of sequence homology with K16 suggest that it should reside within the distal half of the sequence. Reversible changes in the balance of charges (i.e., through phosphorylation) and other factors (i.e., associated proteins) are postulated to influence the stability of filamentâfilament interactions mediated by the exposed tail domains, and hence modulate self-induced bundling.</p>

        <title>Defining a role for the nonhelical tail domain of keratins</title>
        <p>The properties of the nonhelical tail domain of cytoplasmic IF proteins have been studied through mutagenesis. The consensus that emerged is that the tail domain contributes to the lateral growth and stability of filaments, and influences filamentâfilament interactions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann and Aebi, 1998</xref>). The tail domain of many type I keratins is not required for complete copolymerization with a type II keratin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albers and Fuchs, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Coulombe et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hatzfeld and Weber, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Lu and Lane, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bader et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>). Limited proteolysis studies in vitro (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann and Aebi, 1998</xref>) and accessibility to kinases in vivo (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Omary et al., 1998</xref>) suggest that the tail domain of IF proteins is exposed at the filament surface. Extensive bundling of K5âK14 filaments in vitro can be promoted by small changes in the assembly buffer conditions (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). Here we show that this depends, in part, on the presence of the tail domain of K14. We provide biochemical and genetic evidence that the isolated tail domain behaves like a keratin binding protein, with an affinity comparable to that of most F-actin cross-linkers (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Matsudaira, 1994</xref>). We propose a model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C) in which the nonhelical tail domain of K14 (and possibly other keratins) contributes to the ability of keratin filaments to self-organize into bundles. Such interactions are postulated to assist in keratin organization and function in vivo. In support of this model, a frameshift mutation resulting in the loss of the COOH-terminal 21 residues in K1 was recently implicated in a failure of keratin filaments to bundle in differentiating epidermal keratinocytes, giving rise to a rare variant of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Sprecher et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>The binding site(s) for the K14 tail domain on the keratin polymer is displayed by K5âK14, K5âK14ÎT, and K8âK18 filaments, and may be shared by several type I keratins (as suggested by the yeast two-hybrid screen). Electrostatic forces may well play a role in these interactions, as filamentâfilament contacts can be modulated by changes in pH and in salt conditions. Filaggrin, a known keratin cross-linker, binds keratin filaments via electrostatic interactions (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Mack et al., 1993</xref>). Likewise, the 50-residue-long IF binding motif contained within the tail domain of plectin is rich in basic residues (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Nikolic et al., 1996</xref>). Given the estimate of â¼700 keratin monomers per Î¼m of filament length (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann and Aebi, 1998</xref>), only a subset of polymer-bound tail domains need be exposed and involved in these interactions to account for a filament cross-bridging effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). Additional studies are needed to define the binding sites and mechanism(s) involved, determine whether this applies to other keratin polymers, and assess the importance of this phenomenon for the mechanical scaffolding function of keratin polymers in vivo.</p>

The linear equilibrium values of the elastic modulus Gâ² (Ï) and loss (viscous) modulus Gâ³(Ï) of the suspensions were measured by setting oscillatory strain amplitude at Î³ = 1% and sweeping from low to high frequency Ï. Strain-dependent viscoelastic moduli were measured by subjecting polymers to three cycles of deformation of increasing amplitude at 1 rad/sec<sup>â1</sup>; Gâ² and Gâ³ were computed from the maximum magnitude of the measured stress. To assess strain hardening, we conducted assays in which the stress was continuously monitored as eight cycles of oscillatory shear deformation were applied (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2001</xref>).
