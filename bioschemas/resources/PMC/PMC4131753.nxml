      <abstract>
        <p id="P4">The contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations to human disease remains poorly understood. Whole genome sequencing can identify all non-coding variants, yet discrimination of causal regulatory mutations represents a formidable challenge. We used epigenomic annotation in hESC-derived embryonic pancreatic progenitor cells to guide the interpretation of whole genome sequences from patients with isolated pancreatic agenesis. This uncovered six different recessive mutations in a previously uncharacterized ~400bp sequence located 25kb downstream of <italic>PTF1A (pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a)</italic> in ten families with pancreatic agenesis. We show that this region acts as a developmental enhancer of <italic>PTF1A</italic> and that the mutations abolish enhancer activity. These mutations are the most common cause of isolated pancreatic agenesis. Integrating genome sequencing and epigenomic annotation in a disease-relevant cell type can uncover novel non-coding elements underlying human development and disease.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P5">Most patients with syndromic pancreatic agenesis have heterozygous dominant mutations in <italic>GATA6<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></italic>. Extra-pancreatic features in these individuals include cardiac malformations, biliary tract defects, gut and other endocrine abnormalities. Four families have been reported with syndromic pancreatic agenesis with severe neurological features and cerebellar agenesis caused by recessive coding mutations in <italic>PTF1A</italic><sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Most cases of isolated, non-syndromic pancreatic agenesis remain unexplained with the only cause described being recessive coding mutations in <italic>PDX1</italic> that have been reported in two families<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We previously noted that individuals with unexplained pancreatic agenesis were often born to consanguineous parents and rarely had extra-pancreatic features<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. This suggested an autosomal recessive defect underlying isolated pancreatic agenesis.</p>
    <p id="P6">To identify recessive mutations causing isolated pancreatic agenesis we used linkage and whole genome sequencing. Initially we performed homozygosity mapping in 6 affected and 1 unaffected subject from 3 unrelated consanguineous families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This highlighted a single shared locus on chromosome 10 that included <italic>PTF1A</italic>, but mutations in coding and promoter sequences of <italic>PTF1A</italic> and the coding sequences of 24 other genes in the region were excluded by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We next performed whole genome sequencing on probands from the two families with multiple affected individuals. We first looked for homozygous coding mutations in the exomes of the two whole genome sequenced patients. Each patient had ~ 3.6 million variants, from which we filtered out any that were present in 81 control genomes or that were present at &gt;1% frequency in the 1000 Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. This left a total of 2,868 and 3,188 rare or novel homozygous SNVs and indels per patient. Of these, 8 and 19 were annotated as missense, nonsense, frameshift or essential splice site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). However, these coding variants either did not co-segregate with the disease or were not considered plausible candidates for a role in pancreas development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">We next searched for non-coding disease-causing mutations among the remaining candidate homozygous variants. We reasoned that any causal variants should disrupt a non-coding genomic element that is active in cells that are relevant to this disease. As isolated pancreatic agenesis must be the result of a defect in early pancreas development, we determined if any of the rare or novel homozygous variants in these patients mapped to active regulatory regions from pancreatic endoderm cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We thus defined 6,109 embryonic pancreatic progenitor putative transcriptional enhancers that were enriched in H3K4me1, a post-translational histone modification that is associated with enhancer regions, and were also bound by two or more pancreatic developmental transcription factors that are known to be essential for early pancreas development. Seven homozygous variants from each patient occurred in one of these annotated non-coding regions. However, only one of the 6,109 regulatory regions contained a variant in both sequenced individuals, and it was the same variant in the two unrelated patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). This variant, chr10:23508437A&gt;G, was located ~25kb downstream of <italic>PTF1A</italic>, in the region previously identified by homozygosity mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The novel variant occurred in a short (~400bp) evolutionary conserved region that showed enrichment for enhancer marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac), and was bound by the transcription factors FOXA2 and PDX1 in hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Remarkably, this region lacked active chromatin features in 68 embryonic and adult cell types from the Epigenome RoadMap project and in 125 cell types from the ENCODE project (which includes an adult pancreatic exocrine cell line) indicating that it is specifically active in pancreatic embryonic progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). A combination of whole genome sequencing and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory annotations therefore identified a recessive mutation that mapped to a putative stage- and lineage-restricted transcriptional enhancer.</p>
    <p id="P8">We sequenced this putative pancreatic developmental enhancer in 19 additional probands with pancreatic agenesis of unknown aetiology (9 with extra-pancreatic features and 10 isolated cases) and identified recessive mutations in 7 of the 10 patients with non-syndromic pancreatic agenesis. We also identified a homozygous mutation in one patient with pancreatic agenesis and intrahepatic cholestatic failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Of the 10 probands with mutations in this element, 6 had the same chr10:23508437A&gt;G mutation as part of a shared extended haplotype (minimal shared haplotype of 1.2Mb; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Three of the remaining probands had different base substitution mutations: a homozygous chr10:23508363A&gt;G mutation, a homozygous chr10:23508305A&gt;G mutation and compound heterozygous chr10:23508365A&gt;G/chr10:23508446A&gt;C mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In the tenth family a 7.6kb deletion was identified by long range PCR, and sequence analysis showed that the deleted region (chr10:23502416-23510031) included the entire putative enhancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Testing of parents and siblings demonstrated co-segregation of the mutations with diabetes and exocrine insufficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). None of the mutations were present in 1092 individuals from the 1000 genomes project<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> or in dbSNP137, and Sanger sequencing of 299 controls did not detect any of these variants. The deletion was not observed in the Database of Genomic Variants<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. There is very little diversity in humans within this element; the only 3 variants reported in dbSNP137 or the 1000 genomes project are rare (&lt;0.2% allele frequency). These results provide overwhelming genetic evidence that we have identified mutations causing non-syndromic pancreatic agenesis in a non-coding genomic region that is likely to be a transcriptional enhancer during pancreas development.</p>
    <p id="P10">We next tested whether this previously uncharacterized non-coding element acts as a developmental enhancer of <italic>PTF1A</italic>. We linked the wild type sequence to a minimal promoter and performed luciferase assays in human pancreatic progenitor cells, which demonstrated lineage-specific enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The enhancer was not active in adult exocrine pancreatic cell lines, consistent with a stage-specific regulatory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To assess if this enhancer truly targets <italic>PTF1A</italic>, we performed chromatin conformation capture (3C) experiments. This demonstrated that the enhancer region establishes direct interactions with the <italic>PTF1A</italic> promoter in human pancreatic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">We next demonstrated that the five base-substitution mutations prevent enhancer activity by abolishing transcription factor binding. We noted that three of the mutations disrupt binding sites for FOXA2 and a fourth disrupts a binding site for PDX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). FOXA2 and PDX1 are essential transcription factors for pancreatic development<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that these four mutations abolished binding of FOXA2 or PDX1, as predicted, whereas the remaining point mutation disrupted the affinity of an uncharacterized sequence-specific DNA-binding protein present in mouse pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, all five mutations disrupted the enhancer activity of this region in hESC-derived human pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Collectively, these findings show that multiple mutations causing isolated pancreas agenesis disrupt the function of a previously unrecognized enhancer that targets <italic>PTF1A</italic> in human embryonic pancreatic progenitor cells.</p>
    <p id="P12">The contribution of non-coding variants to human disease remains poorly understood. There are examples of mutations in distal regulatory elements causing monogenic disease<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, but the number is small compared to coding mutations. Although whole genome sequencing technologies can potentially solve this problem, the discrimination of functional non-coding causal variants amongst millions of non-coding variants present in each individual remains a formidable challenge. The ENCODE project has recently uncovered functional elements throughout the non-coding genome, leading to expectations that these can be integrated with genome sequencing to discover causal non-coding mutations<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Our study now provides an example that validates this expectation, and shows that recessively inherited distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations in a novel developmental enhancer are the most common cause of a rare Mendelian disease. The fact that the mutated regulatory element was exclusive to embryonic pancreatic progenitors among a broad panel of adult and embryonic tissues highlights the importance of analyzing disease-relevant genomic annotations. Our results support efforts to identify novel regulatory element mutations in monogenic disorders by integrating genome sequencing data with functional annotation from projects such as ENCODE<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the Epigenome Roadmap<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These findings may also be relevant for future efforts to discover causal alleles in common non-Mendelian diseases, where many susceptibility variants appear to lie outside coding regions<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P13">In summary, we have demonstrated that mutation of a novel, distal, developmental enhancer of <italic>PTF1A</italic> is a common cause of isolated pancreatic agenesis in humans and demonstrate the potential of integrating genome sequencing with epigenomics to identify mutations in novel regulatory elements that cause disease.</p>

        <title>Epigenome annotation of variants from genome sequencing identifies a shared variant in a putative enhancer element</title>
        <p>Variant identified by whole genome sequencing, plus an additional five variants in patients with pancreatic agenesis map to a 25 Kb region downstream of <italic>PTF1A</italic>, which contains a single candidate pancreatic progenitor-specific enhancer within a highly conserved 400bp element. The top panel depicts ChIP-seq density plots for the enhancer mark H3K4me1, the second and third show occupancy for FOXA2 and PDX1. A broad panel of embryonic and adult human tissues do not show active chromatin marks in this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Vertebrate Conservation and mammalian conservation tracks (as measured by the GERP Score) tracks illustrate the high conservation of this element. The red line depicts the approximate location of a 7.6 kb deletion in this region, and red arrows indicate point mutations, using the final 3 digits from the hg19 coordinates as labels (referring to positions 23508305A&gt;G, 23508363A&gt;G, 23508365A&gt;G, 23508437A&gt;G and 23508446A&gt;C on chromosome 10 respectively).</p>

        <title>Pancreas agenesis mutations disrupt the function of a transcriptional enhancer that is specifically active in pancreatic progenitors</title>
        <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reporter assays for the novel enhancer in hESC-derived pancreatic endoderm progenitors, several adult pancreatic exocrine transformed cells (Panc-1, 266-6, AR42J) and HeLa cells. Transcriptional enhancer activity was only observed in hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells, and it was disrupted by all 5 mutations. Asterisks indicate Studentâs t test P&lt;0.05 for comparisons of mutant vs. wild type enhancers in progenitors. (<bold>B</bold>) Chromosome conformation capture shows that the newly identified enhancer interacts directly with <italic>PTF1A</italic> promoter in hES cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells. The viewpoint at <italic>PTF1A</italic> is signaled with an arrow, and the approximate regions that were tested for interaction with the viewpoint (C1, C2, C3, and P, for <italic>PTF1A</italic> promoter) are shown in (<bold>C</bold>). C4 represents a control region in an unrelated locus. (<bold>C</bold>) Pancreas agenesis mutations target critical residues in predicted binding sites for pancreatic regulators FOXA2 and PDX1. (<bold>D</bold>) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showing high affinity, sequence-specific interaction of FOXA2 with a double stranded oligonucleotide containing the wild type (WT) sequence, but not the 363 A&gt;G mutation (MUT). The retardation signal was suppressed by unlabelled consensus high-affinity binding site for FOXA2, and supershifted with antibodies recognizing FOXA2. Black triangles represent competition gradients of 30 and 100-fold cold probe excess. Binding activity is shown for MIN6 cells and dissected pancreatic buds from e12.5 mouse embryos. Probe refers to the radioactively labelled probed used in binding assays. (<bold>E</bold>) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showing sequence-specific interaction of PDX1 with oligonucleotide containing the wild type (WT) sequence, but not the 446 A&gt;C mutation (MUT). The retardation signal was suppressed by unlabelled consensus high-affinity binding site for PDX1, and supershifted with antibodies recognizing PDX1. Competition was performed with 100-fold cold probe excess. Binding activity is shown for MIN6 cells and pancreatic buds from e11.5 mouse embryos.</p>
