        <p>Perforin (PFN) is a pore-forming protein produced by cytotoxic lymphocytes that aids in the clearance of tumor or virus-infected cells by a mechanism that involves the formation of transmembrane pores. The properties of PFN pores and the mechanism of their assembly remain unclear. Here, we studied pore characteristics by functional and structural methods to show that perforin forms pores more heterogeneous than anticipated. Planar lipid bilayer experiments indicate that perforin pores exhibit a broad range of conductances, from 0.15 to 21 nanosiemens. In comparison with large pores that possessed low noise and remained stably open, small pores exhibited high noise and were very unstable. Furthermore, the opening step and the pore size were dependent on the lipid composition of the membrane. The heterogeneity in pore sizes was confirmed with cryo-electron microscopy and showed a range of sizes matching that observed in the conductance measurements. Furthermore, two different membrane-bound PFN conformations were observed, interpreted as pre-pore and pore states of the protein. The results collectively indicate that PFN forms heterogeneous pores through a multistep mechanism and provide a new paradigm for understanding the range of different effects of PFN and related membrane attack complex/perforin domain proteins observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells provide an essential line of defense by eliminating pathogen-infected and tumor cells through a process called granule-mediated apoptosis. This phenomenon involves the secretion of PFN<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN9"><sup>10</sup></xref> postulated to aid the intracellular delivery of granule-associated proteases (granzymes) resulting in the death of the target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). How this delivery is achieved is subject to intense debate. Broadly, there are two alternative models as follows: either PFN forms pores at the cell membrane through which granzymes are delivered directly or PFN forms pores in endosomes containing granzymes and thereby delivers them to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Nevertheless, the ability of PFN to perforate the target membranes by transmembrane pores is central to each model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>PFN is a multidomain protein. The largest portion, including around two-thirds of the molecule starting from the N terminus, is the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). PFN also contains an epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF) of an unknown function and a C2 domain at the C terminus, which is needed for calcium-dependent binding to lipid membranes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.169417/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The structure of the MACPF domain is strikingly similar to the pore-forming domain of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) protein family from Gram-positive bacteria, and it is therefore believed that both protein families use a similar mechanism for transmembrane pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). CDCs are important pathogenicity factors, and prominent members of the family include pneumolysin from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, perfringolysin (<italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>), streptolysin (<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>), and listeriolysin (<italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). CDCs form pores by inserting a huge Î²-barrel across the membrane, each monomer contributing two transmembrane Î²-hairpins that refold from six Î±-helices within domain 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.169417/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1, <italic>CâE</italic></ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These crucial structural elements are conserved between CDC and MACPF domains and are deployed after oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Baran <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) have described two amino acid residues that participate in oligomerization of monomers after PFN binds to the membrane. It has been conclusively shown that CDCs form pores by a two-stage mechanism. First, the protein oligomerizes into a pre-pore state; second, a pore forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). There is good evidence that pre-pores and pores can be either complete ring-shaped oligomers or incomplete arc-shaped ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The inner diameter of the PFN pore was determined to be 7â16 nm when measured by the electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and incomplete rings (so-called arcs) were observed adjacent to completely oligomerized PFN pores (rings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Because the inner pore diameter obtained by photobleaching or electrophysiological methods also ranged from 5 to 10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the existence of pleomorphic oligomeric states emphasizes that the exact molecular mechanism of PFN pore formation remains poorly understood.</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanism of PFN pore formation, we have conducted a detailed study using several model membrane systems, clearly showing that native human PFN forms pores of heterogeneous size. The data are consistent with direct insertion of the full ring-shaped pre-pore complex into the lipid bilayer as a pore, as well as the assembly of a transmembrane pore by oligomerization of monomers to an incompletely formed protein channel (an arc) that can form a pore, on membrane insertion, at a protein-lipid interface. The data convincingly show that pore assembly and insertion into the membrane are modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane and that PFN pores have two very distinctive alternative states, either with noisy or noise-free conductance, and with some pores appearing to expand in size while active. We also image two different oligomeric conformations of membrane-bound PFN, which indicate that it can exist in both pre-pore and pore states, validating a CDC-like two-stage mechanism of membrane interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Native human PFN was isolated as described by Froelich <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

Liposomes were used immediately after preparation. PFN was added to liposomes at a final concentration of 10â20 ng/Î¼l and incubated at either room temperature or 37 Â°C. If at the latter temperature, then the liposomes and PFN were individually preincubated at 37 Â°C. Incubation times varied from 5 s to 5 min. The number of pores was accentuated by longer incubations and 37 Â°C temperature. As a control for the effect of PFN itself, we incubated a mixture of PFN buffer and LUVs at the same ratios used with PFN present.

The use of fluorescent microscopy enabled us to monitor the movement of fluorescent dextran molecules co-administered with PFN into the GUVs when at least 100 Î¼<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, no permeabilization of GUVs was observed, and spontaneous passage of probes into the GUV in the absence of PFN was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). The presence of PFN at 12 n<sc>m</sc> final concentration caused rapid filling of the whole GUV when low molecular weight fluorescent dextrans (Alexa-dextran 3000 (D3) or FITC-dextran 4000 (D4) with hydrodynamic radii of â¼1.4 nm) were in the surrounding medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>).

The flux of high molecular weight fluorescent dextrans (Oregon Green- or FITC-labeled dextran 70,000 (D70) with hydrodynamic radii of 6 nm) into GUVs was insignificant even with prolonged incubation for 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). No further changes in the number of permeabilized GUVs were observed with prolonged incubation for any of the probes tested.

The influx of the intermediate probe (Alexa- or FITC-labeled dextran 10,000 (D10) with hydrodynamic radius of â¼1.8 nm) was slower than that of the small probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>), but nevertheless, approximately half of the vesicles were filled with this probe after 45 min. After that time, we did not observe any further changes in the number of permeabilized GUVs indicating that 45 min is a sufficient time period for formation of functional PFN pores on GUV membranes and for passage of D10 into the interior of permeabilized GUVs. These results clearly show that medium size probes, such as D10, which have a similar size to granzyme B, can also pass through the pores, but the physiological relevance of this direct transfer is questionable because diffusion of such molecules through the pore is relatively slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). When both small and intermediate probes were used, we could clearly discriminate vesicles that were filled with either probe or only the small one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>), indicating that some of the pores formed on the GUV membrane were not of sufficient size to allow the passage of the intermediate probe.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>GUVs are rapidly permeabilized in the presence of PFN.</bold> <italic>A,</italic> GUVs in the absence or presence of 48 n<sc>m</sc> PFN and different fluorescent probes after 45 min incubation at room temperature. <italic>Scale bar,</italic> 20 Î¼m. <italic>B,</italic> time courses of GUVs filling with D3 and D10 in the presence and absence of 12 n<sc>m</sc> PFN.

Because PFN readily formed pores in all tested lipid compositions, a preferential lipid requirement was not apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Nevertheless, substantial differences in current traces were noted, consistent with the gradual opening of individual pores as well as well resolved stepwise openings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Gradual current increases with nonresolved step-like jumps were observed on DPhPC and DOPC membranes and where 20% of CHO was added to DOPC membranes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>inset i,</italic> for the representative trace on DPhPC membrane). Gradual increases of this kind were not seen in similar experiments with CDCs. In these experiments, it was difficult to resolve individual pore apertures, and the pore size estimate was obtained from results of single channel experiments (see below). In contrast, POPC membranes containing various concentrations of CHO enabled stepwise increases in currents, which were very clear at high CHO concentrations. For example, the opening of individual pores could be easily discriminated with a membrane consisting of POPC/CHO, 1:1 (mol/mol) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>inset ii,</italic> for a representative trace).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Conductance traces reveal diverse mechanisms of PFN pore formation.</bold> <italic>A,</italic> graph showing that PFN pores exhibit a wide range of conductances and current noise values.

The observed distribution of single channel conductances is slightly larger than reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This broad distribution strongly suggests the co-presence of pores, ranging in size from 2 to 22 nm in diameter (as estimated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">Equation 3</xref>). It appears that larger pores predominated in membranes with lipid compositions that favor opening of discrete pores, <italic>i.e.</italic> POPC, POPC/CHO (4:1), and POPC/CHO (1:1) membranes lacked pores that displayed conductances &lt;1 nS. On the other hand, smaller pores were frequent on the bilayers composed of DPhPC, DOPC, and DOPC/CHO (4:1).</p><p>We also noted that PFN pores that assembled on various membranes possessed distinct levels of current noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Small pores (G &lt;2 nS) were always associated with high noise and exhibited a generally unstable character. The current traces were often associated with sudden stepwise increases or decreases and sometimes they completely closed (see <italic>pores 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). Larger pores (G &gt;2 nS) possessed slightly lower noise (<italic>pores 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>); however, some were associated with a very low noise current trace (<italic>pores 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). These pores possessed conductances between 5 and 14 nS and were stable for up to 1 h. The calculated diameter of such low noise pores was 11â18 nm corresponding to ring-shaped pores observed by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>By arbitrarily clustering pores into three groups, small high noise (G &lt;2 nS) and large (G &gt;2 nS) with either high or low noise, we also determined some of the properties of pores on the DPhPC bilayer. As observed by the linear current-voltage relationship for the three groups, PFN pores were not voltage-dependent. Minor rectification at negative voltages was observed only for the small pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). As expected for large aqueous transmembrane channels, PFN pores were poorly selective. However, the selectivity of small pores was slightly anionic, although larger pores displayed a slightly cationic preference regardless of their noise level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>). The pneumococcal CDC, pneumolysin, similarly exhibits a wide range of conductances, where small pores are cation-selective, although large pores are unselective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>We also noted that the formation and stability of large pores were highly dynamic. For example, more than 80% of the openings of larger pores with low noise were preceded by smaller increases in current displaying high noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref>, <italic>pore <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>,</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic>A</italic>). In most instances, the noise stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>) and then remained constant for up to 1 h. On rare occasions, the stable low noise pore (possibly a double-arc pore, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>pore 4</italic>, and under âDiscussionâ) appeared to undergo disassembly causing a sudden reduction in current associated with an increase in noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). When the current spontaneously returned to the previous level, the noise also returned to the former level suggesting restoration of a purely proteinaceous pore. The fact that the same conductance is found in a membrane before and after a period of lower, noisier conductance suggests that a single pore has broken up into a more disordered arrangement before reforming an ordered one. This is in striking distinction to the CDCs where pores open once and do not fluctuate in this manner.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Several examples of pores exhibiting variable noise.</bold> <italic>A,</italic> openings of large pores were frequently preceded by smaller increases in conductance.

The size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>) resembles the distribution of single channel conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>) but lacking small pores. We suspect that PFN pores smaller than 10 nm are too small to be detected by cryo-EM. This range of sizes is wider than described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) but in line with pores formed by arcs and possibly between two arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To seek a more focused classification, we limited our assessment of image similarity to one side of the pore-like oligomeric structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>boxed</italic>, and results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>). This allowed us to view two clearly different PFN structures bound to the membrane surface as follows: one in which the molecule has a comma-like shape (19 images in class) and its head is cocked back, and the other in which the molecule is more linear and seems to stand upright above the membrane (22 images in class). As shown, focusing our classification on one side of the oligomer not only sharpened the clarity with which we could see the PFN subunit profile, but it also smeared out the other half of the structure. This underscores the diversity of pore diameters in the images (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.169417/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2</ext-link>) and has allowed us to pinpoint two different membrane-bound states of PFN. It is notable that the comma-shaped conformation is associated with an unbroken lipid membrane (it is pre-pore), but the upright conformation is associated with a hole through the membrane, the PFN pore. A subset of 34 of the images, which aligned with respect to one side of the oligomer, did classify together to show a symmetrical pore-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>), which would correspond to larger pores (conductances 11â14 nS) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>. This demonstrates that some symmetrical structures of this kind exist because we avoided the possible effect of model bias by only aligning one side of the pore data to a reference image, yet we considered both sides in statistical analysis of image features to produce the average shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>. Even so, alignment and classification on the basis of one side of the oligomer alone produced the best images of PFN bound to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>F</italic>). Surface rendering of these by application of rotational symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>G</italic>) permitted the fitting of homology models of the PFN MACPF, EGF, and C2 domains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.169417/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>), showing the dimensions of the pore match those expected for the molecule. As is also the case with CDCs, the comma-shaped (pre-pore) state matches better the MACPF domain shape than the upright (pore) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). This is consistent with what is known about the mechanism of MACPF/CDC superfamily proteins, because it suggests the refolding and extension of the pore-forming MACPF/CDC helical regions that insert into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) on PFN pre-pore-to-pore transition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M110.169417/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Two models exist currently to explain the protein delivery function of PFN. The first involves formation of stable, albeit transiently functional, plasma membrane pores that allow the direct transfer of granzymes into the target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). This model is based primarily on visualization of pore-like structures on the membranes of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In this study, we show that native human perforin forms heterogeneous pores on lipid membranes, and cryo-EM for the first time enabled monitoring of a pre-pore intermediate, which sits atop an unperturbed membrane. Although heterogeneity was noted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), the use of single-channel PLM experiments and cryo-EM indicate that it is much larger than thought previously. Larger pores are most likely fully assembled ring-shaped pores, in agreement with the dimensions of the pore shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>, and those larger than the ring are perhaps two fused arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Smaller pores are in our opinion the incomplete but nevertheless functional arc-shaped pores, which have been postulated for cholesterol-dependent cytolysins also.</p><p>Several models of pore formation exist for the related CDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), where complete oligomerization of monomers into the pre-pore was shown to occur prior to pore formation for perfringolysin O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The pre-pore complex inserts into the membrane in a single step, and discrete stepwise openings were indeed observed in a planar lipid bilayer setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). On the other hand, CDC oligomers are predicted to form incomplete arcs that are supposed to be functional. Arcs are viewed as transmembrane pores lined by a protein oligomer on one side and lipids on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Previously, we proposed a model in which the nature of the pore depends on the local concentration of monomer such that limiting levels predispose to pore formation by arcs rather than rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, depending on such variables as protein concentration and the lipid composition of the membrane, functional transmembrane arcs, double-arc pores, or fully assembled ring-shaped pores may be formed by CDC oligomers. Some of the electrophysiological data are in agreement with this model. For example, it was shown that pneumolysin generates multiple conductance pores in the membranes of nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Similarly, planar lipid bilayer experiments of a CDC from <italic>Bacillus sphaericus</italic> showed gradual as well as stepwise increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The electrophysiological data reported here agree with these possibilities suggesting that PFN may also exist in different pore states.</p><p>The current traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and the variability in the pore size and noise level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) not only suggest the existence of multiple PFN pore states but also indicate that distinct mechanisms are responsible for their formation. Current traces with high noise indicate small pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>pores 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>) or large transmembrane arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>pores 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>,). The inherent noise of such pores may be due to the less rigid structure of arcs and the presence of flexible and dynamic lipids as part of the actual pore boundary. Extremely large increases in current are probably caused by formation of double-arc pores by fusion of two arcs within the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>pore 4</italic>). Fully assembled pores appear to form by maturation of previously inserted arcs to a final stable ring-shaped proteinaceous pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>), but it can also be formed instantaneously by the insertion of a fully assembled ring-shaped pre-pore complex into the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>pores 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>). Thus, our results are in accordance with both the âgrowing arcsâ and the âpre-pore to pore transitionâ model, where composition of lipids and local protein concentration favors one or the other pathway. The sliding increase in conductance seen in some pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic>B</italic>) could be explained by the movement of lipids away from PFN on the membrane, and this could be due to either a direct effect of the pre-pore state or an inserted arc of PFN. Another explanation for the sliding increase in conductance would be the addition of further PFN molecules, either already formed into other oligomeric arcs or from a remaining pool of monomeric protein.</p><p>It is generally accepted that the physical state of the plasma membrane plays an important role in the functioning of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) and can have, in the case of pore-forming peptides and proteins, important consequences on the latter steps in the pore-forming process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). One crucial parameter in protein-lipid interactions is the ordering of lipid acyl chains. The structure of headgroups used in our PLM experiments was identical, but the acyl chains differed with ordering that decreased as follows: POPC &gt; DOPC &gt; DPhPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Our results clearly show that the ordering of the acyl chains influences the mechanism of pore formation, which agrees very well with the known dependence of pore formation on temperature in MACPF/CDC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and the idea that pore formation is a kinetically governed event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Less ordered acyl chains (DPhPC and DOPC) allow the prompt insertion of PFN oligomers, which then may expand by addition of monomers or smaller oligomers or the effect of the membrane-inserted protein on the membrane lipid arrangement. This possibility is manifested in gradual increases of current and occurrence of small pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Lipids with more ordered acyl chains (<italic>e.g.</italic> POPC) minimize the inadvertent insertion of oligomers leading to the preferential formation of a full ring-shaped pre-pore on the membrane surface and thereby a pore. In the next step, the whole complex (complete or nearly completely assembled pre-pore) inserts into the bilayer resulting in a discrete jump in the conductance of such pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>pores 3â6</italic>). Although the presence of CHO did not appear to affect the mechanism of pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), the stepwise current increases were clearest for membranes with the highest CHO content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) with most pores having low noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This agrees with the ability of CHO to promote protein oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) and order acyl chains of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>In summary, by using different model systems with diverse membrane curvature (PLM, LUVs, and GUVs), we show that PFN forms pores that are more heterogeneous than anticipated. In addition to large, ring-shaped pores previously discovered by electron microscopy, we show here that PFN also forms smaller, less stable pores, presumably by lipids closing the gap between the two ends of a PFN arc. The observation of two membrane-bound PFN conformations, one associated with a pore and the other not, indicates that a pre-pore oligomer as well as a pore oligomer can form. However, our data provide evidence for the expansion of pore size after pore formation, which is lacking for CDCs, and therefore shows a difference in mechanism. This is likely to be further complicated by consideration of the mechanisms by which PFN-related proteins facilitate phenotypes such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gliding through cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) and, separately, invasion of insect midgut cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Indeed, the common CDC/MACPF fold seems to have been selected for its membrane-focused activity but not for only one kind of membrane permeabilization event.</p></sec>
