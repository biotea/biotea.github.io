      <abstract>
        <p>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is a vital process that controls distinct cell and organelle functions. Mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1) was identified as key regulator of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) that together with the essential MCU regulator (EMRE) forms the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. However, mechanisms by which MICU1 controls MCU/EMRE activity to tune mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals remain ambiguous. Here we established a live-cell FRET approach and demonstrate that elevations of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rearranges MICU1 multimers with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 4.4âÎ¼M, resulting in activation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. MICU1 rearrangement essentially requires the EF-hand motifs and strictly correlates with the shape of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises. We further show that rearrangements of MICU1 multimers were independent of matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression levels of MCU and EMRE. Our experiments provide novel details about how MCU/EMRE is regulated by MICU1 and an original approach to investigate MCU/EMRE activation in intact cells.</p>

    <p>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake stimulates mitochondrial dehydrogenases and, thus, oxidative phosphorylation, that, ultimately results in increased ATP formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Due to the effective mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer capacity local and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are shaped by mitochondria, thus, these organelles control multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive cell signaling pathways and functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is associated with an increased generation of reactive oxygen species, cell dysfunctions and the induction of cell death pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
    <p>While the phenomenon of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniport is known since the early 1960ties, the identity of key protagonists that actually accomplish and directly regulate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake remained elusive until very recently. In 2011 a 35-kDa protein, which was initially referred to as CCDC109A and then renamed mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) was described to show many if not all of the typical characteristics of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. It has been suggested that MCU, which possesses two transmembrane domains, forms tetrameric highly specific mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Interestingly, these MCU oligomers are part of larger protein complexes of the inner mitochondrial membrane, indicating the existence of complex mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake machineries that include other regulatory subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. While mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 (MCUR1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, leucine zipper/EF hand-containing transmembrane-1 (Letm1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and the novel uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2/3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, which have been shown to contribute to certain modes of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, have not been found in MCU containing protein complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, other types of proteins have been identified and characterized as regulatory components of the MCU machinery. These proteins include the dominant-negative pore-forming subunit MCUb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, the essential MCU regulator (EMRE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and its isoforms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. MICU1, which was identified some months earlier than MCU, has two classical EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domains and forms large complexes of app. 480 kDa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The interaction of MICU1 with MCU is mediated by EMRE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hand domains of MICU1 can undergo large conformational changes upon binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and face the intermembrane space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. MICU1 is a gatekeeper of MCU preventing an increase of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>) at low resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels while it is thought to facilitate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake upon high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Recently, an elegant study determined the crystal structure of MICU1 indicating that in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> MICU1 exists as a hexamer, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the two EF-hands results in a rearrangement to MICU1 dimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. This study provided the first insights into the molecular mechanism by which MICU1 possibly controls MCU/EMRE activity and suggests that the hexameric MICU1 prevents MCU/EMRE Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity that gets released upon (re-)organization of MICU1 hexamers/multimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, whether or not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent rearrangements of MICU1 multimers indeed occur and regulate the activity of MCU in intact cells, and the impact of MCU and EMRE to the structural (re-)organization of MICU1 have not been investigated so far. Hence, the kinetics of the rearrangement of the MICU1 multimers upon cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and whether or not the mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration or membrane potential (Ï<sub>mito</sub>) have an impact on the structural reorganization of MICU1 remain elusive.</p>
    <p>In this study we used a FRET-based live-cell imaging approach to dynamically monitor the kinetics of the structural (re-)organization of MICU1 and to explore its dependence from cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals as well as Ï<sub>mito</sub>. Simultaneous measurements of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> with either mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals or MICU1 rearrangement were performed to verify whether MICU1 multimers indeed retard MCU activation in intact cells. Finally, we tested whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive rearrangement of MICU1 is dependent of the expression level of MCU and EMRE. Our data provide new insights in the dynamics, regulation, and molecular effect of the structural (re-)organization of MICU1 that adds to our current understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms of MCU activation.</p>

        <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations yield rearrangement of MICU1 multimers in intact cells</title>
        <p>In order to dynamically monitor whether and, if so, how intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilization by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- (IP<sub>3</sub>-)generating agonist affects the arrangement of MICU1 in intact cells, FÃ¶rster energy transfer (FRET) imaging was applied in cells co-expressing MICU1 fused to either cyan fluorescent protein (MICU1-CFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (MICU1-YFP). Because MICU1 has been shown to assemble in hexamers in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and rearranges to dimers upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we assumed that under resting conditions the expressed MICU1-CFP and MICU1-YFP chimeras exist as hexamers, thus, facilitating FRET from CFPs to YFPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and its subsequent binding to MICU1 should yield disaggregation of MICU1 hexamers and reduce the inter-MICU1 FRET signal. Indeed, cell treatment with the IP<sub>3</sub>-generating agonist histamine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> considerably reduced the inter-MICU1 FRET ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>), while the agonist had no effect on fluorescence of cells expressing MICU1-YFP alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Upon removal of the agonist the signal was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>), indicating the reassembly of MICU1 to higher multimers upon the decline of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. In the nominal absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the histamine-triggered decrease of inter-MICU1 FRET was more transient and slowly developed upon subsequent addition of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), thus, highlighting that inter-MICU1 FRET strictly follows cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast to the fast intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in response to histamine, slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> only slowly and weakly reduced the inter-MICU1 FRET signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Under this condition mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in response to cell treatment with BHQ was largely increased in cells treated with the 3Â´UTR siRNA against MICU1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), despite an almost unaffected cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These findings indicate that the slow and weak ER depletion with BHQ yields only in insufficient MICU1-rearrangement, while the inhibitory function of MICU1 multimers on MCU remains under these conditions. However, expression of FP tagged MICU1 completely restored the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, using a MICU1 variant mutated in both canonical EF hands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> was neither able to rescue this siRNA mediated effect of MICU1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) nor showed any MICU1 FRET rearrangement upon stimulation with histamine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to determine the affinity of the MICU1 multimers for Ca<sup>2+</sup> to evoke their rearrangement <italic>in situ</italic>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin was used to clamp different cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). These experiments revealed a half maximal effective Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) to trigger rearrangement of the MICU1 multimers of 4.4 (3.7â5.2)âÎ¼M in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Our findings are in line with studies demonstrating the existence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-domains of up to 16âÎ¼M in hot spots between the ER and mitochondria in response to an IP<sub>3</sub>-generating agonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Such Ca<sup>2+</sup> hot spots would efficiently destruct MICU1 multimers and, hence, activate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniport. Our results provide a first demonstration that MICU1 oligomerization is reversibly controlled by high and low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in intact cells.</p>

        <title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered MICU1 de-multimerization occurs prior to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake</title>
        <p>Simultaneous imaging of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in individual single cells using a red-shifted mitochondria targeted cameleon (mtD1GO-Cam) in combination with the near ultra-violet excitable cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor fura-2 was performed in order to compare the kinetics of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. This approach revealed a lag time (ÎT) of 1.50âÂ±â0.08 s between the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise and its transition into the mitochondrial matrix upon intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization by the IP<sub>3</sub>-generating agonist histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The molecular mechanism responsible for this temporal shift between rises of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> is so far unknown. To investigate whether or not the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent de-oligomerization of MICU1 multimers might retard mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, identical experiments were performed in cells transfected with siRNA specifically against MICU1. In these MICU1-diminuted cells the coupling between cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals was greatly improved and the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal followed almost instantly the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation upon histamine stimulation (ÎTâ=â0.93âÂ±â0.05âs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to visualize how the temporal pattern of MICU1 de-oligomerization refers to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we imaged dynamic changes of MICU1 FRET simultaneously with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This approach revealed that MICU1 de-oligomerization is only slightly delayed from the histamine-induced increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and, thus, clearly precedes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Notably, app. 90% of the maximal histamine-induced increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> trigger â¥ 50% of MICU1 de-oligomerization that appears essential to initiate considerable uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). These data dissect the transfer of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> into mitochondria into (at least) four sequential steps: (<italic>i</italic>) cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and transfer into the intermembrane space, (<italic>ii</italic>) binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to MICU1 oligomers, (<italic>iii</italic>) MICU1 de-oligomerization, and (<italic>IV</italic>) activation of the MCU.</p>

        <title>Rearrangement of MICU1 multimers occurs independently of the mitochondrial membrane potential and matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation</title>
        <p>In order to test if the mitochondrial membrane potential (Î¨<sub>mito</sub>) impacts rearrangement of MICU1 multimers, cells were treated with oligomycin and the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) to efficiently depolarize mitochondria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, thus, only very small mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to histamine were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>) approving the loss of Î¨<sub>mito</sub> under these conditions. However, depolarization of mitochondria did neither affect basal MICU1 FRET nor the histamine-triggered reduction of the inter-MICU1 FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These data indicate that the rearrangement of MICU1 multimers upon intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization with an IP<sub>3</sub>-generating agonist occurs independently of Î¨<sub>mito</sub> and the mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation.</p>

        <title>MICU1 multimers rearrange irrespective of the expression level of MCU and EMRE</title>
        <p>MICU1 is known to interact with EMRE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> that represents the second pore forming protein of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> complex beside MCU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, which is regulated by MICU1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. To investigate the importance of EMRE and MCU for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered rearrangement of MICU1 multimers, expression of either EMRE or MCU were diminished by respective verified siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Diminution of the expression of either MCU or EMRE strongly reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) while no effect on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). However, the rearrangement of the MICU1 multimers upon stimulation with histamine was neither affected by knock-down of MCU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>) nor EMRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study describes the dynamics of MICU1 (re-)organization in response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in intact cells. Using the FRET technology we could correlate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced rearrangement of MICU1 multimers with the activation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniport and examined the impact of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Î¨<sub>mito</sub> and the expression levels of MCU and EMRE for MICU1 (re-)organization. Our data highlight that an elevation of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> rearranges MICU1 multimers to smaller complexes in intact cells. These findings are consistent with a recent report showing that recombinant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free MICU1 exists as hexamer and rearranges in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to dimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Hence, our data that point to the existence of large MICU1 complexes that suppresses mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at low cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is in line with previous reports about the inactivity of MCU under resting conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our approach of live-cell monitoring the inter-MICU1 FRET allows the visualization of MICU1 (re-)organization within the intact cell in life-time. Notably, calculation of the changes in MICU1 FRET probability in the transition from hexamers to dimers revealed a theoretically achievable reduction of FRET by app. 52% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). However, the actual measured changes in FRET upon MICU1 rearrangement triggered by histamine was app. 7%. The discrepancy between the theoretical FRET changes upon the rearrangement of hexamers to independent dimers and the actual measured one might be due to basically two reasons: <italic>first</italic>, the high expression of FP tagged MICU1 proteins might result in lower oligomerization states, and <italic>second</italic>, upon histamine-induced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, MICU1 de-oligomerization most likely occurs predominantly within the junctions between the ER and mitochondria where high Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradients are developed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, thus, only a small portion of MICU1 hexamers actually undergoes rearrangement under this conditions. This assumption is further supported by the app. 15% FRET reduction achieved in the assessment of the concentration response curve of MICU1 FRET dynamic to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
      <p>Our approach that allowed correlation of the kinetics of MICU1 (re-)organization with cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics data revealed that the rearrangement of MICU1 multimers by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> strictly correlates with the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and is rapidly reversible. The <italic>in situ</italic> calibration indicates that the rearrangement of MICU1 senses Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the range between the low basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels of 100ânM up to 100âÎ¼M. With an EC<sub>50</sub> of around 4âÎ¼M, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of MICU1 rearrangement lays exactly in the range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> hot spots (3.78 and 16.4âÎ¼M) that have been measured at the outer mitochondrial membrane between the junction of mitochondria and the ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In line with this report, the IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization almost instantly yielded MICU1 rearrangement, while Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry via the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> triggered only a slow and moderate re-organization of MICU1 multimers. These differences between the MICU1 rearrangement upon intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and entering Ca<sup>2+</sup> are consistent with previous reports that described a rather slow on-kinetics of entering Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the mitochondrial surface without the formation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> hot spots and slow mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
      <p>Similar to entering Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the inhibition of SERCA by BHQ yielded only slow and small rearrangement of MICU1 multimers and, thus, explains the marginal effect of SERCA inhibition on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Since the diminution of MICU1 expression substantially gains mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by SERCA inhibition, the prominent role of MICU1 as a negative regulator of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniport is clearly demonstrated. This assumption is further supported by our experiments in which cytosolic and mitochondrial free Ca<sup>2+</sup> were simultaneously measured and the lag time of app. 1.5âs between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was strongly reduced in cells with diminished expression of MICU1. Hence, the correlation between cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, the rearrangement of MICU1 multimers and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, revealed that MICU1 reorganization temporally occurs in between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise within the two compartments. Notably, significant mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake appears to occur at app. 50% rearrangement of MICU1 multimers. These data demonstrate that for activation of the MCU/EMRE complex to achieve mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, app. 50% of the MICU1 multimers have to be rearranged. Although these findings might be due to the overexpression of MICU1 in our model, the MICU1-dependent lack of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in response to SERCA inhibition supports this assumption.</p>
      <p>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake strongly depends on Î¨<sub>mito</sub> that establishes the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniport into the organelle. However, whether or not Î¨<sub>mito</sub> also impacts on MICU1 organization has not been investigated so far. Our data with completely depolarized mitochondria revealed an unchanged MICU1 dynamics despite a greatly reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. These data demonstrate that neither Î¨<sub>mito</sub> nor matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> are involved in the rearrangement of MICU1 complexes and confirms cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> as possible the sole regulator of MICU1 (re-)organization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
      <p>Considering the interaction of MICU1 with EMRE and MCU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, the importance of these two pore-forming proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> for the structural organization of MICU1 was evaluated. Although the siRNA-mediated diminution of either of these proteins resulted in strongly reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered rearrangement of MICU1 multimers, their arrangement upon the reduction of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> to basal levels, and the sensitivity to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> remained unaffected by the reduction of MCU or EMRE. These data demonstrate that the structural (re-)organization of MICU1 upon elevation of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not involve MCU or EMRE indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced rearrangement of MICU1 multimers is a robust process that does most likely not require other interaction partners.</p>
      <p>Despite the topology of MICU1 is still under debate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, our data that, <italic><underline>first</underline></italic>, MICU1 FRET rearrangement follows cytosolic but not matrix mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>, <italic>second</italic>, MICU1 knockdown results in a faster mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, <italic>third</italic>, rearrangement of MICU1 FRET precedes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, <italic>forth</italic>, MICU1 FRET is independent from Î¨<sub>mito</sub>, and <italic>fifth</italic>, neither knockdown of MCU nor of EMRE influences MICU1 FRET rearrangement indicate that MICU1 anchors with its N-terminus in the IMM while the core protein is oriented towards intermembrane space and not to the matrix.</p>
      <p>Our results provide new mechanistic insights in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. For the first time, the kinetics and adjustments of one of the most important molecular gatekeeper of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was visualized in intact cells. Our data revealed cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the most prominent regulator of the structural organization of MICU1, which in the form of a homo-multimere potently inhibits the MCU/EMRE mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel complex. Moreover, neither Î¨<sub>mito</sub> nor matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>, nor MCU or EMRE were found to affect the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-controlled (dis)assembly of MICU1 multimers. Finally, our data provide important details for a better understanding of the molecular regulation of an intricate mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake machinery.</p>

        <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and dynamic FRET measurements between MICU1-CFP and MICU1-YFP were performed on an inverted microscope (Axio Observer.A1, Zeiss, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany) equipped with a polychromator illumination system (VisiChrome, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) and a thermoelectric-cooled CCD camera (Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ, Visitron Systems). Cells were imaged with a 40Ã oil-immersion objective (Zeiss). Fura-2 and the 4mtD1GO-Cam were alternately excited at 340ânm or 380ânm and at 477ânm, respectively, with an ultra-fast switching monochromator, the Polychrome V (Till Photonics), equipped with an excitation filter (E500spuv) and a dichroic filter (495dcxru, Chroma Technology Corp., VT).
