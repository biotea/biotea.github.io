      <abstract>
        <p>Glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 2 protein (GLTSCR2) is a nucleolar protein. In the investigation of the role of GLTSCR2 that played in the cellular innate immune response to viral infection, we found GLTSCR2 supported viral replication of rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and coronavirus in cells. Viral infection induced translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm that enabled GLTSCR2 to attenuate type I interferon IFN-Î² and support viral replication. Cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 was able to interact with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), and the triple interaction induced USP15 activity to remove K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-Î². Blocking cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2, by deletion of its nuclear export sequence (NES), abrogated its ability to attenuate IFN-Î² and support viral replication. GLTSCR2-mediated attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-Î² led to alleviation of host cell innate immune response to viral infection. Our findings suggested that GLTSCR2 contributed to efficient viral replication, and GLTSCR2 should be considered as a potential target for therapeutic control of viral infection.</p>

    <p>Innate immunity is critical for defending the host from pathogens, and type I interferon (IFN) is the core of cellular antiviral response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Upon viral infection, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), are able to detect viral nucleic acids and initiate a series of cell signals, leading to induction of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

MAVS recruits tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) that results in TRAF3 lysine 63 (K63)-linked auto-ubiquitination to provide docking sites for TANK binding kinase 1/I kappa-B kinase epsilon (TBK1/IKKÎµ) complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

The complex also activates canonical IKK for NF-ÎºB activation to induce proinflammatory cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Studies also showed that dephosphorylation (Thr170) of RIG-I by the phosphatase PP1 Î±/Î³<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and K63-linked ubiquitination (Lys172) of RIG-I by the ubiquitin E3 ligase tripartite motif proteins TRIM25<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and TRIM4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> lead to RIG-I activation and type I IFN production.

USP15 also deubiquitinates the K48-linked ubiquitylation of TRIM25 and facilitates the activation of RIG-I<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.

The IFN-inducible protein IFI35 suppresses dephosphorylation and activation of RIG-I and mediates degradation of RIG-I via K48-linked ubiquitination, resulting in blockage of type I IFN induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
    <p>Glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 2 protein (GLTSCR2) is a nucleolar protein containing multiple nucleolar localization sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. GLTSCR2 was shown to directly interact with viral proteins, such as ICP22 and ICP0 of HSV-1 and KS-Bcl-2 of KSHV in infected cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. However, it was not clear whether GLTSCR2 might be involved in viral replication. In this work, we pursued the role of GLTSCR2 in viral replication. Translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm enabled GLTSCR2 to attenuate the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-Î² in cells responding to viral infection. We also investigated mechanisms for GLTSCR2-induced attenuation of RIG-I. Our studies revealed a previously unrecognized role of GLTSCR2 in attenuation of RIG-I and IFN-Î² and, for the first time, our results provided insights into nucleolar proteins involved in innate immunity response to viral infection.</p>

        <title>GLTSCR2 for production of viral particles</title>
        <p>To investigate whether GLTSCR2 might play any role in viral replication, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down GLTSCR2 in cells, followed by infection with <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, decreases of GLTSCR2 resulted in reduced production of viral particles of VSV, NDV, and IBV by ~60, ~120, and ~20 folds, respectively. GLTSCR2 reduction also resulted in decreased levels of viral proteins in cells, indicating an important role of GLTSCR2 for production of various viruses. To investigate if viral infection might modulate GLTSCR2 level in cells, we studied the time-course of GLTSCR2 during VSV infection, and we detected that GLTSCR2 level was not significantly affected by viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), indicating the endogenous level of GLTSCR2 was sufficient to support viral replication.</p>
        <p>Studies indicated that the C-terminal region ranging from residue 347 to 478 contains key nucleolar localization sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The C-terminal region of residues 330 to 478 plays a role in GLTSCR2 interaction with other cellular proteins, such as PTEN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and merlin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The region of residues 342 to 386 is also responsible for homo-dimerization or even homo-oligomerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. To understand if these putative domains might be important in GLTSCR2-involved viral replication, we constructed plasmid expression vectors to carry gene fragments encoding G3 (residues 330â432) and G4 (residues 241â478). We transfected HEp-2 cells with these expression vectors individually and infected cells with VSV. We detected that ectopic expression of the full length, wild-type (wt) GLTSCR2 enhanced viral replication, indexed by viral proteins VSV-G and NDV-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Expression of G3 or G4 appeared to enhance viral replication to a comparable level as enhanced by wt GLTSCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These preliminary results indicated that the integrity of C-terminal region G3 (residues 330â432) was important for GLTSCR2 in support of viral replication.</p>
        <p>To further verify the function of these regions in viral replication, we ectopically expressed wt, G3, and G4 of GLTSCR2 and infected cells with NDV or IBV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>, ectopic expression of wt and variants of GLTSCR2 was able to increase gene expression of viral NDV-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and IBV-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), especially in 24âhours after viral infection. Meanwhile, expression of wt GLTSCR2, but not G3 or G4, consistently resulted in upregulation of these viral genes in 6âhours after viral infection and supported viral replication to higher levels than G3 and G4 did throughout the entire infection course. The results lead us to suggest that GLTSCR2 played a supportive role in viral replication.</p>

        <title>Translocation of GLTSCR2 to cytoplasm for VSV replication</title>
        <p>GLTSCR2 is a nuclear protein. It was reported that the translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm was induced by infection with HSV-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, however, it was not clear whether GLTSCR2 cytoplasmic translocation might be associated with viral replication. To verify the cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 in response to VSV replication, we ectopically expressed GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 in HeLa cells, followed by infection of cells with VSV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 was detectable in the nucleus (lane 1), and then was detected in the cytoplasm by 7 (lane 2) and 10 (lane 3) hours after viral infection. Cytoplasmic translocation of GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 was blocked by leptomycin B (LMB) (lane 4), which is able to inhibit broad range of nuclear protein export pathways mediated by CRM1/exportin 1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, indicating that the export of GLTSCR2 to cytoplasm was in a CRM1-dependent manner. In addition, GLTSCR2-âGLT variant, in which the nuclear export sequence (NES, residues 358 to 370) was deleted, failed to translocate into the cytoplasm after VSV infection (lane 5). Furthermore, the levels of viral production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, left) and viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, right) were greatly increased by ectopic expression of wt GLTSCR2. The ectopic expression of GLTSCR2-âGLT, however, resulted in slightly increased production of viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The results indicated that cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 played an important role in support of VSV replication.</p>

        <title>GLTSCR2 attenuated IFN-Î²</title>
        <p>To reveal the mechanism for GLTSCR2 in supporting viral replication, we investigated any effects of ectopically expressed GLTSCR2 on IFN-Î². After viral infection, increases of ectopically expressed GLTSCR2 resulted in decreases of IFN-Î² promoter activity in cells infected with either Sendai virus (SeV) or VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also detected that increases of ectopically expressed GLTSCR2 resulted in decreasing NF-ÎºB-dependent promoter activity in cells infected with either SeV or VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These results indicated that GLTSCR2 might be involved in downregulation of IFN-Î² and NF-ÎºB during viral infection of cells. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in significant increases of IFN-Î² promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and IFN-Î² secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>) in cells after infection with SeV or VSV. These results verified the ability of GLTSCR2 to mediate downregulation of IFN-Î² during viral infection.</p>
        <p>In addition, the ability of recombinant IFN-Î² to suppress VSV replication, indexed by viral particle production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, left) and the viral protein VSV-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, right), was significantly reversed by ectopically expressed wt GLTSCR2. The results further indicated that GLTSCR2 supported viral replications by not only downregulating IFN-Î² expression but also suppressing IFN-Î² activity. Phosphorylation of type I IFN regulatory factor IRF3 on serine 396 has been shown to play a pivotal role in IFN-Î² induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. While investigating the involvement of IRF3 activation in GLTSCR2 suppression of type I IFN, we generated HEK293T cell line stably expressing specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting GLTSCR2 using a shRNA-based lentivector (GLTSCR2 knockdown cells). Our results showed that VSV replication was decreased in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells versus viral replication in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, left). We also detected that a higher level of phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3) in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells than it in HEK293T cells infected with VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, right) for 24, 36, and 48âhours. These results indicated that p-IRF3 reduction was involved in GLTSCR2 mediated suppression of IFN-Î² induction in the support of viral replication.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>GLTSCR2 targeted and blocked RIG-I activity</title>
        <p>To reveal the mechanism for GLTSCR2 in downregulation of the type I IFN, we investigated modulators involved in the regulation of IFN-Î². It has been indicated that RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1 are activated in cells responding to VSV infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. We found that ectopic expression of RIG-I-N (constitutively-active RIG-I variant consisting of residues 1â300), MAVS, or TBK1 was able to induce IFN-Î² promoter activity, and co-expression of GLTSCR2 blocked IFN-Î² promoter activation by RIG-I-N but not MAVS or TBK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating the ability of GLTSCR2 to block RIG-I.</p>
        <p>Then, we investigated whether GLTSCR2 might interact with RIG-I in downregulation of IFN-Î². We used Flag-specific antibodies to immune-precipitate ectopically-expressed Flag-tagged wt GLTSCR2 or GLTSCR2-âGLT variant and used specific antibodies in immunoblotting to detect if endogenous RIG-I was in the immune complexed in cells with and without being infected with VSV. The result revealed that GLTSCR2 interacted with RIG-I. The NES-deletion mutant ÎGLT of GLTSCR2, however, failed to interact with RIG-I, suggesting that the deletion of the sequences 358â370 disrupted their interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Under the same experimental condition, we found that RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, left), but not MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, right), was in the immune complexes with GLTSCR2 regardless of viral infection. In addition, HA-tagged RIG-I was detected in the immune-complexes with G3 and G4 variants versus wt GLTSCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Apparently, the C-terminal region of GLTSCR2 was able to interact with RIG-I. However, whether the N-terminal region of GLTSCR2 was involved in interaction with RIG-I remains to be clarified.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, co-expression of wt GLTSCR2 and G3, but not the NES-deletion mutant ÎGLT, blocked RIG-I-N-induced IFN-Î² promoter activation; and G3 was less effective than wt GLTSCR2 in the blockage of RIG-I-N-induced IFN-Î² promoter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These results taken together indicated that C-terminal region G3 (residues 330â432) was able to interact with RIG-I for blocking the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-Î², and the cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 were important in downregulation of IFN-Î² expression.</p>
        <p>To further explore whether GLTSCR2 blocked the ability of RIG-I by directly targeting RIG-I, HEK293T or RIG-I knockdown cells were transfected with Flag-tagged GLTSCR2. Our results revealed that the viral protein level increased, while p-IRF3 level decreased in RIG-I knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, lanes 5â7) as compared with that in HEK293T cells (lanes 2â4). Ectopically expression of GLTSCR2, however, failed to support viral replication (lanes 5â7). This result indicated that GLTSCR2 blocked the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-Î² that supports viral replication.</p>

        <title>GLTSCR2 negatively regulated RIG-I via K63-linked ubiquitination</title>
        <p>It has been shown that the dephosphorylation (threonine T170) and K63-linked ubiquitination (lysine K172) lead to RIG-I activation and IFN-Î² production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To address whether these sites in RIG-I were also critical for interaction with GLTSCR2, we substituted arginine (R) for T170 and K172 to arginine (R) to result in RIG-I-T170R and RIG-I-K172R variants, respectively, afterthen ectopically expressed these RIG-I variants in HEK293T or GLTSCR2 knockdown cells. We detected that ectopic expression of wt RIG-I induced IFN-Î² promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, lane 1), and knockdown of GLTSCR2 resulted in increasing wt RIG-I induced IFN-Î² promoter activity (lane 2). Expression of RIG-I-T170R significantly increased IFN-Î² promoter activity to a higher level than wt RIG-I induced (lane 3), and knockdown of GLTSCR2 also increased RIG-I-T170R-induced IFN-Î² promoter activity (lane 4). Expression of RIG-I-K172R induced a lower level of IFN-Î² promoter activity than wt induced (lane 5), and knockdown of GLTSCR2 failed to affect RIG-I-K172R-induced IFN-Î² promoter activity (lane 6). The results showed that the two sites of T170 and K172 of RIG-I were critically involved in induction of IFN-Î² promoter activity, in line with the results reported by Wiels and Gack (lanes 1, 3, 5). Furthermore, knockdown of GLTSCR2 potentiated wt RIG-I or mutant T170R induced activation of the IFN-Î² promoter, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, lanes 2, 4. It can be excluded that GLTSCR2 targeted RIG-I via dephosphorylation of RIG-I.</p>
        <p>To further study whether GLTSCR2 modulated ubiquitination of RIG-I, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids to express Flag-tagged RIG-I-N and GFP-tagged GLTSCR2, along with HA-tagged ubiquitin, K63-linked ubiquitin, or K48-linked ubiquitin. We detected that ectopic expression of GLTSCR2 was able to induce de-conjugation of K63-linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, lane 4), but not K48-linked (lane 6) polyubiquitin chains from the constitutively-active variant RIG-I-N. Knockdown of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in increased K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These results taken together indicated that GLTSCR2 was able to downregulate RIG-I, via K63-linked ubiquitination.</p>

        <title>USP15 mediated GLTSCR2 removal of RIG-I ubiquitination</title>
        <p>USP15 has been shown to remove K63-linked, but not K48-linked, polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, resulting in deactivation of RIG-I and blockage of IFN-Î² induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Addressing whether USP15 was responsible for GLTSCR2-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, we ectopically co-expressed Myc-tagged USP15 and Flag-tagged GLTSCR2 in cells with and without being infected with VSV. The result showed that USP15 can interact with GLTSCR2 upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Furthermore, we detected that USP15 was in the immune complexes with wt, G3, and G4 variants of GLTSCR2, at the moment of VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). These results indicated that USP15 interacted with GLTSCR2, via binding to the range of residues 330â432 (G3).</p>
        <p>To address whether USP15 was responsible for GLTSCR2 regulation of K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, we co-expressed Flag-tagged RIG-I-N and HA-tagged K63 ubiquitin in the presence or absence of Myc-tagged USP15 in HEK293T or GLTSCR2 knockdown cells. We detected that K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I-N was increased in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>, lane 2) versus in HEK293T cells (lane 1) in the absence of USP15. Presence of USP15 reduced K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I-N in HEK293T cells (lane 3); in contrast, USP15 failed to reduce K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I-N in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells (lane 4). The results indicated that presence of GLTSCR2 was required for USP15 to effectively remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I. Interestingly, we detected that reduction of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in increased USP15 activity in removing K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I-N in GLTSCR2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, lane 6), whereas GLTSCR2 presence reduced the activity of USP15 in removing K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I-N in HEK293T cells (lane 3). It appeared that GLTSCR2 supported and inhibited the ability of USP15, respectively, to remove K63-linked and K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. These results taken together indicated that GLTSCR2 interacted with RIG-I and USP15 in a complex to support the activity of USP15 to remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, leading to inactivation of RIG-I and blockage of IFN-Î² induction.</p>

It was showed no evidence of the interaction regardless of viral infection. To further address whether TRIM25 or USP21 were responsible for GLTSCR2 regulation of K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, we co-expressed Flag-tagged RIG-I-N and HA-tagged K63 ubiquitin in the presence or absence of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>) or USP21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>) in HEK293T or GLTSCR2 knockdown cells.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work, we presented evidence that viral infection induced translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic translocation enabled GLTSCR2 to effectively attenuate IFN-Î² and support viral replication; however, viral infection did not result in elevating GLTSCR2 in cells. It was reported that viruses are able to utilize host cellâs ubiquitin ligase and deubiqutinases to antagonize RIG-I-, MAVS-, TBK1-, and IRF3-mediated innate immune response in order to succeed viral replications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Cellular proteins, such as PCBP2, Ndfip1, SOCS3, Siglec1, and FoxO1, are involved in recruiting ubiquitin ligases to down-regulate MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 by K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. On the other hand, studies showed that influenza A virus infection induces nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin to suppress IFN-Î² induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, and nuclear translocation of TRIM26 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of IRF3, thereby blocking IFN-Î² induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In contrast, our studies showed that cytoplasmic translocation of nucleolar GLTSCR2 contributed to attenuation of IFN-Î² induction and replication of viral particles. Abrogating the cytoplasm-translocating ability of GLTSCR2 diminished its ability to attenuate IFN-Î² induction and support viral replication. Accordingly, targeting cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 should be seriously considered in the development of antiviral agents.</p>
      <p>RIG-I, which acts as a sensor to recognize viral infection and intracellular infection of bacteria, plays an important role in the induction of type I IFN for cellular defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. The amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I (RIG-N) undergo robust ubiquitination induced by TRIM25<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and TRIM4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, which effectively deliver the Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains to the RIG-N, to increase the activity of RIG-I. However, an ubiquitin-specific proteases USP15<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, USP21<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, or USP3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, removes the 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from the RIG-N to attenuate the activity of RIG-I. K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I results in activation of RIG-I, leading to induction of type I IFN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, whereas K48-linked ubiquitination results in inactivation of RIG-I<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. GLTSCR2 was able to interact with RIG-I and abolish the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-Î², via de-conjugation of K63-linked, but not K48-linked, polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I. Thus, RIG-I played an important role as an immediate downstream target of GLTSCR2 for inactivation in attenuation of type I IFN and facilitation of viral replication.</p>
      <p>USP15 has been shown to remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, resulting in deactivation of RIG-I<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. We detected that USP15, but not USP3 or USP21, involved in GLTSCR2-induced removal of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, resulting in deactivation of RIG-I and blockage of IFN-Î² induction. Interestingly, decreases of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in increasing the ability of USP15 to remove K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. Possibly, K63-linked and K48-linked ubiquitination competed for the same residue K172 in RIG-I, and a threshold of GLTSCR2 level played the role of modulating USP15 activity to de-conjugate K63-linked or K48-linked ubiquitination. It is also possible that cytoplasmic translocation increased GLTSCR2 level to induce the ability of USP15 to de-conjugate K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I; in contrast, lack of cytoplasmic GLTSCR2 resulted in decreasing the ability of USP15 to de-conjugate K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I but increasing the USP15 ability to de-conjugate K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. Decreases of K63-linked ubiquitination or increases of K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I resulted in attenuation of RIG-I, thereby blocking the RIG-I to IFN-Î² pathway and supporting viral replication.</p>
      <p>Type I IFN plays an important role in host cell defense against viral infection. Our studies revealed a novel role the nucleolar protein GLTSCR2 played in attenuation of IFN-Î², via cytoplasmic translocation to induce the ability of USP15 to deactivate RIG-I. Our findings advanced current knowledge of nucleolar modulators, translocated into the cytoplasm, for attenuation of type I IFN and support viral replication during viral infection. However, whether cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 and abrogation of RIG-I activity might induce additional pathways, bypassing attenuation of IFN-Î², to support viral replication remains to be clarified. What viral components or cellular modulators, in response to viral infection, induced GLTSCR2 translocation to the cytoplasm also needs to be studied.</p>
