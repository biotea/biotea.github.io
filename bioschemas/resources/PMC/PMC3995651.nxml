      <abstract>
        <p>The regulation of membrane shapes is central to many cellular phenomena. Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing proteins are key players for membrane remodeling during endocytosis, cell migration, and endosomal sorting. BIN1, which contains an N-BAR domain, is assumed to be essential for biogenesis of plasma membrane invaginations (T-tubules) in muscle tissues. Three mutations, K35N, D151N and R154Q, have been discovered so far in the BAR domain of BIN1 in patients with centronuclear myopathy (CNM), where impaired organization of T-tubules has been reported. However, molecular mechanisms behind this malfunction have remained elusive. None of the BIN1 disease mutants displayed a significantly compromised curvature sensing ability. However, two mutants showed impaired membrane tubulation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and displayed characteristically different behaviors. R154Q generated smaller membrane curvature compared to WT N-BAR. Quantification of protein density on membranes revealed a lower membrane-bound density for R154Q compared to WT and the other mutants, which appeared to be the primary reason for the observation of impaired deformation capacity. The D151N mutant was unable to tubulate liposomes under certain experimental conditions. At medium protein concentrations we found âbuddingâ structures on liposomes that we hypothesized to be intermediates during the tubulation process except for the D151N mutant. Chemical crosslinking assays suggested that the D151N mutation impaired protein oligomerization upon membrane binding. Although we found an insignificant difference between WT and K35N N-BAR in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, depolymerizing actin in live cells allowed tubulation of plasma membranes through the K35N mutant. Our results provide insights into the membrane-involved pathophysiological mechanisms leading to human disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cell membranes display a wide variety of shapes, including flat sheets, vesicles and tubules. Dynamic membrane remodeling occurs during phenomena such as membrane trafficking, organelle biogenesis, and cell division. Changes in membrane morphology can be accomplished through translocation and assembly of membrane sculpting proteins<xref rid="pone.0093060-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Qualmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Amphiphysin II, also called BIN1, is such a membrane deforming protein. It was first identified as a tumor repressor by its interaction with MYC oncoproteins. In accordance with that role, BIN1 expression was found to be reduced in cancer cell lines<xref rid="pone.0093060-Sakamuro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The human BIN1 gene is subject to alternative splicing in a cell-type-specific manner<xref rid="pone.0093060-WechslerReya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Fugier1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Isoform 8 is primarily expressed in striated muscle tissues. This isoform contains a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) binding sequence encoded by exon10<xref rid="pone.0093060-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In skeletal myocytes, BIN1 locates on tubular membrane invaginations called transverse tubules (T-tubules). T-tubules incorporate Ca<sup>2+</sup> releasing channels and ryanodine receptors, and are a membranous platform critical for synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<xref rid="pone.0093060-AlQusairi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Acute knockdown studies of BIN1 in skeletal muscle have revealed disorganized T-tubule formation and impaired intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling<xref rid="pone.0093060-Tjondrokoesoemo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additionally, BIN1 is required for C2C12 myoblast fusion and differentiation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-WechslerReya2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Full-length BIN1 isoform 8 contains an N-terminal BAR domain, a Myc-binding domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 3 domain (SH3 domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0093060-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. BIN1 associates with membranes peripherally through its N-terminal BAR domain and binds dynamin2 via its SH3 domain<xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The crystal structure of a dimeric BAR domain shows a six-helix bundle core with two arms that form a crescent shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0093060-Casal1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Positively charged amino acids are located at the concave surface that forms the membrane binding interface<xref rid="pone.0093060-McMahon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Frost1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although not resolved in the crystal structure, residues 1â36 are predicted to fold into an amphipathic helix upon membrane binding<xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This helix inserts into the membrane leaflet and thereby facilitates curvature generation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Gallop1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for how N-BAR domains induce membrane curvature. These include 1) scaffolding by imposing the intrinsic curvature of a BAR dimer to bend the membrane; 2) hydrophobic insertion of amphipathic helix causing asymmetry between two leaflets; 3) protein oligomerization and lattice formation to stabilize curved membranes; and 4) recently discovered protein crowding effects leading to membrane tubulation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Baumgart1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Stachowiak1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, several mutations have been identified in the BIN1 gene in patients with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (CNM). CNM is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness, abnormal localization of nuclei, and growth retardation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Jungbluth1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-FujimuraKiyono1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To date, five mutations in the BIN1 gene have been discovered in CNM. Among these, three mutations are in the N-BAR domain region: K35N, D151N, and R154Q. The other two are nonsense mutations in the C-terminal SH3 domain: Q434X and K436X (numbering for human isoform 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Mejaddam1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These mutations in the N-BAR domain of BIN1 result in defective T-tubule biogenesis in skeletal myocytes. The nonsense mutations in the SH3 domain do not compromise the membrane tubulation ability of BIN1, but abolish recruitment of dynamin2 on tubules<xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Toussaint1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Toussaint2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Disrupted membrane remodeling by BIN1 mutations is thus clearly connected with centronuclear myopathy, but the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of each point mutation in BIN1 on membrane interactions is poorly understood.</p>
      <p>In this study, we focused on three CNM-related mutations in the BIN1 N-BAR domain and investigated differences among BIN1 N-BAR variants in the context of membrane association and curvature generation. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular studies of BIN1 N-BAR variants confirmed that all three mutations in the BIN1 N-BAR domain impaired membrane tubulation. We demonstrated that lipid composition played an important role in regulating tubulation abilities among BIN1 N-BAR mutants in liposome tubulation assays. Both the D151N and R154Q mutations in the BIN1 N-BAR domain led to significant reduction in tubulation for lipid compositions mimicking physiological conditions. We then studied protein densities on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and found that the R154Q mutation caused reduced protein binding to the membrane. However, interestingly the D151N mutant retained a similar curvature sensing ability on pulled tethers as WT N-BAR and was also able to reduce equilibrium pulling force on membrane tethers relative to bare membranes. Chemical crosslinking and protein titration in tubulation assays suggested that D151N was deficient in protein oligomerization on membranes. Strikingly, we failed to identify a significant deviation of recombinant K35N N-BAR from WT in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. This implies that the K35N mutation does not disrupt N-terminal helix hydrophobic insertion into the lipid membrane, which is a widely accepted mechanism for the N-BAR domain protein in curvature generation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Lastly, we provided preliminary evidence that the cytoskeleton regulates membrane tubulation activity of BIN1 in cells.</p>

        <title>Point mutations associated with CNM in BIN1 impair membrane remodeling</title>
        <p>BIN1, as a BAR domain containing protein, is implicated in membrane remodeling during T-tubule generation. Previous research has shown that overexpression of BIN1 in cells leads to membrane tubulation. The first two N-BAR domain mutations (K35N and D151N) found in CNM patients were reported to abolish the membrane deforming function of BIN1 in COS-1 cells. However, for the most recently discovered mutant (R154Q), only tissue biopsy data are available thus far. These indicate that R154Q also disrupts T-tubule organization and thus triad function at sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/T-tubule junctions <xref rid="pone.0093060-Claeys1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Boehm1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In order to test the hypothesis that all disease mutations found in the BIN1 BAR domain impair membrane tubule formation, we transiently transfected C2C12 myoblasts with BIN1 N-BAR* wild type (WT) and CNM-related mutants conjugated with mKate at the C-terminus. The N-BAR* domain is distinguished from the N-BAR domain by a longer sequence that includes exon10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We used the BIN1 N-BAR* domain because it has been reported that the polybasic sequence coded by exon10 is required for targeting to the plasma membrane mediated by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and that <italic>in vivo</italic> membrane tubulation is not observed by BIN1 N-BAR domains<xref rid="pone.0093060-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Confocal micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> demonstrated that BIN1 N-BAR* WT expression resulted in the generation of invaginated membrane tubules, while cells expressing the CNM-associated mutant proteins showed essentially homogeneous cytosolic fluorescence. To exclude potential membrane morphological influences by the fluorescence tags, mKate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093060.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>) or EGFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093060.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>) alone were expressed in C2C12 myoblasts. All cells were found to express fluorescence proteins (mKate or EGFP) in a homogeneous manner. To quantitatively compare membrane deforming differences, we categorized tubules in live cells into three groups based on tubule lengths and calculated the percentages of cells in each group<xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, on average, over 90% of cells with over-expressed WT N-BAR* had long tubules generated, while this phenotype was absent in all disease mutants. In cells transfected with disease mutants, we found fluorescent clusters in 30% of the cells. These clusters may be protein aggregates or short tubules that we were not able to distinguish due to the optical resolution limit.</p>

        <p>To understand the origins of membrane tubule generation, we used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) to examine the spatial organization on the plasma membrane of BIN1 N-BAR* domains conjugated with green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The introduction of fluorescent tags at the N-terminus might affect N-terminal helix membrane insertion. However, we did not observe changes in <italic>in-vivo</italic> tubulation phenotypes among BIN1 N-BAR* variants when proteins were either N-terminally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093060.s002">Fig. S2</xref>) or C-terminally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) labeled. Consistently, distinct fluorescent speckles were only present on plasma membranes of cells transfected with N-BAR* WT, whereas disease mutants were distributed more evenly on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>From the TIRF imaging results we conclude that: 1) most of the membrane tubules induced by BIN1 N-BAR* are oriented perpendicularly to the TIRF plane. Thus, fluorescence projections on the plasma membrane show up as speckles; 2) only the WT protein, which possesses the capacity for cellular membrane tubulation, shows significant clusters at the plasma membrane.</p>
        <p>The findings from this section emphasize that BIN1 N-BAR* acts as a membrane curvature generator, causing membrane tubulation in cells, and that this function is perturbed by disease mutations.</p>

<italic>In vitro</italic> tubulation abilities of recombinant N-BAR domain variants vary with lipid composition</title>
        <p>To further characterize the BIN1 N-BAR domain and its mutants, we purified WT BIN1 N-BAR domains as well as disease mutants. Because we neither observed retention volume shifts in size exclusion chromatography, nor any changes in CD spectra, we believe that none of the disease mutations had significant effects on the folding of the protein (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To characterize curvature generation by BIN1 N-BAR domains and its mutants, we adopted an <italic>in vitro</italic> liposome deformation assay involving negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Negative staining is a widely accepted method to study biological macromolecules. It involves embedding liposome-protein complexes adsorbed to sample grids in a dried heavy metal solution for contrast enhancement<xref rid="pone.0093060-DeCarlo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We first used large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs) composed of 100% DOPS to maximize electrostatic interactions between protein and membrane without the potential complications of lipid demixing. Contrary to the observations from cellular studies described above, tubules were found in all the samples when BIN1 variants were incubated with liposomes composed of 100% DOPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). We used tubule diameter and tubule length as two parameters to quantify the strength of the membrane shaping ability of BIN1 N-BAR domains. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, the averaged tubular diameter induced by BIN1 N-BAR WT was 34Â±1 nm (note that here and below uncertainties are expressed as standard errors of the mean if not indicated otherwise), which is comparable to the reported tubule dimensions generated by N-BAR domain proteins (ranging from 20â50 nm)<xref rid="pone.0093060-Gallop1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Farsad1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The length of tubules varied from 300 nm to 4 Âµm with an averaged tubule length around 549Â±43 nm. No significant differences between WT and K35N were found with respect to either tubule diameter or length (K35N: 35Â±1 nm in diameter and 436Â±22 nm in length). For D151N, although there was a slight increase in the tubule diameter (40Â±1 nm), the averaged tubule length was similar as WT (D151N: 385Â±26 nm). For the R154Q mutant, tubules were shorter (190Â±11 nm, 3 fold decreased) suggesting reduced tubulation ability of R154Q. We acknowledge that dehydration during sample preparation may cause variations in geometric measurements that can be avoided using the alternative method of Cryo-EM imaging<xref rid="pone.0093060-DeCarlo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Sander1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The diameters of the tubules generated by endophilin N-BAR domain ranged from 24 nm to 28 nm in Cyro-EM studies.

        <p>Two types of membrane deforming events occur as consequences of N-BAR protein binding: tubulation and vesiculation. N-BAR domains are known to be able to deform large liposomes into vesicles with diameters smaller than 30â40 nm<xref rid="pone.0093060-Boucrot1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, we quantified both tubulation and vesiculation events as a measure of membrane deformation ability of peripheral proteins.</p>
        <p>We compared the average number of tubulation and vesiculation events in 30 individual image fields. WT and K35N had similar deformation capacities with 5â6 tubules and 48 vesiculated liposomes (diameter was less than 30 nm) on average per frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Tubule numbers for D151N and R154Q were reduced to 71Â±12% and 40Â±6% of that for WT. Vesiculation numbers for D151N and R154Q, however, decreased more significantly to 22Â±5% and 27Â±4% of the vesiculation events observed for WT protein.</p>
        <p>To conclude, on 100% DOPS membranes, BIN1 N-BAR domains are able to deform spherical membranes into tubules or small vesicles. Mild decrease in the membrane deformation capacity is found in the D151N and R154Q mutants.</p>
        <p>Because with model membranes consisting of 100% DOPS we found only mild impairment of deformation capacity of disease mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) compared to the significant differences observed in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), we next tested the hypothesis that lipid composition plays a role in regulating deformation capacity of BIN1 variants. We chose a lipid composition meant to better mimic the headgroup composition of the inner plasma membrane leaflet: DOPC:DOPS:DOPE:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>â=â6â¶2â¶1â¶1. Here, DOPS and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which are enriched in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane<xref rid="pone.0093060-Spector1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, provide negative charge promoting electrostatic interactions with the BAR domain while the presence of the smaller headgroup in DOPE lipids results in more lipid packing defects that facilitate insertion of amphipathic helices leading to enhanced tubulation and vesiculation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Vamparys1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In this composition, the overall negative charge density on the membrane decreases to 50% rather than 100% as a result of the reduced DOPS percentage and â3 charge per PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecule at physiological conditions<xref rid="pone.0093060-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Toner1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We note that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, as a multivalent lipid, could introduce specific effects on protein-membrane interactions<xref rid="pone.0093060-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Despite this potential complication we aim, with this more physiological lipid composition, to provide biologically relevant insights into how BIN1 N-BAR membrane interactions differ among our mutants.</p>
        <p>For this lipid composition, electron micrographs of liposomes incubated with BIN1 N-BAR variants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>. WT BIN1 N-BAR protein acted as a strong curvature generator. The averaged tubule diameter was 29Â±1 nm with a tubule length distribution ranging from 200 nm to 2 Âµm. With this lipid composition, more vesiculated liposomes (with diameters less than 30 nm) were found on grids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) than for the 100% DOPS composition. Compared to WT BIN1, membrane tubules induced by K35N had similar width, but tubule lengths reduced to 61Â±5% of those generated by WT. The R154Q mutant showed wider (37Â±1 nm) and shorter (135Â±9 nm) tubules. Strikingly, we found severely impaired membrane deformation for D151N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>): Among over 30 analyzed EM micrographs, no tubulation or vesiculation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5A&amp;D</xref>). Differences among N-BAR variants are clearly demonstrated in the tubulation and vesiculation analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>. While K35N showed a number of tubulation events per frame that was comparable to the WT protein, the other mutants exhibited decreased probabilities of tubulation and vesiculation from liposomes.</p>

        <p>On the 100% DOPS vesicles, the density of membrane-bound protein increased with increasing protein solution concentration, as expected. The membrane binding affinities (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) that we obtained were similar among BIN1 N-BAR variants. The membrane binding dissociation constants <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> are: 320 nMÂ±51 nM (WT), 400 nMÂ±29 nM (K35N), 540 nMÂ±172 nM (D151N) and 640 nMÂ±94 nM (R154Q). From these affinities, one finds that the maximal binding free energy difference comparing WT and mutants is only about 0.7 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, i.e. on the order of thermal fluctuations. The saturation densities for the disease mutants were only slightly lower compared to the WT N-BAR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The overall high protein packing densities (&gt;100,000 per Î¼m<sup>2</sup>), even for disease mutants on 100% DOPS membranes, are consistent with the notion that the mutants are still able to generate tubules from liposomes but with shorter lengths and lower probabilities, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, because of the slightly decreased protein densities compared to WT.</p>
        <p>For the composition 60%DOPC/20%DOPS/10%DOPE/10%PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), where disease mutants show significant variation in tubulation abilities, the membrane dissociation constants increased due to the reduced membrane charge. The observed membrane dissociation constants <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> are: 720 nMÂ±173 nM (WT), 1300 nMÂ±346 nM(K35N), 1000 nMÂ±415 nM (D151N) and 1800 nMÂ±57 nM (R154Q). The differences among <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values are on the order of thermal fluctuations. However, we obtained the saturation protein densities <italic>B<sub>max</sub></italic> from the curve fitting and found that <italic>B<sub>max</sub></italic> of the disease mutants were reduced compared to WT N-BAR, especially for the R154Q mutant. <italic>B<sub>max</sub></italic> of the R154Q mutant was 54Â±7% of the saturation density for WT N-BAR domain on the membrane. The decreases in <italic>B<sub>max</sub></italic> for the K35N (95Â±15%) and D151N (80Â±7%) mutants were less noticeable. These data suggest that R154Q impairs membrane association more severely compared to the other N-BAR variants considered here.</p>
        <p>Recent studies have assigned an important role of protein density on membranes in influencing curvature-coupling. Even protein crowding alone can lead to membrane tubulation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Stachowiak1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Sorre1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Our results from protein density quantification on GUVs suggest that the R154Q mutation reduces protein packing density on the membrane due to the loss of a positively charged residue at position 154, thus reducing electrostatic interactions between the N-BAR domain and negatively-charged membrane. Arginine is also often found inserted into the lipid bilayer<xref rid="pone.0093060-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Mutational studies of peptide-membrane interactions have revealed that arginine density governs the strength of peptide-lipid headgroup interactions and depth of insertion into the lipid membrane<xref rid="pone.0093060-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The crystal structure of the BIN1 N-BAR domain suggests that residue 154 is not oriented towards the membrane. However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that R154 contributes to membrane binding.</p>
        <p>N-BAR domains are known to function as curvature sensors<xref rid="pone.0093060-Baumgart1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The SLiC (<bold>S</bold>ingle <bold>Li</bold>posomes of different diameters and therefore <bold>C</bold>urvature) assay has revealed that N-BAR domains of endophilin preferentially bind to smaller liposomes with higher affinity and density<xref rid="pone.0093060-Bhatia2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, mainly through membrane defect sensing ability via the amphipathic H<sub>0</sub> helix<xref rid="pone.0093060-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. It has also been shown before that the N-BAR domain from endophilin is able to partition onto highly curved membranes<xref rid="pone.0093060-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We next asked the question if compromised curvature sensing ability caused the impaired membrane deformation capacity of the D151N mutant.</p>
        <p>To investigate the ability of the disease mutants to sense membrane curvature, we used a tether-pulling system to quantify the protein partitioning ratio between flat and curved membranes. In this assay, a tubular membrane was pulled from a GUV (composed of 59% DOPC/20% DOPS/10% DOPE/10% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>/0.5% DSPE-Bio-PEG2000/0.5% Texas Red-DHPE) by a polystyrene bead aspirated by a micro-pipette (for fluorescence imaging) or trapped by optical tweezers (for mechanical force measurement on tubule)<xref rid="pone.0093060-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. A typical fluorescence image of a tether-pulled vesicle is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6C</xref> (top panel). At a membrane tension of 0.12 mN/m, increased fluorescence signal on the tubular membrane relative to the quasiflat GUV was observed in WT N-BAR at 100 nM concentration. In contrast, significantly reduced fluorescence was found on vesicles incubated with R154Q under the same conditions, confirming our conclusion that R154Q binds to membranes more weakly than the WT protein.</p>

We note that curvature sorting behavior is known to be protein density dependent<xref rid="pone.0093060-Sorre1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Therefore, in the experiments just described, only vesicles showing comparable fluorescence intensities on GUVs were analyzed, as shown in the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>. An <italic>F</italic>-test of the linear regressions revealed that the slopes of the curvature sorting/square root of tension relationship comparing WT and K35N are indistinguishable.

<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0093060.e016.jpg"/></inline-formula> values for the D151N and R154Q mutants are slightly lower compared to WT N-BAR, these two mutants both show that the curvature sorting ratios <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0093060.e017.jpg"/></inline-formula>
<italic>/</italic>
<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0093060.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> increase proportionally to the square root of membrane tension. The slopes of the fluorescence intensity ratio for all the BIN1 variants investigated here deviate significantly from the null hypothesis of absent curvature sorting (slope â=â0). Results from the curvature sorting assay imply that CNM mutations do not eliminate the curvature sensing ability of N-BAR domains. The defective membrane deformation ability, especially for the D151N mutant, cannot be attributed to the loss of membrane curvature sensing ability.</p>
        <p>We next aimed to characterize curvature generation capacities of BIN1 N-BAR domains in more detail. The measurement of membrane tether pulling forces is a powerful assay to probe the mechanical influence of protein binding to membranes. With the help of optical tweezers, forces needed to mechanically stabilize tethers can be monitored in real time<xref rid="pone.0093060-Heinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. As expected, the presence (100 nM bulk concentration) of BIN1 N-BAR domains was observed to reduce tether pulling forces relative to a pure lipid control at a membrane tension of 0.21Â±0.003 mN/m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). This observation implies that binding of BIN1 N-BAR domains on the tether stabilizes membrane curvature.</p>
        <p>At the same bulk protein concentrations as the wt protein, equilibrium pulling forces on the tethers covered by BIN1 N-BAR mutants were lower and significantly different from the ones on a bare lipid tube, based on a Student <italic>t</italic> test. Although the R154Q mutant showed a higher pulling force on average compared to the other mutants, the differences among the mutants are not statistically significant. This is consistent with the observation that we found similar curvature-coupled protein sorting behaviors among the BIN1 variants. Particularly, the D151N mutant is able to sense and stabilize the pulled membrane tethers, but it is <italic>not</italic> able to induce spontaneous tubule formation from liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). A decrease of the curvature generation capacity of the R154Q mutant relative to the other mutants and the wt protein is likely to be caused by the decreased membrane association density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To summarize, membrane curvature sorting is displayed by all CNM-associated mutant proteins, and they are able to stabilize cylindrical membrane curvatures. The significantly higher pulling force measured on GUVs incubated with the R154Q mutant is a result of reduced membrane-bound density.</p>

        <title>D151N is unable to initiate curvature required for tubule growth, possibly due to impaired protein assembly/oligomerization on the membrane</title>
        <p>As shown above, the D151N mutant binds membranes and senses membrane curvature equivalently to the WT protein. However, the tubulation assay clearly demonstrated that the D151N mutation can impair tubulation under certain conditions.</p>
        <p>During clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), proteins including clathrin, AP2 and FCHo1/2, arrive at the plasma membrane at an early stage and nucleate to form initial buds that recruit other proteins, including BAR domain proteins, to further promote membrane invagination and scission<xref rid="pone.0093060-Traub1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Traub2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. In our tubulation assay, the initiation of membrane tubulation occurs via BAR domain protein binding only.</p>
        <p>In order to test the possibility that D151N is deficient in membrane budding initiation, we varied protein concentration in the EM tubulation assay to monitor membrane morphology changes as a function of protein concentration. We first examined BIN1 N-BAR WT in this manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g007">Fig. 7A</xref> shows micrographs of liposomes incubated with BIN1 N-BAR WT at various protein concentrations. At a low protein concentration of 200 nM, the morphologies of liposomes were similar to a lipid control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). When increasing protein concentration to 500 nM, membrane âwobblesâ appeared, as indicated by the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>. We speculate that those buds serve as sites for tubule growth through recruitment of additional proteins. Consistent with that idea, when we further raised protein concentration to 1 ÂµM and 5 ÂµM, tubule generation set in and tubule diameters decreased with increasing protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). However, we failed to observe membrane morphology changes for the D151N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) for a wide range of protein concentrations (200 nM-15 ÂµM). Because we have shown above that the ability to reduce the pulling force of a cylindrical membrane tether, as well as curvature sensing, are <italic><underline>not</underline></italic>
<underline> eliminated</underline> by D151N, we hypothesize that D151N impairs membrane budding at the onset of the tubulation process.</p>

        <p>Thus far, our results suggest that the D151N mutation interferes with membrane curvature initiation only, but retained the capacity to stabilize cylindrical membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g006">Fig. 6C&amp;D</xref>). We next asked, if the addition of a small amount of WT protein (large enough to cause budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) but small enough to prevent significant tubulation) might rescue the curvature initiation defect observed in the presence of D151N only. When only 500 nM WT N-BAR was incubated with liposomes, vesicle boundary wobbling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) was observed, in addition to the generation of some short tubes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093060.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>).

However, mixing 500 nM WT N-BAR with 4.5 ÂµM D151N mutants (achieving identical <italic>total</italic> protein concentration as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g004">Figs. 4</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g005">5</xref>) successfully rescued the N-BAR tubulation ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093060.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>&amp;B). Both budding and long tubule formation (&gt;1 ÂµM) were found in such samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093060.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>&amp;B). This observation supports our hypothesis that the defect for D151N tubule generation lies in impaired spontaneous curvature initiation (budding), instead of lack in cylindrical curvature stabilization.</p>
        <p>Cryo-EM reconstructions and simulations of endophilin N-BAR revealed that oligomeric assembly on flat and tubular membranes is essential for inducing and stabilizing tubulation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Mim1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Mizuno1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Additionally, recent computer simulations have proposed that transient protein lattice formation/aggregation on flat membranes is a prerequisite for tubulation induced by the N-BAR domain<xref rid="pone.0093060-Cui2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Simunovic1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Here, we used a chemical cross-linking assay to ask the question if failure in membrane budding by the D151N mutant was due to defective protein oligomerization<xref rid="pone.0093060-Gortat1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. In the absence of crosslinkers, BIN1 N-BAR and variants were monomeric in solution under denaturing conditions. SDS-PAGE gels showed a single band corresponding to a molecular weight around 30 kDa. At 0.5 mM or 5 mM crosslinker concentration, BIN N-BAR domains were crosslinked into dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). However, when liposomes were present, multiple oligomeric bands with molecular weight larger than a single dimer appeared on SDS-PAGE gels for the cases of WT and K35N, demonstrating that higher-ordered protein complexes were formed when associated with membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g008">Fig. 8A&amp;B</xref>). For these two proteins, after adding 5 mM BS3, a fraction of the crosslinked species became too large to be able to enter the resolving gel. Addition of BS3 crosslinker to the mixture of R154Q and liposomes resulted in diminishing dimer bands and an unresolvable pattern of oligomeric species on the gel. The unresolvable oligomer pattern of R154Q could be a result of the lowest membrane association affinity among all mutants. In contrast, we observed only dimer bands for D151N mutants in the presence (or absence) of liposomes confirming that the capacity to form protein assemblies on the membrane is impaired for the D151N mutant. Even at high crosslinker concentration (5 mM), absence of protein retention in the stacking gel indicated absence of D151N oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>).</p>

Since residue D151 is located in the arm region with the side chain pointing outward in the crystal structure, this orientation might allow for interaction with a charged residue from a neighboring BAR domain in an anti-parallel manner. The crystal structure reveals several charged or polar residues at the distal tip region. We screened these residues by mutation to alanines and transfected the resulting mutants in C2C12 cells to determine if they were important for maintenance of tubulation capacity as well.</p>
        <p>After a series of mutational analyses (confer <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0093060-t001">Table 1</xref>), residue H155 emerged as a possible candidate interacting with D151.

        <title>Tubulation induced by BIN1 N-BAR domain is antagonized by actin polymerization</title>
        <p>Thus far, we have not been able to identify any conditions under which K35N can be distinguished from WT BIN1 N-BAR domains except in cellular studies. We first recall that the K35 residue is predicted to be projected onto the charged surface of the N-terminal helix in BIN1<xref rid="pone.0093060-Nicot1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, thus the K35N mutation may influence helix insertion into the lipid membrane and influence membrane tubulation. To test this, we compared the interaction of WT and K35N BAR domain with lipid monolayers<xref rid="pone.0093060-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Levental1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The lipid monolayer was spread at a constant area at a given initial surface pressure (Ï<sub>0</sub>), and the change in surface pressure (ÎÏ) was monitored on a Langmuir trough after injection of proteins into the subphase. A linear relationship between ÎÏ and Ï<sub>0</sub> was observed that allows determination of the critical penetration pressure Ï<sub>c</sub>, which can be interpreted as the upper limit of Ï<sub>0</sub> that allows protein penetration into the lipid membrane. We determined close Ï<sub>c</sub> values for the WT and K35N BAR domains: 26.2 and 25.6 dyne/cm. According to an <italic>F</italic>-test on the linear regressions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>, the slopes are not significantly different but the intercepts (Ï<sub>c</sub>) differ slightly (pâ=â0.024). However, the Ï<sub>c</sub> values we determined here are below 31 dyne/cm, which is an estimated surface pressure for the cell membrane<xref rid="pone.0093060-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

New membrane tubules are generated after actin is depolymerized as the arrows indicate. No increased tubulation was observed in cells transfected with D151N and R154Q N-BAR* (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Furthermore, it has been reported that an extended N-BAR peptide that carries the N35 mutation cannot be distinguished from the 1â34 peptide in biophysical measurements including a tubulation assay<xref rid="pone.0093060-Low1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Thus, we next asked if there are other cellular processes regulating membrane tubulation and if perturbation of such processes might reveal a role of the K35N mutation. Specifically, we tested the role of actin in the membrane tubulation process and asked how perturbation of actin polymerization affects tubulation by disease mutants.</p>
        <p>To that end, C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with GFP-labeled BIN1 WT and K35N N-BAR* domains, and examined using TIRF microscopy. At <italic>t</italic>â=â0 s, cells were treated with. 1 ÂµM Latrunculin A, an actin polymerization inhibitor. GFP-positive membrane tubules started to grow from the plasma membrane shortly after inhibitor addition in cells expressing BIN1 N-BAR domains, or alternatively, the K35N mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>), similarly as reported before both for F-BAR domain proteins and other N-BAR proteins<xref rid="pone.0093060-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Itoh1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Importantly, we did not observe tubule formation from cells expressing D151N and R154Q mutants after depolymerizing the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown). This is consistent with our findings that D151N and R154Q are mutations that cause inability to deform membranes, while K35N behaves similarly to WT. This suggests that the tubulation ability of the K35N mutant is inhibited in cells, possibly by the cytoskeleton. However, it remains unknown if there are other proteins involved in coupling BIN1 to cytoskeletal components, and how the mutated N-terminal helix is involved in this inhibitory interaction.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, our studies have shown that both protein density and oligomerization on membranes determine membrane curvature generation ability. Based on the membrane structures revealed in the tubulation assay, we suggest that in order to initiate spontaneous liposome deformation and tubule growth, transient ordered protein oligomers are required to form on a flat membrane and to allow for the initiation of tubule formation. A schematic illustration of this process is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093060-g011">Fig. 11</xref>. We have divided the tubulation process into the following four steps:</p>

            <p>A membrane association step enables proteins to reach a certain density on the membrane. In the class of N-BAR domains, this interaction is primarily mediated by electrostatic interactions between charged residues located at the binding interface with negatively charged lipid headgroups. The membrane insertion of the amphipathic helix in the BAR domain also contributes to increasing the protein density on the membrane. GUV isotherm measurements demonstrated that the R154Q mutation led to decreased protein density on GUVs. We hypothesize that the reduced binding may result from the unfavorable charge change at residue 154, where a highly membrane binding and inserting residue has been mutated to a neutral one. Although, based on the crystal structure, R154 is located in the tip region of the BAR domain and the orientation of this residue does not point directly to the membrane binding interface. Given the length and the flexibility of the Arginine side chain, we hypothesize that the R154 residue may adopt a conformation allowing interactions with anionic lipids, thus the mutant R154Q may influence membrane binding by interrupting electrostatic interactions.</p>

            <p>With increasing protein density on the membrane, local curvature is induced as budding sites for tubule formation grow; a process where protein oligomerization is involved<xref rid="pone.0093060-Cui2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. At an intermediate protein concentration (500 nM), liposome boundaries developed wobbles and semi-spherical structures appeared on the membrane. We consider those buds as the initiation sites for tubulation to occur. In our experiments, we observed bud formation for both WT and K35N mutants, and for R154Q mutants at higher protein concentration. However, budding formation was absent in D151N mutants even at 15 ÂµM concentration. Our chemical crosslinking assay further confirmed that covalently crosslinked protein oligomers occurred under conditions where membrane deformations were induced by N-BAR domains. The D151N mutant specifically abolished protein assembly on the membrane. Our observations suggest a correlation between protein nucleation and membrane bud formation. This hypothesis is further supported by recent computational simulations, which reported that N-BAR domains form linear aggregates on the membrane, with emerging membrane buds at low surface protein densities<xref rid="pone.0093060-Mim1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Cui2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Simunovic1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.</p>

            <p>After the initial curved membrane is formed, BAR domains can sense the high curvature membrane and migrate onto tubules to facilitate tubule growth. Currently, the most popular interpretation of the membrane curvature sensing mechanism is that it is mediated by N-terminal amphipathic helix insertion in which curved membranes display increased membrane defect density promoting hydrophobic insertion<xref rid="pone.0093060-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Bhatia2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093060-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In our protein partitioning assay, we did not observe significant differences in curvature sensing ability among BIN1 N-BAR mutants. For the D151N and R154Q mutants, the intact N-terminal helix likely provides a driving force for curvature sensing. Strikingly, we observed that the K35N behaved similarly to WT BIN1 N-BAR domain. Previous studies on an extended N-terminal peptide of human Amphiphysin II (residue 1â44) have shown that K35N mutants cannot be distinguished from WT peptide in CD/NMR spectra and tubulation assays<xref rid="pone.0093060-Low1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Together with our <italic>in vitro</italic> biophysical measurements, it can therefore be inferred that the K35 residue is not critical for amphipathic helix function. Our preliminary findings implicate that the cytoskeleton plays a role, because upon actin depolymerization, K35N mutant in cells are able to tubulate membranes just as WT N-BAR. However, future work is needed to understand the role of the K35 residue in regulating protein tubulation ability.</p>

        <p>We have experimentally shown that protein-protein assembly is required to drive membrane bud formation in the early stage of membrane deformation which is consistent with the results from simulations<xref rid="pone.0093060-Simunovic1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. However, these simulations did not provide all-atom resolution to reveal the residues involved in lateral contacts among neighboring N-BAR domains. A mutagenesis screening performed at the BIN1 N-BAR tip region allowed us to identify potential residues regulating membrane deformation capacity. As a result, H155 caught our attention because mutation of this residue to a neutral amino acid abolishes tubule formation by N-BAR domains <italic>in-vivo</italic>. The fact that the double mutant D151N/H155R rescues tubulation ability of the BAR domain in cells is surprising. As expected, the purified double mutant retained the <italic>in-vitro</italic> membrane deformation capacity and membrane-mediated oligomerization (data not shown). One possible explanation is that D151 and H155 engage in an inter-molecular interaction of two BAR domain dimers on the membrane and facilitate the formation of a protein lattice. This might imply that arginine at the 155 position enhances the inter-molecular H-bond strength and may thus rescue the tubulation capacity in the disease mutant. This may be due to the fact that the enthalpic gain upon formation of the charged-neutral H-bond (D151â¦H155 in WT or N151â¦R155 in the double mutant) is greater compared to a neutral-neutral H-bond (N151â¦H155 in the disease mutant)<xref rid="pone.0093060-Tanner1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0093060-Gilli1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. To further test this idea, we constructed a double mutant where these two residues were swapped, and we expressed it in C2C12 myoblasts. Unfortunately, this test proved unsuccessful due to protein aggregations into vacuole-like structures. Future studies such as high-resolution reconstruction from Cryo-EM images may provide direct evidence for potential contact formation of these two residues upon membrane binding.</p>
        <p>In this study, we have focused on the differences in the membrane deformation ability among disease-related mutations in the N-BAR domain of BIN1. We hasten to remark that T-tubule biogenesis in skeletal muscle tissues is likely to be a more complicated process than discussed here. This is in part due to the fact that in the full-length BIN1 protein, exon10-encoded peptide and SH3 domain contribute to the regulation of membrane deformation ability of the BIN1 protein. Particularly, the SH3 domain acts as an adaptor to allow BIN1 complexation with other proteins to modulate membrane morphology. In addition to dynamin2, it has been recently discovered that myotubularin (MTM1) binds the BIN1 SH3 domain and enhances BIN1-mediated membrane tubulation. Binding between SH3 domain and downstream proteins such as dynamin2 and MTM1 induces a conformational change in full-length BIN1 that favors membrane deformation<xref rid="pone.0093060-Royer1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. This finding supports a more complex pathological mechanism in centronuclear myopathy. The mutations we examined in this study do not have an impact on MTM1 recruitment to BIN1 because they were located outside of the SH3 domain. This finding also supported our argument that mutations in the N-BAR domain did not alter the protein conformation as confirmed by CD spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography. Thus, the biophysical measurements we performed here provide a basis for elucidating molecular mechanisms contributing to membrane deformation defects in the CNM-related mutations, specifically in the N-BAR domain.</p>

Pipette tips were cut using a microforge at desired inner diameters of 5â¼8 Âµm. Irreversible adhesion of membrane to the pipette was prevented by filling the pipette tips with 2.5 mg/ml casein dissolved in 1x PBS. Pipettes were then rinsed and filled with 300 mM sucrose solution using a MicroFil needle (WPI, Sarasota, FL). A sample chamber was formed from two coverslips overhanging both sides of a microscope glass slide, creating a 1 mm thick cell that was open on three sides to allow the insertion of a micropipette. The bottom of the chamber was pre-coated with 2 ÂµL of 2.5 mg/ml casein (dissolved in 1x PBS) to prevent the adhesion of microspheres and GUVs to the coverslip. A mixture of sucrose and buffer solution with the same osmolarity as the GUV dispersion was prepared while keeping the NaCl concentration at 50 mM. The chamber was filled with 90â¼100 ÂµL of sucrose and buffer mixture, 1 ÂµL of microsphere dispersion and 3 ÂµL of GUV dispersion. BIN1 was added to reach the desired concentration. The chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope (1Ã71; Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a home built optical trap, which uses a second, independently positioned objective (60X, 1.1 NA, water immersion, 1.5 mm working distance; Olympus) oriented opposite to the imaging objective to introduce a 1064 nm wavelength laser into the chamber. Micropipettes were moved via a three-dimensional motorized micromanipulator system (Luigs &amp; Neumann, Ratingen, Germany). Aspiration pressure was controlled through adjustments of the height of a water reservoir, and pressures were measured with a differential pressure transducer (Validyne Engineering, Los Angeles, CA). The chamber was equilibrated for 10â¼20 min before an individual GUV (typically between 8 and 15 Âµm in radius) was aspirated at a constant pressure. A subsequently trapped bead was brought into contact with the vesicle, and then either the vesicle or the bead was retracted at a speed about 5 Âµm/s, generating a membrane tether around 10â¼20 Âµm in length. Forces exerted on the bead were measured in real-time. Aspiration pressure was changed subsequently to generate the relation between tether pulling force and membrane lateral tension.

Two micropipettes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), which were fabricated by using a microforge, were inserted into the sample chamber by a three-dimensional motorized manipulator system (Luigs and Neumann, Ratingen, Germany).

The membrane tension of the vesicle was controlled by adjusting the height of a connected water reservoir, and measured by a pressure transducer with a DP-28 diaphragm (Validyne Engineering, Los Angeles, CA). The other pipette then aspirated a bead, contacted the vesicle, and was moved away to pull a membrane tether. We used Kalman-averaged images of the tether cross section (xz plane, which was orthogonal to the axis of the tether) for measuring tether fluorescence intensities, with a stepwidth of 0.15 Âµm and a total imaging depth of 6 Âµm.

A) BIN N-BAR* WT and mutants are fused to EGFP at the N-terminus and transiently transfected in C2C12 myoblasts. Cells are imaged via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Similar tubulation phenotypes are observed as in the case of the C-terminal labeled proteins. Scale bar: 20 Âµm. B) Quantification of three types of membrane deformations by BIN1 N-BAR* variants. Clusters are defined as structures with lengths not longer than five times of their width. Over 50 cells were analyzed in each separated experiments.

          <p>Mixing D151N mutants with 500 nM WT N-BAR restores tubulation. Electron micrographs of liposome A) 500 nM WT+4.5 ÂµM D151N. Scale bar: 200 nm. B) Quantification of tubulation enhancement after mixing WT N-BAR with D151N. 500 nM WT primarily generates membrane buds on vesicles with occasional tubules found on the grid. D151N consistently had a negligible effect on membrane morphology. When mixing D151N N-BAR with 500 nM WT N-BAR domain, tubulation was observed suggesting D151N was able to induce membrane tubule elongation as long as the initiation intermediates were present. Over 30 images were analyzed. Error bars: standard error of the mean in black and standard deviation in light grey.
