      <abstract>
        <p>Cilia are highly conserved microtubule-based structures that perform a variety of sensory and motility functions during development and adult homeostasis. In humans, defects specifically affecting motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, infertility and laterality defects in the genetically heterogeneous disorder Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Using the comparatively simple <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, in which mechanosensory neurons possess modified motile cilia, we employed a recently elucidated cilia transcriptional RFX-FOX code to identify novel PCD candidate genes. Here, we report characterization of <italic>CG31320/HEATR2</italic>, which plays a conserved critical role in forming the axonemal dynein arms required for ciliary motility in both flies and humans. Inner and outer arm dyneins are absent from axonemes of <italic>CG31320</italic> mutant flies and from PCD individuals with a novel splice-acceptor <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutation. Functional conservation of closely arranged RFX-FOX binding sites upstream of <italic>HEATR2</italic> orthologues may drive higher cytoplasmic expression of HEATR2 during early motile ciliogenesis. Immunoprecipitation reveals HEATR2 interacts with DNAI2, but not HSP70 or HSP90, distinguishing it from the client/chaperone functions described for other cytoplasmic proteins required for dynein arm assembly such as DNAAF1-4. These data implicate <italic>CG31320/HEATR2</italic> in a growing intracellular pre-assembly and transport network that is necessary to deliver functional dynein machinery to the ciliary compartment for integration into the motile axoneme.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cilia are small, specialized projections extending from a cell's surface that play key sensory and sometimes motility functions, such as generating fluid flow for clearing airways or sperm propulsion necessary for male fertility. Ciliary motility is defective in the inherited disease, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Although the basic cilium blueprint has been elaborated on during evolution, many of the core genes involved in building or maintaining functional cilia have been conserved. We have used the comparatively simple fruit fly, which has motile cilia on only a handful of touch-sensitive sensory cells, to identify genes involved in ciliary motility and which are therefore candidate genes for causing PCD. We show here that when one such gene (<italic>CG31320/HEATR2</italic>) is disrupted in either flies or in human PCD patients, cilia form but they cannot move. We show this protein stays in the cytoplasm, where it is acts like a flexible scaffold stabilizing and facilitating interactions during the assembly of large multi-component ciliary motor complexes needed to power cilia movement.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cilia and flagella are small microtubule-based projections on the cell surface, where they perform diverse sensory, and in some cases motility functions. These highly conserved organelles are found across species from protozoa to mammals, and are believed to have evolved from flagellar structures found in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. At their core is an axoneme composed of a peripheral arrangement of 9 microtubule doublets. Extension and maintenance of cilia involves a conserved microtubule-based process of motor-driven intraflagellar transport (IFT) that traffics protein cargo from the ciliary base to the tip, and back again. Despite the functional and structural diversity that has arisen among cilia <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Choksi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, they retain key elements. Axonemes of motile cilia, which usually have an additional central pair of singlet microtubules in a â9+2â arrangement, possess inner (IDA) and outer dynein arms (ODA) attached to the peripheral outer doublet A microtubule. These orchestrate the ATP-dependent sliding of the doublets relative to each other, enabling motility. Recent genomic and proteomic studies have compiled a âmotile ciliomeâ, now consisting of several hundred centrosomal and ciliary components. However, how these components are assembled into different structural and functional cilia types remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Disorders specifically arising from dysfunction of motile cilia are called Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias (PCD, MIM244400). As a result of defective airway mucociliary clearance, individuals with PCD typically present in the first year of life with recurrent infections, rhinosinusitis and otitis media, resulting in a chronic respiratory condition which can progress to permanent lung damage (bronchiectasis). Around half of PCD patients also have laterality defects as a result of embryonic nodal cilia dysfunction that lead to randomization of the left-right body axis, most commonly situs inversus totalis (Kartagener syndrome) or more rarely heterotaxy defects affecting the heart. Fertility defects are also reported in individuals with PCD. PCD is genetically heterogeneous, and 27 causative loci have been identified to date, but these still account for only a fraction of total cases <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Leigh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Kott1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Diagnosis of PCD typically involves identification of ultrastructural defects of the motile ciliary axoneme, over 70% of which involve the loss of ODA. Many cases of PCD can be attributed to mutations in genes encoding ultrastructural components of motile cilia such as dynein subunits or proteins involved in their docking and targeting <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Pennarun1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Knowles1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, central pair microtubules <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Olbrich2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, radial spokes <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Kott1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Castleman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and nexin-dynein regulatory complex <xref rid="pgen.1004577-BeckerHeck1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Wirschell1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Less well functionally characterized are a growing group of cytoplasmic factors that are putatively involved in trafficking or stability of dynein arm components (<italic>DNAAF1/LRRC50</italic>, <italic>DNAAF2/KTU</italic>, <italic>DNAAF3/PF22</italic>, <italic>DNAAF4/DYX1C1</italic>, <italic>HEATR2</italic>, <italic>LRRC6</italic>, <italic>SPAG1</italic>, <italic>ZMYND10</italic>, <italic>CCDC103</italic>, <italic>C21ORF59</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1004577-AustinTse1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Zariwala2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Several of these Dynein Axonemal Assembly Factors, such as the case for DNAAF1-4, work directly within a heat-shock protein (HSP)-based molecular chaperone complexes to direct the proper folding of axonemal dynein subunits <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Tarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the complexity of the motile cilia assembly and function, it is possible that there is an underlying conserved transcriptional programme that could be used to identify further PCD candidate genes? Expression of the core ciliogenic programme, including components of the IFT and BBSome machinery, is regulated at the transcriptional level in part by the regulatory factor X (RFX) family of transcription factors <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Choksi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. RFX proteins are essential for ciliogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Swoboda1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Dubruille1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Of the eight paralogues that exist in mammals, <italic>Rfx2</italic> and <italic>Rfx3</italic> have been implicated in vertebrate motile ciliogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Baas1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. These proteins contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, which directly interacts with a consensus sequence, the X-box motif <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Swoboda1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-ElZein1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Reith1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Laurenon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Identification of X-boxes in promoters of genes transcriptionally activated during ciliogenesis has been previously used for identification of putative ciliopathy candidates <xref rid="pgen.1004577-AvidorReiss1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been proposed that the diversity of cilia function could arise from elaboration of a core ciliary transcriptome through additional transcriptional controls <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Choksi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. FOXJ1 (HFH4), a forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor, has been shown to activate gene expression required for motile cilia formation <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. FOXJ1 is highly expressed in tissues with motile cilia <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Blatt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and only motile cilia are affected in <italic>Foxj1</italic> null mice <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Brody1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>FoxJ1</italic> is sufficient to confer some motile functions on primary cilia in both <italic>D. renio</italic> and <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Stubbs1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Functional diversification of specific subsets of motile cilia involves other transcription factors including the homeobox NOTO for nodal cilia <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Beckers1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Alten1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, as well as MYB and nuclear MULTICILIN for multiciliated epithelia <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Stubbs2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Unlike their wide distribution and diverse types in vertebrates, cilia in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are very restricted. The only somatic cells with cilia in flies are sensory neurons, which have specialized ciliary dendrites for sensory reception. Only a subset of these, the proprioceptive and auditory chordotonal (Ch) neurons, possess cilia that are motile. As a result, genes encoding axonemal dynein subunits and other motility components are uniquely expressed in Ch neurons and spermatocytes. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna, Ch neuron ciliary motility is proposed to be part of a mechanical amplification process involved in transducing sound vibrations through the interplay of motors and transduction channels <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Nadrowski1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. This simplicity of cilia diversity is recapitulated at the transcriptional level. A single <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rfx member controls expression of core ciliogenic targets in all ciliated sensory neurons <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Vandaele1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Although the existence of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> FOXJ1 orthologue had been questioned, we recently demonstrated that the diverged Fox gene <italic>fd3F</italic> is required for Ch neuron function <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Cachero1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and fulfills a role equivalent to <italic>Foxj1</italic> genes in vertebrates <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Fd3F protein cooperates with Rfx to control expression of Ch-specific genes, including those encoding many structural components of the motility machinery such as ODA subunits (dynein heavy chain <italic>Dhc93AB</italic>, homolog of DNAH9/11), and IDA subunits (<italic>Dhc16F</italic>, homolog of <italic>DNAH6</italic>, and <italic>CG6971</italic>, homolog of <italic>DNALI1</italic>). In addition, Fd3F was found to regulate several unknown or poorly characterized genes that shared a similar Ch neuron-specific transcriptional profile. Some of these have subsequently been found to encode cytoplasmic proteins that are implicated in the assembly and/or transport of the dynein arm apparatus (<italic>tilB</italic>/<italic>LRRC6</italic>, <italic>dtr</italic>/<italic>DNAAF1</italic>), and their mutation in humans leads to PCD. In the majority of these target genes, conserved Fox and Rfx consensus binding motifs could be found in their promoters in close proximity to the transcriptional start site <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. We hypothesized that this transcriptional fingerprint could be used to predict novel components of the motile cilia machinery as a route to finding additional human orthologues potentially involved in PCD.</p>
      <p>Here, we present our studies on one such candidate, <italic>CG31320</italic>/<italic>HEATR2</italic>, which plays a conserved role in the assembly and/or stability of ODA and IDA in humans and in flies. We identify a novel splice-acceptor <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutation in a PCD family associated with respiratory and laterality defects. <italic>CG31320</italic> mutant flies exhibit aberrant proprioception, deafness and immotile sperm due to ciliary/flagella motility defects, which correlates with a lack of ODA and IDA in the cilia. Similar to the RFX- and FdF3- regulated expression of <italic>CG31320</italic> in Ch neurons, we show higher levels of cytoplasmic HEATR2 early in mammalian motile ciliogenesis within differentiating cells that also express high RFX3 and FOXJ1. We present human HEATR2 immunoprecipitation data showing interaction with outer arm dynein intermediate chain DNAI2, but not other DNAAFs or HSPs. We therefore propose that HEATR2 is unique amongst known DNAAFs as it acts in the early stages of cytoplasmic dynein preassembly but not in a classic chaperone/client function. We suggest HEATR2 functions as a flexible scaffold for stabilizing interactions between dynein subunits, like DNAI2, during cytoplasmic pre-assembly.</p>

        <p>We identified an extended UK-Pakistani family with three affected children presenting with PCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The proband (IVâ¶4) presented at the age of 3 with chronic respiratory infections, middle ear disease and chronic nasal discharge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004577-t001">Table 1</xref>). She had also experienced neonatal respiratory distress and dextrocardia was apparent on chest X-ray. Nasal ciliary biopsy confirmed the PCD diagnosis by video microscopy, and written reports of transmission electron microscopy revealed absence of both IDA and ODA (data not shown). Her cousins subsequently presented at the age of 2 (IVâ¶1) and 4 (IVâ¶10) with chronic chest infections and nasal discharge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004577-t001">Table 1</xref>). The diagnosis of PCD was confirmed in both these latter cases by nasal ciliary biopsy, again electron microscopy confirmed absence of both inner and outer dynein arms.</p>

            <p>(A) Pedigree of related families of UK-Pakistani descent. IVâ¶4 identifies the proband, also designated by the arrow. Solid symbols (individuals IVâ¶1, IVâ¶4 and IVâ¶10) indicate those affected with PCD. Double lines indicate consanguineous marriages. The individuals labeled DNA signified those that had their DNA included in SNP genotyping. (B) Schematic of <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript showing the transversion mutation (<italic>ENST00000297440:c.2432-1G&gt;C</italic>) affecting the splice acceptor site of the final exon. The mutation results in inactivation of this splice site and utilization of an adjacent downstream cryptic splice acceptor site in exon 13, causing a 2-nucleotide AG deletion in the <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript, resulting in a frameshift in translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). This is predicted to alter the final 44 amino acids of the protein and add an additional 33 amino acids with creation of a novel termination signal at codon 888 in the 3â²UTR (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). This mutation disrupts the final highly conserved HEAT repeat and alters the C-terminus of the ARM-type fold superfamily domain (red). (C) Relative expression levels of <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript by RT-qPCR, when normalized to the reference <italic>TBP</italic> gene. (D) The PCD transversion mutation (<italic>ENST00000297440:c.2432-1G&gt;C</italic>) does not affect <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript stability or gross splicing as shown by RT-PCR on parental control (C) and patient (P*) cDNA from LCLs. PCR products spanning the gene including the splice acceptor mutation at Exon 11â13 and Exon 12-3â²UTR show no obvious alterations in size. Direct sequencing confirmed a 2 base pair deletion consistent with efficient splicing to the cryptic splice acceptor at the start of exon 13 in PCD patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). (E) Western blot analysis on total protein extracts from unrelated control, heterozygous parental and homozygous patient LCLs demonstrates the PCD mutation (<italic>ENST00000297440:c.2432-1G&gt;C</italic>) results in an elongated HEATR2 protein present at reduced levels implying instability. The slight shift in mobility of the protein in the patient is consistent with the predicted 3 kDa size shift due to the amino acid alterations described. Î²-actin is used as a loading control. (For longer exposure see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). (F) Levels of HEATR2 protein normalized relative to Î²-actin reveal that parental samples which are heterozygous for the mutation shows a reduction to â50% of that of unrelated controls whilst the homozygous patient sample shows a reduction to â3% of control levels.</p>

        <p>Whole genome SNP autozygosity mapping in this consanguineous family identified a single concordant homozygous region of 2.6 Mb on chromosome 7â¶46,239â3,179,991 (GRCh37) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) shared by all three affecteds and not seen in unaffected sibs. A custom oligonucleotide array was designed to capture all exons as well as intron/exon boundaries within the interval, and these were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing. This identified a single potentially pathogenic variant c.2432-1G&gt;C in the splice acceptor site of the final exon of <italic>HEATR2</italic> (NM_017802). Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of the variant with the phenotype within the family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The change which affects the highly conserved AG of the consensus U2-type splice acceptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) is absent in 176 ethnically matched control individuals as well in 6503 European and African American subjects in the Exome Variant Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/">http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/</ext-link>) (November, 2013 accessed)). With a total of 13,358 genotyped control chromosomes, we could significantly achieve greater than 95% power to exclude the likelihood that this is an uncommon SNP with an allele frequency of 0.1% <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, strongly indicating that this is the PCD causative mutation. All <italic>HEATR2</italic> exons were sequenced in an additional 23 PCD patients but no further mutations were detected. However, another PCD-causing <italic>HEATR2</italic> allele has been recently reported among a Midwest American Amish pedigree which contains a missense Leu795Pro mutation in a highly conserved residue in exon 12 <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Together, these studies indicate that independent mutations in <italic>HEATR2</italic> contribute to a small proportion of PCD cases.</p>
        <p>We sequenced <italic>HEATR2</italic> cDNA from patients to investigate the consequences of the G-to-C transversion mutation on <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcripts. The PCD transversion mutation (<italic>ENST00000297440:c.2432-1G&gt;C</italic>) affects the terminal G of the AG at the end of intron 12/13 located within the exon 13 splice acceptor consensus sequence. In patients, the first two coding bases of exon 13, also AG, create a cryptic splice site immediately adjacent which is utilised, resulting in a two base pair deletion of <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript and a consequent coding frameshift within exon 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The mutation does not affect mutant <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript stability as shown by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR from parental control and patient cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1C, D</xref>), with the heterozygous parental samples containing approximately equal levels of each splicing variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). RT-PCR products spanning the splice acceptor mutation, exon 11â13 and exon 12-3â²UTR showed no significant alterations in size, consistent with efficient splicing to the cryptic splice acceptor at the start of exon 13 in PCD patients and loss of just 2 bp (confirmed by sequencing) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">S2B</xref>). Moreover, ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) using riboprobes containing portions of exons 12 and 13 from unaffected control and patient cDNA confirmed with high sensitivity and specificity these splicing events are occurring in mutant <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>This PCD mutation and consequent frameshift (<italic>c.2432-2433delAG</italic>) was predicted to replace the final 44 amino acids of HEATR2 protein with 77 novel amino acids (<italic>pGlu811GlyfsTer78</italic>: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). This mutation would disrupt the last of ten highly conserved HEAT repeats and alter the C-terminus of the ARM-type fold superfamily domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This simple array of repeating motifs is found in Î±-solenoid proteins and is best characterized by Î²-importin with 19 HEAT repeats. They are believed to create a highly flexible macromolecule with large surface area key for mediating protein-protein binding, both in terms of cargo selection and interactions with cell transport machinery <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Kappel1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Western blot analysis confirmed the PCD HEATR2 mutation (<italic>pGlu811GlyfsTer78</italic>) resulted in a slight shift in mobility consistent with the predicted 3 kDa size increase. More striking, however, was a striking reduction in total HEATR2 levels in the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s003">S3B</xref>). Parental samples, heterozygous for the mutation, showed a â50% reduction in Î² actin-normalized HEATR2 levels compared to unrelated controls whilst the homozygous patient samples were â3% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests the mutation (<italic>pGlu811GlyfsTer78</italic>) resulted in pathogenic changes in the amino acid sequence and C-terminal structure of HEATR2 protein resulting in its instability. Our study supports the recent report <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> of <italic>HEATR2's</italic> contribution to the genetic heterogeneity underlying Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.</p>

          <p>Given its expression in early differentiating Ch neurons, we next investigated whether <italic>CG31320</italic> is regulated by ciliary transcription factors. We found that <italic>CG31320</italic> expression is Rfx-dependent, since <italic>CG31320</italic> expression is lost in <italic>Rfx</italic> mutant Ch neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g002">Figure 2E,F</xref>). <italic>CG31320</italic> expression in Ch neurons was also <italic>fd3F</italic>-dependent, as it was absent in <italic>fd3F</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g002">Figure 2G,H</xref>; <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>) and could be induced ectopically by forced Fd3F expression in all the Rfx-positive non-motile ciliated sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). These studies demonstrate that <italic>CG31320</italic> expression is restricted in a <italic>Rfx-</italic> and <italic>fd3F</italic>-dependent manner to the neural cells that form specialized motile cilia. Outside the Ch lineage, <italic>CG31320</italic> expression was also detected transiently in early stage 12 non-ciliated mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and in the adult testes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0051320.html">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0051320.html</ext-link>); its transcriptional control in these lineages remains unclear.</p>
          <p>To determine whether <italic>CG31320</italic> is required for ciliary motility, we generated <italic>CG31320</italic> mutant flies by imprecise excision of an associated P element in the line <italic>CG31320<sup>EY06677</sup></italic>. The resultant excision line <italic>CG31320<sup>27</sup></italic> had a 992-bp deletion of the 5â² end of the gene, including the transcriptional and translational start sites, and <italic>CG31320</italic> mRNA was absent in homozygous <italic>CG31320<sup>27</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Visual inspection of deletion mutants showed a complete lack of surviving homozygote adult flies while homozygote larvae were smaller but with no obvious morphological defects. Since Ch neuron dysfunction is not lethal, this suggests a vital non-cilial role for <italic>CG31320</italic> correlating with its expression in the developing midgut, which may affect nutrition. To bypass this lethality and focus on the cilial role, we used a Gal4-inducible RNAi line (P{KK102625}VIE-260B) to generate knock-downs lacking <italic>CG31320</italic> specifically in embryonic and adult developing sensory neurons (<italic>scaGal4 UAS-Dcr2/UAS-CG31320-KK102625 RNAi</italic>). RNAi generated knock-down embryos showed a strong reduction in neural <italic>CG31320</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g003">Figure 3A,D</xref>). These knock-down flies are viable but uncoordinated, performing poorly in climbing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g003">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that Ch neurons are defective as these are required for proprioception during coordinated locomotion. Ch neurons are also required for hearing, and so we tested for larval auditory function. Control larvae contract abruptly when exposed to a 1-kHz tone, due to auditory reception by Ch neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). In contrast, <italic>CG31320</italic> knock-down larvae failed to respond to the tone.</p>

<italic>CG31320</italic> is also expressed in the adult testes, which contains the only other motile cilium-like structure in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the sperm flagellum.

Moreover, extension and maintenance of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm flagella is IFT-independent, such that IFT-B mutant sperm are motile and structurally normal.

Although such males can mate, they are sterile (nâ=â20 males tested) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g004">Figure 4J</xref>). We examined sperm development in control and mutant testes. Normally spermatogonial germ cells at the apical tip of testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g004">Figure 4A</xref> asterisk) go through 4 synchronous mitotic amplifications with incomplete cytokinesis to produce a cyst of 16 interconnected spermatogonia (or primary spermatocytes). Eventually all 16 spermatocytes undergo meiosis I and II, to form a cyst of 64 inter-connected primary spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g004">Figure 4A</xref> arrowhead). Formation of sperm axonemes yields a bundle of extremely long spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g004">Figure 4A</xref> (arrows) and 4C) that stretch almost the entire length of the testis. The final step in spermatogenesis is a highly complex process of membrane remodelling called individualisation to yield 64 individual sperm that are then transferred to the seminal vesicle (SV) in a process which appears to be dependent on sperm motility. <italic>CG31320</italic> knock-down testes appeared to develop normally and mature sperm were clearly present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g004">Figure 4B, D</xref>), but no motile sperm were observed in the SV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g004">Figure 4F:</xref> SV with motile sperm in 0/23 mutant testes examined compared with 23/23 control testes).</p>

            <p>
<italic>CG31320/HEATR2</italic> orthologues are found in species with cilia/flagella that have motile function and retain elements of the axonemal dyneins required for this motility. Species which have no cilia (<italic>ie.</italic> amoebozoans, flowering plants, yeast) or those which lack motile cilia (<italic>i.e.</italic> nematodes) have lost <italic>HEATR2</italic> orthologues as well as the axonemal dynein genes. Interestingly, unusual species with variant motility programmes still retain <italic>HEATR2</italic> orthologues. These include <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> whose male gametes have motile axonemes without inner arm dyneins, and <italic>P. patens</italic>, whose male gametes have motile flagella without outer arm dyneins. Similarly, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which assembles its flagella intracytosolically through an IFT-independent programme, retains a <italic>HEATR2</italic> orthologue.

        <p>To further explore developmental transcriptional control of mammalian <italic>Heatr2</italic> during formation of motile multiciliated cells (MMCs), we first used RT-qPCR during mouse embryonic trachea and lung development. Ciliation in developing mouse airway epithelia occurs in a distinct spatial and temporal manner, from E14.0 when the first few <italic>FoxJ1</italic>-positive epithelial cells emerge in a proximal-distal sequence <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Rawlins1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>.

RT-qPCR analysis of E14.5 through to P2 mouse trachea and lungs revealed <italic>Dnah5</italic>, <italic>Dnali1</italic> and <italic>Zmynd10</italic> to have exponential expression curves during development (similar to <italic>FoxJ1</italic>), whilst <italic>Rfx3</italic> and <italic>Heatr2</italic> followed more linear increases in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Both <italic>Rfx3</italic> and <italic>Heatr2</italic> were detected prior to <italic>FoxJ1</italic> expression, but a highly significant two fold increase in <italic>Heatr2</italic> expression was observed during <italic>Foxj1</italic>-dependent differentiation (<italic>Heatr2</italic>: 2.73Â±0.501 (SEM), E14.5 vs. P0: One-way Kruskal-Wallis test P&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U-Test P&lt;0.01). We next refined the spatial expression pattern of HEATR2, RFX3 and FOXJ1 by immunofluorescence in the developing bronchial epithelium at E15.5, prior to multiciliation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g007">Figure 7B, C</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s006">Figure S6A,B</xref>). During this proximal-to-distal wave of differentiation, only the larger proximal airways had interspersed cells expressing high levels of FOXJ1 and RFX3, as well as subunits of inner and outer arm dyneins DNALI1 and DNAI2. These same cells expressed high levels of HEATR2. At other stages and sites of MMC differentiation, HEATR2 is expressed in a âsalt-and pepperâ pattern, including E18.5 epithelial cells of trachea and bronchus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s006">Figure S6C,D</xref>), as well as in ependymal cells lining the lateral ventricles of P5 brains and MMCs lining the adult oviduct ampulla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s006">Figure S6E</xref>, F). For comparative analysis of human cilia, we used asynchronous nasal brush epithelial cells from healthy controls, in which we were able to distinguish both immature cells (arrow) alongside terminally differentiated and fully ciliated mature cells (arrowhead). This revealed that HEATR2 expression was highest in immature cells in the process of extending multicilia, which were also those expressing higher nuclear RFX3 and FOXJ1 and predominantly cytoplasmic DNALI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g007">Figure 7DâG</xref>). In adjacent fully mature MMCs, when DNALI1 was predominantly axonemal, comparatively lower levels of HEATR2 were observed, as well as lower RFX3 and FOXJ1 expression (arrowheads <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g007">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that while <italic>Heatr2</italic> expression in mammals has evolved more complex transcriptional control compared to flies, the conserved FOX/RFX ciliary motility signature we identified is still used to drive dynamic high level expression at a developmental window when axonemal dynein pre-assembly is occurring in the cytoplasm.</p>

        <p>HEATR2 was an interesting candidate for functional characterization as it had not been identified in any of the ciliary axoneme <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Ostrowski1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Pazour1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> or centrosome <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Keller1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref> proteomic studies. This presumably was due to isolation techniques used in these studies focused on cilial/flagellar axonemes and precluded the identification of cytoplasmic components involved in ciliogenesis. Indeed, we find that endogenous HEATR2 shows granular localization throughout the cytoplasm in human nasal epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g008">Figure 8A,C</xref>), but is never detected in the ciliary axonemes even transiently in immature MMCs when the pool of outer (as represented by DNAH5 and DNAI2) and inner (as represented by DNALI1) arm dynein subunits are predominantly cytoplasmic and moving into the ciliary compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g008">Figure 8AâC</xref>). This extends recent findings reported by Horani et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, both tagged CG31320 (brackets: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g008">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s007">S7</xref>) and HEATR2 (arrowheads: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s006">Figure S6G</xref>) remained cytoplasmic, without any axonemal localization, in fly Ch neurons and mouse cells respectively. Together, these data define a temporospatial window of highest HEATR2/CG31320 expression, and likely function, during early cytoplasmic dynein pre-assembly.</p>

            <p>(AâC) Immunostaining of control human nasal brush epithelia reveals endogenous HEATR2 (red: Novus (A), Proteintech (C)) is highly enriched in the cytoplasm of developing MMC when components of outer dynein arms (B: DNAH5, red; C: DNAI2: green) as well as inner dynein arms (AâC: DNALI1, purple) are predominantly cytoplasmic. Arrowheads highlight fully mature MMCs where these components are exclusively axonemal and with relatively lower levels of HEATR2. Arrows highlight immature MMCs for comparison. Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue).

        <p>Given the loss of identifiable IDA and ODA in fly <italic>CG31320</italic> and human <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutant cilia, we next asked how HEATR2 was affecting the localization of axonemal components of motile cilia. Similar to previous outer arm defects by DNAI1 immunofluorescence <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, no expression of outer arm dynein DNAH5 was detected by immunofluorescence in patient <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutant cilia (arrowheads: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Fliegauf1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Endogenous HEATR2 complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation from terminally differentiated control human bronchial epithelial lysates and immunoblotted with antibodies against components of dynein arms (DNAH5, DNALI1, DNAI2), dynein assembly factors (KTU, DNAAF3, ZMYND10) as well as chaperones (HSP70, HSP90). In terminally differentiated cells, we were able to establish that HEATR2 interacts with DNAI2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), a critical component added in the initial step of ODA assembly <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, but not other axonemal dynein components, dynein assembly factors or chaperones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s008">Figure S8</xref>). These findings are confirmed by previous studies showing that the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNAI2 orthologue DIC2/IC78 is near absent in <italic>htr2</italic> RNAi mutant axonemal extracts <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, suggesting this interaction is conserved and of functional significance to the ODA loss phenotype in <italic>HEATR2</italic>-mutant cilia. Consistent with the absence of IDA from <italic>HEATR2</italic> PCD patient and mutant fly axonemes observed by TEM, endogenous DNALI1 was not detected in <italic>HEATR2</italic> PCD mutant cilia by immunofluorescence (arrowheads: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g009">Figure 9C</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Rashid1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref> and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> a tagged orthologue <italic>CG6971::mVenus</italic> failed to enter axonemes in <italic>CG31320</italic> knock-down Ch neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). The mechanism for HEATR2 in controlling IDA assembly remains unclear as we were unable to confirm interactions with DNALI1 or other DNAAFs in terminally differentiated MMCs.</p>

            <p>(A) Immunofluorescence for axonemal dynein heavy chain 5 (DNAH5: green) on respiratory cells from patients with <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutations compared to non-related control cells, shows loss of type 1 and type 2 DNAH5-positive staining although axonemes are still present (acetylated tubulin:red). Nuclei are stained with DAPI. (Scale bar: 10 Âµm). (B) Extracts prepared from control human terminally differentiated respiratory airway cultures (40 days ALI, Epithelyx) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies to HEATR2 (Proteintech) or control rabbit immunoglobulin G (GFP). Resulting immunocomplexes (IP: right) as well as dilutions of original extract (INPUT: left) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to HEATR2 (Proteintech) or DNAI2 (Abnova). (See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s008">Figure S8</xref>). (C) No staining of axonemal dynein light intermediate chain 1 (DNALI1: green) is observed in patients with <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutations. No signal above background is detected in patient cells, in contrast to strong axonemal localization in non-related control cells. Nuclei are stained with DAPI. (Scale bar: 10 Âµm). (D) The DNALI1 orthologue in fly, <italic>CG6971::mVenus</italic> (green), fails to localize to ciliary axonemes (Ci: cilia, marked with square bracket) of Ch neurons (magenta: 22C10/Futsch) in <italic>CG31320</italic> knock-down larvae. (E) Schematic of dynamic role of HEATR2 in developing airway epithelial MMCs. Progenitor cells exit the cell cycle to commit to the MMC lineage with primary cilia. These cells express low levels of RFX3 (light red nuclei). Other upstream factors governing multiciliogenesis (MCN, MYB) induce centriole amplification as well as expression of FOXJ1 (bright green nuclei), required for centriole docking. High FOXJ1 and RFX3 drive a cilia motility transcriptional cascade leading to high expression of HEATR2 as well as expression of axonemal dynein components. HEATR2 is involved in the pre-assembly and/or delivery of future dynein arms to the apical cilia base. In fully mature MMCs, once inner and outer arm dynein complexes are delivered and incorporated into motile ciliary axonemes, relative levels of HEATR2 as well as RFX3 and FOXJ1 are reduced. This conserved regulatory motility module is required to drive high levels of HEATR2 when axonemal dyneins are being assembled and trafficked.</p>

        <p>Our human and fly data support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g009">Figure 9E</xref>) in which HEATR2/CG31320 is a cytoplasmic factor, whose dynamic expression is elevated in an RFX- and FOX-dependent manner prior to assembly of motile cilia at the apical surface of MMCs and Ch neurons. Once mature motile cilia are assembled, HEATR2/CG31320 expression appears reduced. This corresponds to a shift from a predominantly cytoplasmic pool of precursor dynein protein subunits to assembled stable dynein complexes successfully docked on the microtubules of the axonemes. These observations suggest HEATR2 interactions are also likely very transient, as HEATR2 remains exclusively cytoplasmic throughout cilia assembly while components of dynein arms become enriched in the axonemal compartment. The interaction with DNAI2 we have identified in this study in human bronchial epithelial cultures by co-IP as well as the absence of outer dynein arms in <italic>HEATR2/CG31320</italic> mutant axonemes and DNAH5 localization in patient cell lines, strongly suggest that HEATR2 is functioning in the earliest steps of outer arm dynein pre-assembly and stability. This is further supported by the reports of loss of IC2 in axonemes of <italic>htr2</italic> mutants <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Whether HEATR2 also functions in apical transport of dynein arm complexes to basal bodies is unclear, as no apical inclusions of dynein arm components were observed in the loss-of-function <italic>HEATR2</italic> PCD cells (here and <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>). Moreover, no direct link to IFT is suggested by the fact that <italic>Drosophila CG31320</italic> is required for dynein arms in both IFT-dependent (Ch neurons) and IFT-independent (sperm flagella) axonemal assembly.</p>
        <p>Although we were unable to determine how HEATR2 may be regulating inner arm dynein pre-assembly, we could show strong loss of IDA by TEM and DNALI1 IF in <italic>HEATR2</italic> patients and mutant flies. In contrast, algal <italic>htr2</italic> silenced strains showed incomplete loss of IDA by TEM and varying stability of different inner arm dynein subunits by axonemal immunoblots <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This suggests the role for HEATR2 may vary in the preassembly of the seven major species of inner arm dyneins in algae, each associated with an intermediate chain/light chain complex <xref rid="pgen.1004577-King1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. While the diversity of inner arm dyneins in modified motile cilia of other organisms is as yet poorly characterised <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, we show that the inner arm DNALI1, whose orthologue p28 is a component of several IDA species in algae, is destabilized in our PCD patients and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In contrast, Horani et al. report that inner arm dynein heavy chain DNAH7 (a component of centrin-containing inner arm dynein species b/I3â²) is correctly localized in their HEATR2 PCD cilia. Consistent with this, <italic>htr2</italic> silenced <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains had increased levels of centrin (component of the light chain complex of subspecies b/I3â², e/I2b and g/I3) <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, while PCD patients with mutations in <italic>DNAAF2/KTU</italic> also show loss of light chain p28/DNALI1 immunostaining, expression levels of p28 were unchanged in the corresponding <italic>pf13</italic> algal mutants <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Omran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Changes in p28 in <italic>htr2</italic> silenced algal strains were not discussed <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Defining the currently under-appreciated molecular complexity of inner arm dyneins in functionally diverse motile cilia may help reconcile differences between PCD studies and clarify the distinct and overlapping roles for individual disease genes within the dynein cytoplasmic assembly network. Interestingly, in <italic>CG31320</italic> RNAi Ch axonemes, IDAs appear very cleanly absent in the majority of sections (visible IDAs 3.20% vs control 91.5%: <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004577-t002">Table 2</xref>), more so than our recent report for <italic>ZMYND10</italic> mutant flies (visible IDAs 21.0% vs control 86.7%) <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This suggests that despite overlapping gross phenotypes, important molecular subtleties with respect to IDA assembly may exist between these mutants, even within the highly modified cilium of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ch neurons, which utilize a simplified ciliary motility machinery.</p>
        <p>Our work supports a conserved role for HEATR2/CG31320 in the hierarchy of cytoplasmic factors involved in a multistep process of axonemal dynein pre-assembly In consequence, it has been agreed with the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) that <italic>HEATR2</italic> should be referred to as <italic>DNAAF5</italic>. This group includes DNAAF1/LRRC50, DNAAF2/KTU, DNAAF3/PF22, DNAAF4/DYX1C1, LRRC6, SPAG1 and ZMYND10 <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Zariwala2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. While <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> have only one outer arm dynein species comprised of a single complex of three dynein heavy chains (DHCs) with several intermediate and light chains <xref rid="pgen.1004577-King1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, human studies suggest two types of double-headed HC ODA complexes vary in their composition along motile axonemes <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Fliegauf1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Unlike DNAAF2/KTU, HEATR2 is required for formation of both types of ODA subtypes whereas in <italic>DNAAF2</italic> mutant respiratory cilia only distal DNAH5<sup>+</sup> DNAH9<sup>+</sup> ODA species are affected (here and <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Omran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). Unlike ZMYND10 and LRRC6, HEATR2 is exclusively cytoplasmic <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Zariwala2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Kott2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Kavlie1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. Via its interaction with DNAI2, we propose HEATR2 acts in the early stages of cytoplasmic dynein preassembly, before complexes are transferred to a loading zone around the basal body where IFT comes into play. Loss of DNAI2 in <italic>htr2</italic> silenced algal axonemes <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and ODA intermediate chain DNAI1 <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and heavy chain DNAH5 (here) immunofluorescence in PCD patient cells with two different <italic>HEATR2</italic> mutations, strongly suggest HEATR2 may play a conserved role in stabilizing formation of the IC1/IC2 complex in the cytoplasm from the pool of precursors. Stability of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNAI1 (IC1) and DNAI2 (IC2) are mutually dependent, and necessary for subsequent cytoplasmic pre-assembly of outer arm heavy chains <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Fowkes1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. A similar role in mammalian testes has been proposed for DNAAF2/KTU <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Omran1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and the closely related PIH1D3 <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref> via interaction with DNAI2. However, we have been unable to show an interaction between HEATR2 and HSP70 or HSP90 by co-IP in human mature MMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s008">Figure S8A</xref>), suggesting HEATR2 is not functioning in a classical client/chaperone manner. Given no cytoplasmic accumulations of axonemal dyneins are observed in HEATR2 PCD MMCs, we instead propose the tandem arrays of HEAT repeats in HEATR2 are acting as flexible joints or scaffold stabilizing and facilitating interactions between subunits during assembly of dynein complexes.</p>
        <p>The dynamic cytoplasmic expression of HEATR2 during the period of motile ciliogenesis suggests that its interactions may be quite transient. In the terminally differentiated human airway cultures used in our co-IP experiments, only a small fraction of cells would be in early ciliogenesis with DNAI2 cytoplasmic rather than axonemal. This would explain why only a portion of DNAI2 is co-immunoprecipitated with HEATR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Transient interactions may be a trend for dynein assembly factors, such as PIH1D3, which localizes to the cytoplasm of spermatogenic cells but is absent from differentiated spermatids or mature sperm <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, unlike other cytoplasmic assembly PCD proteins which cause PCD when deficient, such as ZMYND10 and LRRC6 <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Hjeij1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Zariwala2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Tarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Horani4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, this study suggests the control of <italic>HEATR2/CG31320</italic> expression has evolved more complexity, possibly due to independent recruitment during evolution of its HEAT repeat-dependent scaffolding functions in other non-cilia cytoplasmic assembly processes. Indeed, <italic>CG31320</italic> was the only gene identified in our motility candidate screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004577-Newton1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004577-Cachero1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> whose expression is not confined to Ch neurons and testes, displaying transient, yet apparently vital, mesodermal expression during embryonic development. The role of HEATR2/CG31320 outside motile ciliated cells is currently unknown. Despite its expression in non-ciliated tissues, the clinical phenotypes caused by both human <italic>HEATR2</italic> point mutations reported to date (here and Horani et. al 2012) only manifest in cells expressing the highest levels of HEATR2, those with motile cilia, suggesting they may be most sensitive to profoundly reduced levels of HEATR2 protein.</p>

Each assay lasted 60â90 seconds, during which a 1000 Hz tone of 1 second duration was played at 30 second intervals. Larval movement was recorded by video camera and videos analysed in Macintosh iMovie software. For each tone, larval behaviour was observed in two 0.5 seconds time windows: the first starting 1 seconds before the tone, and the second starting from the onset of the tone. Number of larvae retracting (showing clear length shortening) was recorded as a score for each time window.</p>

For immunofluorescence, tissues were dissected in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 0.5â4 hours at 4Â°C with agitation. Samples were rinsed in PBS, processed through sucrose gradient for cryoprotection and embedded in OCT (Sakura). Cryostat sections of 10â15 Âµm were air-dried on SuperFrost plus slides (Fischer Scientific). Sections were blocked in 10% donkey serum/0.1% Triton-X in PBS and primary antibodies were diluted in 1% donkey serum/PBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s011">Table S3</xref>). Slides were washed and incubated in Alexafluor conjugated secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s011">Table S3</xref>), washed and mounted in ProLong Gold (Life technologies).</p>
        <p>For RT-qPCR studies, lungs and trachea were dissected from C57BL/6J embryos and neonates in cold DEPC-treated PBS into RNALater (Qiagen). Total RNA was isolated according to manufacturer's protocol using RNAeasy minicolumns with Qiashredder homogenizers (Qiagen), followed by DNase treatment with Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA yield and A260/A280 ratio were measured using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). cDNA was made using First Strand Synthesis of cDNA for RT-PCR (AMV) kit (Roche). Real-time PCR was performed on cDNA diluted 1/5 using mix in a LightCycler LC480 (Roche). Primer and probe sequences are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004577.s013">Table S5</xref>. Only a single PCR product was amplified for each reaction. To calculate relative amounts of transcripts in a sample, standard quantification curves were generated using either serial plasmid dilutions for <italic>Tbp</italic> and <italic>Heatr2</italic>, or wild-type cDNA. For each developmental time-point, three separate biological samples were isolated and processed independently. Data presented represents the mean average of these samples in three separate experimental runs with technical repeats in triplicate. Expression of each gene was normalized to reference gene <italic>Tbp</italic>, as it was unchanged during this developmental window and within a dynamic range of our ciliary targets. We have presented each gene relative to E14.5 (set as 1). To compare the expression level of a given gene between developmental timepoints a one-way Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used, if this generated a significant P value (&lt;0.05) it was followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons using Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.</p>

Lysates were pre-absorbed against Dynabeads G (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4Â°C to minimize non-specific binding. Pre-absorbed lysates were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with antibodies against HEATR2 (Proteintech) and an isotype-matched IgG rabbit polyclonal antibody (GFP: sc-8334, SantaCruz) as control. To concentrate immunocomplexes, antibody-lysate solutions were incubated with Dynabeads G followed by a series of washes with reducing amount of detergents. Finally, immunocomplexes were eluted off the beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Resolved immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies to HEATR2 (Proteintech) and DNAI2 (M01, clone IC8; Abnova). Also used for immunoblotting were HSP70 (K-20; SantaCruz), (MAB32861: R&amp;D), DNAAF2/KTU (ab99056; Abcam), DNAAF3 (ab126301; Abcam), ZMYND10/BLU (TA308345; Origene), DNAH5 (HPA037470; Sigma) and DNALI1 (N-13; SantaCruz).

(A) The <italic>HEATR2</italic> (<italic>ENST00000297440:c.2432-1G&gt;C</italic>) mutation alters the final highly conserved consensus U2-type splice acceptor but utilizes the initial two bases of exon 13 (AâG) as an alternate and efficient splice acceptor.

The heterozygous sample was found to contain 55% of the control variant and 45% of the mutant variant. The traces also confirm the mutant transcript is efficiently spliced to the novel exonic splice acceptor, with no alternate transcripts or missplicing events visible. (C) Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) confirms with high sensitivity and specificity splicing events in control and mutant <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcripts. Riboprobes containing a portion of exon 12 and 13 from a control (C) and patient (M) cDNA were generated. Sources of polyA+ RNA included a yeast control, heterozygous parent, PCD patient (affected), or an unrelated normal control. Undigested probes had a length of approximately 350 bases. Anti-sense riboprobes that annealed with identity to the transcript were digested to produce either a 245 bp control or 243 bp mutant product. Probes that annealed to sequence with a lack of identity at the exon12/13 junction were further digested to produce an exon 13 protected fragment of 163 bases in the normal or 161 bases in the mutant situation. Lack of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed using sense riboprobes. Quantification of the relative levels was 15% of the total in the patient and 24% in the control, indicating a moderate level of non-reference sequence splicing was present in both patient and control in this cell type.</p>

Based on sequencing of control, parental and patient <italic>HEATR2</italic> cDNA, we found the mutation results in inactivation of this splice site and utilization of the adjacent cryptic splice acceptor site in exon 13 (red box in control transcript), causing a 2-nucleotide deletion of the <italic>HEATR2</italic> transcript (<italic>c.2432-2433delAG</italic>, bases marked in red), resulting in a 2+ frameshift in translation (blue/white boxes: mutant codons). The final nucleotide of exon 12 is highlighted with an arrow, up to which point the patient sequence is the same. The mutation alters the final 44 amino acids of the protein and adds an additional 33 amino acids until it encounters a novel termination signal at codon 888 in the 3â²UTR (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004577-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Very weak expression is also detected in v'td neuron, which although is not thought to be ciliated, remains poorly characterized and requires atonal for its development.

Fainter, diffuse expression in one of the Ch organ support cells (scolopale cell) that ensheaths the sensory dendrite likely reflects CG31320 is expressed in the mother cell before its final division into these sister lineages.
