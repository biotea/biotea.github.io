      <abstract>
        <p>Spondylo-meta-epiphyseal dysplasia (SMED) with short limbs and abnormal calcifications (SMED-SL) is a rare, autosomal recessive human growth disorder, characterized by disproportionate short stature, short limbs, short broad fingers, abnormal metaphyses and epiphyses, platyspondyly and premature calcifications. Recently, three missense mutations and one splice-site mutation in the <italic>DDR2</italic> gene were identified as causative genetic defects for SMED-SL, but the underlying cellular and biochemical mechanisms were not explored. Here we report a novel <italic>DDR2</italic> missense mutation, c.337G&gt;A (p.E113K), that causes SMED-SL in two siblings in the United Arab Emirates. Another <italic>DDR2</italic> missense mutation, c.2254C&gt;T (p.R752C), matching one of the previously reported SMED-SL mutations, was found in a second affected family. DDR2 is a plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinase that functions as a collagen receptor. We expressed DDR2 constructs with the identified point mutations in human cell lines and evaluated their localization and functional properties. We found that all SMED-SL missense mutants were defective in collagen-induced receptor activation and that the three previously reported mutants (p.T713I, p.I726R and p.R752C) were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The novel mutant (p.E113K), in contrast, trafficked normally, like wild-type DDR2, but failed to bind collagen. This finding is in agreement with our recent structural data identifying Glu113 as an important amino acid in the DDR2 ligand-binding site. Our data thus demonstrate that SMED-SL can result from at least two different loss-of-function mechanisms: namely defects in DDR2 targeting to the plasma membrane or the loss of its ligand-binding activity.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, comprise a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that function as collagen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C2">2</xref>). The DDRs are the only RTKs that are activated by a component of the extracellular matrix. Several collagen types, both fibrillar and non-fibrillar types, activate the DDRs, with the two receptors displaying different specificities for certain collagen types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C4">4</xref>). Structurally, the DDRs are characterized in their extracellular regions by the presence of a collagen-binding discoidin homology domain and a domain unique to the DDRs (stalk region) (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F1">1</xref>). A transmembrane region is followed by a large cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain, and, finally a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Both DDRs form ligand-independent dimers on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C5">5</xref>). We have recently defined the mode of collagen recognition by the discoidin domain of DDR2 using X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>).</p><fig id="DDQ103F1" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic domain structure of homodimeric DDR2. The extracellular domain consists of a collagen-binding discoidin domain, followed by a so-called stalk region. The intracellular domain contains a large cytosolic juxtamembrane domain in addition to the C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. The position of disease-causing missense mutations is shown at the left.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddq10301"/></fig><p>The DDRs control fundamental cellular processes including cell proliferation, adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C8">8</xref>). In addition, the DDRs regulate extracellular matrix remodeling by controlling matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity. Both receptors are associated with human diseases, including fibrotic disorders of the lung (DDR1), liver (DDR2) and kidney (DDR1); atherosclerosis (DDR1); osteoarthritis (DDR2); rheumatoid arthritis (DDR2); and several types of malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C7">7</xref>).</p><p>DDR2, like DDR1, is widely expressed in different tissues during development and in postnatal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C7">7</xref>). While DDR1 is mostly confined to epithelial cells and leukocytes, DDR2 is found on cells of mesenchymal origin. Mice lacking DDR2 exhibit dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C10">10</xref>), indicating that DDR2 plays an important role in bone growth. Labrador <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C9">9</xref>) showed that targeted deletion of <italic>Ddr2</italic> in mice led to shortened long bones due to reduced chondrocyte proliferation. In another study, Kano <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C10">10</xref>) characterized a spontaneously occurring, autosomal-recessive mutation in their mouse colony that led to a 150 kb deletion encompassing the first 17 exons of the <italic>Ddr2</italic> gene. These latter mice, termed <italic>slie</italic> mutant mice, were infertile in addition to being dwarfed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C10">10</xref>).</p><p>Recently, DDR2 function has been implicated in human skeletal growth. Three <italic>DDR2</italic> gene missense mutations and one splice site mutation were each shown to cause spondylo-meta-epiphyseal dysplasia (SMED) with short limbs and abnormal calcifications [SMED-SL (MIM 271665)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>). SMED-SL is a rare, autosomal recessive, human growth disorder. Patients exhibit normal intelligence, disproportionate short stature, platyspondyly, abnormal epiphyses and metaphyses, narrow chest, shortening of the lower and upper limbs, short broad fingers and premature calcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C13">13</xref>).</p><p>DDR2 is a member of the subfamily of RTKs that also include ROR2. Mutations in the <italic>ROR2</italic> gene have been shown to be the underlying cause of the recessive form of Robinow Syndrome, a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature, limb shortening, genital hypoplasia and craniofacial abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C14">14</xref>). We have recently shown that all the missense pathogenic mutations in ROR2 are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are substrates for the ER quality control system, demonstrating that ER retention is the underlying cellular mechanism of this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C16">16</xref>) (Ali <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data). Given the phylogenetic relatedness of DDR2 to ROR2, we reasoned that most SMED-SL causing missense mutations in DDR2 are likely to result in the retention of DDR2 protein in the ER. In addition, patients with SMED-SL phenotype have been reported in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but the molecular defects responsible for their symptoms have not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C17">17</xref>) (Al-Gazali <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data). In this article, we report the evaluation of two families from the UAE with SMED-SL and the identification of two mutations including a novel missense mutation in DDR2. In addition, we report the elucidation of the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of all the missense mutations so far found in patients with this condition. While the previously established SMED-SL DDR2 mutations indeed caused ER retention of mutated DDR2, we demonstrate that the novel SMED-SL mutation (p.E113K) resulted in a ligand-binding defect. These latter data fit well with our recent structural data on the ligand-binding site of DDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>). Furthermore, our data demonstrate further the widespread involvement of the ER quality control systems in the cellular mechanisms of numerous secretroy pathway targeted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C20">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical characteristics of patients with SMED-SL from United Arab Emirates</title><p>Two consanguineous families with SMED-SL from the UAE have been evaluated (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddq103/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link> for the pedigrees). The first is a Pakistani family with two affected children. The clinical details of the affected children are described in detail below. The second family is of Egyptian background with two affected children and was described in detail before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C17">17</xref>). The family was found to have the same mutation, c.2254C&gt;T (p.R752C), as found in the Palestinian families described by Bargal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>). The severity of the clinical features in this family, particularly the degree of chondral calcifications, was also similar to the clinical features of the families described by Bargal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>). Both children in this family died, one at the age of 13 years due to respiratory complications and the other one died suddenly at 8 years of age due to cord compression.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Family 1, Case 1</title><p>This male child was the product of normal pregnancy. Delivery at term was by lower section Cesarean section. Prenatal ultrasound showed short limbs and short stubby hands. His birth weight was 2700 gm (5%) and length was 47 cm (10%). At birth, he was noted to have in addition to the short limbs and short hands, bowing of the lower limbs. The diagnosis of achondroplasia was suggested. During the first year of life and the early childhood years, he had repeated chest infections which were not severe enough to require hospital admissions. These attacks got better with time and stopped when he was 6 years old. His early developmental milestones were normal. He was operated on both legs to correct the bowing. He was evaluated by us at the age of 9.5 years. His weight was 27.5 kg (10%) and height was 99 cm (âª &lt; 3%, â6 SD). He had dysmorphic features and shortening of all limbs with very short puffy hands (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDQ103TB1">1</xref>). He was attending normal school at the appropriate grade and was top of the class. Neurological examination was normal. Skeletal survey revealed changes typical of SMED-SL including short and broad long bones with irregular flared metaphyses of the proximal and distal ends and genu varum (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDQ103TB1">1</xref>).

Direct DNA sequencing revealed two homozygous missense mutations: c.337G&gt;A (p.E113K) for family 1 and c.2254C&gt;T (p.R752C) for family 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddq103/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>).

The amino acid change is physiochemically significant (a change of the negatively charged glutamic acid to the positively charged lysine) and affects an important residue within the discoidin domain, the DDR2 ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>).

Substitution of the glutamate by lysine would disrupt the salt bridge and is expected to negatively impact on ligand binding by E113K-DDR2.

This mutation (p.E113K) is located in the extracellular discoidin domain and affects a surface-exposed residue that was previously identified as an important amino acid in the collagen-binding site of DDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C23">23</xref>). Additionally, we identified another mutation (p.R752C) in an Egyptian family with SMED-SL. This DDR2 mutation, localized in exon 17 of the <italic>DDR2</italic> gene, which encodes part of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, is a recurring mutation previously found in five Arab families from Jerusalem affected with SMED-SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate the effects of all known SMED-SL causing missense mutations on DDR2. Our cellular and biochemical analysis of these four DDR2 mutations showed that these fall into two classes: all previously identified missense mutations cause a trafficking defect with the affected proteins mis-localizing to the ER, while the novel p.E113K-DDR2 mutation is localized in the cell similar to wild-type DDR2 but is defective in transmembrane signaling due to a ligand-binding defect. A previous report identified mutations in the <italic>DDR2</italic> gene as causative genetic defects for SMED-SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>), but did not illuminate the mechanism of disease. Bargal <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>) speculated on the possible biochemical consequences of the disease mutations p.T713I, p.I726R and p.R752C. Because the affected amino acids are located in the active site of the DDR2 kinase, it was proposed that the substitutions may influence the stability of the activation loop, ATP binding affinity or substrate specificity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C11">11</xref>). The possibility that protein folding may be affected was not considered. DDR2 is a member of the RTK family of plasma membrane receptors and is phylogenetically related to ROR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C24">24</xref>). Missense mutations in the <italic>ROR2</italic> gene were recently shown to cause retention of the mutated proteins in the ER as a result of the protein folding quality control within this organelle named ER-Associated Protein Degradation (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C16">16</xref>). ERAD ensures that only properly folded proteins and fully assembled complexes are allowed to exit the ER to their final destinations. Proteins that fail to attain the required functional native conformations due to mutations or failure to acquire the needed posttranslational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage of signal peptides, glycosylation and GPI-anchoring, are retained in the ER for a short period of time but then get targeted for re-translocation to the cytoplasm and degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C29">29</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we show that three out of four missense mutations (p.T713I, p.I726R and p.R752C) found in SMED-SL patients result in the retention of the affected proteins in the ER. ER retention of the three mutants is strongly supported by the confocal images presented in FiguresÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F4">4</xref> and the biochemical findings on the sensitivity to Endo H treatment presented in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F5">5</xref>. We noticed lower levels of expression of the ER-retained mutant proteins in HEK293 cells, compared with wild-type DDR2, as can be seen in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F5">5</xref>B. These low steady-state levels of the mutant proteins may be due to ERAD degradation. Additionally, our findings add another genetic condition to the 60 or so known to be caused by ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C30">30</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the ER-retained mutant DDR2 receptors, E113K-DDR2 was found at the cell surface, similar to wild-type DDR2 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F3">3</xref>AâF), indicating a different disease-causing mechanism. Glu113 is located in the DDR2 extracellular discoidin domain. The DDR2 discoidin domain adopts a Î²-barrel structure consisting of eight Î²-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C23">23</xref>). At the top of the barrel, five protruding loops create a trench that forms the collagen-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C23">23</xref>). Glu113, which forms a salt bridge with Arg105, is one of several key residues that contact collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>). FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F8">8</xref>, which shows a cartoon drawing of the DDR2 discoidin domain bound to a collagen peptide, illustrates how Glu113 is involved in the DDR2-collagen interaction. Data presented in FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F7">7</xref> demonstrate that E113K-DDR2 had lost most of the collagen-binding activity. This result agrees well with the previous observation that mutation of E113Q reduced collagen-binding to â¼10% of wild-type DDR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C23">23</xref>). Thus, Glu113 is one of the main DDR2 residues contributing to collagen-binding. It is also noted that Glu113 and Arg105 are conserved in DDR1, further underscoring the importance of the Glu113-Arg105 salt bridge in the DDR-collagen interaction. This is the first report on the clinical relevance of substitutions at this site.</p><fig id="DDQ103F8" position="float"><label>FigureÂ 8.</label><caption><p>Cartoon drawing of the DDR2 discoidin domain (selected side chains: W52, cyan; R105, blue; E113, red) bound to a collagen peptide (selected side chains: M21 and O24 of leading chain, F23 of middle chain).

The Figure was prepared using the coordinates of PDB entry 2WUH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C6">6</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddq10308"/></fig><p>We noted some variations in the phenotype between the two families we are reporting here. For example, the clinical phenotype and the degree of chondral calcification of the second family (mutation p.R752C) were very severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C17">17</xref>). Both children had extensive calcifications which appeared by 1 years of age and were very progressive and widespread involving almost all cartilages. In addition, both children had repeated respiratory infections requiring hospital admissions and leading to death in the older child. The younger sib had in addition symptoms of cord compression, which led to his sudden death. The phenotype in the affected children from the first family (mutation p.E113K), on the other hand, was less severe with very few mild respiratory infections not requiring hospital admissions. In addition, the chondral calcification was limited and much less severe than in the p.R752C family. This variability might be due to retention of some residual activity in the p.E113K mutant compared with the p.R752C mutant. Alternatively, cells expressing the ER-retained mutated protein (p. R752C) may experience ER stress, which would not be experienced by cells expressing the correctly targeted p.E113K protein. However, the clinical significance of these presumed differences in ER stress responses are unknown at this stage.</p><p>How does DDR2 control bone growth? Very little is known about the role of DDR2 in bone growth. DDR2 is expressed on chondrocytes and its elimination in the mouse leads to suppression of chondrocyte cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C9">9</xref>). It is assumed that the interaction of DDR2 with collagen II in the proliferative zone of the growth plate is responsible for controlling chondrocyte proliferation. DDR2 is also a receptor for another collagen type with relevance to bone growth, collagen X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C4">4</xref>). While collagen II is found in all types of cartilage, collagen X expression is restricted to the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate. We show here that E113K-DDR2 is unable to interact with collagen II (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDQ103F7">7</xref>C). Further studies are required to establish whether the mutant protein is also defective in binding to collagen X.</p><p>In mice with targeted DDR2 deletion, the growth plates were observed to be shortened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C9">9</xref>). In the only available histological study of a chostrochondral junction from a SMED-SL patient, extremely abnormal cartilage was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDQ103C12">12</xref>). The growth plate was found to lack proliferating chondrocyte columns. Chondrocytes were small and sparse in the resting zone, often surrounded by a âring-likeâ amorphous matrix, which in turn could be surrounded by a more densely packed structure of fibrillar collagen. Clustering of chondrocytes within lacunae was also observed. Taken together with our data, it can be speculated that in SMED-SL patients, lack of DDR2 interaction with collagen II results in impaired DDR2 signaling, leading to severe suppression of chondrocyte proliferation, which may be responsible for poor linear bone growth. Further morphological studies on patient samples with known DDR2 mutations would be required to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, we report a novel mutation in the <italic>DDR2</italic> gene in patients affected with SMED-SL and elucidate the cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying all reported SMED-SL disease mutations. Two different mechanisms, failure to reach the plasma membrane and impaired ligand binding, were found to result in the growth disorder. This study supports the notion that DDR2 signaling is important in human development and that the interaction of DDR2 with collagen is essential for proper skeletal growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients</title><p>The research was approved by Al-Ain Medical District Human Research Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from the parents.
