        <p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that frequently move, divide, and fuse with one another to maintain their architecture and functions. However, the signaling mechanisms involved in these processes are still not well characterized. In this study, we analyze mitochondrial dynamics and morphology in neurons. Using time-lapse imaging, we find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) causes a rapid halt in mitochondrial movement and induces mitochondrial fission. VDCC-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling stimulates phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at serine 600 via activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IÎ± (CaMKIÎ±). In neurons and HeLa cells, phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 600 is associated with an increase in Drp1 translocation to mitochondria, whereas in vitro, phosphorylation of Drp1 results in an increase in its affinity for Fis1. CaMKIÎ± is a widely expressed protein kinase, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is likely to be functionally important in the control of mitochondrial dynamics through regulation of Drp1 phosphorylation in neurons and other cell types.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria play an essential function in cells through the production of energy and the ability to regulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As such, they are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including survival, proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kroemer and Reed, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shaw and Nunnari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fannjiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oakes and Korsmeyer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szabadkai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youle and Karbowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karbowski et al., 2006</xref>). Mitochondria are also dynamic organelles and move through the cell with frequent fission and fusion processes that influence their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bereiter-Hahn and Voth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rube and van der Bliek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial fusion is regulated by Fzo1, OPA1, and Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), Fis1, and possibly other proteins such as MTP18 play an important role in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stojanovski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tondera et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). A critical role is played by the Drp1, which translocates to mitochondria and forms a complex with Fis1 on the mitochondrial surface. There, Drp1's GTPase activity is coupled to outer membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barsoum et al., 2006</xref>). Mitochondrial fission is likely to be similar to the process involved in plasma membrane endocytosis mediated by the GTPase activity of dynamin, such as in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takei et al., 1995</xref>). Recent studies suggest that posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation are likely involved in the control of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerveny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Detmer and Chan, 2007</xref>). However, it is still unclear how extracellular stimuli might modulate intracellular signaling processes to control mitochondrial dynamics and morphology.</p><p>In neurons, mitochondrial trafficking to pre- and postsynaptic sites is likely to play an important role in control of basal synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang and Zucker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2004</xref>). In dendrites, mitochondrial movement and morphology are regulated by synaptic activity, whereas in axons, mitochondrial movement responds to changes in axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chada and Hollenbeck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruthel and Hollenbeck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Mitochondrial movement and morphology are also regulated by nitric oxide, and alterations in mitochondrial morphology may play a role in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barsoum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wasiak et al., 2007</xref>). Although mitochondrial movement and fission/fusion play critical functional roles in neurons, it is unclear how these changes in mitochondrial morphology and movement are coupled to alterations in synaptic activity.</p><p>In the present study, we find that intracellular signaling associated with activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) regulates mitochondrial dynamics and morphology in neurons. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via VDCCs stimulates mitochondrial fragmentation, and this involves activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) and phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 600 (Ser600). These results identify an important mechanism involved in Drp1-regulated mitochondrial dynamics and highlight a key role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the control of mitochondrial dynamics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effects of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial dynamics and morphology in neurons</title><p>Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with pDsRed2-Mito to label mitochondria. The movement and morphology of mitochondria were monitored using live-cell imaging. As previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ligon and Steward, 2000</xref>), mitochondria were found in neuronal axons and dendrites, exhibiting an elongated shape and dynamic movement. Treatment with 45 mM K<sup>+</sup> for 15 min had a marked effect on mitochondrial shape and movement. Elongated mitochondria became much shorter and rounder in morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1, A and C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802164/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802164/DC1</ext-link>). In time-lapse imaging, 45-mM K<sup>+</sup> stimulation was found to trigger a rapid halt to movement (mitochondrial movement was reduced to 16.5% of control at 1 min, recovering to 26.3% at 10 min and 29.6% at 15 min; Fig. S1, A and B). High K<sup>+</sup> treatment also caused mitochondria to form ringlike structures that were the sites of fission events giving rise to smaller, round mitochondrial structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial dynamics and morphology in neurons.</bold> (A) Neurons (10 DIV) were transfected with pDsRed2-Mito to label mitochondria.

Normal mitochondria had a rodlike shape with clear cristae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, i and ii). After high K<sup>+</sup> treatment, mitochondria appeared empty with less electron-dense material and less cristae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, iiiâvii). Mitochondria undergoing division were frequently observed. In some cases, the dividing mitochondria were found to be connected by a narrow necklike membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, vâvii).</p></sec><sec><title>VDCC-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is required for the effects of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial dynamics</title><p>To investigate the signaling mechanisms involved in the effects of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondria, we first measured intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level after high K<sup>+</sup> treatment. As expected, high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation triggered a rapid increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> was sustained during the 20-min treatment with high K<sup>+</sup> and then rapidly recovered to a normal level after washout of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The changes in mitochondrial movement and morphology were observed in response to various concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> from 10 to 100 mM (not depicted) but, importantly, were reversible after 15-min treatment with high K<sup>+</sup> and subsequent washout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that there was little detectable neuronal death 24 h after high K<sup>+</sup> treatment (15 min) and subsequent washout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In contrast, as expected, treatment with glutamate (500 Î¼M for 15 min) resulted in obvious cell death when examined 24 h later.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>High K<sup>+</sup> induces elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reversible changes in mitochondrial morphology.</bold> (A) Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level was measured in hippocampal neurons (12 DIV) in response to treatment with 45 mM K<sup>+</sup>.

(B) Neurons transfected with pDsRed2-Mito were analyzed before addition of 45 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 15 min after treatment with high K<sup>+</sup>. Arrows show ringlike mitochondria formations. After 15 min, 45 mM K<sup>+</sup> was removed by exchange of media, and mitochondria were imaged after 3 h. The same result was obtained in three separate experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Bars, 10 Î¼m. (C) Neurons (12 DIV) were untreated or treated for 15 min with 500 Î¼M glutamate or 45 mM K<sup>+</sup>. After the 15-min treatment, the media was replaced by conditioned medium from 10-d-old neuronal cultures. 24 h later, cell death was measured by Hoechst 33258 and MAP2 staining. Data were obtained from at least five visual fields under a 20Ã objective from at least three independent experiments for each group. Error bars indicate SEM in each group. Bars, 40 Î¼m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820573f02"/></fig><p>To investigate the identity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, we examined the effects of a series of VDCC inhibitors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). All of the VDCC blockers (N, P/Q, and L type) attenuated the high K<sup>+</sup>âinduced changes in mitochondrial movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). However, only the N-type VDCC blocker, P/Q-type VDCC blocker (conotoxin-MVIIC or a mix of conotoxin-GVIA and agatoxin-IVA), and P/Q-type blocker agatoxin IVA prevented high K<sup>+</sup>âinduced changes in mitochondrial morphology (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). These results suggest that either L-, N-, or P/Q-type VDCC may be involved in K<sup>+</sup>-induced mitochondrial dynamics but that coactivation of N and P/Q types plays the most important role.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>VDCC-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is involved in the effects of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondria.</bold> (A) Neurons (10 DIV) transfected with pDsRed2-Mito were analyzed by time-lapse imaging. Neurons (at 11 DIV) were then preincubated with 10 Î¼M nifedipine (L-type blocker), 1 Î¼M Cono-MVIIC (N and P/Q blocker), 10 Î¼M UO126 (MAPK inhibitor), 20 Î¼M KN93 (CaMK inhibitor), 20 Î¼M KN92 (control for KN93), and 1 Î¼M FK506 and were incubated in 45 mM K<sup>+</sup> for 15 min. Bars, 10 Î¼m. (B) Mitochondrial length was measured through analysis of the elongation index (calculated by the square of longest length divided by the area). The elongation index after 15 min of high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation was normalized to the value before stimulation. Mitochondrial movement was measured by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The movement events after high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation were normalized to the value before stimulation. Neurons were either untreated (No sti), incubated with 45 mM K<sup>+</sup> for 15 min (K<sup>+</sup>), or preincubated with various pharmacological agents before incubation with 45 mM K<sup>+</sup> as in A and also including 1 Î¼M Cono-GVIA (N-type blocker), 0.1 Î¼M Aga-IVA (P/Q-type blocker), or Cono-GVIA plus Aga-IVA.

FK506 and cyclosporin, which act through inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, had no effect on high K<sup>+</sup>âinduced changes in mitochondrial shape and movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). U0126, a blocker of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, also had no effect on K<sup>+</sup>-induced changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). However, KN93, an antagonist of CaMKs, almost completely blocked the K<sup>+</sup>-induced changes in mitochondrial shape and movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). KN92, a negative control for KN93, had no effect. The inhibitory effect of KN93 was not caused by an effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx because KN93 (or KN92) had no effect on high K<sup>+</sup>âinduced elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (unpublished data). KN93 is a general inhibitor of CaMKs, including CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV, but recent studies in neurons have highlighted that CaMKI may be an important target for KN93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schmitt et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the possible contribution of CaMKIÎ±, the most abundant CaMKI isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hook and Means, 2001</xref>), in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and morphology. Expression of a dominant-negative CaMKIÎ± (CaMKIÎ±-DN) blocked the effect of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial length and movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and C</xref>). In addition, expression of constitutively active CaMKIÎ± (CaMKIÎ±-CA) alone resulted in inhibition of mitochondrial movement and caused mitochondria to become shorter in length (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>CaMKIÎ± mediates VDCC-dependent mitochondrial changes after high K<sup>+</sup>.</bold> (A) Neurons (10 DIV) were cotransfected with pDsRed2-Mito and GFP (negative control; top) or GFPâCaMKIÎ±-DN.

The regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in response to high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation involved activation of N-type VDCCs, P/Q-type VDCCs, and, to a lesser degree, L-type VDCCs and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cells. In response to VDCC activation, mitochondria exhibit significant morphological and dynamic changes. Mitochondria very rapidly stopped moving and formed ringlike structures that accompanied the division process. An elongated mitochondrial morphology was rapidly recovered, and neuronal viability was not impaired after washout of high K<sup>+</sup> from the medium. These results were obtained from studies using live-cell imaging with mitochondrial-targeted fluorescent protein as well as by electron microscopy. The electron micrographs showed that the high K<sup>+</sup> treatment resulted in mitochondria that appeared hollow with a less electron-dense matrix and less cristae. The ringlike formation and hollow mitochondrial changes during fission are also consistent with results from studies in which hFis1 was overexpressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoon et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on mitochondrial movement and morphology required the activity of CaMKI. KN93, a CaMK inhibitor known to inhibit CaMKI in neurons, almost completely blocked the effects of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial dynamics. More specifically, expression of CaMKIÎ±-DN blocked the effect of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial movement and morphology, although CaMKIÎ±-CA mimicked the effects of high K<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, our experiments indicated that phosphorylation of Drp1 by CaMKIÎ± was likely to play an important role in the effect of high K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via VDCCs resulted in activation of CaMKIÎ± and the phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser600. Ser600 is included within a consensus CaMKI phosphorylation site in the C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED; Fig. S2 A). In contrast to dynamin, Drp1 does not have a pleckstrin homology domain, and the GED is necessary and sufficient for interaction with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pitts et al., 2004</xref>). The GED is conserved in all Drp1 isoforms, and all are likely to be regulated by CaMKIÎ±-dependent phosphorylation.</p><p>The recruitment of Drp1 to the cytoplasmic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane is dependent on Fis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoon et al., 2003</xref>). Fis1 is a small 17-kD protein that interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane via its C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mozdy et al., 2000</xref>) and interacts with Drp1 via two N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). The expression level of Fis1 appears to be the rate-limiting factor in mitochondrial fission through its ability to interact with Drp1 and recruit it in an active conformation to allow scission of the mitochondrial membrane. Our results showed that in intact cells, phosphorylation of Drp1 by CaMKIÎ± was necessary for translocation of the protein to mitochondria. In addition, expression of a (dephospho) mutant Drp1 in which Ser600 was changed to alanine was able to attenuate the effect of high K<sup>+</sup> on mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, in vitro, prior phosphorylation of Drp1 by CaMKIÎ± significantly increased the binding of Drp1 and Fis1. Finally, reduction of Fis1 expression was able to attenuate the effect of high K<sup>+</sup> on Drp1 translocation. Together, these results suggest that activation of CaMKIÎ± and phosphorylation of Drp1 are necessary for the increased mitochondrial fission observed after exposure of cells to high K<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, a mutant Drp1 in which Ser600 was changed to aspartate to mimic the phosphorylated state behaved like the wild-type protein under basal and high K<sup>+</sup> conditions. This result indicates that the S600D mutation does not mimic phosphorylation by CaMKI and also suggests that CaMKI likely regulates the function of other proteins involved in Drp1 translocation to mitochondria.</p><p>Drp1 and Fis1 were found previously to interact by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The proteins can also interact in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoon et al., 2003</xref>). However, this interaction is normally transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wasiak et al., 2007</xref>), requiring the use of a chemical cross-linker to observe coimmunoprecipitation or interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoon et al., 2003</xref>). The precise molecular details of the interaction of Drp1 and Fis1 remain to be established. A study in yeast suggests that a third protein termed Mdv1 is required for the interaction between Dnm1 and Fis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoppins et al., 2007</xref>). However, a recent study suggests that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Fis1 directly binds Dnm1 and not Mdv1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wells et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, this binding is negatively regulated by a short N-terminal region of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Fis1. Notably, the N-terminal region of Fis1 is not well conserved between yeast and mammals. Moreover, Mdv1 is not found in mammalian cells, and human Fis1 does not rescue deletion of the yeast gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stojanovski et al., 2004</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the interactions between Drp1 and Fis1 in mammalian cells may be distinct from those occurring between the equivalent proteins in yeast. Phosphorylation of Drp1 by CaMKIÎ± may therefore represent a mechanism by which the affinity of Drp1 and Fis1 is increased in mammalian cells.</p><p>During the revision of this manuscript, several other recent studies also found that Drp1 is phosphorylated in mammalian cells. Two independent studies found that cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylated Drp1 at the same site as CaMKI (different residue numbers reflect the use of different Drp1 isoforms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Blackstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>). CaMKI and PKA are known to have overlapping substrate specificity and, for example, phosphorylation of a common serine residue in synapsin I has been found to be phosphorylated in response to high K<sup>+</sup> treatment or increased cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nairn and Greengard, 1987</xref>). Although there were some differences between the two studies, there was a general agreement on the conclusion. Results obtained from the use of phosphosite mutants of Drp1 indicated that increased phosphorylation of Drp1 was associated with increased mitochondrial length or area, results consistent with decreased mitochondrial fission. Moreover, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cribbs and Strack (2007)</xref> found that expression of a phosphomimetic form of Drp1 was associated with increased resistance to proapoptotic treatments. These studies did not find any effect of phosphorylation on Drp1 self-assembly.</p><p>The basis for the difference between our study and these two recent studies is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Blackstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>). It is notable, however, that there was general agreement that the basal level of phosphorylation of native Drp1 was very low. Based on the results from these two studies, a low level of phosphorylation of Drp1 would predict that mitochondria would be expected to be highly fragmented and cells would be vulnerable to apoptosis. However, this situation is generally the opposite of what was actually observed. In our studies, mitochondria were highly elongated, especially in neuronal dendrites, consistent with the idea that a low basal phosphorylation of Drp1 favors mitochondrial fusion and increased phosphorylation favors mitochondrial fission. Another notable feature of these two studies is that they did not find any effect of increased cAMP levels on mitochondrial morphology. This result is consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser600, although necessary for regulation of mitochondrial morphology, is not sufficient on its own and that activation of CaMKI has additional roles in regulation of Drp1 interaction with mitochondria. It will be interesting to investigate whether Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways can act synergistically to regulate mitochondrial morphology.</p><p>Another recent study found that rat Drp1 is phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B, leading to stimulation of mitochondrial fission during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taguchi et al., 2007</xref>). The CaMKIÎ± and Cdk1 phosphorylation sites are very close in the C terminus of Drp1, highlighting the important role of this region of the protein in regulation of mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation at the C terminus, at least in the case of CaMKIÎ±, presumably results in alterations in the conformation of Drp1 and increases affinity of Drp1 for Fis1. It will be of interest to investigate whether phosphorylation of Drp1 by Cdk1 also stimulates fission through an increase in its affinity for Fis1 and to examine the interrelationship between the phosphorylation of these sites.</p><p>Recent studies have found that mitochondria distribution and movement in dendrites is regulated by synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Reynolds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sung et al., 2008</xref>). K<sup>+</sup>-dependent depolarization or titanic stimulation was associated with a redistribution of mitochondria to dendritic spines, presumably to support the high metabolic requirement at these sites during synaptic activation. Moreover, increased Drp1 activity was found to be associated with increased mitochondrial fission, redistribution of mitochondria to dendrites, density of dendritic spines, and synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Preferential activation of CaMKs is found with protocols that increase long-term potentiation at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xia and Storm, 2005</xref>). CaMKIÎ±-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 and altered mitochondrial dynamics are therefore likely to play an important role in changes in synaptic morphology and function that accompany long-term potentiation.</p><p>Our results indicated that the effects of high K<sup>+</sup> treatment were rapid, occurring within minutes, and were reversible. Moreover, high K<sup>+</sup> treatment had no effect on cell death. This latter finding is of interest because several previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial fission is involved in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fannjiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Youle and Karbowski, 2005</xref>).

However, recent studies have also suggested that mitochondrial fission, although necessary for certain types of cell death, is not itself sufficient to cause apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szabadkai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meuer et al., 2007</xref>). The results of the current study add support to this hypothesis. Indeed, in preliminary experiments, we found that pretreatment with high K<sup>+</sup> in neurons could prevent release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria and prevent apoptosis in response to glutamate treatment (unpublished data). CaMKIÎ±-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 may play an important role in this protective process.</p><p>In conclusion, these results provide important new insights into the understanding of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and morphology. We found that mitochondrial dynamics and morphology are controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VDCCs. In turn, VDCCs are coupled to the activation of CaMKIÎ±, resulting in phosphorylation of Drp1. CaMKIÎ±-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 facilitates its interaction with Fis1 and leads to increased mitochondrial fission. In addition to the phosphorylation of Drp1, CaMKIÎ± may also influence other aspects of Drp1 translocation to mitochondria. Mitochondrial morphology is regulated by a balance between fission and fusion. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that mitochondrial fragmentation induced by high K<sup>+</sup> is also accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial fusion, the results indicate that the effects of high K<sup>+</sup> are mediated by activation of CaMKI and phosphorylation of Drp1. This suggests that the fission process is the most likely target for the effects of high K<sup>+</sup>. Although our studies focused on regulation of Drp1 in neurons, we also found that CaMKI could regulate Drp1 function in HeLa cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER has also been found to promote the translocation of Drp1 from the cytoplasm to the outer mitochondrial membrane of nonneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breckenridge et al., 2003</xref>). CaMKI is a ubiquitously expressed protein kinase. Thus, CaMKI-dependent phosphorylation and regulation of Drp1 may be a general phenomenon found in many different types of cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA construction</title><p>PDsRed2-Mito (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) is a mammalian expression vector that encodes the fluorescent protein DsRed2 tagged with the mitochondrial targeting sequence from subunit VIII of human cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase.

GFP was visualized with excitation at 480 nm using an FITC filter. Time-lapse imaging was captured automatically with a selected interval. Drp1 imaging was performed with a laser confocal microscope (Fluoview 300; Olympus). 60Ã/1.0 NA or 40Ã/0.9 NA WLSM (PIauApo) objectives (Olympus) were used to view the cells.

To analyze Drp1 foci, we selected random regions in neurons. The areas of these regions were also different in different cells, but their areas (micrometers squared) were automatically calculated by the software (Fluoview 300; Olympus).

Mitochondrial movement was evaluated by analyzing the pDsRed2-Mito signal with time-lapse imaging using neuronal culture medium or DME (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS at 30Â°C. Pixel intensity difference was obtained by image subtraction between successive images at 10-s intervals, and the difference after subtraction of the background was calculated as the movement during the 10-s period. Image differences between six sequential images were averaged. The pixel area of the image was normalized to the total mitochondrial pixel area before subtraction. Morphology was evaluated by elongation index. Mitochondria were picked up after subtraction of background by using AquaCosmos software (Hamamatsu Photonics). The length and the area of an individual mitochondria were measured, and the elongation index was calculated by the square of the length divided by the area (i.e., when the elongation index is larger, mitochondria are longer). The elongation index after 15 min of high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation was normalized to the value measured before stimulation to obtain the percent change in elongation index.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement</title><p>Hippocampal cultures were incubated with Fura-2 AM (5 Î¼M for 30 min) and washed with Hepes-buffered salt solution composed of 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 mM glucose in 25 mM Hepes (buffered to pH 7.4 with NaOH) at 30Â°C.
