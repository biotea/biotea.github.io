        <p>Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) down-regulates expression of the T cell receptor (TCR)âCD3 complex during a specific stage of thymocyte development when the TCR repertoire is selected. Consequently, SLAPâ/â thymocytes display alterations in thymocyte development. Here, we have studied the mechanism of SLAP function. We demonstrate that SLAP-deficient thymocytes have increased TCRÎ¶ chain expression as a result of a defect in TCRÎ¶ degradation. Failure to degrade TCRÎ¶ leads to an increased pool of fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes that are capable of recycling back to the cell surface. We also provide evidence that SLAP functions in a pathway that requires the phosphorylated TCRÎ¶ chain and the Src family kinase Lck, but not ZAP-70 (Î¶-associated protein of 70 kD). These studies reveal a unique mechanism by which SLAP contributes to the regulation of TCR expression during a distinct stage of thymocyte development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>T cells develop in the thymus, where immature thymocytes undergo a developmental program that ensures the generation of T cells with a diverse repertoire of T cell receptors (TCRs). These TCRs are capable of recognizing foreign antigens that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules without being autoreactive (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Love and Chan, 2003</xref>). The Î±Î²TCR is part of a multichain complex that is composed of the peptideâMHC-binding TCRÎ± and Î² chains that are noncovalently associated with the CD3Î³ÉÎ´É and TCRÎ¶Î¶ chains, which together are referred to as the CD3 complex (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Exley et al., 1991</xref>). Although Î±Î²TCR is responsible for antigen recognition, the remainder of the CD3 complexâthe TCRÎ¶ chains in particularâis required for coupling the TCR to downstream signaling molecules.</p>
      <p>Generation of the Î±Î²TCR repertoire is initiated at the most immature stage of thymocyte development (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sebzda et al., 1999</xref>). At this early stage of development, thymocytes express neither CD4 nor CD8 coreceptors. Thymocytes that are destined to become Î±Î² T cells stochastically rearrange their TCRÎ² genes. If rearrangement of TCRÎ² is successful (in frame), the TCRÎ² chain is transported together with a nonvariant pre-TCRÎ± chain and the CD3 complex to the cell surface as the pre-TCR complex. Surface expression of the pre-TCR complex induces ligand-independent signals (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Irving et al., 1998</xref>), which allows for thymocytes to proliferate and up-regulate CD4 and CD8 expression, thereby progressing to the CD4+ CD8+ double-positive (DP) stage of development. At the DP stage of development, thymocytes rearrange their TCRÎ± genes. If the rearrangement of TCRÎ± is successful, low levels of the mature TCRâCD3 complex are expressed on the surface of the developing thymocyte. Expression of the TCRâCD3 complex is crucial at this stage of development, as signals through the TCR are required for the survival (positive selection) or deletion (negative selection) of DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sebzda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Love and Chan, 2003</xref>). If the TCR expressed by a DP thymocyte cannot bind to self-peptideâMHC molecules, the thymocyte fails to receive positively selecting signals and subsequently dies. Conversely, if the TCR interacts too strongly with self-peptideâMHC molecules, the cell is potentially autoreactive and is deleted via apoptosis. Thymocytes that express TCRs with an intermediate affinity for peptideâMHC down-regulate either CD4 or CD8, thereby progressing to the single-positive (SP) stage of development. Progression to this more phenotypically and functionally mature SP stage is also associated with a 10-fold increase in the level of the TCRâCD3 complex to that of mature peripheral T cells. At the SP stage, thymocytes are subjected to further selection and maturation processes before exiting the thymus as mature T cells.</p>
      <p>Both positive and negative selection processes are dependent on the strength of signals received through the TCRâCD3 complex. Signal strength is dependent not only on the intrinsic affinity of the TCR for peptideâMHC molecules but also on the number of receptors that interact with peptideâMHC. TCRâCD3 expression on DP thymocytes is only â¼10% of the level observed on SP thymocytes and mature T cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Finkel et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Havran et al., 1987</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that modulating levels of TCRâCD3 expression in developing thymocytes can lead to alterations in positive selection (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ericsson and Teh, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Naramura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that tight regulation of surface TCRâCD3 levels is required for normal TCR repertoire selection. Therefore, proteins that regulate surface TCRâCD3 levels in the thymus are likely to be important determinants of thymocyte development.</p>
      <p>Recently, we have shown that Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) regulates the level of TCRâCD3 expression on DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2001</xref>). SLAP was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the Eck receptor protein tyrosine kinase (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 1995</xref>). In particular, SLAP is highly homologous with Src family kinases, which include the T lymphocyteâspecific family members of Lck. Like Src family kinases, SLAP has a unique NH<sub>2</sub> terminus that is myristolated, thereby targeting SLAP to cellular membranes (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Manes et al., 2000</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of SLAP is followed by Src homology (SH) 3 and 2 domains, which share 55 and 50% amino acid sequence identity with these domains in Lck, respectively. Unlike Src family kinases, however, SLAP lacks a kinase domain and, instead, contains a unique COOH terminus, whose function remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Because SLAP is highly homologous to Lck but lacks a kinase domain, it was postulated that SLAP could negatively regulate Src family kinases by functioning in a dominant negative manner. Overexpression and microinjection studies in nonlymphoid cells have shown that SLAP can inhibit Src-mediated signaling through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Roche et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Manes et al., 2000</xref>). In Jurkat T cells, the transient overexpression of SLAP can inhibit signaling downstream of the TCR as measured by nuclear factor of activated T cells, AP-1, or interleukin 2 transcriptional reporter activity (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2000</xref>). Maximum inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cell activity in Jurkat T cells requires both the SH2 and SH3 domains of SLAP. Altogether, these data suggest that SLAP is an inhibitor of Src family kinases. However, the mechanism by which SLAP inhibits signaling remains unclear, as no differences in overall tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in Jurkat T cells that overexpressed SLAP or in SLAPâ/â thymocytes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>In mice, SLAP protein expression is developmentally restricted and is most highly expressed in DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this restricted pattern of expression, targeted inactivation of the SLAP gene demonstrated that SLAP down-regulates TCRâCD3 expression at the DP stage of thymocyte development. In addition to increased TCRâCD3 expression, SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes also display increased levels of CD4, CD5, and CD69. Furthermore, SLAPâ/â thymocytes display increases in positive selection in the presence of a transgenic TCR. Finally, SLAP deficiency can partially overcome a developmental block at the DP stage and rescue the development of CD4+ SP thymocytes and peripheral T cells in mice that lack ZAP-70 (Î¶-associated protein of 70 kD) tyrosine kinase. These alterations in thymocyte development in the absence of SLAP argue that control of surface TCRâCD3 levels on DP thymocytes is an important regulatory step in the generation of peripheral T cells. Therefore, we set out to elucidate the mechanism of SLAP-mediated TCRâCD3 down-regulation on DP thymocytes. In this study, we show that SLAP-deficient thymocytes have a defect in TCRÎ¶ chain degradation, which leads to an increased pool of fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes that are capable of recycling back to the cell surface.</p>

        <title>Total levels of TCRÎ¶ are increased in SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes</title>
        <p>SLAPâ/â mice have increased levels of surface TCRâCD3 on DP thymocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2001</xref>). We reasoned that if either synthesis or degradation is altered by the absence of SLAP, total levels of TCRâCD3 should also be up-regulated. Total cell lysates were prepared from CD8+ thymocytes, which contained mostly DP thymocytes but also contained small numbers of CD8+ SP thymocytes. Purified cells were &gt;95% DP, as determined by FACS (unpublished data). By Western blot analysis, total levels of the TCRÎ¶ chain were consistently increased three- to fourfold in SLAPâ/â CD8+ thymocytes as compared with wild-type (WT) controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). In contrast, total levels of TCRÎ± and CD3É were not substantially increased. Although lysates contained mostly DP thymocytes, there was a small (&lt;5%) contaminating pool of CD8+ SP thymocytes in lysate preparations. Therefore, we used intracellular FACS staining to analyze total TCRâCD3 levels, specifically in DP thymocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). We were unable to stain for the TCRÎ¶ chain by FACS, but intracellular FACS analysis confirmed the results that were obtained by Western blot analysis for CD3É. Although surface levels of CD3É (as well as TCRÎ²) were consistently three- to fivefold higher on SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes, total levels of TCRâCD3 were not significantly increased.</p>

        <p>Increased TCRÎ¶ chain expression in the absence of SLAP suggests that SLAP modifies the rate of TCRÎ¶ synthesis and/or degradation. Metabolic labeling of CD8+ thymocytes demonstrated that the synthesis of TCRÎ¶, TCRÎ±, and CD3É during a 30-min pulse label was similar in WT and SLAPâ/â thymocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). To test whether the rate of TCRÎ¶ degradation was altered in the absence of SLAP, thymocyte single-cell suspensions that were enriched for DP thymocytes (CD8+ purified) were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit synthesis of TCR chains, and the stability of CD3É, TCRÎ¶, and TCRÎ± over time was assessed by either Western blot analysis or by intracellular FACS staining. Degradation of TCRÎ¶, but not CD3É, TCRÎ±, or TCRÎ², was markedly impaired in SLAPâ/â thymocytes as compared with WT controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, BâD). We were unable to study TCRÎ¶ and TCRÎ± degradation using a FACS-based assay. Therefore, we simultaneously investigated CD3É degradation by intracellular FACS staining to determine whether the results obtained by Western blot analysis of CD8+-purified thymocytes were similar to the results obtained by intracellular FACS staining of DP thymocytes. CD3É degradation by Western blot analysis was comparable to the FACS-based assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, BâD), demonstrating that contamination from SP thymocytes does not significantly contribute to the impaired degradation of TCRÎ¶ that was observed in SLAPâ/â thymocytes.</p>

        <title>Recycling TCRâCD3 complexes are increased in the absence of SLAP</title>
        <p>The failure of SLAPâ/â thymocytes to degrade TCRÎ¶ may be a result of alterations in the dynamics of TCRâCD3 internalization and/or recycling. However, SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes that were precoated with anti-CD3É mAbs internalized surface-bound mAb with kinetics similar to WT thymocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Next, we tested whether SLAP regulates recycling of the TCRâCD3 complex. Thymocytes were incubated in culture with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD3É mAb for 30 min at 37Â°C to label an internalized pool of CD3É. Cells were transferred to ice and washed, and surface-bound antibody was removed by using two sequential low pH washes. Thymocytes were then resuspended in cell culture medium and were incubated at 37Â°C for various time points. Anti-CD3É mAb that recycled back to the cell surface during the course of the assay was removed by a second series of low pH washes. The amount of CD3ÉâPE fluorescence that was lost as compared with staining of the intracellular pool at time 0 was used to calculate the percentage of CD3É recycled at each time point. SLAP-deficient DP thymocytes recycled CD3É more rapidly than DP thymocytes from WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). Furthermore, SLAP-deficient DP thymocytes recycled more CD3É over the course of the assay, suggesting that the size of the CD3É recycling pool is increased in the absence of SLAP. Notably, the increase in CD3É recycling was seen only in DP thymocytes, where SLAP is most highly expressed, because CD3É recycling by SP thymocytes was similar regardless of genotype.</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="200501164f3"/>
        </fig>
        <p>Next, we tested whether the size of the CD3É recycling pool is altered in the absence of SLAP. We were unable to measure the size of the TCRâCD3 recycling pool by using Fab fragments, presumably as a result of the low level of CD3É expression in DP thymocytes as compared with background staining and lower biotin labeling of the Fab fragments. Therefore, thymocytes were incubated with PE-labeled anti-CD3É mAb either on ice to label only surface CD3É or at 37Â°C for 60 min to label both surface CD3É and CD3É that recycled to the cell surface during the 60-min incubation. More recycling CD3É was labeled in SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes than in WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C), indicating that the number of mature TCRâCD3 complexes present in the recycling pool is increased in the absence of SLAP. In contrast, the size of the CD3É recycling pool was more similar to SP thymocytes, suggesting that (consistent with its expression in DP thymocytes) SLAP regulates the size of the recycling pool specifically at the DP stage of thymocyte development.</p>
        <p>Our lab has previously shown that SLAP-mediated TCRâCD3 down-regulation on DP thymocytes does not depend on a positively selecting MHC allele (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we were interested in studying CD3É recycling in the absence of any TCR ligation. We reasoned that if we could block internalization of the TCRâCD3 complex, any new TCRâCD3 appearing on the cell surface would be caused by newly synthesized or recycled TCRâCD3. To block TCRâCD3 internalization, we exploited the observation that TCR is internalized via clathrin-coated pits (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Telerman et al., 1987</xref>). Hypertonic medium (e.g., 0.45 M sucrose) blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inducing spontaneous clathrin lattice formation in the absence of cell membranes, thereby depleting the cell of clathrin monomers that would be used in vesicle formation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Daukas and Zigmond, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Heuser and Anderson, 1989</xref>). Furthermore, hypertonic medium has been shown to inhibit internalization of the TCRâCD3 complex (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dallanegra et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
        <p>To validate the use of hypertonic medium to inhibit TCRâCD3 internalization, we first analyzed the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin by the transferrin receptor, a process that requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mellman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schmid, 1997</xref>). Because DP thymocytes do not express the transferrin receptor, we first tested the effect of hypertonic medium on Jurkat T cell lines that stably expressed either SLAP-GFP fusion or GFP alone as a control. Transferrin uptake via the transferrin receptor was completely inhibited by hypertonic medium in both stable cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A), demonstrating that hypertonic medium blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis regardless of whether SLAP is present or not. We analyzed the effect of SLAP on CD3É expression while clathrin-mediated endocytosis was blocked in Jurkat T cells. Strikingly, we were able to detect up-regulation of CD3É surface expression over the time course of the experiment in the control cell line. However, up-regulation of CD3É by Jurkat T cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of SLAP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B).</p>

        <p>To investigate whether SLAP expression affects up-regulation of CD3É on DP thymocytes as it did in our model cell line, we incubated thymocyte single-cell suspensions in hypertonic medium and followed CD3É expression over time. Both WT and SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes up-regulate CD3É on the cell surface over the course of the assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). However, quantitation demonstrated that CD3É up-regulation was substantially increased in SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes as compared with WT controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). Interestingly, the observed up-regulation of CD3É in hypertonic medium is comparable with the estimated amount of CD3É present in the recycling pool (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C), indicating that increases in the size of the TCRâCD3 recycling pool can be revealed upon incubation of thymocytes in hypertonic medium. Notably, the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin by double-negative thymocytes (which express low, but detectable, levels of the transferrin receptor) was inhibited in the presence of hypertonic medium (unpublished data), indicating that hypertonic medium inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis in our thymocyte cultures.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have reported that prolonged culture of DP thymocytes in the absence of TCRâMHC interactions results in up-regulation of the TCRâCD3 complex by the stabilization of newly synthesized TCRÎ± chains (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kearse et al., 1995</xref>). Indeed, both WT and SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes up-regulate CD3É when cultured in the absence of 0.45 M sucrose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). However, over this time course, the increase in CD3É expression was markedly lower than the increase observed in thymocytes that were incubated in hypertonic medium. In addition, most of the CD3É up-regulation that was observed in hypertonic medium was detected after only 2 h in culture, a time at which little or no CD3É up-regulation had yet occurred in the absence of 0.45 M sucrose. Furthermore, incubation of thymocytes in cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis had no effect on the up-regulation of CD3É in hypertonic medium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). In contrast, in parallel experiments using thymocytes cultured in media without 0.45 M sucrose, up-regulation of CD3É was sensitive to cycloheximide treatment (unpublished data), demonstrating that cycloheximide effectively inhibited protein synthesis in our cultures.</p>
        <p>It is possible that incubation of thymocytes in hypertonic medium has an effect on cell viability. However, Annexin V staining failed to demonstrate a decrease in thymocyte viability for thymocytes incubated in hypertonic medium (unpublished data). In addition, because SLAP protein expression is predominantly restricted to DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2001</xref>), up-regulation of CD3É in hypertonic medium should not be altered in SP thymocytes. Notably, CD3É up-regulation by CD4+ SP thymocytes that were cultured in hypertonic medium was similar regardless of genotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D). These data demonstrate that up-regulation of TCRâCD3 expression in hypertonic medium can be used to analyze the pool of recycling TCRâCD3 complexes in the absence of receptor cross-linking.</p>

        <title>The TCRÎ¶ chain is the target of SLAP</title>
        <p>We have demonstrated that expression of TCRÎ¶ is increased in SLAPâ/â thymocytes as a result of the impaired degradation of TCRÎ¶. A SLAP-GST fusion has previously been shown to interact with several phosphoproteins, including the TCRÎ¶ chain (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we postulated that SLAP could bind to TCRÎ¶, leading to its subsequent degradation. To study the interaction between SLAP and TCRÎ¶, we first examined Jurkat T cells that had been transiently transfected with SLAP-GFP to determine whether SLAP can interact with the endogenous TCRÎ¶ chain. SLAP-GFP, but not the GFP control, coimmunoprecipitated with TCRÎ¶ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Furthermore, SLAP-GFP containing a point mutation in the SH2 domain coimmunoprecipitated only weakly with TCRÎ¶. The cytoplasmic domain of TCRÎ¶ is phosphorylated by Lck (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iwashima et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">van Oers et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, the inhibition of Src family kinase catalytic activity with PP2 caused a loss of basal TCRÎ¶ phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Interestingly, PP2 treatment also caused a corresponding loss in SLAP-GFP coimmunoprecipitation with TCRÎ¶. The dependence on Src family kinase activity prompted us to study whether SLAP can interact with TCRÎ¶ in the Lck-deficient Jurkat T cell line JCaM1. Transiently transfected SLAP-GFP failed to coimmunoprecipitate with TCRÎ¶ in JCaM1; however, stable reconstitution of Lck back into the JCaM1 cell line resulted in the restoration of basal phospho-TCRÎ¶ as well as the recovery of SLAP-GFP coimmunoprecipitation with TCRÎ¶ (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B).</p>

        <p>In addition to TCRÎ¶, SLAP-GST has also been shown to interact with phosphorylated ZAP-70 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2000</xref>). ZAP-70 is also phosphorylated by Lck and can bind to the phosphorylated TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iwashima et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">van Oers et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, SLAP-GFP may indirectly interact with TCRÎ¶ via ZAP-70. However, transiently transfected SLAP-GFP also coimmunoprecipitated with TCRÎ¶ in the ZAP-70âdeficient Jurkat T cell line P116 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C), indicating that the interaction between phosphorylated TCRÎ¶ and SLAP-GFP does not require ZAP-70 and may instead be a direct interaction. Furthermore, neither surface TCRâCD3 expression (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Negishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kadlecek et al., 1998</xref>) nor the up-regulation of CD3É by DP thymocytes that were incubated in hypertonic medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E) were increased in the absence of ZAP-70, suggesting that ZAP-70 is not required for SLAP-mediated down-regulation of the TCRâCD3 complex in vivo.</p>
        <p>It has previously been shown that upon transient transfection, SLAP localizes to an intracellular compartment and displays partial colocalization with late endosomes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sosinowski et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that SLAP would colocalize with TCRÎ¶ in an intracellular compartment. Extensive colocalization of SLAP-GFP with endogenous TCRÎ¶ was observed after transient transfection into Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D). Colocalization occurred primarily in an intracellular compartment, as very little SLAP-GFP was detected at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, colocalization requires the SH2 domain of SLAP, as an SH2 point mutation of SLAP-GFP displayed very little colocalization with the TCRÎ¶ chain. These data suggest that the SH2 domain of SLAP is required for SLAP to interact with phosphorylated TCRÎ¶, thus targeting TCRÎ¶ for degradation.</p>
        <p>To investigate the requirement of TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domains for the effects of SLAP on TCR expression in vivo, we obtained TCRÎ¶-deficient mice that were reconstituted with transgenes encoding either full-length TCRÎ¶ (TCRÎ¶ Tg) or a cytoplasmic truncation of TCRÎ¶ (TCRÎ¶ D67â150; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Shores et al., 1994</xref>). TCRÎ¶ D67â150 is a deletion of amino acid residues 67â150 of TCRÎ¶, resulting in the loss of five out of six tyrosines that are normally present in the TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, relative to mice expressing TCRÎ¶ Tg, mice expressing TCRÎ¶ D67â150 displayed increased surface levels of TCRÎ² and CD3É on DP, but not SP, thymocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> F and not depicted). Furthermore, mice expressing the truncated form of TCRÎ¶ displayed increased CD3É up-regulation in hypertonic medium on DP, but not SP, thymocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> G), suggesting that the TCRâCD3 recycling pool is increased in the absence of the TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain. The observed increase was not caused by new synthesis of the complex, as cycloheximide had no effect on TCRâCD3 recycling in hypertonic medium (unpublished data). Additionally, no significant increase in CD3É expression was observed in thymocytes that were incubated in the absence of 0.45 M sucrose (unpublished data). These data indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of TCRÎ¶ is required to prevent the accumulation of fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes in the recycling pool of DP thymocytes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have studied the mechanism by which TCRâCD3 expression is increased in the absence of SLAP. Our data demonstrate that SLAPâ/â thymocytes have increased TCRÎ¶ expression as a result of a defect in TCRÎ¶ degradation. Failure to degrade TCRÎ¶ leads to an accumulation of fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes that continue to recycle back to the plasma membrane instead of being retained and/or degraded. In addition, we have shown that Lck, but not ZAP-70 activity, is required for SLAP to interact with the phosphorylated form of TCRÎ¶. It has previously been shown that TCRÎ¶ is basally phosphorylated in DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">van Oers et al., 1994</xref>) and that TCRÎ¶ phosphorylation is almost undetectable in Lckâ/â thymocytes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">van Oers et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, surface TCRâCD3 expression is also up-regulated in Lckâ/â DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Molina et al., 1992</xref>), suggesting that the inability of SLAP to bind TCRÎ¶ may contribute to the increase in TCRâCD3 expression that was observed on Lckâ/â DP thymocytes. Thus, SLAP regulates the expression of TCR on DP thymocytes by targeting tyrosine-phosphorylated TCRÎ¶ for degradation in an Lck-dependent manner.</p>
      <p>In addition to Lck, our studies suggest that regulation of TCRâCD3 expression by SLAP requires the cytoplasmic domain of TCRÎ¶. TCRÎ¶-deficient mice that are transgenic for a truncated form of TCRÎ¶ (TCRÎ¶ D67â150) express increased levels of surface TCRâCD3 as well as an increased pool of recycling CD3É on DP, but not SP, thymocytes. It is possible that in the absence of the majority of TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domains, trafficking of the TCRâCD3 complex is altered such that internalization and/or recycling of the complex leads to the phenotype that we have observed in TCRÎ¶ D67â150 DP thymocytes via a SLAP-independent mechanism. Notably, the TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain contains multiple tyrosine-based motifs that could mediate internalization of the TCRâCD3 complex. However, a recent study demonstrated that the mutation of all six tyrosines present in the TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain had no effect on the internalization of the TCRâCD3 complex (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Szymczak and Vignali, 2005</xref>). An additional study has indicated that a similar deletion of the TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain increases the rate of TCRâCD3 internalization (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">D'Oro et al., 2002</xref>). This later study suggests that, if anything, TCRâCD3 expression should be decreased in the absence of the TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that altered trafficking of the TCRâCD3 complex either contributes to or is responsible for the increased surface TCRâCD3 expression and increased pool of recycling CD3É in TCRÎ¶ D67â150 DP thymocytes. However, our findings are also consistent with a role for the phosphorylated TCRÎ¶ cytoplasmic domain interacting with SLAP, thereby leading to its accelerated degradation.</p>
      <p>Previous data indicate that unassembled TCRÎ¶ chains are rapidly degraded in the ER of DP thymocytes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino et al., 1990</xref>) and that newly synthesized TCRÎ¶ chains are stabilized by their incorporation into fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kearse et al., 1995</xref>). This raised the possibility that SLAP could function to prevent assembly of the TCRâCD3 complex. Currently, it is believed that the rate of TCRâCD3 assembly is low in DP thymocytes as a result of the instability of the TCRÎ± chain. However, because we failed to detect a difference in expression, synthesis, or degradation of the TCRÎ± chain in the absence of SLAP, we must conclude that SLAP does not regulate assembly of the TCRâCD3 complex by the mechanism previously described. In addition, our data clearly demonstrate that SLAP interacts with the phosphorylated TCRÎ¶ chain, which has been shown to be present only in fully assembled, mature TCRâCD3 complexes (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kearse et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that SLAP plays a direct role in the assembly of TCRâCD3. We cannot exclude the possibility that SLAP somehow regulates TCRâCD3 assembly through an indirect mechanism that has yet to be described. However, our data suggests that a substantial proportion of TCRÎ¶ is present mainly in fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes, as evidenced by the large increase in TCRÎ¶ chain protein expression in WT thymocytes as compared with TCRÎ±â/â thymocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Together, these data strongly indicate that the degradation of TCRÎ¶ observed in WT DP thymocytes is predominantly caused by the degradation of TCRÎ¶ that was derived from fully assembled TCRâCD3 complexes.</p>
      <p>The TCR has been shown to undergo constitutive internalization in cell lines and T cells, with an estimate of 0.6â1.2% of TCRs internalized per minute (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Menne et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, subtle modifications to the rate of recycling or internalization could have large effects on the steady-state level of TCR expression on the cell surface. We consistently observed an increase in both the rate as well as the absolute amount of CD3É recycled by SLAPâ/â DP thymocytes. Notably, the increased amount of CD3É recycled (5â9% as calculated from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B) is consistent with the 5â7.5% of TCRÎ¶ chains that are estimated to be phosphorylated in the thymus (van Oers, N., personal communication). Furthermore, the small difference in CD3É recycling can account for the loss of TCRÎ¶ that is observed over time in WT but not for SLAPâ/â thymocytes when incubated in cycloheximide. Therefore, SLAP appears to target only a small proportion of the constitutively recycling TCRâCD3 complexes that contain phospho-TCRÎ¶. However, this has a substantial effect on the steady-state level of TCRâCD3 expression in SLAP-deficient thymocytes.</p>
      <p>In contrast to TCRÎ¶, we were unable to detect a substantial increase in the level of TCRÎ±, TCRÎ², or CD3É in the absence of SLAP. Likewise, degradation of TCRÎ±, TCRÎ², and CD3É was not noticeably altered in the absence of SLAP. One possible explanation for these observations is that DP thymocytes typically express a relatively large intracellular pool of unassembled and/or partially assembled TCRâCD3 chains, some of which are rapidly degraded (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino et al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). Therefore, the large pools of unassembled TCRâCD3 chains could mask any differences in TCRâCD3 expression or degradation. Alternatively, our results could also be interpreted to indicate that TCRÎ¶ separates from the rest of the mature TCRâCD3 complex and is independently degraded via a SLAP-dependent mechanism. Separation of the TCRâCD3 complex has been previously described (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kishimoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ono et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Thien et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">La Gruta et al., 2004</xref>). Additional studies will be required to conclusively determine whether the remainder of the recycling TCRâCD3 complex is also degraded via a SLAP-dependent mechanism or is retained in an intracellular compartment.</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which SLAP targets TCRÎ¶ for degradation has yet to be elucidated. Degradation of TCRÎ¶ is likely to involve the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). SLAP has been previously reported to interact with the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of c-Cbl (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, c-Cblâdeficient mice have a very similar phenotype to SLAP-deficient mice with regard to TCRâCD3, CD4, and CD5 up-regulation on DP thymocytes and increases in positive selection (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Naramura et al., 1998</xref>). Finally, TCRÎ¶ has been previously shown to be ubiquitinated (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cenciarelli et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 1994</xref>), perhaps via c-Cbl (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we suspect that the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl is required to target TCRÎ¶ for degradation and subsequently prevent the accumulation of recycling TCRâCD3 complexes. Indeed, our unpublished results indicate that c-Cbl and SLAP function in the same pathway to regulate TCRâCD3 expression on DP thymocytes by targeting the TCRÎ¶ chain for degradation (unpublished data). Therefore, we suggest the model shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. Surface TCRâCD3 complexes in DP thymocytes are constitutively phosphorylated on TCRÎ¶ chains by Lck. The TCRâCD3 complex is internalized and transported to an intracellular compartment where SLAP binds to phosphorylated TCRÎ¶, thus targeting TCRÎ¶ for ubiquitination and degradation via a c-Cblâdependent mechanism. In the absence of TCRÎ¶, the remainder of the TCRâCD3 complex is either degraded or retained in an intracellular compartment. Conversely, in the absence of SLAP, the TCRÎ¶ is neither ubiquitinated nor degraded, and the TCRâCD3 complex remains intact and continues to recycle back to the plasma membrane.</p>

      <p>We have identified a novel mechanism by which TCRâCD3 expression is regulated in a developmentally restricted manner. Together with previous studies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino et al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kearse et al., 1995</xref>) that have implicated regulation of the TCRâCD3 complex at the level of ER assembly is the current mechanism of SLAP-mediated degradation of phospho-TCRÎ¶âcontaining complexes. It is interesting to speculate why DP thymocytes possess multiple mechanisms to regulate surface TCRâCD3 expression. We suspect that receptor levels are kept low on DP thymocytes to ensure the selection of developing thymocytes that express TCRs with the appropriate avidity for self-peptideâMHC complexes. As a result of the massive amplification of the TCR signaling cascade, it may be difficult for a thymocyte to differentiate between strong and weak TCR signals if TCR levels are high. Therefore, quantitative differences in signaling may be more easily distinguished if levels of surface TCRâCD3 are kept low. Likewise, the increase in receptor levels after positive selection may be desirable for a heightened sensitivity of thymocytes to self-peptides that lead to negative selection. Such increases in receptor levels could be achieved both by down-regulating SLAP expression as well as by promoting TCR assembly. Thus, SLAP may play a key role in regulating TCRâCD3 levels during thymocyte development to optimize receptor levels for both positive and negative selection.</p>

After 30 min in culture, thymocytes were washed twice with PBS. Surface-bound antibody was removed by washing thymocytes twice in ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA, pH 1.5, followed by immediate neutralization in FACS buffer. These conditions removed &gt;97% of cell surface staining. 5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> ml of thymocytes were incubated at 37Â°C in primary cell culture for the indicated time points. At each time point, cells were mixed with 100 Î¼l of ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub> and were maintained on ice for the remainder of the assay. After all time points had been collected, thymocytes were again washed twice in ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA, pH 1.5, followed by immediate neutralization in FACS buffer to remove anti-CD3É antibody that was bound to recycled CD3É.

        <p>For total levels of TCRÎ±, CD3É, and TCRÎ¶, CD8+ thymocytes were purified by using magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recovered cells were â¥95% DP, as assessed by FACS. CD8+ thymocytes were lysed at 200 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> ml in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, PMSF, and pepstatin A) for 30 min on ice. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifuging samples at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> (4Â°C) for 30 min. For TCRÎ±, postnuclear supernatants from 50 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cell equivalents were immunoprecipitated with Î±-TCRÎ± (H-142; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein G (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4Â°C. Samples were washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. For CD3É and TCRÎ¶, postnuclear supernatants from 5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cell equivalents were mixed with SDS loading buffer and were boiled. Samples were electrophoresed in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Immobilon, and blotted for Î±-tubulin (B-5-1-2; Sigma-Aldrich), TCRÎ± (H-142), CD3É (M20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or TCRÎ¶ (8D3; BD Biosciences). Subsequently, membranes were incubated in secondary antibodies coupled to HRP (GE Healthcare) and were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). For TCRâCD3 degradation experiments, CD8+ thymocytes were cultured in primary cell culture media containing 100 Î¼g/ml cycloheximide. At each time point, thymocytes were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer and were maintained on ice for the remainder of the experiment. Lysates were blotted for Î±-tubulin, TCRÎ±, CD3É, or TCRÎ¶ as described above. Western blots were quantitated on an Image Station (Eastman Kodak Co.) using 1D Image Analysis software version 3.5 (Eastman Kodak Co.).</p>
        <p>For SLAP/TCRÎ¶ coimmunoprecipitations, cells were transiently transfected with GFP, SLAP-GFP, or SH2-GFP overnight. Cells were washed twice in PBS and were lysed at 50 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> ml in RIPA lysis buffer as described above (but supplemented with NaVO<sub>4</sub>). Postnuclear supernatants from 60 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells were immunoprecipitated with TCRÎ¶ (6B10.2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein G as described above. Samples were electrophoresed in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Immobilon, and blotted for GFP (JL8; CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) or phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology) as described for Western blotting. Subsequently, membranes were stripped (30 min at 55Â°C in 5% SDS, 100 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8) and blotted for TCRÎ¶ (8D3; BD Biosciences).

Samples were fixed in 4% PFA (20 min at RT) and were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 min at RT). Samples were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.5% milk, and 1% goat serum) for 10 min at RT and were incubated in primary antibody (6B10.2, 1:50) in blocking buffer for 2 h at 37Â°C. After washing, samples were incubated in secondary antibody (Cy5 goat antiâmouse IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in blocking buffer for 20 min at RT. Samples were washed, coverslipped in gel/mount (Biomeda), and visualized on a turnkey inverted digital microscopy system (Marianas; Intelligent Imaging) that was built around an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) using a plan-Neofluar 40Ã oil immersion objective (NA 1.3; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.).
