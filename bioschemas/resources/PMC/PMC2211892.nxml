      <abstract>
        <p>The complement system is an essential component of host defense against pathogens. Previous research in our laboratory identified StcE, a metalloprotease secreted by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 that cleaves the serpin C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a major regulator of the classical complement cascade. Analyses of StcE-treated C1-INH activity revealed that surprisingly, StcE enhanced the ability of C1-INH to inhibit the classical complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes. StcE directly interacts with both cells and C1-INH, thereby binding C1-INH to the cell surface. This suggests that the augmented activity of StcE-treated C1-INH is due to the increased concentration of C1-INH at the sites of potential lytic complex formation. Indeed, removal of StcE abolishes the ability of C1-INH to bind erythrocyte surfaces, whereas the proteolysis of C1-INH is unnecessary to potentiate its inhibitory activity. Physical analyses showed that StcE interacts with C1-INH within its aminoterminal domain, allowing the unaffected serpin domain to interact with its targets. In addition, StcE-treated C1-INH provides significantly increased serum resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 over native C1-INH. These data suggest that by recruiting C1-INH to cell surfaces, StcE may protect both <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and the host cells to which the bacterium adheres from complement-mediated lysis and potentially damaging inflammatory events.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Innate mechanisms of immunity are fundamental components of host defense and are essential for the detection and clearance of many invading pathogens. Among them, the complement system serves multiple functions, including opsonization and lysis of organisms, production of chemoattractant molecules, mediation of inflammation, and augmentation of humoral immunity (for review see reference <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Acting in a series of interlinked proteolytic cascades comprised of multiple serine proteases, complement pathways are rapidly up-regulated and the components are amplified upon activation. To protect the host from the adverse inflammatory and cytolytic effects resulting from complement activation, multiple factors exist to prevent unregulated complement activity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
      <p>One of these factors is C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), an essential regulator of classical complement, intrinsic coagulation, and contact activation (for review see reference <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). C1-INH is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family of molecules, which includes antithrombin, Î±-1-antitrypsin, and plasminogen activator type-1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Serpins control multiple proteolytic cascades in the body by nonenzymatically inactivating target serine proteases in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Serpins interact with their targets via the serpin reactive center loop (RCL) which, when cleaved by the serine protease, inserts into the target molecule. This insertion irreversibly displaces the active serine of the protease from its catalytic partners (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>C1-INH is the only known inhibitor of activated C1r and C1s of the classical complement cascade and the MASP 1 and 2 proteases of the mannose-binding ligand pathway, and is a major inhibitor of Factor XIIa (Hageman Factor), kallikrein, and Factor XIa of the inflammation, fibrinolysis, and the intrinsic coagulation pathways (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, C1-INH competes with Factor B for binding to C3b to inhibit the activation of the alternative complement pathway (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). C1-INH is a heavily glycosylated protein and the majority of the posttranslational modifications occur within the aminoterminal domain unique to this serpin. Interestingly, removal of this domain does not affect the ability of C1-INH to interact with or inhibit its targets (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As with other serpins, glycosaminoglycans can potentiate the inhibitory capacity of C1-INH, although the effect of potentiation differs depending on the substrate (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). C1-INH forms large SDS-insoluble complexes with its target proteases that are subsequently removed from circulation (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition to its soluble form, cell-associated C1-INH may protect cells from proinflammatory events at their surface (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, the mechanism by which this form of C1-INH is bound to the cell surface is unknown.</p>
      <p>
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 is an enteric human pathogen responsible for diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and the potentially lethal hemolytic uremic syndrome. Multiple virulence determinants have been recognized in <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, including the Shiga toxin, an ADP-ribosylating enzyme that inhibits protein synthesis, and the locus of enterocyte effacement, responsible for conferring the attaching and effacing phenotype on intestinal epithelial cells (for review see references <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Our laboratory has identified an additional potential virulence factor, StcE, a metalloprotease that cleaves C1-INH from its apparent full-length M<sub>r</sub> of 105 kD to produce unique â¼60â65-kD species (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). StcE is encoded on pO157, a large plasmid carried by strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, and is ubiquitous among isolates of the enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> 1 complex (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). StcE is secreted by a functional type II secretion apparatus also encoded on pO157, and its expression has been detected in vivo (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this report, we investigate the functional consequence of the interaction between StcE and C1-INH. We show that instead of inactivating C1-INH, StcE potentiates the ability of C1-INH to inhibit classical complement activity by recruiting the inhibitor to cell surfaces. Additionally, physical analysis indicates that StcE cleaves C1-INH not in the RCL, but within its heavily glycosylated NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain. Finally, we show that StcE-treated C1-INH provides increased serum resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting that StcE may aid the protection of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 from complement activity during infection.</p>

        <p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. Buffers used were PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), TBS (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), VBS (5 mM veronal, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), VBS<sup>2+</sup> (VBS containing 0.15 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and VBS containing 10 mM EDTA. Recombinant DNA manipulations were performed by standard methods. pTB4 was constructed by amplifying bases 207â2795 of the <italic>stcE</italic> gene from pO157 by PCR with the primers <italic>stcE</italic>Sac5â²207 (5â²-CCGAGCTCCGGCTGATAATAATTCAGCCATTTATTTC-3â²) and <italic>stcE</italic>3â²Xba2795 (5â²-CCTCGAGTTTATATACAACCCTGATTG-3â²), and cloning the product into the SacI-XhoI sites of pET24d(+) (Novagen). WAM2751 is <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) transformed with pTB4. pTB5 was constructed in the same manner as pTB4 by amplifying the equivalent bases of the <italic>stcE</italic> E435D mutant from pTEG1 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). WAM2804 is <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pTB5. StcEâ²-His, lacking the StcE NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal signal sequence and containing a 6xHis tag at the COOH terminus, and StcEâ² E435D-His, a similar protein with a single amino acid change at residue 435 (glutamic to aspartic acid) that disrupts the catalytic activity of the protease, were purified from WAM2751 and WAM2804, respectively, as previously described (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and dialyzed into VBS, pH 6.5. Purified C1-INH was obtained from Advanced Research Technologies and purified kallikrein and C1s were from Calbiochem. All proteins were stored at â80Â°C. mAbs 3C7 and 4C3 were provided by P.A.

        <title>Hemolytic Assays.</title>
        <p>Sheep erythrocytes were prepared according to Mayer (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Erythrocytes were opsonized with an antiâsheep red blood cell Ab for 10 min before use. Human serum (0.5%) was mixed with opsonized erythrocytes (10<sup>7</sup> in 50 Î¼l) in VBS<sup>2+</sup> to a total volume of 200 Î¼l for 1 h at 37Â°C before the addition of 1 ml VBS plus 10 mM EDTA to stop complement activity. To measure the amount of hemoglobin released by lysed cells, erythrocytes were pelleted and the OD<sub>412</sub> of the supernatant was measured in a spectrophotometer. The percent lysis was determined by subtracting the OD<sub>412</sub> in the absence of serum and dividing by the maximum possible OD<sub>412</sub> obtained by lysis of erythrocytes in water. Where indicated, increasing concentrations of StcEâ²-His or BSA were incubated with serum overnight at room temperature before the start of the assay. To determine the effect of StcE-treated C1-INH on erythrocyte lysis, increasing concentrations of StcEâ²-His or BSA were mixed with 16 Î¼g C1-INH, or increasing concentrations of C1-INH were mixed with 1 Î¼g StcEâ²-His or 1 Î¼g StcEâ² E435D-His in a total volume of 149 Î¼l VBS<sup>2+</sup> overnight at room temperature before the start of the assay.

        <p>8 Î¼g C1-INH was untreated or treated with 1 Î¼g StcEâ²-His in a total volume of 149 Î¼l VBS<sup>2+</sup> as described above before the addition of opsonized sheep erythrocytes and human serum deficient in complement component C5 (Quidel Corp.). Erythrocytes were incubated for 10 min at 37Â°C before the addition of VBS plus 10 mM EDTA. Cells were washed with VBS<sup>2+</sup> and incubated on ice for 30 min with polyclonal goat antiâhuman IgG against C1-INH (Cedarlane Laboratories). Erythrocytes were washed, incubated on ice for 30 min with FITC-conjugated rabbit antiâgoat IgG, and resuspended in VBS<sup>2+</sup> for analysis by flow cytometry using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCaliburâ¢; Becton Dickinson). Where indicated, StcEâ²-His was removed from the assay mixture by adsorption to Ni-NTA agarose beads (QIAGEN) in the presence of 50 mM imidazole before the addition of sheep erythrocytes. To measure StcE-treated C1-INH saturation kinetics of erythrocytes, increasing concentrations of C1-INH were mixed with 1 Î¼g StcEâ² E435D-His before the addition of 10<sup>7</sup> sheep erythrocytes as described above in the absence of human serum and analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>
        <p>To determine if StcE binds sheep erythrocytes, StcEâ²-His was labeled via its primary amines with the Alexa Fluor 488 dye as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). 5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> sheep erythrocytes were opsonized as described above, pelleted, and resuspended in 500 Î¼l VBS<sup>2+</sup> before the addition of 250 ng StcEâ²-His or Alexa-labeled StcEâ²-His for 10 min at 37Â°C. Erythrocytes were pelleted and washed with VBS<sup>2+</sup> before analysis by flow cytometry. To measure the point at which erythrocytes become saturated with StcE, increasing concentrations of Alexa-labeled StcEâ²-His were added to 10<sup>7</sup> sheep erythrocytes for 10 min at 37Â°C before analysis by flow cytometry as described above.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of Classical Complement-mediated Erythrocyte Lysis by StcE.</title>
        <p>Previous research from our laboratory demonstrated that StcE, a metalloprotease secreted by <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, cleaves the serum protein C1-INH from its apparent M<sub>r</sub> of 105 kD to produce â¼60â65-kD species (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As C1-INH is an essential regulator of the classical complement pathway, we examined the effect of StcE on the classical complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes. Human serum was mixed overnight with increasing concentrations of StcE or the control protein BSA before adding to opsonized sheep erythrocytes for 1 h at 37Â°C. The reaction was stopped with EDTA and the amount of hemoglobin released by lysed erythrocytes into the supernatant was measured. Serum alone lysed 75.0% (Â±2.7% SEM) of erythrocytes and BSA had no effect on the ability of serum to lyse erythrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). At higher concentrations, though, StcE significantly reduced classical complement-mediated erythrocyte lysis compared with equivalent amounts of BSA (2 Î¼g, P &lt; 0.01; 4 Î¼g, P &lt; 0.005).</p>

        <title>StcE Potentiates C1-INHâmediated Inhibition of Classical Complement.</title>
        <p>Although StcE cleaves the serum component C1-INH, the data represented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> do not implicate the serpin directly in StcE-mediated classical complement inhibition. To examine if StcE-treated C1-INH plays a role in this process, we mixed purified C1-INH with increasing concentrations of StcE or BSA overnight and added this mixture to human serum and opsonized sheep erythrocytes for 1 h at 37Â°C. As before, the reaction was stopped with EDTA and the amount of hemoglobin released by lysed erythrocytes into the supernatant was measured. The addition of 0.4 IU untreated C1-INH to the assay decreased erythrocyte lysis from 82.9 (Â±1.1% SEM) to 33.7% (Â±1.8% SEM; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A), demonstrating the effective role of C1-INH in the inhibition of classical complement activity. Although BSA-treated C1-INH was unchanged in inhibitory activity, 0.4 IU StcE-treated C1-INH reduced erythrocyte lysis to between 1.5 (Â±0.5% SEM) and 0.1% (Â±0.1% SEM) of total.</p>

These results demonstrate the direct role of StcE-treated C1-INH in the decrease of classical complement-mediated erythrocyte lysis.

        <title>StcE Binds Erythrocyte Surfaces.</title>
        <p>To understand how StcE might potentiate C1-INH, we asked if StcE could interact with erythrocytes, thereby acting as a binding protein for C1-INH on cell surfaces. 250 ng unlabeled StcEâ²-His or a form of StcEâ²-His fluorescently labeled via its primary amines with the Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Alexa-StcEâ²-His) were added to opsonized sheep erythrocytes for 10 min at 37Â°C. Erythrocytes were pelleted and washed with VBS<sup>2+</sup> before analysis by flow cytometry. Erythrocytes treated with Alexa-labeled StcEâ²-His showed 80-fold greater mean fluorescence compared with cells treated with unlabeled StcEâ²-His (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A), demonstrating a direct interaction between these cells and the protease. Furthermore, we observed that StcE continues to bind sheep erythrocytes even at lower temperatures (0â4Â°C), suggesting that this interaction is not mediated by an active cellular process (not depicted). To determine if the interaction between erythrocytes and StcE is specific and therefore saturable, we mixed increasing concentrations of Alexa-labeled StcEâ²-His with 10<sup>7</sup> sheep erythrocytes as described above. We observed that this number of erythrocytes becomes saturated with StcEâ²-His at 3.2 Î¼g of the protease in 500 Î¼l (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). Based on the calculated molecular weight of StcEâ²-His, at this concentration we estimate â¼1.8 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> molecules of StcE are bound per erythrocyte.</p>

        <title>StcE Localizes C1-INH to Erythrocyte Surfaces.</title>
        <p>Based on the ability of StcE to directly bind erythrocytes, we asked if StcE could localize C1-INH to erythrocyte surfaces, thereby possibly increasing the local concentration of inhibitor at the site of potential lytic complex formation. C1-INH was untreated or treated with StcEâ²-His overnight before the addition of opsonized sheep erythrocytes and C5-deficient human serum (to prevent formation of the membrane attack complex and lysis of the cells) for 10 min at 37Â°C. Erythrocytes were washed, treated with an Ab against C1-INH, and washed again before the addition of an FITC-conjugated secondary Ab. Deposition of C1-INH was subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. Little to no C1-INH binding was measured on erythrocytes treated with only StcEâ²-His or native C1-INH compared with mock-treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). However, increased deposition of C1-INH was detected on erythrocytes mixed with 0.2 IU StcE-treated C1-INH. Similar results were observed in the absence of human serum, indicating that serum components or complement activation are not required for the localization of StcE-treated C1-INH to erythrocyte surfaces. As we observed with the interaction between StcE and sheep erythrocytes, StcE-treated C1-INH continues to bind the cells at 0â4Â°C (not depicted).</p>

Erythrocytes were washed and polyclonal goat antiâhuman C1-INH IgG was added to cells. C1-INH binding was detected with FITC-conjugated antiâgoat IgG in a flow cytometer. (B) 8 Î¼g C1-INH was incubated with or without 1 Î¼g StcEâ²-His overnight at room temperature before the addition of 50 mM imidazole and Ni-NTA agarose beads to remove StcEâ²-His from the sample. Opsonized sheep erythrocytes were added for 10 min at 37Â°C and C1-INH binding was detected as described. As a control for StcE-treated C1-INH binding, StcEâ²-His was not removed from one sample before analysis.

        <p>The results suggest that StcE may directly mediate the binding of C1-INH to the cell surface. To test this possibility, C1-INH was incubated with or without StcEâ²-His overnight as described earlier, after which Ni-NTA agarose beads were added to the samples in the presence of 50 mM imidazole to specifically remove the 6xHis-tagged StcE protein from the assay. The agarose beads were pelleted and the supernatants were mixed with sheep erythrocytes and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. In the absence of the protease, StcE-treated C1-INH no longer binds to erythrocyte surfaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B), indicating that StcE itself is required to sequester C1-INH to erythrocytes. The absence of StcEâ²-His from the Ni-NTA agarose-treated samples and the presence of equivalent amounts of C1-INH between Ni-NTA agarose-treated and untreated samples were confirmed by immunoblot analyses (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To determine the level at which erythrocytes become saturated with StcE-treated C1-INH, we mixed StcEâ² E435D-His (a mutant form of the protein containing a single amino acid change from glutamic to aspartic acid at position 435 that is unable to cleave C1-INH; reference <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) with increasing concentrations of C1-INH (from 0.25 to 16 Î¼g) before the addition of opsonized sheep erythrocytes as described above. We chose to use StcEâ² E435D-His in this experiment so as to measure the saturation of sheep erythrocytes with C1-INH without the creation of StcE-cleaved C1-INH, which might reduce the levels of the serpin bound to the cell surface, thereby increasing the amount needed to saturate the cells. We observed that in the presence of 1 Î¼g StcEâ² E435D-His, this number of erythrocytes becomes saturated with C1-INH at 4 Î¼g, or 0.1 IU, of the serpin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). Based on the observed molecular weight of mature C1-INH and assuming uniform binding of the primary and secondary antibodies to their antigens, at this concentration we estimate â¼2.25 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> molecules of C1-INH are bound per erythrocyte. Finally, to determine if C1-INH and StcE can interact in solution (before binding erythrocytes), C1-INH was mixed with either StcEâ²-His or StcEâ² E435D-His for 10 min at 37Â°C before immunoprecipitating the mixture with an antiâC1-INH Ab. After separating the immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and transferring them to nitrocellulose, both StcEâ²-His and StcEâ² E435D-His were detected with an antiâStcEâ²-His Ab, demonstrating that a complex of StcE and C1-INH can be formed in solution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D).</p>

        <title>Cleavage of C1-INH by StcE Is Not Necessary to Protect Cells against Complement Activity.</title>
        <p>To test if the proteolysis of C1-INH by StcE is necessary to provide erythrocytes increased protection against classical complement activity over that of untreated C1-INH, we mixed C1-INH with either StcEâ²-His or the proteolytically inactive StcEâ² E435D-His. After overnight incubation, the samples were added to human serum and opsonized sheep erythrocytes for 1 h at 37Â°C before determining the amount of hemoglobin released into the supernatant by the lysed cells as described above. In the presence of 0.2 IU C1-INH, human serum lysed 75.8% (Â±1.5% SEM) of the erythrocytes, whereas StcEâ²-Hisâtreated C1-INH significantly decreased erythrocyte lysis to 25.4% (Â±3.5% SEM, P &lt; 0.005; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Interestingly, the cleavage of C1-INH by StcE is not required for the protection of erythrocytes from complement activity, as StcEâ² E435D-Hisâtreated C1-INH was able to significantly reduce the lysis of the cells to 16.7% (Â±1.3% SEM, P &lt; 0.005). The difference in the amount of erythrocyte lysis between the StcEâ²-Hisâ and StcEâ² E435D-Hisâtreated C1-INH samples was not significant (P &gt; 0.05).</p>

        <title>StcE Is Unable to Potentiate C1-INH in the Absence of Cells.</title>
        <p>Data presented so far demonstrate the ability of StcE to localize C1-INH to erythrocytes, thereby providing increased complement-inhibiting activity at the cell surface. To determine if this potentiation can occur in solution (i.e., in the absence of cells), we measured whether StcE affects the ability of C1-INH to inhibit kallikrein, another C1-INHâregulated molecule, by monitoring the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate of kallikrein, S-2302 (<italic>H</italic>-<sc>d</sc>-Prolyl-<sc>l</sc>-phenylalanyl-<sc>l</sc>-arginine-<italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline dihydrochloride). Increasing concentrations of C1-INH were untreated or treated with StcEâ²-His overnight at room temperature, after which the samples were allowed to react with kallikrein for 1 h at 37Â°C. The C1-INH/kallikrein mixtures were subsequently incubated with S-2302 for 30 min at room temperature before determining total kallikrein activity by measuring the change in absorbance of the samples in a spectrophotometer. For the purpose of this assay, kallikrein in the absence of C1-INH was considered to be 100% active. As expected, increasing concentrations of C1-INH resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in kallikrein activity, ranging from 88.8 (Â±2.6% SEM) to 10.3% (Â±1.3% SEM) activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). The addition of StcE-treated C1-INH to the assay did not significantly alter the inactivation of kallikrein compared with untreated C1-INH.</p>

The high molecular weight band in samples containing C1-INH that are absent from the sample containing C1s alone are indicative of the C1sâC1-INH interaction. If StcE were able to potentiate C1-INH in solution, an increase in the intensity of the C1sâC1-INH band would be visible. However, this does not appear to be the case (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B).

        <title>Interaction of StcE with the NH<sub>2</sub> Terminus of C1-INH.</title>
        <p>The ability of StcE to interact with C1-INH while maintaining the inhibitory activity of the molecule suggests that StcE may bind C1-INH in the heavily glycosylated NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain, leaving the serpin domain unaffected. Therefore, to further characterize the site(s) of cleavage by StcE, we examined StcE-treated C1-INH with the mAbs 3C7 and 4C3, directed against the amino terminus of C1-INH (Patston, P.A., personal communication) and the RCL-inserted form of C1-INH (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), respectively. As most preparations of purified C1-INH contain trace amounts of RCL-cleaved C1-INH, we removed this species of C1-INH from the mixture by immunoprecipitation with mAb 4C3 before analysis. Virgin C1-INH was treated with StcE or kallikrein, a serine protease inactivated by C1-INH via its interaction with and cleavage of the RCL, before analysis by immunoblot with a polyclonal antiâhuman C1-INH Ab (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, left), 3C7 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, middle), or 4C3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, right). As expected, analysis with 3C7 detected both virgin C1-INH and kallikrein-reacted C1-INH, but did not detect StcE-cleaved C1-INH, indicating a modification of the C1-INH NH<sub>2</sub> terminus by StcE. Additionally, analysis with 4C3 detected RCL-inserted C1-INH produced upon interaction with kallikrein, but not virgin C1-INH or StcE-treated C1-INH.</p>

        <p>To confirm that StcE interacts with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of C1-INH, we examined the ability of StcE to cleave a recombinant C1-INH protein lacking this region. Coutinho et al. (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) demonstrated that C-serp(98), a recombinant C1-INH molecule lacking the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids 1â97 and containing only the serpin domain, binds its serine protease substrates identically to wild-type C1-INH and is effective in inhibiting C1 activity in hemolytic assays. We expressed recombinant, full-length human C1-INH (hC1-INH) and C-serp(98) in COS-7 cells and harvested the culture media after 24 h in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine. Samples were untreated or treated with StcEâ²-His overnight before immunoprecipitating metabolically labeled protein with polyclonal antiâhuman C1-INH IgG. Both hC1-INH and C-serp(98) migrated at the appropriate molecular weights on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel, however, only hC1-INH was cleaved by StcEâ²-His. C-serp(98) was unaffected by the protease (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). These analyses further support the evidence that StcE does not inactivate C1-INH, but instead interacts with the heavily glycosylated NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of C1-INH, leaving the serpin domain available for interaction with C1-INH targets.</p>

Bacteria were incubated at 37Â°C for 1 h, serially diluted, and plated onto LB agar to determine the numbers of surviving CFUs.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report, we define the outcome of the interaction between StcE, a metalloprotease secreted by the enteric pathogen <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, and its apparent target, the serpin C1-INH. Rather than reducing or destroying its serpin activity, this interaction in effect enhances the ability of C1-INH to down-regulate the classical complement cascade, thereby protecting cells from the lytic effects of complement activity. Specifically, we found that the addition of StcE-treated C1-INH to opsonized sheep erythrocytes and human serum significantly decreased erythrocyte lysis below that of equivalent amounts of native C1-INH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The decrease is specific for StcE and C1-INH, as BSA had no effect on erythrocyte lysis. We also observed a significant decrease in complement activity when human serum was treated with StcE before the addition of sheep erythrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This is likely due to the activity of StcE on the endogenous C1-INH found in serum, although other potential targets cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, analysis of complement component deposition on erythrocyte surfaces indicates that StcE-treated C1-INH continues to act on its natural targets C1r and/or C1s.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we observed that StcE was unable to potentiate C1-INH activity in the absence of cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These data suggest that rather than modifying C1-INH directly to increase its inhibitory ability, StcE might be tethering the serpin to cell surfaces, thereby increasing the local concentration of the inhibitor at the sites of potential lytic complex formation. Functional C1-INH has been identified on the surface of multiple cell types including endothelial cells and platelets (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Moreover, work by Patston and Schapira (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) demonstrated that C1-INH binds extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen IV and laminin while retaining inhibitory activity against C1s. C1-INH cross-linked by tissue transglutaminase to the extracellular matrix may influence the local regulation of C1-INHâcontrolled proteolytic pathways (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and recombinant, GPI-anchored C1-INHâexpressing porcine endothelial cells are protected from human complement-mediated lysis (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Indeed, ex vivo reperfusion of pig liver with C1-INH showed immunoreactive C1-INH localized to the sinusoidal endothelium and reduced plasma C3 activation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>
      <p>With this in mind, we investigated whether StcE could localize C1-INH to erythrocyte surfaces, thereby increasing the local concentration of the inhibitor at sites of potential lytic complex formation. We found that StcE-treated C1-INH, but not native C1-INH, binds erythrocyte surfaces (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A), providing a plausible explanation for the reduced classical complement activity observed. The StcE-mediated binding of C1-INH to cell surfaces would also explain why StcE had no effect on C1-INHâmediated inhibition of kallikrein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) because this assay was performed in the absence of cells. However, as the contact activation pathway is initiated upon the interaction of Factor XII and prekallikrein with negatively charged surfaces (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), it is feasible that StcE-treated C1-INH may down-regulate this cascade in a manner similar to that observed with classical complement.</p>
      <p>How does StcE-treated C1-INH obtain the capacity to bind to cells? In some cases, a change in the structure of C1-INH allows the altered molecule to bind to receptor(s) on the cell surface. For instance, desialylated C1-INH is thought to interact with hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), whereas C1-INHâC1s complexes bind to the low density lipoprotein receptorârelated protein, LRP (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Rather than modifying C1-INH in this way, however, our data indicate that StcE sequesters C1-INH to erythrocytes by itself binding to cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and acting as a âbridgeâ between the serpin and the cell surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Indeed, the cleavage of C1-INH by StcE is unnecessary to provide increased protection against complement activity, as a point mutant of StcE defective in proteolytic activity against C1-INH protects erythrocytes to similar levels as wild-type StcE in vitro (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). The interaction between StcE and erythrocytes is specific, saturating the cells at â¼1.8 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> molecules of StcE per cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). In turn, this allows a high affinity interaction between C1-INH and erythrocytes, reaching 2.25 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> molecules of C1-INH per cell in the presence of 1 Î¼g StcE. This amount of C1-INH (0.1 IU) is well within the physiological concentration of C1-INH found in serum, suggesting that this interaction might be biologically relevant in vivo. Although it appears that the ratio of C1-INH to StcE is &gt;1:1, this might be due to the heterogeneous nature of C1-INH (native, inactivated, and variably glycosylated forms of the molecule), leaving only a fraction of the population of C1-INH able to interact with StcE. Alternatively, StcE may act as a coligand to a multimeric molecule capable of binding C1-INH and other components. Future analyses of the binding requirements of StcE and C1-INH will address this possibility.</p>
      <p>In our model, the initial interaction between StcE and the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of C1-INH at the cell surface allows the serpin to inactivate its targets via the exposed RCL at the site of C1 complex formation. This occurs before the eventual cleavage of C1-INH by StcE and the subsequent release of the serpin from the cell surface, thereby freeing StcE to interact with another molecule of C1-INH (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Indeed, we observed increased levels of C1-INH bound to erythrocytes in the presence of the proteolytically inactive StcE mutant compared with StcEâ²-His, supporting the notion of C1-INH turnover at the cell surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Thus, the relatively slow cleavage rate of C1-INH by StcE (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) may actually be beneficial to the potentiation of the serpin, as a more rapid rate of catalysis might not allow enough time for the inactivation of the C1 complex to occur. Additionally, the interaction of StcE with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of C1-INH (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) while bound to the cell surface likely permits continued access of the serpin domain to its targets without compromising its activity. The binding of StcE to host cells might also allow the protease to be carried to sites distal to <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 colonization in a manner similar to the Shiga toxin (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), thereby affecting C1-INH-regulated processes outside the local environment of bacterial infection. Finally, the observation that cell-bound C1-INH might affect leukocyte adhesion (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) suggests StcE could influence the migration of inflammatory mediators to the sites of enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> colonization.</p>

      <p>The complement system is an essential means of host defense against invading organisms, however, pathogenic bacteria have developed multiple ways to subvert complement activity. Capsules and long <italic>O</italic>-polysaccharide side chains of LPS can effectively prevent the formation of the membrane attack complex at bacterial cell surfaces (for review see references <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and general metalloproteases such as the <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> 56-kD protease (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> elastase (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) can proteolytically inactivate complement components. Additionally, the sequestration of complement inhibitors to bacterial surfaces can reduce complement activity and promote serum resistance. Examples include the binding of Factor H by the outer membrane protein OspE to <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> surfaces (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and C4b-binding protein by the well-studied M protein of group A streptococci (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In this report we demonstrate that StcE-treated C1-INH acts in a similar manner by providing increased serum resistance to <italic>E. coli</italic> over native C1-INH (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). By preventing complement activity at such an early stage in the pathway via the recruitment of C1-INH to cells, StcE may also reduce the opsonization of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 by C3b and the production of the chemoattractant anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Because StcE is a secreted protein (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the protection against complement activation may extend to the colonic epithelial cells colonized by <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7.</p>
      <p>The genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 contains other potential serum-resistance loci, including homologues of <italic>traT</italic> and the Î» <italic>bor</italic> gene encoded on the 933W prophage (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). As such, StcE likely acts in concert with other factors to prevent complement activation. In addition, the StcE-cleaved aminoterminal domain of C1-INH may contain unidentified functions not previously associated with native C1-INH, much like the smaller, cleaved âaâ fragments of various complement components. The effect of StcE on the control of other C1-INHâregulated targets remains to be investigated, however, based on our data, StcE may well have profound consequences on multiple aspects of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 pathogenesis.</p>
