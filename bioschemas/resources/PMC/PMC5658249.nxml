        <p id="P2">Autophagy and interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immunity are critical antiviral defense mechanisms, and recent evidence indicated that <italic>tripartite motif</italic> (TRIM) proteins are important regulators of both processes. While the role of TRIM proteins in modulating antiviral cytokine responses has been well established, much less is known about their involvement in autophagy in response to different viral pathogens. Through a targeted RNAi screen examining the relevance of selected TRIM proteins in autophagy induced by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and influenza A virus (IAV), we identified several TRIM proteins that regulated autophagy in a virus-species specific manner, as well as a few TRIM proteins that were essential for autophagy triggered by all three viruses and rapamycin, among them TRIM23. TRIM23 was critical for autophagy-mediated restriction of multiple viruses, and this activity was dependent on both its RING E3 ligase and ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that unconventional K27-linked auto-ubiquitination of the ARF domain is essential for the GTP hydrolysis activity of TRIM23 and activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) by facilitating its dimerization and ability to phosphorylate the selective autophagy receptor p62. Our work identifies the TRIM23-TBK1-p62 axis as a key component of selective autophagy and further reveals a role for K27-linked ubiquitination in GTPase-dependent TBK1 activation.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P3">TRIM proteins are key components of the innate immune system, functioning as antiviral restriction factors, or modulating signaling cascades that lead to proinflammatory cytokine induction<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, several TRIM proteins also regulate fundamental cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, gene transcription, and RNA metabolism. TRIM proteins belong to the larger family of RING E3 ligases and can synthesize both classical degradative K48-linked ubiquitination, and various non-degradative polyubiquitin-linkage types. For most TRIM proteins, RING E3 enzymatic activity is required for their ability to restrict viral infection or modulate innate immune signaling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P4">Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated homeostatic process in which damaged or surplus proteins and organelles are engulfed by double-membrane structures called autophagosomes and subsequently degraded by the lysosome<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Although autophagy was initially described as a non-specific auto-digestive response towards nutrient depletion, it has become evident that autophagy also selectively recognizes and degrades âtaggedâ cargos via autophagy receptors, such as p62/SQSTM1, Optineurin and NDP52<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Upon recognition via ubiquitin, galectin, or other âearmarksâ, cargos are delivered by these receptors to microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-containing autophagosomes to induce cargo degradation<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P5">Autophagy is implicated in diverse physiological functions in humans, including stress adaptation, development, and protection against inflammation and neurodegeneration<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, autophagy has been increasingly appreciated as an important mechanism in antimicrobial defenses<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. In regards to viral infection, it has been shown that autophagy can either promote or suppress viral replication, dependent on the viral pathogen, host species, and cell type. Recent studies demonstrated that autophagy and antiviral innate immune responses, in particular the type I interferon (IFN) response, are intricately interconnected<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and several key molecules involved in innate immunity are also important regulators of autophagy. For example, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylates IFN-regulatory factor 3 and p62 to induce IFN-Î² induction and autophagy, respectively<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. NOD-like receptor family member X1 (NLRX1) suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN-Î² gene expression, while promoting virus-induced autophagy<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that TRIM proteins, which are well known to regulate antiviral cytokine responses, also play important roles in virus-induced autophagy and autophagy-mediated antiviral defenses<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. For example, TRIM5Î± was shown to mediate autophagy-dependent degradation of the capsid of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, compared to the wealth of information about TRIM-mediated regulation of antiviral cytokine responses, our knowledge about the functional role of TRIM family members in autophagy in response to different viral pathogens is still rudimentary.</p>
      <p id="P6">Here, we show that TRIM proteins play important roles in virus-triggered autophagy in a virus species-specific manner. We further identify TRIM23, which has dual E3 ubiquitin ligase and GTPase activities, as a core component of the selective autophagic machinery. TRIM23 GTP hydrolysis activity is activated through K27-linked auto-polyubiquitination, which is essential for the recruitment of TRIM23 to autophagosomal membranes and activation of TBK1- and p62-mediated selective autophagy.</p>

        <title>Virus-specific roles of TRIM proteins in autophagy</title>
        <p id="P7">To systematically assess the role of TRIM proteins in autophagy, we first screened a cDNA library of 61 TRIM proteins for their ability to induce formation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3B puncta in human cells, which is a hallmark of autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). 18 TRIM proteins efficiently induced GFP-LC3B puncta, to a greater extent than even treatment with the mTOR-inhibitory drug rapamycin, which robustly activates autophagy and thus served as a positive control. 31 TRIM proteins detectably induced GFP-LC3B puncta formation as compared to empty vector transfection, although less efficiently than rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The seven TRIM proteins (TRIM 23, 25, 38, 41, 44, 61 and 74) that most strongly induced GFP-LC3B puncta formation also effectively induced processing of endogenous LC3B-I to LC3B-II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8">As many viral pathogens induce autophagic flux in infected host cells, we next asked whether the TRIM proteins identified by our cDNA screen are essential for virus-induced autophagy. To this end, we determined the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of selected TRIM proteins on GFP-LC3B puncta formation in response to infection by three different viral pathogens known to induce autophagy: <italic>1)</italic> influenza A virus (IAV), a negative-strand RNA virus of the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family; <italic>2)</italic> encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), which is a <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family member carrying a positive-strand RNA genome; and <italic>3)</italic> a mutant variant of herpes simplex virus 1 (a dsDNA virus), in which the Beclin-1-binding domain<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> of the autophagy-antagonistic protein Î³34.5/ICP34.5 is deleted<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (hereafter referred to as mutHSV-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1câf</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). In parallel, we also determined the effect of depleting individual TRIM genes on GFP-LC3B puncta formation induced by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Non-targeting scrambled siRNA (NT) and siRNAs targeting the autophagy-related genes 5, 7 or 12 (ATG 5, 7, or 12), which are core components of the cellular autophagy machinery, served as controls. The knockdown efficiency of the individual TRIM proteins was determined by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>), and efficient viral infection in our screen was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of specific viral proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Depletion of several TRIM proteins significantly reduced GFP-LC3B puncta induced by a specific virus (<italic>e.g.</italic> TRIM13 for EMCV; TRIM25 for IAV; and TRIM56 for mutHSV-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1câf</xref>). Knockdown of other TRIM proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> TRIM20, TRIM38, TRIM44, and TRIM74) abrogated autophagy induced by infection with a specific virus and also rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1câf</xref>), suggesting overlap between the autophagy initiation pathways triggered by viral infection and mTOR inhibition. Finally, silencing of endogenous TRIM21, TRIM23, and TRIM41 profoundly decreased autophagy induced by all three viruses as well as rapamycin, to a similar extent as knockdown of ATG5, ATG7 or ATG12, suggesting that these TRIM proteins play a central role in the autophagic process.</p>

      <sec id="S4">
        <title>TRIM23 is essential for autophagy in response to viral infection</title>
        <p id="P9">Both our cDNA and RNAi screens suggested that TRIM23 is an important molecule in autophagy, which is a fundamental process in vertebrates, invertebrates, and yeast. Sequence alignment showed that TRIM23 is highly conserved in vertebrates and also <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>); however, no orthologous TRIM23 sequence was identified in yeast. TRIM23 transcripts were readily detectable in many different human tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to many TRIM proteins which are expressed at low levels under normal conditions and are inducible by type I IFN<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, TRIM23 mRNA was not upregulated upon IFN-Î± stimulation or infection with Sendai virus (SeV), which is known to robustly induce type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). In line with this, endogenous TRIM23 protein was readily detectable under normal (unstimulated) conditions, and its abundance did not change upon IFN-Î± stimulation or SeV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P10">To corroborate the role of TRIM23 in autophagy, we first compared the effect of ectopically expressed FLAG-TRIM23 on GFP-LC3B puncta formation and conversion of endogenous LC3B-I to LC3B-II in wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MEFs that are deficient in <italic>ATG5</italic> (<italic>ATG5 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. FLAG-TRIM23 efficiently induced LC3B puncta formation and LC3B-I/II processing in WT MEFs, but not <italic>ATG5 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3aâc</xref>). To confirm the data from our siRNA screen, we silenced endogenous TRIM23 using a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) that has a different TRIM23-targeting sequence than the siRNAs used. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of TRIM23 profoundly reduced the number of GFP-LC3B puncta that formed upon infection with mutHSV-1, IAV, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3dâf</xref>). Consistent with the results from our siRNA screen, shRNA-mediated TRIM23 depletion also markedly reduced GFP-LC3B puncta formation and LC3B-I/II conversion induced by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3gâi</xref>). We next utilized MEFs from <italic>TRIM23</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> and WT mice<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> to confirm the role of TRIM23 in autophagy. While mutHSV-1 infection and rapamycin treatment efficiently induced LC3B puncta formation in WT MEFs, the numbers of LC3B puncta were very low in infected <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs, similar to those in untreated (Mock) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2aâc</xref>). In line with this, endogenous LC3B puncta accumulated in rapamycin-treated or mutHSV-1-infected WT, but not <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic>, cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). TRIM23 gene targeting also abrogated LC3B puncta formation induced by infection with a GFP-expressing recombinant human adenovirus (Ad-GFP, a dsDNA virus) or Sindbis virus (SINV, an alphavirus with a positive-strand RNA genome), further strengthening that TRIM23 is important for autophagy triggered by a broad range of viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>
<bold>and</bold>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b,c</xref>). Notably, gene targeting of TRIM23 had only a minor or no effect on basal or starvation-induced autophagy, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2aâe</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">Another hallmark of autophagic flux is the degradation of the selective autophagy receptor p62<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Whereas endogenous p62 was degraded in WT MEFs in response to mutHSV-1 infection or rapamycin treatment, it was stabilized and abundant in <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). However, the increased protein abundance of p62 in <italic>TRIM23<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs was not due to transcriptional upregulation of p62 in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). Electron microscopy (EM) confirmed that WT, but not <italic>TRIM23<sup>â/â</sup></italic>, MEFs contained a large number of autophagolysosomes following mutHSV-1 infection or stimulation by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">EM analysis also showed that mutHSV-1-infected <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs had an increased number of virus particles in the cytoplasm as compared to infected WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), suggesting that TRIM23-mediated autophagy acts in an antiviral manner. To test this directly, we analyzed HSV-1 replication in WT and <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). As TRIM23 reportedly also plays a role in type I IFN responses<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we sought to compare the growth of WT HSV-1 and mutHSV-1, the latter lacking a major autophagy-antagonistic mechanism due to mutation in the Î³34.5 protein<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and therefore efficiently inducing LC3B-I/II conversion in contrast to WT HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>). However, both WT HSV-1 and mutHSV-1 have intact IFN-antagonistic properties, evident by the failure to upregulate IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>), allowing us to specifically test the autophagy function of TRIM23 in virus restriction. The replication of WT HSV-1 was similar for WT and <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs, likely due to the strong autophagy-antagonistic capacity of this virus. However, the replication of mutHSV-1, which is impaired in autophagy antagonism, was enhanced by almost 2-log in <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs as compared to WT cells, indicating that the autophagy function of TRIM23 confers antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we tested the replication capacity of Ad-GFP and SINV, both of which are known to be restricted by autophagy<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, in WT and <italic>TRIM23 <sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEFs.

Taken together, these results indicate that TRIM23 plays a central role in virus-triggered autophagy, and this activity of TRIM23 restricts viruses that are targeted by autophagy for degradation.</p>

        <title>K27-linked auto-polyubiquitination of the ARF domain is required for TRIM23-mediated autophagy</title>
        <p id="P13">A key feature of TRIM proteins is their N-terminal RING-finger E3 ligase activity, which mediates the conjugation of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins. In addition, TRIM proteins have different C-terminal domains, which typically mediate protein-protein interactions, but can also have enzymatic activity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. TRIM23 is unique in that it is the only TRIM family member that possesses a C-terminal ARF domain, which has GTPase activity<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. To determine the relevance of the RING and ARF domains for TRIM23-mediated autophagy, we tested mutant proteins of TRIM23 in which these two domains have been deleted individually (ÎRING and ÎARF TRIM23) for their ability to induce GFP-LC3B puncta. Whereas ectopic expression of WT TRIM23 robustly triggered GFP-LC3B puncta formation, the ÎRING and ÎARF TRIM23 mutants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3aâc</xref>). To test if the enzymatic activity of the RING domain is important for TRIM23 autophagy function, we generated a C34A mutant of TRIM23, which is defective in E3 ligase activity<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Similar to the ÎRING mutant, the TRIM23 C34A mutant completely lost the ability to induce GFP-LC3B puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). This indicates that both the RING E3 ligase activity and the ARF domain are required for TRIM23-mediated autophagy.</p>
        <p id="P14">During our studies, we noticed several higher molecular weight bands of FLAG-TRIM23, which immunoblotting confirmed as polyubiquitinated versions of TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Interestingly, rapamycin treatment enhanced the ubiquitination of FLAG-TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Consistent with these results, we also readily detected polyubiquitination of endogenous TRIM23, which was minimal under normal conditions, but strongly increased upon autophagy induction by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). To determine whether TRIM23 ubiquitination represents auto-ubiquitination or is mediated by the activity of another E3 ligase, we compared the ubiquitination levels of WT TRIM23 with those of the catalytically-inactive TRIM23 mutants, ÎRING and C34A. Unlike WT TRIM23, the ÎRING and C34A TRIM23 mutants had no detectable ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), strongly suggesting that TRIM23 is auto-ubiquitinated. Furthermore, the ÎARF mutant of TRIM23 also showed a near-complete loss of polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P15">To identify the lysine residues in TRIM23 that undergo ubiquitination, we performed large-scale affinity purification of FLAG-TRIM23 expressed in mutHSV-1-infected HEK293T cells, and then analyzed the ubiquitinated TRIM23 bands by mass spectrometry (MS). This identified six ubiquitination sites in TRIM23: K250 located in the coiled-coil (CC) domain, and K402, K425, K446, K458 and K460 located in the ARF domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that the ARF domain is the major site of ubiquitination. Individual mutations of K250, K402, K425, and K446 to arginine, and double mutation of K458 and K460 to arginine, all failed to detectably diminish the ubiquitination levels of TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>); however, combined mutation of the five lysines located in the ARF domain (K402R/K425R/K446R/K458R/K460R; hereafter referred to as TRIM23 5KâR) led to a near-complete loss of TRIM23 ubiquitination, similar to ÎARF TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">To determine whether ubiquitination of the ARF domain is required for TRIM23âs autophagy function, we tested WT TRIM23 and its 5KâR mutant for their ability to induce autophagy. Whereas WT TRIM23 expression led to high numbers of GFP-LC3B puncta, the 5KâR mutant lost this ability, similar to the ÎARF TRIM23 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that auto-ubiquitination of TRIM23 at K402, K425, K446, K458 and K460 is required for the autophagy-promoting activity of TRIM23.</p>
        <p id="P17">To identify the linkage type of TRIM23 auto-polyubiquitination, we expressed in HEK293T cells FLAG-TRIM23 together with HA-tagged WT ubiquitin (WT Ub), or Ub mutants in which all internal lysines are mutated except one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Co-expression of WT Ub as well as the Ub-K27only and Ub-K29only mutants led to efficient TRIM23 polyubiquitination, while co-expression of other Ub mutants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). To corroborate this, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> restriction assay utilizing a set of deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that remove specific ubiquitin linkage types<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>): OTUB1 (K48-linkage-specific), OTUB2 (K63-linkage-specific), TRABID (K29- and K33-linkage-specific), and YOD1 (K27-, K29- and K33-linkage specific). USP21, which cleaves all types of ubiquitin linkages, served as positive control in this assay. Incubation with YOD1 and USP21 profoundly reduced the ubiquitination of FLAG-TRIM23, while other DUB enzymes had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i,j</xref>). Moreover, co-expression of TRIM23 with WT Ub, but not a K27R Ub mutant, led to efficient TRIM23 polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>), providing further evidence that TRIM23 is primarily modified by K27-linked polyubiquitination. Collectively, these results indicate that K27-linked auto-polyubiquitination of TRIM23 at the C-terminal ARF domain is required for TRIM23 autophagy function.</p>

Interestingly, homology modeling of the TRIM23 ARF domain based on the crystal structure of ARF6 revealed that the five ubiquitinated lysine residues are in close proximity to the GTPase catalytic site, and located in regions that undergo major structural changes during the GDP-GTP cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

In contrast to WT TRIM23, a mutant of TRIM23 that has abolished GTP hydrolysis activity (TRIM23 K458I)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> did not induce GFP-LC3B puncta formation, similar to the ÎARF TRIM23 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that GTPase activity is required for TRIM23-mediated autophagy.</p>
        <p id="P19">The TRIM23 K458I mutant had comparable ubiquitination levels as WT TRIM23, suggesting that GTPase activity is not a prerequisite for TRIM23 auto-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). To test whether K27-linked ubiquitination affects the GTP hydrolysis activity of TRIM23, we performed a luciferase-based <italic>in vitro</italic> GTPase assay using purified TRIM23 WT and 5KâR mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). WT TRIM23 showed efficient GTPase activity, which was similar to that of Rab5Î±, a distantly related small GTPase of the Rab protein family. In contrast, the TRIM23 5KâR mutant exhibited low GTPase activity, comparable to that of the GTPase-defective mutants K458I and ÎARF. Importantly, the C34A mutant, which has abolished RING E3 ligase activity, also showed defective GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), further strengthening that TRIM23 auto-ubiquitination is important for GTPase activity. In accord, an <italic>in vitro</italic> GTPase assay measuring free phosphate production showed that, unlike WT TRIM23, the TRIM23 5KâR, C34A, K458I and ÎARF mutants had strongly impaired GTP hydrolysis activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Next, as GTPase-defective TRIM23 mutants are expected to exhibit prolonged GTP-bound states, we tested purified WT TRIM23 and its 5KâR mutant for their abilities to bind GTP-agarose matrix <italic>in vitro</italic>. In this assay, the TRIM23 mutant K458I, which is locked in the GTP-bound state, as well as ÎARF TRIM23, which is unable to bind GTP, served as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). TRIM23 5KâR bound to GTP-agarose more strongly than did WT TRIM23, which supports the conclusion that ubiquitination of the ARF domain is important for its GTP-GDP cycling activity, and also indicates that the 5KâR mutation does not perturb the overall ARF structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). To further strengthen these data, we purified FLAG-TRIM23 WT from cells in which either WT Ub, or the Ub mutants K27R or K27only were overexpressed, and then measured TRIM23 GTPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This showed that TRIM23 purified from WT Ub or K27only Ub expressing cells exhibited strong GTP hydrolysis activity, but not TRIM23 from cells transfected with K27R Ub. These results indicate that K27-linked auto-ubiquitination of TRIM23 at the ARF domain is important for its GTPase enzymatic activity.</p>
        <p id="P20">The ARF domain of TRIM23 is highly homologous in sequence to members of the ARF protein family of small GTPases (ARF1â6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>), which are important regulators of membrane trafficking and organelle structures<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. A common feature of ARF proteins and other small GTPases is their ability to cycle between the cytosol and membrane structures, or between different membrane compartments (<italic>e.g.</italic> Golgi and late endoplasmic reticulum) in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether the GTPase activity of TRIM23 is necessary for its recruitment to p62-containing autophagosomal membranes. Whereas WT TRIM23 co-localized extensively with endogenous p62 punctate structures, the 5KâR, K458I, and C34A mutants showed much less co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). We further observed that, compared to WT TRIM23, the K458I, 5KâR, and C34A mutants exhibited a more punctate localization in vesicles that did not co-localize with p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), suggesting that K27-polyubiquitin-dependent GTPase activity is needed for the cycling of TRIM23 from intracellular compartments (<italic>e.g.</italic> the Golgi as previously reported<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>) to autophagosomes. We next addressed whether TRIM23 co-localizes to early autophagosomes in a GTPase-dependent manner by determining its co-localization with the early autophagosomal marker ATG16L<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Whereas WT TRIM23 co-localized with ATG16L-positive vesicles, the K458I and 5KâR mutants did not show co-localization with ATG16L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Moreover, neither WT TRIM23 nor the K458I and 5KâR mutants co-localized with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6f</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that K27-linked ubiquitination is essential for TRIM23 enzymatic activity to hydrolyze GTP, and that the ubiquitin-dependent GTPase activity promotes the recruitment of TRIM23 to early autophagosomal membranes.</p>

        <title>Interaction of TRIM23 with TBK1 and p62 during autophagy</title>
        <p id="P21">To identify the molecular mechanism of TRIM23 in virus-induced autophagy, we sought to identify the TRIM23 interactome through MS analysis of cellular factors that co-purified with FLAG-TRIM23 from mutHSV-1-infected HEK293T cells. We found TBK1 and p62, two key molecules in selective autophagy<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, as major TRIM23 interaction partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). We first confirmed the interaction of TRIM23 with TBK1 and p62 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and found that, whereas binding of endogenous TRIM23 to TBK1 and p62 was minimal in uninfected cells, the interaction was induced by mutHSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Moreover, autophagy stimulation by rapamycin also enhanced TRIM23 binding to TBK1 and p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Confocal microscopy showed that ectopically expressed V5-TRIM23 co-localized extensively with both GFP-p62 and FLAG-TBK1 even without stimulation of autophagy; in contrast, endogenous TRIM23, TBK1 and p62 co-localized specifically upon autophagy stimulation, but not under normal (unstimulated) conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b,c</xref>). In accord, co-IP also indicated that endogenous TRIM23 forms a ternary complex with endogenous TBK1 and p62 specifically in mutHSV-1-infected or rapamycin-treated cells, but not mock-treated cells, suggesting that their interaction is inducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> binding assay using purified GST-TRIM23 and His-tagged TBK1 proteins showed an efficient interaction, suggesting that TBK1 is a direct binding partner of TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>). Mapping studies by co-IP revealed that WT TRIM23, but not the ÎARF mutant of TRIM23, bound to endogenous TBK1 and p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Notably, the 5KâR mutant bound to TBK1 and p62 as efficiently as WT TRIM23, indicating that the K27-linked ubiquitination of the ARF domain is not necessary for recruiting TBK1 and p62 to TRIM23. Finally, complementary binding studies using truncated TBK1 constructs showed that TRIM23 interacted with the N-terminal kinase domain (KD) of TBK1, but not with its central ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) or C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P22">We next asked whether TBK1 and p62 are required for TRIM23-mediated autophagy.

Together, these results indicate that upon autophagy stimulation TRIM23 forms a complex with TBK1 and p62, and further that the kinase activity of TBK1 is important for mediating TRIM23âs function in autophagy.</p>

        <title>TRIM23 GTPase-dependent activation of TBK1 to phosphorylate p62</title>
        <p id="P23">Recent studies demonstrated that during mitophagy or bacterial infection, TBK1 phosphorylates p62 at S403 and several other residues, thereby facilitating p62-mediated autophagic clearance<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that TBK1 phosphorylates p62 also during viral infection, and that this activity may be facilitated by TRIM23. Immunoblotting with a phospho-S403-specific p62 antibody showed detectable p62 phosphorylation upon mutHSV-1 infection or rapamycin treatment in control siRNA-transfected cells; in contrast, p62 phosphorylation was minimal in infected or rapamycin-stimulated cells that have been depleted of endogenous TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Conversely, ectopic expression of FLAG-TRIM23 increased S403 phosphorylation of endogenous p62, an effect that was nullified by treatment of cells with BX795 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). To test if TRIM23 directly activates TBK1, we monitored by immunoblotting the <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of S172 in the activation loop of TBK1, which is indicative of TBK1 activation. We found that overexpressed TBK1 was already partially autophosphorylated at S172 as previously reported<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, and co-expression of V5-TRIM23 strongly enhanced TBK1 autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Confocal microscopy experiments showed that exogenously expressed TRIM23 also readily induced phosphorylation of endogenous TBK1 at S172, and it co-localized with phospho-S172-TBK1 in cytoplasmic punctate structures that also stained for p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P24">Our data indicated that K27-linked autoubiquitination of the ARF domain is important for TRIM23 GTPase activity and autophagy function. Thus, we next asked whether K27-ubiquitination and GTPase activity are important for TBK1 activation by TRIM23. In contrast to WT TRIM23, the mutants 5KâR and K458I failed to enhance TBK1 phosphorylation at S172 as compared to vector transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). In accord, ectopic expression of WT TRIM23 but not of the mutants 5KâR and K458I triggered endogenous p62 degradation, indicative of increased autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). Furthermore, the TRIM23 ÎARF mutant, which did not bind TBK1 or co-localize with LC3B-positive autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>), also did not promote TBK1 S172 autophosphorylation or p62 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). In line with these results, whereas WT TRIM23 effectively restricted mutHSV-1 infection, the TRIM23 mutants 5KâR and ÎARF failed to block virus replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P25">Finally, we asked how TRIM23 binding leads to activation of TBK1 in a manner that is dependent on its GTPase activity. As TBK1 enzymatic activation is known to require dimerization or higher-order oligomerization to allow <italic>trans</italic>-auto-phosphorylation at S172 to occur<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>â<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, we tested whether the GTPase activity of TRIM23 facilitates TBK1 self-association by measuring the extent to which HA-tagged TBK1 co-purified with GST-TBK1. In the presence of WT TRIM23, we observed an increase in the amounts of co-purifying HA-TBK1, but not in the presence of the GTPase-defective mutants 5KâR and K458I or vector transfection control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that TRIM23âs ARF GTPase activity induces TBK1 activation by promoting self-association of the kinase.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P26">Over the past decade, it has become clear that members of the TRIM E3 ligase family are important players in innate immune surveillance pathways<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. More recently, a growing number of studies indicated that TRIM proteins also regulate autophagy in response to viral infection or non-viral autophagy stimuli<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. In this study, we tested the role of multiple TRIM proteins in the autophagic response to viral pathogens (both RNA and DNA viruses) from three major virus families. While some TRIM proteins were required for autophagy upon both RNA and DNA virus infection, others were critical for autophagic flux in response to one particular type of viral pathogen. Interestingly, for the latter group of TRIM proteins, their virus-specific roles in autophagy correlated with their functions in intracellular innate immune responses to that particular virus. For example, TRIM56, which is known to regulate STING-dependent sensing of HSV-1 infection<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, was required for autophagy induction in response to infection by HSV-1, but not the RNA viruses IAV and EMCV. TRIM25, which activates the sensor RIG-I via K63-polyubiquitin<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, specifically regulated autophagy in response to IAV, known to be sensed by RIG-I. Furthermore, TRIM13, which regulates EMCV-induced IFN induction by the sensor MDA5<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, was also essential for EMCV-triggered autophagy. These correlations suggest that the functional roles of TRIM proteins in innate signaling and autophagy to a specific viral pathogen are intricately connected. In light of recent evidence suggesting that TRIM proteins can act as specific autophagy receptors by recognizing viral components<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, future studies will need to determine the molecular details of how TRIM proteins link innate immune recognition and autophagy, and which viral (or host) features are recognized by TRIM proteins to trigger autophagy.</p>
      <p id="P27">We also identified a few TRIM proteins, including TRIM23, which had a profound effect on autophagy triggered by both RNA and DNA viruses as well as rapamycin, suggesting that these TRIM proteins regulate a fundamental step in the autophagic process. Our mechanistic studies revealed that TRIM23 is a core component of selective autophagy by assembling a signaling complex composed of the autophagy receptor p62 and its upstream regulator TBK1, ultimately promoting TBK1-mediated p62 phosphorylation and thereby autophagy. Our data thus identify the TRIM23-TBK1-p62 ternary complex as an important component of virus-induced autophagy. As rapamycin also induced the interaction of TRIM23 with TBK1 and p62, it is likely that the TRIM23-TBK1-p62 complex also regulates autophagy in non-viral contexts. Future studies will need to define the upstream stimuli and molecules that activate TRIM23 during autophagy, which may also reveal the molecular details of how TRIM23 functions specifically in p62-mediated selective autophagy, but not starvation-induced autophagy. Furthermore, whereas our study demonstrated that TRIM23-mediated autophagy restricts HSV-1, SINV and Ad, which are known to be targeted for degradation by autophagy<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, the role of TRIM23-induced autophagy in the life cycle of viruses that usurp autophagy for their efficient replication remains to be addressed. Moreover, as TRIM23 reportedly has both positive and negative regulatory roles in the antiviral type I IFN response<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, in-depth studies are required to identify the molecular details of how TRIM23 dually coordinates virus-induced autophagy and IFN responses.</p>
      <p id="P28">TRIM23 is unique among the ~80 TRIM proteins in that it harbors both E3 ligase and GTPase enzymatic activities. We found that K27-linked auto-polyubiquitination of the ARF domain was required for TRIM23 GTP hydrolysis activity. Structure modeling indicated that the five ubiquitinated lysine residues are located in regions in the TRIM23 ARF domain that undergo extensive structural changes during the GDP-GTP cycle. It is thus conceivable that ubiquitin chains conjugated to the TRIM23 ARF sterically lock it in the active conformation, or alternatively, make the enzymatically-inactive conformation of TRIM23 less favorable. As unconventional ubiquitin chains have been shown to also serve as recruitment platforms for protein interactions, it is also possible that K27-linked polyubiquitin allows for binding of host factors, such as GTPase-activating proteins, which promotes TRIM23 GTPase activity. Furthermore, it will be important to test whether other small GTPases also undergo non-degradative polyubiquitination for their enzymatic activity.</p>
      <p id="P29">The GTP hydrolysis activities of ARF proteins and other small GTPases have been shown to allow cytosol-membrane or membrane-membrane cycling of these enzymes. Our study revealed that the GTPase activity of TRIM23 is needed for the localization of TRIM23 to autophagosomal membranes, to activate TBK1 there, thereby promoting phosphorylation of the autophagic receptor p62. Biochemical characterization showed that TRIM23 binds with its C-terminal ARF domain to the N-terminal KD of TBK1, and that GTP hydrolysis activity of the ARF stimulates TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of p62 at S403 in its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which was shown to promote cargo recruitment and autophagic flux<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Our data support a model in which TRIM23 binding to the N-terminal KD of TBK1, and likely conformational changes induced by GTP-GDP cycling of its ARF domain, induce TBK1 dimer/multimer formation in a manner that facilitates TBK1 auto-phosphorylation of the activation loop in <italic>trans.</italic></p>
      <p id="P30">Besides TBK1 autophosphorylation, direct non-degradative ubiquitin modification of TBK1 was shown to be important for its activation in the IFN induction pathway, and multiple E3 ligases, including MIB1/2, have been implicated in TBK1 ubiquitination<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. We observed modification of TBK1 with polyubiquitin upon exogenous expression of WT TRIM23, but not its E3 ligase-defective C34A mutant, to a similar extend as seen in the presence of MIB2, which served as a positive control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). Chemical inhibition of the proteasome did not enhance TBK1 ubiquitination induced by TRIM23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref>), suggesting that TRIM23 promotes non-degradative ubiquitination of TBK1, likely indicative of TBK1 activation. However, the role of TBK1 ubiquitination for virus-induced autophagy warrants further investigation, and whether TBK1 is a direct substrate of TRIM23-mediated ubiquitination.</p>
      <p id="P31">Taken together, our work unveils a role for K27-linked ubiquitination in TRIM23 GTPase function and its ability to activate TBK1-mediated autophagy, which may provide the basis for therapeutics against diseases caused by dysregulation of autophagy, such as microbial infections, inflammation, and cancer.</p>

From the available templates, ARF6 was selected due to its 55.5% sequence identity to the ARF domain of TRIM23, and because both GTP- and GDP-bound structures are available for ARF6 (PDB codes 2A5D and 1E0S, respectively)<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>.
