      <abstract>
        <p>Human vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) 1 is a novel serine-threonine kinase that regulates several transcription factors, nuclear envelope assembly, and chromatin condensation and is also required for cell cycle progression. The regulation of this kinase family is unknown. Mass spectrometry has permitted the identification of Ran as an interacting and regulatory protein of the VRK serine-threonine kinase activities. The stable interaction has been validated by pulldown of endogenous proteins as well as by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. The three members of the VRK family stably interact with Ran, and the interaction was not affected by the bound nucleotide, GDP or GTP. The interaction was stronger with the RanT24N that is locked in its inactive conformation and cannot bind nucleotides. None of the kinases phosphorylated Ran or RCC1. VRK1 does not directly interact with RCC1, but if Ran is present they can be isolated as a complex. The main effect of the interaction of inactive RanGDP with VRK1 is the inhibition of its kinase activity, which was detected by a reduction in VRK1 autophosphorylation and a reduction in phosphorylation of histone H3 in residues Thr-3 and Ser-10. The kinase activity inhibition can be relieved by the interaction with the constitutively active RanGTP or RanL43E, which locks Ran in its GTP-bound active conformation. In this complex, the interaction with VRK proteins does not alter the effect of its guanine exchange factor, RCC1. Ran is a novel negative regulator of nuclear VRK1 and VRK2 kinase activity, which may vary in different subcellular localizations generating an asymmetric intracellular distribution of kinase activity depending on local protein interactions.</p>

  <body><p>Since completion of the human kinome, a new subfamily of serine-threonine kinases, known as vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>) that is composed of three proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>), two of which are catalytically active, VRK1 and VRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), and are mainly expressed in proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). These proteins have a conserved kinase domain but differ in their regulatory region with little conservation among them or with any other protein. The VRK1 protein is mostly nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), although in some cell types it is also present in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>); this subcellular localization is regulated in response to a specific signal.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> The VRK2 gene codes for two isoforms. The cytosolic VRK2A isoform corresponds to the full length and has 507 amino acids, and its carboxyl-terminal region has a hydrophobic tail and is membrane-bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The VRK2B isoform is shorter; corresponds to the first 397 amino acids of isoform A, thus lacking the membrane-anchoring region; and has both a cytosolic and nuclear localization; the latter is mainly expressed in cell types in which the VRK1 protein is cytosolic, thus suggesting a functional replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>).</p><p>Human VRK1 is the best characterized protein; it phosphorylates several transcription factors related with cellular responses to stress such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), forming an autoregulatory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>); c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>); and ATF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). VRK1 also phosphorylates Baf, a protein implicated in the assembly of nuclear envelope membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>) and in the formation of a functional mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Recently VRK1 has been shown to phosphorylate histone H3 in Thr-3 and Ser-10 residues and is implicated in chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). VRK1 expression has been correlated with several proliferation markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). VRK1 expression parallels that of c-<italic>myc</italic> and c-<italic>fos</italic> and occurs early in the G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). The phenotype induced by inactivation of VRK1 induces defective cell proliferation and eventually cell death, suggesting that VRK1 can participate at some stage in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>).</p><p>Cell-specific biological effects are determined by the interplay among signaling pathways in the cells, which are likely to be determined by the proteins expressed, their interactions, and their levels in each cell type, but most intracellular protein-protein interactions remain to be identified. For the identification of these interactions the use of proteomics approaches represents a powerful tool that can identify protein networks as well as placing the proteins within signaling pathways related with different biological processes. Furthermore the characteristics of specific protein-protein interactions can also result in the identification of novel protein motifs that can be used to identify new components of protein networks in the cell. Elucidation of the components of a signaling pathway requires the identification of specific protein-protein interactions, which may be either consecutive steps in the pathway or regulatory elements.</p><p>The components of the signaling pathway where VRK1 is implicated, or other VRK members, are little known, therefore we decided to search for interacting proteins using a proteomics-based approach. The nuclear Ran GTPase was identified in this study by proteomics analysis as a partner of VRK proteins. The small GTPases are a family of signaling proteins of which the most characterized members are the Ras, Rho, and Rac proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>), all of which are cytosolic and mediate signals that reach mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). There is also a nuclear small GTPase, Ran, that belongs to the Ras superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>); its partners in the nuclei are mostly unknown except for importin proteins that are implicated in nuclear transport, which is the best well established function of Ran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). However, Ran is also implicated in regulation of kinetochore function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>) and formation of a functional mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). The active RanGTP is necessary to form membrane vesicles that are precursors required for the assembly of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). The only guanine exchange factor known for Ran is RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Ran participates in chromosome segregation by its interaction with RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). RCC1 generates a local concentration of RanGTP that is necessary for activation of proteins required for kinetochore assembly, spindle formation, or nuclear envelope formation among other mitotic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Nuclear envelop reformation depends in its early stages on RanGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). Ran can also activate the mitotic kinase Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). In addition, its GEF, RCC1, is regulated by phosphorylation in mitosis preventing Ran binding to importin and turning it to chromosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>).</p><p>In this work the nuclear Ran GTPase was identified as a modulator of VRK activity on itself or on histone H3, an effect that depends on the activation state of Ran. However, VRK1 did not affect the nucleotide-bound state of Ran. Thus, this Ran interaction with VRK proteins might regulate their kinase activity spatially and temporally in the cell, thus contributing to determining different roles depending on its subcellular localization and representing a functional compartmentalization.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec disp-level="4"><title>Plasmidsâ</title><p>Plasmid pCEFL-GST expresses GST fusion protein in mammalian cells.

For this aim HEK293T cells were transfected with mammalian plasmids expressing fusion proteins GST-VRK1 or GST-VRK2B (the nuclear isoform of VRK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) that are identical and differ only in the last amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) and with the empty vector expressing GST. The correct expression of the transfected proteins was confirmed in an immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>left</italic>, and supplemental Fig S1A, left). Cell extracts were used for a pulldown of associated proteins using as control GST <italic>versus</italic> GST-VRK2B or GST-VRK1. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were separated by isoelectrofocusing followed by an electrophoresis in the second dimension. SYPRO Ruby staining allowed the detection of several different spots pulled down with GST-VRK2B or GST-VRK1 but not with control GST that may correspond to proteins specifically bound to VRK proteins. In both cases, a â¼25-kDa spot was excised from gels for MS identification (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic> and supplemental Fig S1A, right). The analysis of the MALDI-TOF spectrum in each case showed several tryptic peptide masses that matched to theoretical masses from the Ran GTPase sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="P62826">P62826</ext-link>) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> and supplemental Fig. S1B).

For this aim an <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction assay was performed using a non-limiting concentration of GST-Ran protein (80 n<sc>m</sc>) and increasing concentrations of VRK1 protein. The VRK1 bound to Ran was identified in an <italic>in vitro</italic> pulldown assay followed by an immunoblot.

The GST-Ran protein (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>left lane</italic>), but not the negative control GST (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right lane</italic>), was able to specifically interact with human VRK1. Next to determine whether the conformation of Ran could significantly alter the interaction, a similar assay was performed using three different Ran proteins in the pulldown assay.

For this aim HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid pCEFL-GST-VRK1, and the expressed fusion GST-VRK1 protein was used for a pulldown experiment. In the lysate the expression of transfected proteins as well as endogenous Ran and its interacting protein RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>) were determined (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>). In the pulldown Ran was clearly detected in the corresponding immunoblot in which RCC1 was also present in this complex (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). To rule out that RCC1 does not directly interact with VRK1, a similar experiment was performed in which exogenous RCC1 was transfected (plasmid pGFP-RCC1) to displace endogenous RCC1 from the complex. This exogenous GFP-RCC1 protein did not displace the endogenous RCC1 from Ran, but it did compete with VRK1 for some of Ran because a smaller amount of Ran was detected bound to VRK1, and no GFP-RCC1 could be detected bound to VRK1 in the pulldown (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Subcellular Localization of Endogenous VRK1 and Ran Proteins and Detection of Their Interaction by Reciprocal Immunoprecipitationâ</title><p>As an initial step, whether the two proteins, VRK1 and Ran, were at least partially colocalized within the cell was determined. The endogenous VRK1 and Ran proteins were detected by confocal immunofluorescence in HEK293T (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) and HeLa (not shown) cell lines. VRK1, detected with the polyclonal antibody VE1, was mostly localized in the nucleus, and some was localized in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Ran was mostly cytosolic with some nuclear aggregation. Both proteins presented some overlap of their signals both in nucleus and cytosol in interphase (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). In cells that have finished cell division, Ran was mostly located on, or near, the nuclear membrane, but its overlap with VRK1 was intranuclear (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To validate the interaction detected between Ran and VRK1, a reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. The expression of the VRK1 and Ran proteins was first checked in the cell lysate (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>top gel</italic>). This extract was used for immunoprecipitation of Ran (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom left</italic>) or VRK1 protein (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic>). In each case a parallel immunoprecipitation with an antibody of the same isotype without an endogenous target was performed as negative control. VRK1 was detected in the Ran immunoprecipitate but not in the control with a nonspecific (anti-AU5) antibody (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom left</italic>). Next the inverse experiment was performed, endogenous VRK1 was immunoprecipitated, and the Ran protein was detected in this specific immunoprecipitate but not in the case of the control with an anti-FLAG antibody (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic>). As a positive control, a parallel experiment was performed to check whether RCC1 was also detected as bound to immunoprecipitated Ran following the same experimental conditions used to see the interaction of VRK1 with immunoprecipitated Ran (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Because VRK1 and VRK2 have a high conservation in their first 396 amino acids, whether there was an overlap between Ran and VRK2 was also tested. In the case of the endogenous VRK2 proteins the antibody cannot discriminate between its two isoforms because the sequence of isoform B corresponds to the first 397 amino acids of isoform A; therefore the signal has to be distributed in the cytosol and some in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). In HEK293T cells there was a strong overlap between the cytosolic signal of VRK2 and Ran (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>), suggesting that they might also be forming a complex in this compartment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Identification of the VRK1 Region Interacting with Ranâ</title><p>To identify the region of the VRK1 molecule required for the interaction with Ran, a pulldown with three different constructs of VRK1 as targets of GST-Ran was performed. The VRK1 regions were the full length (amino acids 1â396), amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1â332), and carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 267â396) as well as the kinase-dead VRK1(K179E). The full length interacted very well, but there was a significant loss of binding with either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal region of VRK1, suggesting that they are much less efficient (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). These two constructs have an overlapping region corresponding to residues 267â332 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). The interaction with kinase-dead VRK1 was also weaker probably because of the instability of this inactive protein that lacks autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). VRK2B is almost identical in size and structure to VRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) and thus behaved in a similar manner (not shown). A similar experiment was performed using fusion proteins spanning different regions of VRK2 expressed from plasmids pCEFL-GST-VRK2N (1â320), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C1 (256â508), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C2 (364â508), and pCEFL-GST-VRK2B-C (256â397). In VRK2 the overlapping region corresponds to residues 256â320 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). These regions in both VRK1 and VRK2 have a very flexible structure that can adapt alternative conformations, particularly when truncated at one end of the protein as these protein constructs are. The interaction of RanL43E with VRK1 occurs through the same region as that in Ran because both behave in a similar way (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>). Also the conservation of the interaction region in the three VRK proteins suggests that they might compete with each other, as well as with other Ran-binding proteins containing the same motif, for binding to Ran. This was tested using VRK3, which was able to partially compete with VRK1 for the interaction with Ran (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>F</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>RCC1 and VRK1 Can Bind Simultaneously to Ranâ</title><p>The data available indicate that Ran is able to bind to its GEF, the RCC1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>), and to VRK1 (this work); therefore it is possible that both proteins can bind simultaneously to Ran. First whether VRK1 could bind to RCC1 was determined in a pulldown assay. The GST-VRK1 protein was unable to bring down the RCC1 protein by itself (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>) indicating that they do not appear to interact directly even if VRK1 is in a molar excess over RCC1.</p><p>It is possible that when Ran is bound to RCC1 the formation of this complex might increase Ran affinity for its interaction partner VRK1. Thus when the Ran-RCC1 complex is formed there might be a change in conformation of Ran that increases its binding to VRK1 without displacing RCC1. If that interpretation is correct, in an experiment in which Ran and VRK1 were equimolar, the binding to VRK1 was determined as the amount of RCC1 was increased. In this case the VRK1 bound to Ran increased as the amount of RCC1 was raised (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). A similar result was also obtained when using a molar excess of Ran (not shown). These results indicate that the binding of Ran to RCC1 facilitates the incorporation of VRK1 into the complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Ran and RCC1 Are Not Phosphorylated by VRK1 or VRK2Bâ</title><p>Because VRK1 and VRK2B proteins have kinase activity, whether Ran was also a phosphorylation target of these kinases was tested. For this aim an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed using GST-VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S2A) or GST-VRK2B (supplemental Fig. S2B), and as substrates Ran, RanT24N, and RanL43E proteins were used. The autophosphorylation of VRK2B and VRK1 was used as positive controls. VRK2B and VRK1 did not phosphorylate any of the Ran proteins, but the positive control of kinase autophosphorylation was clearly detected.</p><p>Ran is regulated by its interaction with its GEF factor, RCC1. RCC1 is regulated by phosphorylation in serine residues that inhibits its binding to importin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>) and promotes its association required for spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Therefore, the phosphorylation of RCC1 by VRK1 might be possible, and this was tested using a panel of RCC1 phosphorylation mutants in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The same result was obtained with VRK2B (supplemental Fig. S3C).This phosphorylation was studied with and without the inclusion of different Ran mutants, but none of them were able to induce the phosphorylation of RCC1 by VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S3D). Therefore it can be concluded that VRK1 does not phosphorylate RCC1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Ran Down-regulates the Kinase Activity of VRK1 and VRK2B on Autophosphorylation and on Phosphorylation of Histone H3â</title><p>Regulation of kinase activities is an alternative possibility resulting from a protein-protein interaction. The interaction between Ran and VRK1 might regulate the kinase activity of the latter. Therefore whether the kinase activity of VRK1 was affected by its interaction with Ran and whether it was dependent on any of the different forms of Ran were tested. For this aim two alternative assays were performed, autophosphorylation of VRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>) and phosphorylation of histone H3 in Ser-3 and Thr-10 by VRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Initially whether VRK1 autophosphorylation or H3 phosphorylation was affected by any of the different forms of Ran was determined. The kinetics of phosphorylation reaction is much faster than complex formation; therefore Ran and VRK1 were preincubated to form a complex before performing the kinase assay. VRK1 was able to autophosphorylate itself and phosphorylate H3, but these phosphorylations were inhibited by either wild-type Ran or the inactive RanT24N, whereas H3 was phosphorylated in the presence of the active RanL43E (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Because RanL43E is able to stably bind GTP, the assay was also performed in its presence, but the result was similar to that without GTP (not shown).</p><p>Next a dose-dependent phosphorylation of H3 by VRK1 was performed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, and at the higher VRK1 dose, Ran was added at different concentrations. Autophosphorylation and H3 phosphorylation were dependent on the amount of VRK1 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). The addition of increasing amounts of Ran inhibited both VRK1 autophosphorylation and H3 phosphorylation. The inhibition of phosphorylation was dependent on the amount of Ran present in the assay (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To determine whether a similar situation could be detected with the endogenous VRK1 kinase an experiment was performed in which the endogenous VRK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from either non-synchronized cells or cells blocked with nocodazole in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle. In the case of cells blocked in mitosis, there was an increase in autophosphorylation of VRK1 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>) as well as an increase in H3 phosphorylation, and both were inhibited by the inclusion of Ran protein in the assay (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>last two lanes</italic>).</p><p>It has been reported that VRK1 phosphorylates histone H3 in Thr-3 and Ser-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Therefore, whether these two residues were indeed phosphorylated by VRK1 was tested. The residues were detected using phosphospecific antibodies for each residue. An <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed in the absence or presence of Ran (individual reaction components are shown in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>, <italic>top</italic>), and the products were analyzed with the antibodies. VRK1 clearly phosphorylated H3 in Thr-3, which was reduced in the presence of Ran (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>); however, the phosphorylation in Ser-10 was less noticeable because this antibody was much less efficient, although the phosphorylation signal also disappeared in the presence of Ran. From these experiments we can conclude that, in those complexes where VRK1 is interacting with Ran, VRK1 has a reduced kinase activity manifested both in its autophosphorylation and on its H3 specific target.</p><p>Because VRK proteins, particularly VRK2 and VRK1, have a highly conserved amino-terminal region with their catalytic domain (397 amino acids), whether the kinase activity of both VRK2 isoforms was also inhibited by Ran was also determined (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>E</italic></xref>). The kinase activity of both VRK2A and VRK2B in autophosphorylation and on H3 phosphorylation assays was inhibited by the Ran protein (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p><p>VRK3 is a kinase-inactive protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), and it has been postulated that it can recover kinase activity by its interaction with an unknown protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Therefore whether Ran could recover this activity was tested. An <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed with VRK3 in the presence of the three forms of Ran; none of them recovered the kinase activity (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Interaction of VRK1 with Ran Does Not Affect the Nucleotide Exchange Activity of RCC1â</title><p>Because VRK1 is a nuclear protein the effect on the activity promoted by the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 was studied. One possible consequence of the interaction between VRK1 and Ran is to modulate the nucleotide exchange activity. To try to determine a possible effect, whether VRK1 could affect the release of GDP mediated by RCC1 was first determined. For this aim Ran was loaded with GDP, and the release of GDP was determined in the presence of different amounts of RCC1 with and without an excess of VRK1 protein. RCC1 induced a dose-dependent release of GDP that was not affected by VRK1 (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). Alternatively VRK1 might affect the loading of GTP on Ran induced by RCC1. This potential loading of GTP was studied at different time points using different concentrations of RCC1 with and without VRK1. RCC1 increased the amount of GTP bound to Ran in both a time- and an RCC1 dose-dependent way, but neither of them was affected by incubation in the presence of VRK1 (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). From these data it can be concluded that VRK1 does not affect the role of RCC1 in regulating the nucleotide exchange of Ran.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The role of proteins interacting with VRK proteins can be of three main types: either substrates of the kinase reaction whose interaction is likely to be transient or regulatory proteins that either introduce covalent modifications or alternatively are able to form stable complexes by a protein-protein interaction, which might affect the enzymatic activity or specificity of VRK1. In this work we identified Ran as a negative regulator of VRK1 activity.</p><p>The activation of kinases by small GTPases is a well known mechanism of which activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by Ras is probably the best known process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). In the inverse situation, the regulation of kinase activity by interaction with a small GTPase is a little characterized effect; the only case identified is the activation of PAK1 activity by Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). Ran has been shown to be an activator of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>); thus small GTPase-kinase interactions can function as a switch of signaling pathways that play a role in different biological processes that need to be coordinated. However, there are no data regarding inhibition of kinase activities by their interaction with any small GTPase protein.</p><p>The identification of a stable interaction between VRK proteins and the Ran GTPase opens up new possibilities from a regulatory point of view. The VRK1 protein is very stable and, in continuously growing cells, is always present at relatively high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>); because of that it has been associated with cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). But this kinase, which can regulate several transcription factors, may not always be necessary, and therefore it is likely to be regulated either spatially or temporally. The inhibition of VRK1 kinase activity by RanGDP suggests that its kinase activity might be regulated in time and space, a role already known for Ran in other functions such as in the localization to the nuclear pore during interphase of Mad1p and Mad2p, two spindle assembly checkpoint proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). In general only one conformation of Ran has the effect on the target protein, and it is possible that the inhibition of VRK1 activity by RanGDP might be necessary for its nuclear import.</p><p>The identification of a protein, Ran, that is able to modulate the kinase activity of a nuclear protein, VRK1, has functional consequences. This interaction implies that within the nuclei regions, where these two proteins interact, the kinase activity is inhibited when Ran is bound to GDP. Although in those areas where there is an interaction with the GTP-bound form the kinase is active. Thus although there is a homogeneous distribution of VRK1 protein in the nucleus, it does not imply a similar distribution of its kinase activity. This functional heterogeneity is an important concept regarding the function of both proteins. The VRK1 protein is also present in the cytosol of some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) where Ran is in its inactive conformation; thus in cytosol, the activity of VRK1 is likely to be inhibited. The different compositions of protein complexes that implicate regulation of VRK1 activity are summarized in a diagram (<xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), and their relative proportions in different subcellular location will determine the local effect of VRK1. In the cytosol, the interaction between Ran and VRK2 is more likely to play a relevant role, but the processes implicated still need to be identified and characterized. VRK2 modulates stress response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>) or to IL-1Î² signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of histones by VRK1 was initially identified for histone H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Later the unique <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ortholog of this human kinase family, the NHK-1 (nucleosomal histone kinase), has also been shown to phosphorylate histones and is essential for chromosome condensation and mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>). Histone H3 plays an important role in chromatin condensation once the DNA synthesis has been completed. Histone H3 can be phosphorylated by VRK1 in Thr-3 and Ser-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). H3 phosphorylation in Thr-3 has been shown to be required early in mitosis and was concentrated in the central region of the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>); but the kinase was not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>) although some studies have detected this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>). H3 phosphorylation in Ser-10 has been detected in mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>) and is indispensable for cell transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>), which is also required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>). The subcellular location of H3 phosphorylated in Ser-10 has been detected concentrated in the periphery of chromosome packages in anaphase and telophase and reforming nuclei, thus presenting a different temporal and spatial pattern with respect to Thr-3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>). VRK1 phosphorylation of H3 in both Thr-3 and Ser-10 contributes to nuclear condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) and might also be acting as a downstream target of other signaling kinases that have been shown to phosphorylate H3 in <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, such as MSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>), or haspin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>). H3 phosphorylation in Ser-10 by MSK1/2 has been implicated in the activation of immediate-early response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>), a role that has also been identified for VRK1<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref>; and in this context, VRK1 might be an alternative kinase to the Pim1 kinase role in transcriptional complexes containing Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>).</p><p>The effect of Ran on the activity of VRK1 indicates that within the nucleus and depending on the concentration of each protein they might have different roles creating a functional heterogeneity. VRK1 is located dispersed throughout nuclei, but Ran activation is dependent on the differential gradient of RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). This differential activity can have an important role in the regulation of its transcription factors by phosphorylation that includes p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), ATF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>), c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>), and probably others that will be identified in the future. An alternative role of this inhibition of the phosphorylation by Ran might allow checking for the correctness of DNA replication. The formation of a complex with VRK1-Ran and non-phosphorylated RCC1 suggests that this complex is likely to be in a conformation that binds to chromatin rather than being implicated in nuclear transport that requires phosphorylation of RCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). The importance of intracellular phosphorylation gradients is exemplified by the role of Aurora B in anaphase where there is a cross-talk between Aurora B activation and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>).</p><p>Although VRK1 does not appear to affect the nucleotide-bound state of Ran, it will be necessary to determine whether it modulates some of the effects associated with Ran, such as nuclear transport. Therefore the interaction between VRK proteins and Ran might have additional effects. The interaction region is conserved among the three VRK proteins and is shared with other small GTPase-binding proteins, making feasible the formation of different combinations depending on intracellular location.</p><p>In summary, in this report we have shown that Ran GTPase, depending on its activation state, is able to regulate the kinase activity of the VRK1 and thus has the potential to generate areas within the cell with different kinase activity. This represents the first regulatory protein of VRK1 and one of the first nuclear kinases regulated by protein-protein interactions.</p></sec>

GST-VRK proteins or GST protein was transfected in HEK293T cells, and the protein complexes were isolated by glutathione-Sepharose pulldowns. The proteins were separated in parallel by 2D SDS-PAGE. Spots from the gels of GST-VRK1 and GST-VRK2B were selected for analysis when they did not appear in the GST control gel. The spots were subjected to trypsin digestion and analysis by MALDI-TOF. <italic>B</italic>, pulldown of proteins associated to GST-VRK2B. HEK293T cells were transfected with 8 Î¼g of plasmid pCEFL-GST-VRK2B or 2 Î¼g of pCEFL-GST as control, and the correct expression of the proteins was analyzed by Western blotting 48 h after transfection (<italic>left</italic>). The lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Protein complexes were isolated by pulldown and subjected to 2D SDS-PAGE. Each sample was resolved in a pH range of 3â10, and the second dimension electrophoresis was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
