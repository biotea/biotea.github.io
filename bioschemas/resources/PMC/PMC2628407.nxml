      <abstract>
        <p>Fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation, is due to the absence of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in several steps of RNA metabolism. To date, two RNA motifs have been found to mediate FMRP/RNA interaction, the G-quartet and the âkissing complex,â which both induce translational repression in the presence of FMRP. We show here a new role for FMRP as a positive modulator of translation. FMRP specifically binds <italic>Superoxide Dismutase 1</italic> (<italic>Sod1</italic>) mRNA with high affinity through a novel RNA motif, SoSLIP (<italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA Stem Loops Interacting with FMRP), which is folded as three independent stem-loop structures. FMRP induces a structural modification of the SoSLIP motif upon its interaction with it. SoSLIP also behaves as a translational activator whose action is potentiated by the interaction with FMRP. The absence of FMRP results in decreased expression of <italic>Sod1.</italic> Because it has been observed that brain metabolism of <italic>FMR1</italic> null mice is more sensitive to oxidative stress, we propose that the deregulation of <italic>Sod1</italic> expression may be at the basis of several traits of the physiopathology of the Fragile X syndrome, such as anxiety, sleep troubles, and autism.</p>

          <p>The most common form of inherited mental retardation, Fragile X syndrome, is caused by the absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which can bind mRNA. In mice devoid of FMRP, several hundreds of mRNAs with altered expression and localization have been reported. The impact of these abnormalities is particularly important in the brain, where the absence of FMRP affects the structure and function of connections between neurons, resulting in reduced cognitive abilities. In recent years, scientists studying Fragile X syndrome have focused on identifying the RNAs that are specifically bound by FMRP. We and others have identified two specific RNA structures bound by FMRP/RNA. Importantly, when FMRP binds these structures, the translation of the RNA into its protein product is inhibited. In this new study we have identified a third FMRP-binding RNA structure that is found in the mRNA that encodes superoxide dismutase, an oxidative-stress-mitigating enzyme. Most significantly, FMRP enhances translation of the superoxide dismutase mRNA when it interacts with the structure. These findings suggest that absence of FMRP might result in reduced levels of superoxide dismutase, which in turn leads to increased oxidative stress in the brain. Interestingly, oxidative stress in the brain has already been linked to anxiety, sleeping difficulties, and autism, all of which typically affect individuals with Fragile X syndrome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein whose absence causes the Fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An increasing body of evidence suggests that FMRP has a complex function, reflecting its involvement in the control of hundreds of mRNA targets via its different RNA-binding domains. Indeed, FMRP contains two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K-homology (KH) domains and one arginine-glycine-glycine domain (RGG box) that can mediate protein/RNA interaction [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although specificity of binding for the KH1 domain was not proved, the KH2 domain was shown to specifically bind a category of synthetic aptamers (âkissing complexâ), a sequence-specific element within a complex tertiary structure stabilized by Mg<sup>2+</sup> [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the RGG box is able to bind G-quartet RNA with high affinity [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This structure is present in several FMRP mRNA targets, such as <italic>Fragile X Mental Retardation 1</italic> (<italic>FMR1</italic>), <italic>Microtubules Associated Protein 1B</italic> (<italic>MAP1B</italic>), and <italic>PP2Ac Protein Phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit</italic> (PP2Ac) [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. FMRP is able to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, where it is mostly associated with polyribosomes, suggesting an implication in translational control [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In neurons, FMRP is also involved in RNA trafficking along dendrites and axons, being a component of RNA granules and functioning as a molecular adaptor between these complexes and the neurospecific KIF3C kinesin [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, after traveling along dendrites, FMRP associates with polyribosomes localized at the synapse to participate in the translational control of proteins synthesized in this compartment [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Taking into consideration the results obtained from different laboratories, several mechanisms of action of FMRP have been proposed suggesting: (i) polysomal stalling for <italic>MAP1B</italic> mRNA expression regulation [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; (ii) retention of mRNAs in translationally inactive messenger RNPs (mRNPs) via its interaction with the kissing complex motif [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; (iii) inhibition of translation preventing ribosome scanning via a G-quartet structure localized in the 5â² UTR of a target mRNA, as for the <italic>PP2Ac</italic> mRNA [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the ability of FMRP to stabilize the <italic>Post Synaptic Density 95</italic> (<italic>PSD95</italic>) mRNA, by interacting with its 3â² UTR, was recently reported [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Here we show that FMRP interacts with the <italic>Superoxide Dismutase 1</italic> (<italic>Sod1</italic>) mRNA with high specificity and affinity via a novel RNA structure that we named SoSLIP (<italic><underline>So</underline>d1</italic>
<underline>S</underline>tem <underline>L</underline>oop <underline>I</underline>nteracting with FMR<underline>P</underline>). SoSLIP is organized in a triple stem-loop structure and acts as an FMRP-dependent translational enhancer and as a mild internal ribosome binding site (IRES) in an FMRP-independent manner. The characterization of this novel RNA motif interacting with FMRP sheds new light on the ability of this protein to bind RNA and to improve the translation of SoSLIP-containing mRNAs. Our results, taken together with other recent findings [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggest that the deregulation of <italic>Sod1</italic> expression may have an important role in the pathogenetic mechanism of Fragile X syndrome.</p>

        <title>FMRP Binds <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA with High Affinity via Its C-Terminal Domain</title>
        <p>With the goal to find novel mRNA structures specifically recognized by FMRP, we performed a systematic analysis of known FMRP mRNA targets, focusing on those that have been shown to interact in vivo with FMRP by the antibody-positioned RNA amplification (APRA) technique [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. First, we excluded the presence of already known structures bound by FMRP in these mRNA targets by screening their capacity to bind a recombinant FMRP in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Indeed, K<sup>+</sup> ions stabilize the G-quartet RNA structure, leading to a robust interaction with FMRP [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas Mg<sup>2+</sup> favors FMRP/kissing complex RNA interaction [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This analysis resulted in the characterization of FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> interaction, which takes place in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and is not affected by the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), whereas, as expected, Na<sup>+</sup> affects the binding of FMRP to the N19 sequence that contains the G-quartet present in <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA (nucleotide (nt) 1470â1496) [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, to definitely exclude the presence of a G-quartet structure in <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA, we performed a reverse transcriptase (RT) elongation reaction assay, as previously described [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the presence of K<sup>+</sup>, G-quartet RNA is very stable, blocking RT progression at its 3â² edge and resulting in a truncated transcription product. Conversely, in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, G-quartet structures are destabilized, and the RT can proceed to the end of the RNA [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] . The RT elongation test on <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA did not reveal any K<sup>+</sup>-dependent stop of the polymerase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA is not able to form a G-quartet structure. Moreover, FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> interaction was not dependent on the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which is necessary to stabilize the âkissing complexâ RNA structure (unpublished data) [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest that FMRP binds to <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA via a novel sequence/structure. We continued the characterization of the FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA interaction by testing the ability of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA to compete for the binding of the FMRP/G-quartet RNA structure [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Indeed, 5 nM unlabeled <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA competed very efficiently (65%) with the previously identified N19 FMRP binding site in a gel-shift assay, whereas a negative control, N8 RNA (corresponding to nt 1â654 of <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA that does not contain the G-quartet), was not able to compete for the same interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). To precisely define the region of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA interacting with FMRP, we generated three different constructs from <italic>Sod1</italic> encompassing its full-length cDNA: its 5â² UTR and a portion of its coding region (<italic>Sod1â5â²</italic> region), a central part of the coding region (<italic>Sod1-mid</italic> region), and a fragment overlapping the end of the coding region and the 3â² UTR (<italic>Sod1â3â²</italic> region) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). RNA sequences corresponding to each fragment were produced and tested for their ability to interact with FMRP. Only the <italic>Sod1â5â²</italic> region (spanning nt â70 to +148 of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA) competed with N19 binding to FMRP with the same affinity as the full-length <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA (3 nM concentrations of both cold probes compete for 50% of FMRP/N19 binding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). To identify the sequence of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA that is recognized and bound by FMRP, we employed a site boundary determination method [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this experiment, the 3â²- or 5â²-end-labeled <italic>Sod1â5â²</italic> RNA was treated by mild alkaline hydrolysis in order to generate a pool of smaller fragments. The RNA fragments retaining the capacity to bind FMRP were selected on immobilized glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-FMRP, as previously described [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Bound RNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (not shown). The border positions were at â30 and +34 for 3â²- and 5â²-end-labeled fragments, respectively. This technique allowed us to define a 64-base region spanning both sides of the <italic>Sod1</italic> AUG start codon that is protected by FMRP. We subcloned this sequence, and we synthesized its corresponding RNA, generating the <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA. This RNA was bound specifically by FMRP, because it was able to compete for the FMRP/<italic>Sod1</italic> full-length mRNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Interestingly, the FMRP/<italic>Sod1â64</italic> interaction is competed for by the N19 G-quartet-containing RNA to the same extent (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>To assess which portion of FMRP was able to interact with <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA, we produced protein fragments of the different RNA-binding domains of FMRP (e.g., KH1, KH2, and RGG-box-containing C-terminal domains) as recombinant proteins in a bacterial system [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and we used them in binding assays with the <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA. Interestingly, we observed that <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA interacts only with the C-terminal domain of FMRP encompassing the RGG box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D) and was not able to interact with any of the KH domains, even at high protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). As described previously, the same C-terminal domain was also able to bind the G-quartet RNA structure [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
        <p>To assess whether <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA binds FMRP in the same ionic conditions as the full-length <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA, we performed a binding assay in the presence of either K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>.

        <title>Structure of the <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA Region Interacting with FMRP</title>
        <p>To unravel the mechanism of action of the FMRP/<italic>Sod1â64</italic> interaction in translational control, we decided to determine <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA structure in the absence and in the presence of FMRP. To determine the secondary structure of <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA, we probed the structure of this 64-base region in solution, using a panel of chemical and enzymatic modifications, as described [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This technique is based on the reactivity of RNA molecules toward chemicals or enzymes that modify or cleave specific atomic positions in RNA. The probing experiments were performed using unlabeled or radioactively end-labeled in vitro transcribed RNAs (<italic>Sod1â5â²</italic> region), which were subjected to random digestion with RNases T1, T2, and V1 or chemical modifications with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and a carbodiimide derivative (CMCT). RNase T1 cuts after guanine residues in single-stranded regions, RNase T2 cleaves after all single-stranded residues, but preferentially after adenines, whereas RNase V1 cuts at double-stranded or stacked bases. DMS alkylates the N1 position of adenines and the N3 position of cytosines, whereas CMCT modifies the N1 position of guanines and the N3 position of uridines. The sites of cleavage or modification were then identified by primer extension with reverse transcriptase, using a radiolabeled primer complementary to the <italic>Sod1</italic>-5â² region. Analysis of the resulting cDNAs was performed on sequencing polyacrylamide gels that were run together with the corresponding RNA sequencing ladder to allow identification of the modified residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). A secondary structure model was further derived by combining experimental data and free energy data calculated using the mFOLD program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://helix.nih.gov/apps/bioinfo/mfold.html">http://helix.nih.gov/apps/bioinfo/mfold.html</ext-link>). The structure of <italic>Sod1â64</italic> RNA appears as a succession of three independent stem-loop structures that are separated by short single-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). <italic>Sod1â64</italic> appears strongly conserved at the sequence and structure level also in rat and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g003">3</xref>C).

        <p>We then analyzed the SoSLIP structure by RNA protection after incubation with FMRP. SoSLIP RNA was treated by V1 nuclease, DMS, and Pb<sup>2+</sup> in the absence or in the presence of increasing amounts of recombinant FMRP. The modified RNA was reverse-transcribed using the radiolabeled primer IV, and the obtained products were separated by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Protections and increases of reactivity were found within a region extending from nucleotides â10 to + 34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, lead, a probe specific for unpaired nucleotides, flexible regions, and protein binding sites, with no base specificity, revealed protections over this whole area. Because of their extent, these protections indicate a combination of both direct protection from the protein and strengthening of the structure. Noticeably, the hyperreactive positions +26 and +27 in L3 were particularly protected by the protein. A modification of the SoSLIP structure is further indicated by the increases of reactivity observed with V1 cleavages (for example, the (A) base of <italic>Sod1</italic> starting codon AUG and its preceding base (C), as well as the second stem and the more 3' part) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In conclusion, these data indicate that FMRP protects the RNA particularly at the level of the L2 and L3 loops and induces conformational changes of the L2 and L3 stems, with the possible exposure of several nucleotides, and in particular the AUG sequence in the L2 stem, in the presence of the protein.</p>

FMRP being a well-known polyribosome-associated protein in brain [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and all tissues and cell lines analyzed [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we studied the distribution of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA in polyribosomes derived from extracts of STEK cells expressing or not expressing a <italic>FMR1</italic> transgene and from brain extracts of wild-type and <italic>Fmr1</italic> null mice. We used the polyribosome purification procedure previously described [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], because this method is based on the concentration of polyribosomal franctions, avoiding contamination of light mRNP. We evaluated the <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA level by qRT-PCR using <italic>Hprt</italic> mRNA as an internal control. In the absence of FMRP, we observed a decreased level of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA in polyribosome fractions (medium and heavy) obtained from fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), as well as in the corresponding polyribosomal fractions obtained from total brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Indeed, as we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g005">5</xref>E, the amount of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA associated with polyribosomes is dependent on the amount of FMRP, because a reduced association (statistically significant) is observed in medium and heavy fractions where the amount of FMRP is most abundant, and nonsignificant differences are observed in the light fractions where the amount of FMRP is less abundant. These results suggest that the absence of FMRP plays a key role in <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA incorporation in the translating machinery.</p>

        <title>Role of the FMRP/SoSLIP Complex in Translation</title>
        <p>To confirm the positive role of FMRP in translational modulation of Sod1 expression by the interaction with the SoSLIP RNA structure, we cloned this sequence upstream of the luciferase gene in the pcDNA3.1 zeo vector (Luc) to evaluate the effect of the presence of SoSLIP on the expression of a reporter protein. We transfected primary cultured hippocampal neurons with the SoSLIP-luciferase vector (SoSLIP-Luc) or with the Luc vector, and we tested luciferase activity, showing on average an 8-fold increase when SoSLIP is placed upstream of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). A similar result was obtained in <italic>FMR1</italic>-expressing STEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Analysis of luciferase mRNA levels tested by qRT-PCR revealed that the presence of SoSLIP did not affect the mRNA expression level or stability of the dowstream reporter gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg004">S4</xref>B). These results indicate that SoSLIP behaves per se as a translational activator in both cell types. We then transfected the same plasmid in primary hippocampal neurons obtained from normal and <italic>Fmr1</italic> null mice and in STEK cells expressing or not expressing the <italic>FMR1</italic> transgene. Indeed, in the absence of FMRP, luciferase activity resulted in a 2-fold reduction as compared with that in the presence of FMRP (wild-type condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). These data suggest that the presence of FMRP potentiates the ability of the SoSLIP sequence to positively modulate the expression of a downstream coding sequence independently of the cellular type. In addition, our findings are compatible with the notion that FMRP's roles in translation might be positive or negative as discussed [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To test the functional importance of SoSLIP stem loops, we disrupted each of the three stem loops by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). Using a filter binding assay, we then tested the ability of each mutant to compete for the binding of the FMRP/SoSLIP interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>D, the SL1 mutant is able to fully compete for SoSLIP binding (4 nM cold SL1 probe competes for 50% of wild-type SoSLIP), indicating that the disruption of SL1 does not affect FMRP/SoSLIP interaction. Conversely, the two SL2 and SL3 mutants poorly compete for SoSLIP binding to FMRP (60 nM concentrations of both cold probes compete for 50% of SoSLIP). The disruption of these two stem loops reduces their affinity for FMRP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>D) but did not abolish this binding, as suggested by comparing with the competition of an RNA sequence not bound by FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g003">3</xref>â² UTR <italic>Sod1</italic> RNA as the cold competitor). All three mutations affect the SoSLIP translational enhancer properties<italic>,</italic> reducing the level of luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>E), if compared with the luciferase activity of the SoSLIP-Luc construct. Indeed, the activities of SL1-Luc, SL2-Luc, and SL3-Luc are reduced by 80%, 50%, and 60%, respectively, if compared with SoSLIP-Luc activity when these constructs have been transfected in cells expressing FMRP. The activities of SL1-Luc, SL2-Luc, and SL3-Luc are also reduced (62%, 44%, and 50%, respectively), if compared with SoSLIP-Luc activity when these constructs have been transfected in cells not expressing FMRP. Furthermore, in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout cells, the two SL2 and SL3 mutants have a reduced translational enhancing activity if compared with their activity in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>E) (40% and 33% reduced activity, respectively), confirming the data obtained by the in vitro binding. Surprisingly, the absence of FMRP does not modify the impact of the SL1 mutant on luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g007">Figure 7</xref>E), suggesting that also the SL1 integrity is necessary for the correct function of FMRP. To confirm that the effect of the mutants was only affecting translation efficiency, the expression and the stability of the mRNAs of all three SoSLIP mutants were tested, and no differences were observed with the wild-type mRNA, in the presence or in the absence of FMRP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg004">Figure S4</xref>Aâ<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000016-sg004">S4</xref>C).</p>

        <title>SoSLIP Acts as an IRES-like Element in an FMRP-Independent Manner</title>
        <p>Due to its effects on translation, we asked then whether SoSLIP may act as an IRES. For this purpose, we used the pPRIG-HA-red bicistronic vector, where <named-content content-type="genus-species">Discosoma</named-content> sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) are under the control of the same promoter. The DsRed is translated in a cap-dependent manner, whereas eGFP is translated only if an IRES sequence is cloned in front of it, as described [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We removed the IRES sequence (pPRIGempty), and we cloned the SoSLIP sequence between the DsRed and the eGFP cDNAs (SoSLI-PRIG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). After 48 h of transfection, HeLa cells were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), and the eGFP intensity was quantified for 200,000 cells expressing DsRed at a constant intensity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>B, we did not observe any green fluorescence in cells transfected with pPRIGempty, confirming that eGFP is not expressed in the absence of an upstream IRES sequence. Conversely, when SoSLIP is placed upstream of eGFP cDNA, green fluorescence becomes readily detectable. However, in this case, the mean eGFP fluorescence intensity was 5.4-fold less than that when using the strong viral IRES in pPRIG-HA (250 and 1,400 arbitrary units (AUs), respectively)<italic>.</italic> The same result was observed following transfection of the neuroblastoma NG108 cell line, neurons, COS cells, and STEK cells expressing <italic>FMR1</italic> (unpublished data). No differences were observed in the intensity level of GFP fluorescence from the SoSLI-PRIG vector in cells expressing or not expressing FMRP, suggesting that this protein is not required for the mild IRES-like activity of SoSLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). Even if FMRP cannot be considered as an IRES translational activating factor, the observation that SoSLIP may act as an IRES-like sequence is important to understand the role of SoSLIP in translational control. To confirm this result, we produced mRNAs encoding luciferase and SoSLIP-Luc carrying or not carrying the cap modification, and we translated in vitro equal amounts of each mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and in wheat germ extract (WGE). As expected, luciferase mRNA is translated with higher efficiency when the mRNA is capped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). SoSLIP-Luc is translated in a cap-independent manner with efficiency comparable to that obtained in the cap-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>E). The same result was obtained for the translation of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA in the capped and not capped versions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000016-g008">Figure 8</xref>F).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The primary function of FMRP resides in its ability to bind mRNAs. Despite the importance of this function, the RNA binding specificity of FMRP is not completely understood [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To date, only a single structure, the G-quartet, was found to mediate the specific interaction of FMRP with several of its target mRNAs [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A synthetic RNA with a specific structure, called the âkissing complex,â binds FMRP with high affinity but has not been found in any naturally occurring mRNA that is a target of FMRP [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The G-rich 3â² UTR of <italic>PSD95</italic> mRNA has been reported to interact with FMRP, and the authors claimed that this interaction happens via a novel motif [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The structure of this motif has not been defined, but a sequence highly similar (95%) to the G-quartet consensus previously determined [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is present in the 3â² UTR of <italic>PSD95</italic>, strongly suggesting the presence of a G-quartet in <italic>PSD95</italic> mRNA [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other mechanisms depending on the interaction of FMRP with noncoding mRNAs are controversial [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In conclusion, the specific sequence/region mediating the interaction of most putative mRNA targets with FMRP has not been experimentally defined. It is thought that elucidating the functional significance of the FMRP/RNA interaction is a critical step to understand the molecular bases of Fragile X syndrome. On the basis of conclusions from several laboratories, it has been considered that FMRP behaves exclusively as a translational repressor [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recent studies have proposed a more complex function for FMRP, possibly depending on the specific binding of its target RNAs, on conformational changes in its structure, or on the influence of FMRP-interacting proteins [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, a related member of the FXR family, FXR1P, was reported to function as a translational activator when associated with the AU-rich element present in the 3â² UTR of TNFÎ± mRNA in response to serum starvation [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we define a new function of FMRP by dissecting the mechanism of binding of FMRP to the <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA that was previously identified as an in vivo target of FMRP in cultured primary neurons [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here we show that FMRP recognizes <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA via a novel motif, the SoSLIP, organized in three stem loops separated by short sequences. In the absence of FMRP, <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA present in polyribosomes is reduced, and Sod1 protein is less expressed in brains and cell lines from <italic>FMR1</italic> knockout mice, suggesting that Sod1 expression is positively modulated by the interaction between SoSLIP and FMRP. We have shown that the presence of FMRP protects the L2 and L3 loops of the SoSLIP structure. It is clear from our analyses that this interaction promotes structural modifications around the AUG start codon of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA and the more 3â² end portion of SoSLIP. These structural modifications apparently favor translation. SoSLIP is able to positively modulate the expression of a reporter gene, whose translation is also significantly increased by the presence of FMRP. We generated three mutants, each one impairing the formation of the three stem loops, respectively. All three mutants have a negative impact on the translational effect of SoSLIP. In addition, the absence of FMRP reduces the translational efficiency of the SL2 and SL3 mutants. These findings suggest that when SL2 is mutated the activities of SL1 and SL3 are probably still present, with SL3 activity being abolished in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> null cells. In a similar way, when SL3 is mutated, the activities of SL1 and SL2 are still observable in wild-type cells. These data are consistent with the in vitro binding results, showing an interaction of FMRP with the L2 and L3 loops, and with the finding that in both mutants the FMRP/SoSLIP interaction is reduced but not completely abolished. Interestingly enough, the SL1 mutation does not impair the binding of FMRP to SoSLIP but blocks its activity as a translational enhancer. We propose that the structural alteration due to the disruption of the SL1 stem prevents the conformational changes in SoSLIP structure upon interaction with FMRP that should promote translational activation. In this case, even if FMRP can recognize and bind SL2 and SL3 via the two loop structures, its function is abolished. Alternatively, FMRP needs the interaction with a factor(s) (probably binding to SL1) to carry out its function as an enhancer of translation. Due to the conformational changes of L2 and L3 stems induced by FMRP, we therefore propose that FMRP would facilitate ribosome scanning by participating in the remodelling of the SoSLIP structure, promoting in particular the exposure of the AUG of <italic>Sod1</italic> mRNA. This function is possibly cooperating with factor(s) binding the SL1 stem loop. Furthermore, our data suggest that the mechanism of action of FMRP is dependent on the type of RNA structure to which it binds. FMRP binds both G-quartet and SoSLIP RNAs through its C-terminal region containing the RGG box, even if in different ion concentrations. For this reason, it is tempting to speculate that in vivo the local ionic environment modulates the RNA binding properties for FMRP and favors the binding of either G-quartet or SoSLIP-containing mRNAs. This possibility might be particularly relevant in the synaptic compartment, because the binding of FMRP to its different mRNA targets might be directly modulated by depolarization.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, SoSLIP can be considered as a âbipartiteâ translational activator: one domain (SL2 and SL3) acts in an FMRP-dependent-manner; the other (SL1) is independent of the presence of the Fragile X protein. Moreover, we also observed that SoSLIP may act as an IRES-like sequence. We observe that FMRP does not promote and/or influence this additional function of SoSLIP, suggesting that a specific mechanism of translational regulation is probably activated to translate SoSLIP-containing uncapped RNA. These data confirm the complexity of the translational regulation mediated by SoSLIP, and further studies will be necessary to fully understand its mechanism of action. Most important for our study, in this context, the function of FMRP is relevant to positively modulate SoSLIP-containing mRNA synergizing with other factor(s).</p>
      <p>Sod1 is a well-known protein with antioxidant properties. Alterations of oxidative stress have been proposed to occur in <italic>FMR1</italic> null flies, because changes in the expression of proteins involved in redox reactions have been observed (1-cys peroxiredoxin in brain and peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin peroxidase in testis) [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and a moderate increase of oxidative stress in the brain of <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice has been recently described [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This modest impact of the absence of FMRP on brain oxidative stress might be due to the complex regulation of <italic>Sod1</italic> expression and the fact that the two FXR1P isoforms most expressed in the brain (Isoa and Isod) are also able to bind SoSLIP, even if with a lower affinity if compared with that of FMRP, suggesting that they can partially rescue FMRP function in <italic>Fmr1</italic> null cells. In addition, the FXR1P muscular isoform (Isoe) could functionally replace FMRP in muscle cells where this protein is absent. Moreover, modifications of oxidative stress have been linked to anxiety [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], sleep troubles [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and autism [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], all phenotypic characteristics displayed by Fragile X patients [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, chronic pharmacological treatment with Î±-tocopherol has been reported to reverse behavior and learning deficits of <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At the molecular level, Sod1 has been indicated as a regulator of growth factor signaling. In particular, Sod1 inhibition may attenuate phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) signaling [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this sense, it is remarkable that the rapid activation of ERK1/2 after metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) stimulation is altered in <italic>Fmr1</italic> null mice [<xref rid="pbio-1000016-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], suggesting that reduced expression of Sod1 may contribute to this phenotype in <italic>Fmr1</italic> null synapses. In conclusion, our study suggests a role for Sod1 in the physiopathology of Fragile X syndrome and proposes a new function and novel mechanism of action for FMRP.</p>
