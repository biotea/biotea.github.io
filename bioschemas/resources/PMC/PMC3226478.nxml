      <abstract>
        <p>Neurons are highly polarized cells with long neurites. Vesicular transport is required for neurite extension. We recently identified protrudin as a key regulator of vesicular transport during neurite extension. Expression of protrudin in nonneuronal cells thus induces formation of neurite-like membrane protrusions. We adopted a proteomics approach to identify proteins that associate with protrudin. Among the protrudin-associated proteins, including many with a function related to intracellular trafficking, we focused on KIF5, a motor protein that mediates anterograde vesicular transport in neurons. A coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed that endogenous protrudin and KIF5 interact in mouse brain. Overexpression of KIF5 induced the formation of membrane protrusions in HeLa cells, reminiscent of the effect of protrudin overexpression. Forced expression of both protrudin and KIF5 promoted protrusion extension in a synergistic manner, whereas depletion of either protein attenuated protrusion formation. Protrudin facilitated the interaction of KIF5 with Rab11, VAP-A and -B, Surf4, and RTN3, suggesting that protrudin serves as an adaptor protein and that the protrudinâKIF5 complex contributes to the transport of these proteins in neurons. Given that mutation of protrudin or KIF5 is a cause of human hereditary spastic paraplegia, the protrudinâKIF5 axis appears to be integral to neuronal function.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neurons are highly polarized cells with long neurites that subserve their contribution to neural networks, with the neuronal surface area being as much as 10,000 times that of other cell types. A neuron-specific transport system for membrane-bound vesicles that contain lipids and proteins is thought to be required for the extension and maintenance of neurites and for various aspects of neuronal function. During the establishment of neuronal polarity, such vesicles are transported in a directional manner within the cell, supplying new materials to the growing processes and distributing different sets of molecules to distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Futerman and Banker, 1996</xref>). Once established, the unique structure and compartmentalized molecular composition of neurites must be maintained throughout neuronal life by selective sorting or transport of membranous compartments to particular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Tang, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Kinesin-1 (also known as conventional kinesin) is a molecular motor protein that plays key roles in the polarized transport system of neurons and in neuronal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Ferreira <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Kimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>). It moves unidirectionally over long distances toward the plus end of microtubules and thereby mediates anterograde transport of its cargoes from the cell body to synapses formed by neurites. Kinesin-1 binds a wide variety of neuronal cargoes required for the establishment and maintenance of axonal or somatodendritic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Goldstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). It consists of a dimer of KIF5 (kinesin heavy chain), which hydrolyzes ATP and uses the released energy to move along microtubules, as well as two regulatory kinesin light chains (KLCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hirokawa and Noda, 2008</xref>). KIF5 consists of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal motor domain, a central coiled-coil stalk domain, and a COOH-terminal globular tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). The tail of the kinesin molecule, encompassing the COOH-terminus of KIF5 and KLC, is the region most likely to mediate cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Goldstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hirokawa and Noda, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified protrudin as a key regulator of Rab11-dependent vesicular transport during neurite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). Rab11 regulates recycling pathways from endosomes to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Stenmark, 2009</xref>) and is thought to contribute to the establishment of neuronal polarity through regulation of polarized vesicular transport. Protrudin contains an atypical Rab11-binding domain and promotes neurite formation through interaction with the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form of Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). The association of protrudin with Rab11 is promoted by protrudin phosphorylation, which results from extracellular signalâregulated kinase signaling triggered by nerve growth factor. Forced expression of protrudin in cultured cells, even in nonneuronal cells, induced localized membrane protrusion and the consequent formation of long processes, whereas down-regulation of protrudin by RNA interference (RNAi) induced membrane extension in all directions, resulting in inhibition of neurite formation.</p><p>The gene encoding ZFYVE27, a synonym of human protrudin (SPG33), was recently found to be mutated in a German family with an autosomal dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Mannan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>). AD-HSP comprises a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by bilateral and slowly progressive spasticity of the legs that is associated with retrograde degeneration of axons in corticospinal tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Reid, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Deluca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It has been proposed that abnormal axonal transport of certain cargoes, particularly in the distal region of long axons underlies the disease process, as suggested by the finding that mutations in the gene for KIF5A, a neuron-specific isoform of KIF5 (SPG10), are also associated with HSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Reid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Goizet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These various observations also suggest that protrudin plays a key role in polarized vesicular transport, not only during the establishment of neuronal polarity, but also during its maintenance. The precise mechanism by which protrudin regulates polarized vesicular transport has remained unclear.</p><p>With the use of proteomic screening, we have now identified KIF5A, KIF5B, and KIF5C as proteins that interact with protrudin. Furthermore, overexpression of KIF5 in HeLa cells induced the formation of membrane protrusions similar to those induced by protrudin overexpression. Both protrudin and KIF5 were shown to be required for such protrusion formation. Our results suggest that protrudin and KIF5 perform related functions in polarized vesicular transport. The genetic association of protrudin and KIF5 with a human neurodegenerative disease further suggests that the protrudinâKIF5 axis and its role in the polarized transport system are physiologically important for neuronal function.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of protrudin-associated proteins by a proteomics approach</title><p>To investigate the physiological role of protrudin, we adopted a proteomics approach to identify proteins with which protrudin is physically associated in cells. Mouse protrudin tagged with hexahistidine (His<sub>6</sub>) and the FLAG epitope in tandem at its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus was stably expressed in Neuro2A cells and then purified together with its associated proteins from cell lysates by dual-affinity chromatography with antibodies to FLAG (anti-FLAG) and with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Supplemental Figure S1). Proteins in the final eluate were fractionated by SDSâPAGE and stained with silver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The stained gel was then sliced, the gel pieces were exposed to trypsin, and the generated peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LCâMS/MS; Supplemental Table S1). We identified a total of 82 proteins that were present in all three replicates from cells overexpressing protrudin but which were not recovered from control cells (Table S2). Functional categorization of the protrudin-associated proteins with the PANTHER classification system revealed that a substantial proportion of these proteins (n = 21 or 26%) was related to intracellular protein traffic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), supporting the notion that protrudin plays a key role in vesicular transport. These latter proteins were subjected to semiquantitative analysis on the basis of the normalized identification frequency (IF) in each LCâMS/MS experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Vesicle-associated membrane proteinâassociated protein A (VAP-A) and VAP-B, which we previously identified as protrudin-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Saita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), were ranked first and third in the list. These results therefore justified our approach and revealed its high reproducibility. The protrudin-interacting proteins also included members of the KIF5 family, all of which are molecular motors that play key roles in trafficking of proteins or organelles in neurons.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Identification of KIF5 family members as protrudin-associated proteins. (A) Neuro2A cells stably expressing His<sub>6</sub>-FLAGâtagged mouse protrudin or infected with the corresponding empty virus (Mock) were lysed and subjected to dual-affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG and Ni-NTA agarose. The purified proteins were fractionated by SDSâPAGE and stained with silver. The arrowhead indicates the band corresponding to the bait protein. (B) The identified proteins that associated specifically with His<sub>6</sub>-FLAGâprotrudin were categorized according to their related gene ontology biological processes.

The resulting precipitates, as well as a portion (6% of the input for IP) of the cell extracts, were subjected to IB with anti-HA, anti-FLAG, or anti-HSP90 (loading control). (E) Mouse brain extract was subjected to IP with anti-protrudin or normal rabbit serum (NRS), and the resulting precipitates, as well as a portion (1% of the input for IP) of the tissue extract, were subjected to IB with anti-KIF5 and anti-protrudin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="4602fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Protrudin physiologically associates with KIF5 in mouse brain</title><p>To confirm the interaction between protrudin and KIF5 family members, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitates were prepared with anti-FLAG from lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with expression vectors both for His<sub>6</sub>-FLAGâtagged protrudin and for hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged forms of mouse KIF5A, KIF5B, KIF5C, or KIF1BÎ± (known to transport some cargoes in neurons; used here as a negative control) lacking the head domain. The resulting precipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis (IB) with anti-HA and anti-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). All three isoforms of KIF5, but not KIF1BÎ±, were detected in the immunoprecipitates, with KIF5A being most efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with His<sub>6</sub>-FLAGâprotrudin.</p><p>Similar analysis was performed to detect the potential interaction between endogenous proteins. Immunoprecipitates from mouse brain extracts prepared with anti-protrudin were subjected to IB with anti-KIF5. Endogenous KIF5 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous protrudin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggested that protrudin interacts with KIF5 in the brain under physiological conditions.</p><p>We next investigated which region of KIF5A is required for binding to protrudin by generating a series of HA-tagged deletion mutants of KIF5A and examining their ability to associate with His<sub>6</sub>-FLAGâprotrudin in a coimmunoprecipitation assay with HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, AâD</xref>). Whereas full-length KIF5A and all three mutants that included the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the stalk domain (amino acids 402â572) interacted with protrudin, all of the five mutants that lacked this region failed to do so, suggesting that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the stalk domain is necessary and sufficient for the interaction of KIF5A with protrudin.</p><p>We also determined the region of protrudin that is required for its binding to KIF5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, EâH</xref>). Whereas full-length protrudin and all six mutants that included the region containing the FFAT sequence, the coiled-coil domain, and the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal portion of the FYVE domain (amino acids 274â361) interacted with KIF5A(402â572), all six mutants that lacked this region failed to do so, suggesting that the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 274â361) of protrudin is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with KIF5A.</p><p>To examine the direct interaction between KIF5A and protrudin in vitro, we performed a pulldown assay. Recombinant mutants of KIF5A tagged with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) at their NH<sub>2</sub>-termini were produced in bacteria and tested for their ability to bind to recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-tagged protrudin produced in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and S2). Whereas KIF5A(402â572) bound to protrudin, KIF5A(1â401) and KIF5A(573â1027) did not, consistent with our observations in vivo. These results suggested the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the stalk domain mediates the direct binding of KIF5A to protrudin.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Delineation of the regions of KIF5A and protrudin responsible for their interaction.

Although protrusion formation in HeLa cells might not be identical to neurite formation in neuronal cells, it likely reflects an activity of protrudin required for polarized vesicular transport that may be common to both HeLa and neuronal cells. We therefore adopted HeLa cells as an experimental system to estimate the activity of protrudin. To evaluate the role of KIF5 in the function of protrudin, we examined the effect of short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of KIF5B on the protrusion-forming activity of protrudin in HeLa cells, given that among the KIF5 isoforms only KIF5B was found to be expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and S3A). Depletion of KIF5B resulted in marked inhibition of the protrusion-forming activity of protrudin, even though the expression level of protrudin was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4, B and C</xref>, and S3B). We also examined the effect of expression of HA-tagged KIF5A(402â572), which associated with the KIF5A-binding region of protrudin and inhibited the interaction between KIF5A and protrudin (Figure S3D). The inhibition of the interaction between protrudin and KIF5 resulted in marked inhibition of the protrusion-forming activity of protrudin, even though the expression level of protrudin was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4, D and E</xref>, and S3E). These results suggested KIF5 is required for the induction of protrusion formation by protrudin in HeLa cells.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>Protrusion formation induced by protrudin overexpression requires KIF5 in HeLa cells.

KIF5 is responsible for such proper distribution of a large number of cargo proteins associated with various types of intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The docking of motor proteins to their cargoes via adaptor proteins is thought to be an important mechanism for achieving cargo selectivity and spatiotemporal control of cargo transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Major adaptor proteins for KIF5 include KLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gyoeva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). KLCs associate with scaffold proteins, such as c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinaseâinteracting proteins (JIP1 to -3) and CRMP2, which in turn interact with cargoes and link them to KIF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In other instances, KIF5 directly binds in a KLC-independent manner to adaptor proteins, such as GRIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Setou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), the MiltonâMiro complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Glater <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), syntabulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Su <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, only a limited number of adaptor proteins has been shown to mediate the docking of a large number of cargo proteins to KIF5. We have now shown that protrudin directly associates with KIF5 and that protrudin and KIF5 synergistically promote protrusion formation in cells. Protrudin was found to link its associated proteins, such as Rab11, VAP-A and -B, Surf4, and RTN3, to KIF5, consistent with our observation that inhibition of the interaction between protrudin and KIF5 resulted in the accumulation of protrudin, as well as of Rab11, VAP-A and -B, Surf4, and RTN3 in the soma of cultured neurons.</p><sec><title>Protrudin-associated proteins are candidate cargoes for transport by protrudin and KIF5</title><p>The establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity are fundamental to most aspects of neuronal function. Both protrudin and KIF5 have previously been shown to be important for neuronal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Ferreira <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Kimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Mannan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>). The identification of cargoes transported by the combination of protrudin and KIF5 is therefore likely to provide insight into the regulation of such activities.</p><p>VAP-A and -B were previously shown to interact with protrudin, and such interaction is required for neurite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Saita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). VAP-A interacts with a number of soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptors and fusion-associated proteins, such as syntaxin 1A, Rbet1, Rsec22, Î±SNAP, and NSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Weir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), suggestive of its function in neurons. VAP-33, <italic>Aplysia</italic> homologue of VAP-A and -B, was originally identified as a protein that binds to VAMP and was shown to contribute to the control of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Skehel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). VAP-33 is localized at the tight junction and intracellular vesicles for polarized vesicular transport in epithelial cells; it also localized in vesicles, including VAMP-2 and GLUT4, to regulate insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in muscle or fat cells. Rab11 also regulates the trafficking of vesicles, including VAMP-2 and GLUT4. These observations suggest VAP-33 contributes to a variety of vesicular transport systems in association with Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Calhoun and Goldenring, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lapierre <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lapierre, 2000;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Foster <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kessler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Uhlig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

Collectively, these observations indicate the importance of VAP-A and -B in vesicular transport and neuronal function.</p><p>Surf4 is the mammalian orthologue of yeast Erv29p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Reeves and Fried, 1995</xref>), which serves as a cargo receptor, loading a specific subset of soluble cargo proteins, including glycosylated Î±-factor pheromone precursor and carboxypeptidase Y, into COPII vesicles departing from the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Belden and Barlowe, 2001</xref>). Given the extent of sequence similarity with Erv29p, Surf4 may perform a similar role in the transport of selective soluble cargoes in mammals, and protrudin and KIF5 might transport proteins that are loaded via Surf4.</p><p>RTN3 acts as an inhibitor of the Î²-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 activity that cleaves APP to generate amyloid-Î² protein, which accumulates in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Murayama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). RTN3 aggregates in dystrophic neurites of the senile plaques in the brain of such individuals, and transgenic mice that express human RTN3 manifest formation of dystrophic neurites in the brain that correlates with impairment both of spatial learning and memory acquisition, as well as of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Prior <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). These observations suggest aggregation of RTN3 might contribute to the cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease by inducing neuritic dystrophy. Furthermore, an increase in the amount of RTN3 results in an imbalance in the axonal transport of this protein, which leads to its accumulation in swollen neurites, suggesting the proper transport of RTN3 is important for the maintenance of neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, Rab11 is also a candidate for a cargo molecule. Our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>) and present studies indicate that protrudin interacts with both Rab11a and Rab11b through the Rab11-binding domain at its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus. Although Rab11 was not identified as a protrudin-associated protein by our LCâMS/MS analysis, this was possibly attributable to a low level of Rab11 expression in Neuro2A cells. In the brain, Rab11 is localized to the somatodendritic domain of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) and is required for synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The formation of a GDP-Rab11âprotrudinâKIF5 complex may activate KIF5 to bind to the microtubule track and transport protrudin, GDP-Rab11, and the associated membrane compartment to processes, given that KIF5 becomes activated for transport on cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Jiang and Sheetz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Coy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Blasius <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We propose that the binding specificity of protrudin for the GDP-bound form of Rab11 might be important to maintain Rab11 in the inactive state during transport in neurons. After transport to the target site, GDP-Rab11 might be converted to GTP-Rab11 by the action of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and unloaded from the protrudinâKIF5 complex to exert its function. Indeed, Rab11 was shown to play a pivotal role in Î±-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionateâsensitive glutamate receptor transport in association with myosin Vb at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), suggesting that GDP-Rab11âKIF5 might be converted to GTP-Rab11âmyosin Vb at synapses. Protrudin and KIF5 might therefore be required for the transport of Rab11 from the soma to the base of dendritic spines, where they may transfer it to myosin Vb, a motor protein that contributes to protein trafficking within the spine during long-term potentiation of synaptic strength. Similar regulation of the nucleotide state of Rab3 by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor was shown to be important for its axonal transport by kinesin family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Niwa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of protrudin and KIF5A in HSP</title><p>AD-HSP comprises a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity of the lower limbs that is associated with retrograde degeneration of axons in the corticospinal tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Reid, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Deluca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). To date, 45 spastic paraplegia (SPG) loci and 20 causative genes for AD-HSP, including those encoding ZFYVE27 (a synonym of human protrudin, SPG33) and KIF5A, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Reid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Mannan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>). Mutations in KIF5A were recently identified in as many as 10% of cases of complicated HSP in individuals of European descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Goizet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In contrast, a point mutation in <italic>ZFYVE27</italic> has been described as the cause of pure HSP in a single German family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Mannan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>), although this mutation was recently detected in unaffected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Martignoni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). It is possible that the pathogenic effects of this mutation differ among ethnic groups, especially given the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of, and presumed role of environmental factors in, HSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Mannan, 2008</xref>). In the present study, we have demonstrated the molecular interaction of protrudin with KIF5, as well as the functional relation between these two proteins. We propose that protrudin and KIF5 constitute a system for the regulation of vesicular transport in neurons, and that dysfunction of this system might result in neurodegenerative disease. Protrudin also associates with spastin, the most commonly mutated protein in AD-HSP, which regulates the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum together with atlastin-1, another commonly mutated protein in AD-HSP that associates with RTN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Mannan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Salinas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, spastin associates with the RTN3-related protein RTN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Mannan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006a</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that protrudin, through its complex relations with these various proteins, plays a key role in the maintenance of neuronal function. Further molecular analysis of protrudin and other AD-HSPâassociated proteins, including KIF5A, may provide insight into the pathogenesis of this group of neurological disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of expression plasmids</title><p>Mouse cDNAs encoding protrudin, KIF5A, KIF5B, KIF5C, KIF1BÎ±, and Surf4, as well as human cDNAs encoding KIF11, RTN3 (GenBank accession number NM_006054.2), and Rab11a (GenBank accession number NM_004663.4) were generated by PCR with PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) from cDNA preparations of Neuro2A cells or HEK293T cells.

The resulting peptides were dried, dissolved in a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% acetonitrile, and then applied to a nanoflow LC system (Paradigm MS4; Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) equipped with an L-column (C<sub>18</sub>, 0.15 Ã 50 mm, particle size of 3 Î¼m; CERI, Tokyo, Japan). The peptides were fractionated with a linear gradient of solvent A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (90% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water), with 0â45% solvent B over 20 min, 45â95% over 5 min, and 95â5% over 1 min at a flow rate of 1 Î¼l/min. Eluted peptides were sprayed directly into a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). MS and MS/MS spectra were obtained automatically in a data-dependent scan mode with a dynamic exclusion option. All MS/MS spectra were compared with protein sequences in the International Protein Index (IPI; European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom) mouse version 3.44 with the use of the MASCOT algorithm. Trypsin was selected as the enzyme used, the allowed number of missed cleavages was set at one, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine was selected as a fixed modification. Oxidized methionine and NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal pyroglutaminate were searched as variable modifications. Tolerance of MS/MS ions was 0.8 Da. Assigned high-scoring peptide sequences (MASCOT score of â¥45) were considered for correct identification. If the MASCOT score was &lt;45, the criteria for match acceptance included the following: 1) peptide sequence length of â¥5, 2) a MASCOT score for individual peptides of â¥35, 3) at least three blocks of three successive matches or a block of six successive matches for y or b ions, and 4) a delta score of â¥12. Identified peptides from independent experiments were integrated and regrouped by IPI accession number.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification, semiquantitation, and categorization of protrudin-associated proteins</title><p>Proteins reproducibly detected in all three independent experiments with Neuro2A cells expressing protrudin as the bait, but not at all with mock cells, were considered protrudin-associated proteins. Semiquantitative estimation of protein abundance was based on IF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Matsumoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), which is the number of identified peptides normalized by the number of peptides theoretically detectable with our instrument settings (molecular mass of 900â4000 Da). In this study, IF was normalized by the sum of the IFs for all the identified proteins in each experiment and then multiplied by 100 (normalized IF). The averages of normalized IF values for three independent experiments were ranked. Functional categorization of identified proteins was performed with the PANTHER classification system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org">www.pantherdb.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis</title><p>Whole mouse brain was homogenized by 15 strokes (900 rpm) with a Potter homogenizer in a solution containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaF, aprotinin (10 Î¼g/ml), leupeptin (10 Î¼g/ml), and 1 mM PMSF. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 1000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, and the second supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4Â°C. The crude microsomal pellet was resuspended in the lysis buffer described above, incubated for 1 h at 4Â°C, and then centrifuged again at 100,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4Â°C to remove insoluble material. The resulting supernatant was then subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) for 2 h at 4Â°C with anti-protrudin (or normal rabbit serum) and protein GâSepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and were then subjected to IB, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). The images were scanned with LAS-1000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) or LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare) instruments. For analysis of transfected HEK293T or HeLa cells, the cells were cultured for 1 d after transfection and then lysed by incubation for 10 min at 4Â°C with lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,400 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, and equal amounts of protein from the resulting supernatants were subjected directly to IB or to IP for 45 min at 4Â°C with anti-FLAG (M2)âagarose affinity gel, which was followed by IB.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro binding assay</title><p>Recombinant GST-tagged KIF5A (1â401, 402â572, or 573â1027), VAP-B (wild-type or 125â196), and RTN3 were expressed in and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The BL21(DE3)pLysS bacterial cells were transformed with the pGEX-6P-1âbased vectors, or with pGEX-6P-1 as a negative control. Overnight cultures of the transformed cells were diluted 1:20 with 2Ã YT medium (Gibco, Paisley, United Kingdom) containing ampicillin, grown at 37Â°C for 2 h, and then exposed to 0.2 mM isopropyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at 16Â°C. Expressed proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysates with glutathioneâSepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The purified GST-tagged KIF5A and RTN3 proteins (or GST as the negative control) were eluted from the beads with reduced glutathione. The purified GSTâVAP-B proteins were used without elution from the beads. Recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-protrudin was expressed in and purified from <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (cell line Sf21) insect cells with the use of the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Recombinant virus was produced with pFastBac HT-protrudin. Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant virus for 72 h, and the expressed protein was purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysates with Ni-NTA agarose and subsequently eluted with 300 mM imidazole. GST-KIF5A, GST-RTN3, or GST proteins were incubated with glutathioneâSepharose 4B beads in lysis buffer described above for 1 h at 4Â°C with rotation, and the beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. His<sub>6</sub>-protrudin was incubated with the beads containing bound GST fusion proteins or GST for 1 h at 4Â°C with rotation, after which the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were subjected to IB or to silver staining (Daiichi Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunostaining</title><p>HeLa and PC12 cells, as well as neurons cultured on glass coverslips, were prepared for immunostaining. HeLa and PC12 cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In some experiments, the cells were exposed to 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 s before fixation. Neurons were fixed for 15 min with 3.7% formaldehyde and 4% sucrose in PBS and were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. HeLa and PC12 cells were then incubated consecutively with primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 350â, 488â, 546â, or 633âlabeled goat secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% saponin, and neurons were exposed to the antibodies in PBS containing 1.0% BSA. The cells were also stained with Hoechst 33258 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) in some experiments. Cells were covered with a drop of GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda, Hayward, CA) for observation.</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging</title><p>Cells were observed with a DeltaVision RT system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) that was attached to an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope fitted with an IX-HLSH100 CCD camera and 20Ã/0.75 UPlanSApo, 40Ã/1.35 UApo/340, 60Ã/1.42 PlanApo N, and 100Ã/1.40 UplanSApo objectives (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For observation of cellular morphology, images were acquired with the 20Ã objective lens without deconvolution. For observation of the intracellular localization of proteins, images were collected as stacks with 0.2-Î¼m increments in the <italic>z</italic>-axis with the 100Ã objective lens, and the stacked images were deconvoluted with a constrained iterative algorithm provided with SoftWoRx (Applied Precision). For time-lapse imaging, cells were maintained at 37Â°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a chamber. Images were obtained at 8-min intervals from 16 to 24 h after transfection.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitation of protrusion formation</title><p>For evaluation of the effect of protein overexpression or depletion on the formation of cell protrusions, 40 nonoverlapping images (each 1024 Ã 1024) were collected with the 20Ã objective lens from each sample of HeLa cells that had been cultured for 20 or 48 h after transfection and then fixed and immunostained. The cells with processes whose length was greater than the longest diameter of the nucleus were counted, and the ratio of the number of these cells to the total number of cells overexpressing protrudin or KIF5A (or EGFP) was determined.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAi</title><p>DNA fragments encoding stem loopâtype shRNAs specific for human protrudin mRNA (5â²-GCTGAGGTGAAGAGCTTCTTG-3â²), human KIF5B mRNA (5â²-GCAGTCAGGTCAAAGAATATG-3â²), or EGFP mRNA (5â²-GCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATC-3â²) were synthesized, attached to the U6 promoter, and subcloned into the pBluescriptII SK(+) vector (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA). The vectors were introduced by transfection into HeLa cells, and the knockdown efficiency was assessed after 2 d by reverse transcription (RT) and real-time PCR analysis with cells expressing the EGFP shRNA as a control. Stealth siRNAs designed for human Rab11a (5â²-AAACCAAUAAGGCACCUACAGCUCC-3â²) or Rab11b (5â²-UACGUUAGUGGAAUCCAAGGCUGAG-3â²), or negative control duplexes (Invitrogen), were introduced into HeLa cells by reverse transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen), and the knockdown efficiency was assessed after 2 d by RT and real-time PCR analysis and after 3 d by IB, with cells transfected with the negative control duplexes as a control.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA (1 Î¼g) isolated from cultured cells with the use of Isogen (Wako) was subjected to RT with a Quantitect kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR with Taq polymerase (Takara) or to real-time PCR, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Yada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The amount of each target mRNA was normalized by the corresponding amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Primers for PCR were as follows (forward and reverse, respectively): 5â²-ACACGAGAAGAGCACCAAGC-3â² and 5â²-GACTGCTCATGTCGCTCGTA-3â² for human KIF5A; 5â²-CACAACCTGCGCAAACTCT-3â² and 5â²-TCCGGTGTCATCAGAATCAA-3â² for human KIF5B; 5â²-CAGCATCTGGAGATGGAGCTA-3â² and 5â²-TTCATCCTCAGGCACAGCTT-3â² for human KIF5C; and 5â²-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3â² and 5â²-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3â² for human GAPDH.
