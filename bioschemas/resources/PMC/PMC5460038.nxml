      <abstract>
        <p>Autophagy is controlled by AMPK and mTOR, both of which associate with ULK1 and control the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a prerequisite for autophagosome formation. Here we report that WIPI3 and WIPI4 scaffold the signal control of autophagy upstream of PtdIns3P production and have a role in the PtdIns3P effector function of WIPI1-WIPI2 at nascent autophagosomes. In response to LKB1-mediated AMPK stimulation, WIPI4-ATG2 is released from a WIPI4-ATG2/AMPK-ULK1 complex and translocates to nascent autophagosomes, controlling their size, to which WIPI3, in complex with FIP200, also contributes. Upstream, WIPI3 associates with AMPK-activated TSC complex at lysosomes, regulating mTOR. Our WIPI interactome analysis reveals the scaffold functions of WIPI proteins interconnecting autophagy signal control and autophagosome formation. Our functional kinase screen uncovers a novel regulatory link between LKB1-mediated AMPK stimulation that produces a direct signal via WIPI4, and we show that the AMPK-related kinases NUAK2 and BRSK2 regulate autophagy through WIPI4.</p>

    <p>Autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> is regulated by AMPK and TORC1, which activate catabolic and anabolic pathways, respectively, and interact to control metabolism and maintain energy homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the presence of amino acids and growth factors, TORC1 becomes activated at the lysosomal surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Activated TORC1 inhibits autophagy through the site-specific phosphorylation of the autophagy initiator protein kinase ULK1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). TORC1-mediated autophagy inhibition is released in the absence of amino acids and is achieved through the action of the TORC1 inhibitor complex TSC1âTSC2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), which provokes the displacement of TORC1 from lysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. TSC complex activation is regulated through LKB1-mediated AMPK activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, which phosphorylates TSC2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In addition, AMPK activates ULK1 through direct phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and in turn, ULK1 phosphorylates components of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase class III (PI3KC3) complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, allowing phosphatidylinositol 3-phoshpate (PtdIns3P) production, a prerequisite for autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
    <p>In humans, the PtdIns3P effector function in autophagy is attributed to the four WIPI proteins, representing the human group of proteins within the PROPPIN protein family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. WIPI2 functions as a PtdIns3P effector<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, bridging PtdIns3P production with the recruitment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> of the ATG16L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> complex for LC3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) lipidation and subsequent autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. WIPI1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) is considered to function upstream<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and WIPI4 downstream of LC3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>); however, their functions are unknown, and WIPI3 is uncharacterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
    <p>Despite the notion that glucose starvation induces autophagy through AMPK-mediated ULK1 phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, which acts upstream of WIPI1 and WIPI2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), neither WIPI1 nor WIPI2 respond to glucose starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Here, we demonstrate that glucose starvation signals via the LKB1-AMPK network to WIPI4 in complex with ATG2, which in response contributes to the regulation of autophagosome formation. WIPI3 is also under the control of AMPK as it associates with activated TSC complex in controlling mTOR activity in the lysosomal compartment. Hence, both WIPI4 and WIPI3 function upstream of PtdIns3P production but also downstream of WIPI1-WIPI2 in controlling the size of nascent autophagosomes, with WIPI4 acting in association with ATG2 and WIPI3 in association with FIP200. Our study, a combined protein interactome and kinome screening approach, reveals that the four human WIPI proteins function as a scaffold circuit, interconnecting autophagy signal control with autophagosome formation.</p>

        <title>WIPI3 and WIPI4 bind PtdIns3P at nascent autophagosomes</title>
        <p>With regard to the reported features of WIPI1 and WIPI2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), we assessed WIPI3 and WIPI4 by comparative<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> structural modelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), phospholipid-protein overlay assessments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and subcellular localization using fluorescence-based confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1bâf</xref>). Structural homology modelling using HHpred<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> revealed that all WIPI members fold into seven-bladed Î²-propellers with an open Velcro topology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Of note, we used a new WIPI3 sequence in the current study, as our original WIPI3 cloning isolate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> proved to represent an N-terminal-truncated version (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1aâc,h</xref>).</p>
        <p>As reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, the binding of WIPI1 and WIPI2 to PtdIns3P at nascent autophagosomes is demonstrated by the appearance of subcellular fluorescent puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, right panels, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). The number of cells displaying GFP-WIPI1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) and GFP-WIPI2B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> puncta significantly increased upon starvation and decreased upon PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and GFP-WIPI1 and GFP-WIPI2B puncta co-localized with myc-ATG14 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), myc-DFCP1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), ATG12 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), LC3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and p62 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). The numbers of GFP-WIPI1- and GFP-WIPI2B-puncta-positive cells further increased in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), in line with a previous report on the localization of WIPI1 and WIPI2 at autophagosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p>
        <p>GFP-WIPI3 and GFP-WIPI4 puncta were smaller in size and less complex than GFP-WIPI1 and GFP-WIPI2B puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, right panels, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 3 and 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). The number of GFP-WIPI3-puncta-positive cells significantly increased upon starvation and bafilomycin A1 administration and decreased upon PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The appearance of endogenous WIPI3 puncta upon starvation was also apparent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). In the following, we employed GFP-tagged WIPI3, as proper folding was confirmed through specific binding to PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1bâd</xref>).</p>
        <p>The number of GFP-WIPI4-puncta-positive cells increased upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), but this increase was not abolished via PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>). Endogenous WIPI4 puncta were already prominent in fed conditions, and they were significantly increased upon starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>). Both GFP-WIPI3 and GFP-WIPI4 were clearly localized at nascent autophagosomes, as indicated by their co-localization with the markers used (myc-ATG14, myc-DFCP1, ATG12, LC3 and p62) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). However, the co-localization of GFP-WIPI4 with myc-ATG14, myc-DFCP1 and endogenous ATG12 was less prominent than that of other WIPI members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Based on these findings, all WIPI proteins appear to co-localize at nascent autophagosomes. Indeed, the co-localization of endogenous WIPI2, WIPI4 and GFP-WIPI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>) and GFP-WIPI3 with endogenous WIPI4, myc-WIPI1 and myc-WIPI2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>) was apparent.</p>
        <p>In summary, all four WIPI members fold into seven-bladed Î²-propeller proteins that bind PtdIns3P and localize at nascent autophagosomes upon starvation.</p>

        <title>Autophagosome formation requires WIPI3 and WIPI4</title>
        <p>Using the human melanoma cell line G361, which expresses detectable levels of all endogenous WIPI members, we generated stable WIPI knockdown (KD) cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) and scored cells for autophagosomes by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2bâf</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Compared with the control cell line (shControl, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), WIPI1 KD cells did produce autophagosomes upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, panel shWIPI1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>), although we observed a 2.65-fold reduced presence of autophagosomal structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In line with this finding, autophagic flux<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> assessments by LC3 lipidation analysis was previously reported to be negatively affected in WIPI1 KD cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Additionally, we here found that starvation-induced degradation of long-lived proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> was significantly reduced in WIPI1 KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). EM of WIPI2 KD revealed that proper autophagosome formation was negatively affected as inferred from a 4.93-fold accumulation of rough endoplasmic reticulum tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, panel shWIPI2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>), prominently marking an early blockade of autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> before phagophore formation (template membranes from which autophagosomes emerge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In line with this finding, the appearance of autophagosomal structures decreased by 2.94-fold when compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Moreover, in WIPI2 KD cells, the number of GFP-LC3 puncta was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), corroborating the previous finding that WIPI2 is required for LC3 lipidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The above results confirm that both WIPI1 and WIPI2 function upstream of LC3, as previously suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In addition, the results underline the conception that WIPI2 is required for autophagosome formation, whereas WIPI1 is dispensable to a certain degree.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, both WIPI3 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, panel shWIPI3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>) and WIPI4 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, panel shWIPI4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>) resulted in the appearance of cup-shaped double-membrane structures resembling elongated phagophore formation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In both, WIPI3 KD and WIPI4 KD cells the formation of autophagosomal structures decreased, respectively, by 6.42- and 3.47-fold when compared with shControl cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). In addition, rough endoplasmic reticulum tubular structures accumulated in the absence of WIPI4, as was observed in WIPI2 KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). These data suggest that both WIPI3 KD and WIPI4 KD blocked autophagosome formation downstream of WIPI2. As WIPI2 recruits the ATG16L complex for LC3 lipidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we anticipated that lipidated LC3 would accumulate in the absence of WIPI3 or WIPI4, which was indeed the case when we looked for GFP-LC3 puncta using automated high-throughput imaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In line with this observation, we also found that endogenous WIPI2 puncta accumulated in WIPI3 KD and WIPI4 KD cells due to the downstream blockade of LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Moreover, by western blotting we observed a significant increase in basal levels of lipidated (LC3-II) and unlipidated LC3 (LC3-I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>). Upon amino-acid starvation, however, LC3 levels did not significantly change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>), indicating a layer of redundancy between the different WIPI proteins.</p>
        <p>Of additional note, EM observation of WIPI KD in the G361 melanoma cell line showed that WIPI1 and WIPI2 KD cells were filled with melanosomes that were not detected in control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2i</xref>). The appearance of melanosomes upon ULK1 and WIPI1 silencing has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Altogether with our observation, this suggests that autophagosome and melanosome formation may be co-regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.</p>

        <title>WIPI Î²-propellers are distinct protein interaction platforms</title>
        <p>With regard to the co-localization of all WIPI members at nascent autophagosomes upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>), we examined whether WIPI members also associated through proteinâprotein interactions. Indeed, using GFP- and myc-tagged WIPI variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we found that WIPI1, WIPI2B, WIPI2D and WIPI4 were able to associate with each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Next, we established a WIPI protein interactome using mass spectrometry (MS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> upon the immunopurification of GFP-tagged WIPI1â4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). As a control, we employed GFP alone and excluded the signals from tag-associated proteins from the final results, along with those of proteins giving low peptide counts (see Methods section, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). The WIPI protein interactomes were generated using GeneMANIA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and interactions identified in this study (red lines) are incorporated with previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> and predicted interactions (grey lines).</p>
        <p>The proteomics analysis demonstrated that all four WIPI proteins associated in a distinct and non-redundant protein network. In addition, WIPI1, WIPI2 and WIPI4 share NudC as a common interaction partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We confirmed the specific binding of endogenous NudC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref> with WIPI1, WIPI2B and WIPI4. Consistent with our MS analysis, NudC did not co-purify with WIPI3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>We concentrated our follow-up investigations on ATG proteins and the known autophagy regulators appearing in our WIPI interactome network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In support of our WIPI interactome data, we confirmed the reported interaction between WIPI2 and the ATG16L complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4a</xref>). Moreover, we found that WIPI2 also interacts with WIPI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>), and we provide evidence that WIPI1 likely supports WIPI2 in ATG16L1 recruitment for LC3 lipidation at nascent autophagosomes. We show that GFP-WIPI1 associates with endogenous ATG16L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4a</xref>); however, as we found only a few peptide counts for ATG16L in our WIPI1 MS analysis and low amount of ATG16L copurifying with GFP-WIPI1 when compared with GFP-WIPI2B and GFP-WIPI2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), we suggest that the interaction between WIPI1 and ATG16L occurs indirectly via WIPI2, in line with previously reported suggestions. Nevertheless, the functional KD of not only WIPI2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) but also WIPI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) significantly reduced the number of ATG16L-puncta-positive cells. Moreover, WIPI1 depends on WIPI2 for proper localization to nascent autophagosomes, as demonstrated by the significantly decreased number of GFP-WIPI1 punctate structures in WIPI2 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). By contrast, WIPI1 KD had no effect on the number of WIPI2 punctate structures in fed and starved conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>), suggesting that WIPI2 is required for WIPI1 recruitment and that the presence of the WIPI1-WIPI2 heterodimer may function more efficiently in ATG16L complex recruitment. Moreover, we found that both WIPI1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) and WIPI2 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>) significantly reduced the number of GFP-WIPI4 punctate structures in fed and starved conditions, supporting the idea that WIPI1 and WIPI2 function upstream of WIPI4 during autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
        <p>In support of a role for WIPI3 and WIPI4 downstream of LC3 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2dâf</xref>), ATG16L puncta accumulated in WIPI3 KD and WIPI4 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Supporting a role for WIPI1-WIPI2 upstream of LC3, both GFP-WIPI1- and GFP-WIPI2B-puncta-positive cells were significantly increased in ATG5 KO conditions due to a blockade of LC3 lipidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h,i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 5â8</xref>). This effect was not observed when GFP-WIPI3- and GFP-WIPI4-puncta-positive cells were quantified in ATG5 KO conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>).</p>

        <title>WIPI3 associates with the TSC complex and FIP200</title>
        <p>Our WIPI3 protein interactome analysis revealed that WIPI3 likely connects to the autophagic machinery through associations with the obligatory hetero-dimer TSC1-TSC2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and with FIP200 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The specific interaction between WIPI3 and the TSC complex was demonstrated by immunopurification of both endogenous TSC1 and TSC2 with GFP-WIPI3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The findings of this analysis further revealed that GFP-WIPI3 interacts with TSC2 phosphorylated at serine 1,387 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), an AMPK-specific phosphorylation site required for TSC-mediated TORC1 inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The interaction between the TSC complex and endogenous WIPI3, but not WIPI1, WIPI2 or WIPI4 has also been confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and, as anticipated, is independent of ATG5 as shown by using GFP-WIPI3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted from ATG5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Moreover, we observed that the association of GFP-WIPI3 with the endogenous TSC complex appeared to be more abundant in starved (S) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Furthermore, the association between GFP-WIPI3 and the TSC complex was not dependent on PtdIns3P production because the complex formed despite the addition of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to the starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Of note, a greater degree of complex formation was again apparent in starved cells (S, 15â²â3âh) than in fed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Furthermore, we overexpressed full-length TSC1 (TSC-FL), a TSC1 fragment corresponding to the middle part of the protein (TSC1-M), which has previously been shown to interact with FIP200 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>), or a C-terminal fragment of TSC1 (TSC1-C), and found that GFP-WIPI3 clearly co-immunoprecipitated with TSC1-M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because the active TSC complex localizes to lysosomes for TORC1 inhibition, we enriched lysosomes and found that GFP-WIPI3 co-fractionated with endogenous TSC2 and LAMP2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>), marking lysosomes/late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). This result was confirmed by confocal LSM, which showed that GFP-WIPI3 co-localized with endogenous TSC2 and LAMP2 in starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). In addition, WIPI3 also localized at nascent autophagosomes upon starvation (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1dâf</xref>), and co-localizing GFP-WIPI3 and endogenous WIPI2 puncta were negative for LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). In fed cells GFP-WIPI3 also co-localized with LAMP2, however, this co-localization was more apparent upon lysosomal inhibition by bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>, upper panel) and was sensitive to PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>, lower panel). TSC2 KD significantly reduced the number of GFP-WIPI3- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i</xref>), GFP-WIPI1- and GFP-LC3-puncta-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). As the TSC complex displaces mTOR from the lysosomal surface for TORC1 inhibition, we anticipated that WIPI3 would not localize to LAMP2-positive lysosomes/late endosomes upon TORC1 stimulation, as indicated by site-specific ULK phosphorylation (S757 in mice and S758 in humans), mTOR autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5j</xref>) and lysosomal positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). Indeed, upon TORC1 stimulation, GFP-WIPI3 was not detected at lysosomes (LAMP2-positive lysosomes/late endosomes) positive for endogenous mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). These data suggest that WIPI3 functions in association with the TSC complex to regulate mTOR activity in the lysosomal compartment.</p>
        <p>To further examine the possibility of an additional function of WIPI3 at nascent autophagosomes, we also assessed the WIPI3-FIP200 interaction identified in the MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). GFP-WIPI3 clearly associated with endogenous FIP200 in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Upon starvation, GFP-WIPI3 strongly co-localized with endogenous FIP200, myc-tagged WIPI2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>) and endogenous p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). FIP200 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>) significantly reduced the number of GFP-WIPI3-puncta-positive cells present upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>) and reduced the number of GFP-WIPI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>) and GFP-LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>) puncta.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as FIP200 has also been reported to have additional functions and to interact with TSC1, we examined whether WIPI3 was found together with FIP200 in the lysosomal compartment. Indeed, GFP-WIPI3 co-localized with endogenous FIP200 and LAMP2-positive lysosomes/late endosomes upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>, upper panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>), which was abolished upon amino acid-induced TORC1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>, lower panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). These data argue that WIPI3 interacts with FIP200 at nascent autophagosomes and at LAMP2-positive lysosomes/late endosomes.</p>

        <title>The WIPI4 complex contains ATG2, AMPK and ULK1</title>
        <p>WIPI4 is considered to function, together with ATG2, downstream of LC3 at nascent autophagosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Our MS analysis of WIPI4 protein interaction partners highlighted an association between WIPI4 and ATG2 (ATG2A, ATG2B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), which we confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). By mutating individual amino acids in WIPI4 that are conserved in human WIPI proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) we identified two critical residues in WIPI4, N15 and D17, that confer ATG2A binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). A phospholipid-binding mutant of WIPI4 (WIPI4-R232A/R233A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>) was able to bind to ATG2A, in line with the previous suggestion that the phospholipid-binding site in all WIPI proteins is positioned on one side of the Î²-propeller, whereas the capacity for specific proteinâprotein interactions is conferred by homologous residues on the opposite site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
        <p>Next, we silenced WIPI4 and ATG2 and found that their combined KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>) and the KD of ATG2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>) provoked massive accumulations of WIPI1-positive membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Using automated high-throughput image analysis, we verified this result, as the size and number of both GFP-WIPI1 and GFP-LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>) punctate structures significantly increased upon ATG2 KD. This observation suggests that the WIPI4-ATG2 complex at nascent autophagosomes is required for controlling their size downstream of the effects of LC3, which is in line with the appearance of cup-shaped double-membrane structures resembling elongated phagophore formation sites upon WIPI4 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and the reduced number of GFP-WIPI4-puncta-positive cells upon WIPI1 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) and WIPI2 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our MS analysis of WIPI4-interacting proteins further revealed that AMPK likely interacts with WIPI4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), which we assessed using GFP-WIPI4, and GFP-WIPI2B as well as GFP alone as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). In fed conditions, we detected endogenous AMPK in the WIPI4-ATG2A immunoprecipitate, but we found less in starved conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>). Moreover, the WIPI4-ATG2A complex also contained endogenous ULK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>), which we did not identify in the MS analysis but which is known to interact with AMPK and to be used as an AMPK substrate upon starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. By overexpressing HA-tagged ULK1, we confirmed the association between GFP-WIPI4 and HA-ULK1 in fed conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). These results demonstrate that WIPI4-ATG2A interacts with AMPK-ULK1 in fed conditions but less upon AMPK activation. Using the pharmacological compound AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide), which specifically activates AMPK, the interaction of WIPI4-ATG2A and AMPK-ULK1 was further reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>), which is underlined by quantifying the abundance of co-immunoprecipitated AMPK with GFP-WIPI4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7i</xref>). As AMPK is activated upon glucose starvation, we deprived cells of glucose, either alone or in combination with glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7j</xref>). In line with the results presented above, we detected AMPK in complex with WIPI4-ATG2A in fed conditions but reduced upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7j</xref>). Using overexpressed AMPK subunits Î±1-Î³1, the association between WIPI4 and AMPK was further confirmed in fed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>).</p>

        <title>WIPI4 is stimulated by AMPK, NUAK2 and BRSK2</title>
        <p>To address the functional relevance of AMPK in the control of WIPI proteins, we screened a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, individually targeting all human protein kinases, and identified the regulatory AMPKÎ³ subunit and two AMPK-related protein kinases, NUAK2 and BRSK2, that together with AMPK, are functionally and physically regulated as a network through LKB1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>; see Methods section for details). Based on this result, we knocked down AMPKÎ±1/2, AMPKÎ³1, NUAK2 and BRSK2 or their upstream kinase, LKB1, using transient short interfering RNA (siRNA) transfections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>) in the following experiments. Strikingly, we found a significantly reduced number of GFP-WIPI4-puncta-positive cells upon amino-acid starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>). This result suggests that LKB1/AMPK signalling upon amino-acid starvation is, in addition to its reported effects leading to TORC1 inhibition and ULK1 stimulation, also directed towards WIPI4-ATG2, which we identified to be associated with AMPK-ULK1 in fed but less in starved conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). In line with this observation, we found that glucose and glucose plus glutamine starvation, which activated AMPK as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>), provoked a significant increase in GFP-WIPI4 punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>), which was not the case when GFP-WIPI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>) punctate structures were assessed by automated imaging, supporting the findings of previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Further, using our panel of WIPI4 mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>) we found that WIPI4 D113A was impaired in binding to AMPK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). Employing the GFP-WIPI4 D113A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g,h</xref>), we found that this mutant did not respond to glucose starvation with an increase in the formation of punctate structures when compared with wild-type GFP-WIPI4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g</xref>). Moreover, whereas GFP-WIPI4-puncta-positive structures significantly decreased in AMPK KD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c,h</xref>), GFP-WIPI4 D113A punctate structures did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8h</xref>).</p>

      <p>The human WIPI2 Î²-propeller protein (WIPI2B and WIPI2D) functions as an essential PtdIns3P effector at nascent autophagosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; however, the contributions of the other WIPI proteins, WIPI1 and WIPI4, in autophagy remained obscure, and WIPI3 was entirely uncharacterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Here we provide evidence that all human WIPI proteins function as scaffold building units that interlink the control of autophagy with the formation of functional autophagosomes. We used a combined proteomics and kinome screening approach and identified the WIPI interactome and the associated regulatory protein kinases. Our study shows that WIPI proteins function as scaffolds with distinct associations to both critical regulators of autophagy and each other.</p>
      <p>We show that WIPI1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>) interacts with WIPI2 (WIPI2B and WIPI2D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and that it supports the PtdIns3P-effector function of WIPI2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) in autophagy, which is the recruitment of the ATG16L complex for LC3 lipidation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Although WIPI2 silencing more prominently interferes with autophagosome formation, fewer autophagosomes form and less proteolysis occurs in the absence of WIPI1, which is consistent with a supporting role of WIPI1 for WIPI2.</p>
      <p>At nascent autophagosomes, WIPI1-WIPI2 co-localizes with WIPI4 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), and in co-immunoprecipitation and proteomics analyses, we also found that WIPI1, WIPI2 and WIPI4 co-associate. In addition, WIPI1, WIPI2 and WIPI4 share NudC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref> as a novel partner protein. Moreover, we found that WIPI4 directly associates with ATG2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>) (via N15/D17) and that this complex also contains AMPK and ULK1 in fed conditions. Upon starvation and AMPK activation, WIPI4-ATG2 dissociates from AMPK and ULK1 and localizes at nascent autophagosomes, potentially supporting further autophagosome maturation. WIPI4, ATG2 or combined WIPI4/ATG2 silencing arrests autophagosome formation and increases the accumulation of early and intermediate structures, arguing for a role of WIPI4-ATG2 in controlling the extent of autophagosomal membrane formation. This function is initiated by LKB1-mediated AMPK activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>, demonstrating that AMPK controls not only PtdIns3P production via ULK1 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref> but also appropriate autophagosome formation via WIPI4-ATG2. The AMPK link with WIPI4-ATG2 is further supported by our finding that glucose starvation triggers an increase in WIPI4 localization at nascent autophagosomes, which others and we did not observe when analysing WIPI1 and WIPI2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). This finding is supported by the results of our kinome screening, which identified AMPK and the AMKP-related kinases NUAK2 and BRSK2, all of which function downstream of LKB1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>) and stimulate the localization of WIPI4 to nascent autophagosomes.</p>
      <p>LKB1-AMPK signalling further triggers the activation of TSC1-TSC2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), which inhibits mTOR activity at lysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Interestingly, analysis of the WIPI3 interactome revealed a specific interaction of WIPI3 with the TSC complex, and we demonstrated that WIPI3 binds to the TSC complex when TSC2 is phosphorylated at serine 1,387 (S1387), an AMPK target site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Moreover, we detected both WIPI3 and the TSC complex in the lysosomal compartment upon starvation but not when mTOR was activated. The region in TSC1 to which WIPI3 binds overlaps with the reported binding site for FIP200 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). In line with this finding, we also identified and verified a specific interaction between WIPI3 and FIP200, from which we suggest that WIPI3 functions as a scaffold between the TSC complex and FIP200. In support of this idea, we found that WIPI3 co-localizes with FIP200 in the lysosomal compartment, a reported localization of FIP200 with unknown consequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>. The data presented here suggest that WIPI3 in complex with TSC1-TSC2 and FIP200 co-regulates mTOR activity; in line with this hypothesis, WIPI3 was found to be absent from lysosomes when mTOR was present. Our results further emphasize that FIP200 performs numerous roles in autophagy, acting as part of the ULK1 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, together with WIPI3 and the TSC complex at lysosomes, and at nascent autophagosomes, where direct binding between FIP200 and ATG16L has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>. Upon starvation, WIPI3 also translocates to the nascent autophagosome, where it co-localizes with FIP200 and all other WIPI proteins and ATG members examined. WIPI3 deficiency arrests autophagosome formation, indicating that WIPI3 also has a role in the formation of functional autophagosomes.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our data reveal the WIPI interactome and suggest that the LKB1-AMPK regulatory network directly or indirectly regulates the scaffold functions of the four human WIPI proteins. Our work provides a framework for further studies concentrating in more detail on the various new aspects presented here.</p>
