      <abstract>
        <p>The protein PCM-1 localizes to cytoplasmic granules known as âcentriolar satellitesâ that are partly enriched around the centrosome. We inhibited PCM-1 function using a variety of approaches: microinjection of antibodies into cultured cells, overexpression of a PCM-1 deletion mutant, and specific depletion of PCM-1 by siRNA. All approaches led to reduced targeting of centrin, pericentrin, and ninein to the centrosome. Similar effects were seen upon inhibition of dynactin by dynamitin, and after prolonged treatment of cells with the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole. Inhibition or depletion of PCM-1 function further disrupted the radial organization of microtubules without affecting microtubule nucleation. Loss of microtubule organization was also observed after centrin or ninein depletion. Our data suggest that PCM-1âcontaining centriolar satellites are involved in the microtubule- and dynactin-dependent recruitment of proteins to the centrosome, of which centrin and ninein are required for interphase microtubule organization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Microtubule organization is essential for directional intracellular transport, for the modulation of cell morphology and locomotion, and for the formation of the spindle apparatus during cell division. With the exception of plants, most cells organize their microtubule network using specialized structures, such as the spindle pole body in yeast cells, the basal body of cilia and flagella in protozoan organisms, and the centrosome in animal cells. The centrosome consists of two centriolar cylinders surrounded by electron-dense pericentriolar material. The centriolar cylinders have diameters of â¼0.2 Î¼m and are each composed of nine triplets of short microtubules, arranged to form the wall of the cylinder. In addition to various tubulin isoforms (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">McKean et al., 2001</xref>), centrin, a member of a larger calcium-binding protein superfamily, has been found associated with the centrioles (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Paoletti et al., 1996</xref>). However, 95% of centrin in human cells is not bound to the centrioles, but fractionates with the cytoplasm or with nuclei in biochemical experiments (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Paoletti et al., 1996</xref>). A large variety of proteins is attached to the periphery of the centrioles as part of the pericentriolar material (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kalt and Schliwa, 1993</xref>). Some of the proteins in this matrix have been characterized in recent years (for review see <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Doxsey, 2001</xref>). The primary function of the pericentriolar material is to nucleate microtubules, which are radially arranged from the centrosomal surface or subsequently released and anchored in other places of the cell (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen, 1999</xref>). The initial step of microtubule nucleation is dependent on the function of 25S ring complexes of the protein Î³-tubulin and associated proteins (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). However, for stable anchoring of microtubules, another protein (ninein) is required (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bouckson-Castaing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Piel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2002</xref>). Ninein is also found at noncentrosomal sites in specialized cell types such as polarized epithelial cells that undergo a change from a radial microtubule organization into an arrangement of fibers from the apical to the basal pole (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bacallao et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen, 1999</xref>). To facilitate microtubule nucleation, it has been proposed that Î³-tubulin complexes are embedded in the pericentriolar material, in a lattice formed by pericentrin (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dictenberg et al., 1998</xref>). Pericentrin is a large protein of which two isoforms have been described: a 220-kD form (pericentrin A; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Doxsey et al., 1994</xref>), as well as a newly identified 350-kD form (pericentrin B; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2001</xref>). It is transported to the centrosome by the microtubule-dependent motor dynein, a process apparently mediated through direct binding of pericentrin to the dynein light intermediate chain (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Purohit et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tynan et al., 2000</xref>). Pericentrin has recently been found to bind to PCM-1, a 228-kD protein that localizes to small 70â100-nm granules in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2001</xref>). These granules can move along microtubules in a dynein-dependent way and often concentrate near the microtubule organizing center (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>). Detailed morphological analysis revealed that these PCM-1 containing granules are identical to structures previously described as âcentriolar satellitesâ (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>). Although centriolar satellites have been extensively studied by electron microscopy (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rattner, 1992</xref>), their function is so far unknown. In this paper, we test the potential role of their component protein PCM-1 in centrosome assembly and the organization of microtubule networks.</p>

        <title>Microinjection of antibodies against PCM-1 causes accumulation of centrin and pericentrin</title>
        <p>To examine the cellular function of the protein PCM-1, we raised antibodies in rabbits against a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein containing amino acids 1665â2024 of human PCM-1. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, these antibodies specifically recognized a 230-kD band in HeLa cell extract, characteristic of full-length PCM-1. Because the region of the PCM-1 fusion protein used for immunization is highly conserved among different vertebrate species (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>), our antibodies also cross reacted with PCM-1 from other animals, including <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. PCM-1 staining in HeLa cells displays a pattern of cytoplasmic granules that are partly enriched near the centrosome, but clearly distinct from the strong centrosomal staining of Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Although this is in agreement with data from <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al. (1999)</xref>, it contrasts with immunofluorescence data initially provided by <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al. (1994)</xref>, showing a concentrated staining of PCM-1 at the centrosome of CHO cells. Testing various cell lines, we found that the amount and localization of cytoplasmic granules varied between different cell types (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>Expression of a highly conserved homologue of full-length PCM-1 from chicken (66% identity, 75% homology to human PCM-1 over the entire length of the protein) that was tagged with GFP at the carboxy-terminal end gave the same pattern of cytoplasmic granules as seen in our immunofluorescence, therefore excluding a staining artifact of our antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). After centrosome duplication, we could see PCM-1 concentrating in two large foci, with the highest concentration as cells entered mitosis (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E with <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F). During metaphase, a fraction of PCM-1 granules concentrated at the spindle poles, but the majority of the protein was found dispersed in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> G). In telophase, PCM-1 could be seen enriched in two areas of each daughter cell: (1) distal from the cleavage site, in the area of the centrosomal microtubule organizing center, as well as (2) proximal to the cleavage site, in an area where the minus-ends of midbody microtubules terminate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> H).</p>
        <p>We used affinity-purified rabbit antibodies for microinjection into the cytoplasm of cultured <italic>Xenopus</italic> A6 cells. 24â48 h after microinjection, we found that PCM-1 granules were no longer detectable in 89% of the cells (<italic>n</italic> = 88), using a mouse antibody against PCM-1 for immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Instead, only a weak staining in the centrosomal area remained. This could mean that the PCM-1 epitopes were masked by the microinjected antibody, and therefore, no longer detectable by immunofluorescence, or that the PCM-1 granules were dispersed upon microinjection. No apparent morphological defect was seen in injected cells, but when examining the distribution of other proteins, we observed large cytoplasmic aggregates of the centrosomal protein centrin, in addition to centrosome staining, in 67% of the cells (<italic>n</italic> = 284; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, DâF). In 10% of the injected cells, these aggregates had acquired a filamentous or ribbonlike structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Further, there was a weak effect on pericentrin, with 17% of cells (<italic>n</italic> = 283) exhibiting small pericentriolar aggregates in addition to centrosome staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> H). By contrast, the localization of Î³-tubulin was not significantly affected by microinjection of PCM-1 antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> J). Microinjection of control antibodies had no significant effect on the localization of centrosomal proteins or PCM-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A, C, G, and I</xref>).</p>

        <title>Overexpression of a PCM-1 deletion mutant causes aggregation of a subset of centrosomal proteins</title>
        <p>Our microinjection data suggest that antibodies against PCM-1 can affect the intracellular distribution of centrosome components such as centrin and pericentrin. To examine the role of PCM-1 in centrosomal protein targeting using a different approach, we generated a set of PCM-1 deletion mutants lacking various parts of their carboxy-terminal end. Whereas full-length PCM-1 (aa 1â1904) localized to small cytoplasmic granules characteristic of endogenous PCM-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D), mutants comprising amino acids 1â1468 or 1â1148 formed large cytoplasmic protein aggregates of various sizes, up to ten times the size of normal PCM-1 granules. When overexpressing these mutants, we found that all endogenous PCM-1 was segregated to these protein aggregates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). We were able to distinguish between the mutant and the endogenous form of PCM-1 using an antibody raised against the carboxy terminus, present only in the endogenous full-length PCM-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D), and a species-specific antibody raised against amino acids 1â114 of the chicken homologue of PCM-1, from which the mutant expression construct was derived (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). Overexpression of mutant PCM-1 also affected the correct localization of centrosomal proteins; the majority of centrin accumulated at the same large cytoplasmic aggregates that contained PCM-1 and the deletion mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>; detected in 96% of the transfected cells [<italic>n</italic> = 200]).</p>

        <p>These large protein aggregates also segregated significant amounts of pericentrin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>; 93% of overexpressing cells [<italic>n</italic> = 401]). In addition to centrin and pericentrin, the localization of the centrosomal protein ninein was also affected; whereas ninein localizes to the pericentriolar material in control cells, overexpression of mutant PCM-1 led to dispersion into multiple small foci of ninein in the cytoplasm in 90% of cells (<italic>n</italic> = 249; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, K and L</xref>), which partly colocalized with the large PCM-1 protein aggregates. The localization of Î³-tubulin, on the other hand, was not significantly altered by mutant PCM-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I and J</xref>). Next, we tested whether any of the protein aggregates induced by the PCM-1 deletion mutant 1â1468 represented newly replicated centrosomes. Therefore, we stained cells with an antibody against acetylated tubulin, a marker that labels stable microtubules, including those that form the 9 Ã 3 filaments of the centriolar cylinders. We found that cells expressing mutant PCM-1 stained for acetylated tubulin indistinguishably from controls; generally, acetylated tubulin was enriched at a double-dot representing one pair of centrioles, and at cytoplasmic fibers representing stable microtubules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, M and N</xref>). However, the large protein aggregates of mutant PCM-1 did not show any enriched staining of acetylated tubulin, indicating that no new centrioles, and therefore no additional centrosomes, had been formed in these cells. Overexpression of a control protein, Î²-galactosidase, had no effect on PCM-1 or the centrosome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>).</p>

        <title>RNA silencing of PCM-1 leads to reduced assembly of centrin, pericentrin, and ninein at the centrosome</title>
        <p>Because antibody microinjections and overexpression of PCM-1 mutants could have dominant secondary effects on other proteins in the cell by steric hindrance or by segregation of interacting components, we tested the role of PCM-1 in an approach based on depletion rather than inhibition of this protein. A recently published technique using transfection of double-stranded RNA oligomers of 21 base pairs has demonstrated that depletion of specific mRNAs is possible (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Elbashir et al., 2001</xref>). Using oligomer pairs from two different regions of human PCM-1, as well as control oligomers (see Materials and methods), we reached transfection levels of 95% (<italic>n</italic> = 522; as judged using labeled control oligomers) and were able to remove 34% (siRNA PCM-1.1) or 82% (siRNA PCM-1.2) of the original amounts of PCM-1 in cultures of HeLa cells, U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cells, and C2C4 mouse myoblasts.</p>
        <p>We proceeded with the RNA oligomer pair PCM-1.2 that had the strongest effect on PCM-1 depletion, corresponding to nucleotides 1464â1484 in human PCM-1 cDNA. Efficient depletion of PCM-1 was observed at time points longer than 90 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> K), which required prolonged culturing and retransfection with siRNA at 48 h. This may reflect a slow turnover rate of PCM-1 in the cells. When analyzing individual cells, we found that PCM-1 depletion removed centriolar satellite staining almost completely, with a few PCM-1 granules occasionally remaining near the centrosome or in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B, D, F, H, and J</xref>). Photometric analysis of PCM-1 fluorescence revealed that the depletion levels in individual cells ranged from 69 to 99%, with an average depletion of 89% of PCM-1 protein. As a consequence of PCM-1 depletion, we again saw an effect on the assembly of centrin, pericentrin, and ninein, but no significant effect on Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, AâH). In all cell types examined, we found that the amounts of centrin, pericentrin, and ninein at the centrosome were significantly reduced after PCM-1 depletion. We quantified the fluorescence intensity of these proteins in the centrosomal region of U-2 OS cells (see Materials and methods), and determined that only 39% of centrin, 36% of pericentrin, and 38% of ninein remained localized at the centrosome as compared with control cells. In contrast, the levels of Î³-tubulin remained largely constant (99%). Because previous work has indicated an interaction between PCM-1 and dynactin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1999</xref>), we also measured the centrosomal levels of the dynactin component p150/glued, which remained largely unaffected after PCM-1 depletion (82%; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, I and J</xref>).

        <title>PCM-1 and centrosomal proteins colocalize in a subset of centriolar satellites</title>
        <p>Because antibody microinjection experiments, mutant overexpression experiments, and RNA silencing experiments consistently showed a dependence of centrin assembly on PCM-1, we wanted to test directly for an interaction between PCM-1 and centrin using biochemical methods. Therefore, we used glutathione-Sepharose beads on HeLa cell extract or <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract, preincubated with GST-tagged centrin isoform 3. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A, centrin-3 loaded beads, but not control beads, were able to copellet PCM-1 from both extracts, indicating that PCM-1 and centrin can bind to each other. Because previous reports have shown centrin localizing to electron-dense cytoplasmic granules during ciliogenesis and to dynamic pericentriolar spots in PtK<sub>2</sub> cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 1994</xref>), we examined whether PCM-1 colocalized with centrin in these cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B, â¼79% of cytoplasmic granules of centrin-3 colocalized with PCM-1 (<italic>n</italic> = 518).

        <title>Centrin, pericentrin, and ninein require PCM-1, dynactin, and microtubules for centrosomal localization</title>
        <p>Together, our findings suggest that assembly of specific pericentriolar components depends on PCM-1. Because <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al. (1999)</xref> have reported shuttling of PCM-1 granules in and out of the centrosome in a dynein-dependent manner, and because other reports provided evidence for pericentrin and PCM-1 transport dependent on microtubules and dyneinâdynactin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Purohit et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tynan et al., 2000</xref>), we wanted to examine whether prolonged treatment of cells with microtubule-destabilizing drugs would have similar effects on the localization of centrosomal proteins as PCM-1 inhibition. When CHO cells were treated with 17 Î¼M nocodazole for 2 h, leading to complete depolymerization of microtubules, we observed large protein aggregates in the cytoplasm that contained PCM-1 together with centrin, pericentrin, ninein, and also the motor protein dynein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, AâF, I, and J), but not Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, G and H</xref>). Interestingly, a fraction of dynein also colocalized with PCM-1 granules in untreated cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, K and L</xref>, arrows). We then addressed the question whether assembly of these centrosomal proteins could be directly inhibited by destabilizing the dynein activating complex of dynactin. For this purpose, we microinjected CHO cells with purified p50/dynamitin, a dynactin subunit that sequesters other dynactin components and leads to dynactin disassembly when added in excess (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al., 1999</xref>). We noticed that dynamitin led to the dispersion of most PCM-1 in injected cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, M and N</xref>), and caused similar defects in centrosomal protein assembly as observed with PCM-1 inhibition or depletion; centrin, pericentrin, and ninein were dispersed or formed small cytoplasmic aggregates, whereas Î³-tubulin localization was unaffected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, OâX).</p>

        <title>Organization of a radial microtubule network depends on PCM-1</title>
        <p>In a final set of experiments, we wanted to test whether the inhibition of PCM-1 had an effect on centrosome function, such as microtubule nucleation or organization of a radial microtubule network. In these experiments, we used Cos-7, U-2 OS, and PtK<sub>2</sub> cells, all of which contain a well focused microtubule network, radiating from a single microtubule-organizing center at the centrosome (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Meyer, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al., 1999</xref>). Transfection of PCM-1 deletion construct 1â1468 disrupted this microtubule organization, with most microtubules now randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). To test whether this is due to a lack of microtubule nucleation at the centrosome, we performed a microtubule regrowth assay. Transfected cells were treated for 40 min with 25 Î¼M nocodazole on ice, to depolymerize all microtubules (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, E and F</xref>), after which time the drug was washed out to allow regrowth of microtubules at 37Â°C. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> (G and H), both untreated control cells as well as cells overexpressing mutant PCM-1 showed initial growth of small centrosomal microtubule asters. Within 15 min, however, the radial microtubule organization in mutant expressing cells was lost, and the microtubules became randomly distributed in the cytoplasm, as compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, IâK). This indicates that although centrosomal microtubule nucleation was not affected by inhibition of PCM-1, the ability of the centrosomes to anchor microtubules was disturbed. No microtubules were seen nucleated or anchored at the protein aggregates formed by mutant PCM-1, suggesting that proteins segregated to these structures were not competent to nucleate or anchor microtubules by themselves.</p>

        <title>Depletion of PCM-1, centrin, or ninein inhibits anchorage of microtubules to the centrosome</title>
        <p>Then, we tested whether removal of PCM-1 had the same effect on radial microtubule organization as overexpression of mutant PCM-1. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> (A and B), PCM-1 depletion from U-2 OS cells by siRNA induced loss of centrosomal microtubule anchorage, leaving only 34% of the cells with a radial microtubule network (<italic>n</italic> =1,001, controls 74%, <italic>n</italic> =1,001). Similar results were obtained in mouse C2C4 myoblasts (unpublished data). Because we described earlier in this paper that removal of PCM-1 affected the localization of centrin, ninein, and pericentrin to the centrosome, we examined whether loss of microtubule anchorage was mediated by one or more of these proteins. For this purpose, we depleted centrin, ninein, or pericentrin individually, using specific siRNA oligomers. Protein levels were reduced to 23 (centrin), 29 (ninein), or 20% (pericentrin) of control levels, as measured by quantitative immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> K) or photometric analysis (available antibodies against pericentrin were unable to recognize the denatured protein by immunoblotting). Reduction of centrin-3 and ninein levels similarly affected microtubule organization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, CâF), with only 18 (<italic>n</italic> = 1,001) and 31% (<italic>n</italic> = 934) of cells, respectively, exhibiting a radial network. In contrast, pericentrin depletion had no significant effect on microtubule organization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, G and H</xref>). Radial microtubules were seen in 77% of the cells (<italic>n</italic> = 833), approximately at the same level as in control cells (74%). However, we noticed that removal of pericentrin resulted in a reduced density of microtubules emanating from the centrosome (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> H).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Microtubule nucleation and anchoring of the microtubule filament network are two functions associated with the centrosome. Our present work has directly shown that these two functions can be separated, and that microtubule anchoring is dependent on the protein PCM-1. Most interestingly, PCM-1 itself is not a classical component of the centrosome, but instead localizes to electron-dense protein granules in the cytoplasm. Because these were most easily recognized in electron micrographs near the centrosome, they were termed centriolar satellites (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rattner, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>). This raises the question of how a satellite component such as PCM-1 functions in anchoring microtubules to the centrosomal surface. Our data suggest that the role of PCM-1 in microtubule anchoring is an indirect one, most likely mediated through other proteins that assemble at the centrosome in a PCM-1âdependent manner. As shown in this paper, the correct assembly of a subset of centrosomal proteins, including centrin, pericentrin, and ninein, depends on PCM-1 function. Beyond this, we have demonstrated that PCM-1 binds to an isoform of the protein centrin. Supporting evidence was also provided by <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2001)</xref>, who reported that PCM-1 binds to pericentrin-B, and by <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al. (2002)</xref>, who noted changes in centrosome morphology after PCM-1 antibody injection into mouse oocytes.</p>
      <p>To understand the role of PCM-1, it is important to note that the distribution of centrin, pericentrin and PCM-1 is very dynamic (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2000</xref>) and dependent on the action of dyneinâdynactin motor complexes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Purohit et al., 1999</xref>). Intriguingly, small granules of GFP-tagged PCM-1 have been directly followed by video microscopy, shuttling along microtubules between the cytoplasm and the centrosome (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, a possible function of PCM-1 could be to mediate the transport of centrosome components from the cytoplasm to the centrosome, along microtubules. PCM-1 may serve as a carrier that associates with centrin, pericentrin, or ninein, and docks onto dyneinâdynactin. Consistent with this idea is our observation that depolymerization of microtubules, as well as dynactin inhibition, led to dispersion of centrosomal proteins and cytoplasmic protein aggregates that contain centrin, pericentrin and ninein, as well as dynein and PCM-1. Transport complexes would contain only a small proportion of cellular centrin, pericentrin, or ninein, explaining why most cell types do not show significant centriolar satellite staining of these proteins. Specific cell types such as PtK<sub>2</sub> or mouse myoblasts do exhibit recognizable cytoplasmic granules of these proteins, and we show that they colocalize with PCM-1. Centrin granules are very dynamic structures that can rapidly fuse with the pericentriolar material (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 1994</xref>), consistent with our transport model. A role of PCM-1 in facilitating transport of centrosomal proteins could be important for the duplication of centrosomes during the cell cycle, when new pericentriolar material is recruited to the centrosomal surface, and to increase the potential of centrosomes to organize microtubules into mitotic spindles. This would explain why PCM-1 staining before mitosis is particularly concentrated at the centrosomes, with fewer cytoplasmic granules visible than in interphase, and why the signal becomes again more dispersed in metaphase, after spindle poles have fully formed.</p>
      <p>Another explanation of our data could be that PCM-1 granules in the cytoplasm represent sites at which centrosomal proteins associate temporarily to undergo proper folding, or to assemble into complexes with other proteins. The two interpretations on PCM-1 function are not mutually exclusive. Several centrosomal proteins are not simply confined to the centrosome, but are also present in a large cytoplasmic pool (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Moudjou et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Paoletti et al., 1996</xref>). Cytoplasmic factors that support folding and assembly as well as factors that aid transport would contribute to a dynamic equilibrium between centrosome-bound and free protein (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baron et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
      <p>As shown in this paper, not all centrosomal proteins follow a PCM-1âdependent assembly pathway. In particular, we show that recruitment of Î³-tubulin to the centrosome is independent of PCM-1, and apparently of dyneinâdynactin-dependent transport. Our data are further consistent with previous reports by <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov and Rieder (1999)</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hannak et al. (2001)</xref>, as well as earlier biochemical studies by <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Klotz et al. (1990)</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Felix et al. (1994)</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Moritz et al. (1995)</xref>, and <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Schnackenberg et al. (1998)</xref>, that centrosomal targeting of Î³-tubulin and other potential microtubule nucleation factors is independent of microtubules. In contrast, work by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Young et al. (2000)</xref> clearly demonstrates a requirement for dynactin in Î³-tubulin assembly. These seemingly contradictory findings may be reconciled by the existence of different pools of Î³-tubulin at the centrosome with different rates of exchange with the cytoplasm, as shown by <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov and Rieder (1999)</xref>. If only the slowly exchanging pool of Î³-tubulin required dynactin function, for example, as a microtubule anchor rather than as a transporter, then effects on Î³-tubulin localization would only be observed after prolonged treatment of cells with dynactin inhibitors, as in the experiments of <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Young et al. (2000)</xref>, and not over the shorter time frame of a few hours in our experiments. There may also be differences in the dynamics of centrosomal components between different cell types and cell cycle stages, and these may explain the observation of dynactin-independent pericentrin assembly by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al. (1999)</xref>, in contrast to data from this study and <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Young et al. (2000)</xref>.</p>
      <p>Consistent with our finding of Î³-tubulin assembly independent of PCM-1, microtubule nucleation at the centrosome is not affected when PCM-1 is inhibited. Our data highlight the notion that microtubule nucleation and the organization of the microtubule network are distinct events. Earlier studies by <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Keating et al. (1997)</xref> provided direct evidence for microtubule release from the centrosome. In addition, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen et al. (2000)</xref> have shown that in polarized cell types, microtubules can be transferred after nucleation from the centrosome to apical regions of the cell. It has been suggested that a protein involved in microtubule anchorage at these sites is ninein, previously identified as a component of the pericentriolar material (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bouckson-Castaing et al., 1996</xref>). It has further been shown in a paper by <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Piel et al. (2000)</xref> that immature daughter centrioles, lacking ninein localization, are able to nucleate microtubules, but fail to anchor them. Here, we provide direct evidence for a role of ninein in microtubule anchorage to the centrosome by demonstrating that depletion of ninein causes loss of centrosomal microtubule organization. Our data further suggest that the effects of PCM-1 or centrin depletion on the microtubule network organization are mediated through ninein, because ninein levels at the centrosome decrease when PCM-1 or centrin are depleted.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the potential of the centrosome to anchor microtubules may depend on the correct assembly of a subset of proteins; PCM-1 may be involved in targeting centrin to the centrosome, where it would be necessary for the assembly of ninein, and thereby regulate microtubule anchorage. As discussed above, this targeting of microtubule-anchoring factors appears to be mediated by dyneinâdynactin-dependent transport, consistent with observations by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Meyer (1999)</xref>, who showed that dynactin inhibition interferes with microtubule organization at the centrosome. Pericentrin was also found to assemble at the centrosome in a PCM-1âdependent manner, but in contrast to ninein or centrin, its absence did not interfere with radial microtubule organization. Instead, the density of microtubules in the cell decreased after pericentrin depletion, indicating that pericentrin either stabilizes microtubules or aids microtubule nucleation, as suggested by <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dictenberg et al. (1998)</xref>, due to its close association with Î³-tubulin. Additional factors may be involved in the regulation of microtubule anchorage, such as the microtubule-severing protein katanin (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hartman et al., 1998</xref>), the dynactin component p150/glued (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Quintyne et al., 1999</xref>), or Cep 135 and MIR1, two recently identified novel centrosomal proteins (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Stein et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies of microtubule-anchoring proteins should provide valuable insights in the remodeling of the cytoskeleton during cell differentiation and morphogenesis.</p>

        <p>An EST clone containing the middle 3.5-kb fragment of the chicken homologue of PCM-1 was obtained from a Bursal EST collection then managed by Dr. Jean-Marie Buerstedde (University of Hamburg, Hamburg Germany; clone 4d19r1, GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AJ398048">AJ398048</ext-link> [now obtainable through RZPD]). Clones containing the 5â² and 3â² ends of PCM-1 were obtained by screening a DU249 Î»ZAP cDNA library (provided by S. Kandels-Lewis, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK) with hybridization probes derived from this EST, and the full-length cDNA (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AJ508717">AJ508717</ext-link>) assembled in the cloning vector pBluescript<sup>Â®</sup> in a series of cloning steps.</p>
        <p>A full-length PCM-1âGFP expression construct was then generated by modifying the cDNA insert at its 3â² end by PCR to remove the stop codon, and cloning it in frame into the multiple cloning site of pEGFP-N (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The deletion construct 1â1468, containing nucleotides 1â4423 after the start codon, was generated by PCR, and the GFP tag removed by cutting the vector with SmaI and NotI, blunting, and religating. A control vector for the expression of Î²-galactosidase was obtained from Dr. Adrian Bird (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh UK).</p>

        <title>Antibodies, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting</title>
        <p>The COOH terminus of human PCM-1 comprising nucleotides 4993â6095 after the start codon was amplified by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library (provided by S. Kandels-Lewis, University of Edinburgh, UK) using primers CTGAAAGACTGTGGAGAAGATC and GATGTCTTCAGAGGCTCATC, and cloned into the vector pGEM-T (Promega). The insert was then excised using PstI and NcoI and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pRSET-C (Invitrogen). Bacterial fusion protein was isolated using 8 M urea and purified over Nickel Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories) columns, concentrated, and dialyzed against PBS before injection into two rabbits.</p>
        <p>Affinity-purified antibody was obtained by passing serum over a column of the same antigen coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The same antigen was also used to raise pAbs in mice. Chicken-specific pAbs were further generated in mice against the amino terminus of the chicken PCM-1 protein. For this, nucleotides 1â342 after the start codon were amplified by PCR from the chicken cDNA using primers AAGGATCCATGGCAACAGGAGGCG and AGAATTCACTGATCCAGATCACTGAAGTT, and cloned directly into the bacterial expression vector pRSET-A. Bacterial fusion protein was then purified as described above and injected into mice.</p>
        <p>Mouse antibodies were raised against nucleotides 4002â6263 after the start codon of human pericentrin-B, a region common to both pericentrin-A and -B. This fragment was obtained by excision with BglII and NcoI from a partial cDNA clone provided by Dr. Harish Joshi (Emory University, Atlanta, GA), cloned into pRSET-C (Invitrogen), and expressed as above. All pAbs were used at a dilution of 1:100. Affinity-purified PCM-1 antibody was used at a concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml for both immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. mAbs against dynein intermediate chain, NuMA, and Î²-galactosidase were obtained from CHEMICON International, Calbiochem, and Promega, respectively. mAbs against Î³-tubulin and acetylated tubulin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Other antibodies were used as described previously; pAbs against Î³-tubulin were a gift from Dr. Rebecca Heald (University of California, Berkeley, CA; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Heald et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>mAb 20H5 against centrin (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sanders and Salisbury, 1994</xref>) was a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Salisbury (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Rabbit pAbs against centrin-3 (anti-HsCen3p; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Laoukili et al., 2000</xref>) and against ninein (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>) were gifts from Dr. Michel Bornens (Institut Curie, Paris, France). Rabbit antibody against pericentrin-B (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2001</xref>) was a gift from Dr. Harish Joshi (Emory University, Atlanta, GA), mouse antibody against human ninein (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2002</xref>) was a gift from Dr. Gordon Chan (Alberta Cancer Board, Canada), and mAb against Î²-tubulin was a gift from Dr. Don Cleveland (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, San Diego, CA). For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol at â20Â°C, and processed and imaged using conventional fluorescence microscopy as described previously (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>). Cos-7 and PtK<sub>2</sub> cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, to preserve microtubule integrity. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed according to standard protocols.</p>

        <title>siRNA experiments</title>
        <p>RNA oligomers containing 21 nucleotides were synthesized in sense and antisense directions corresponding to human PCM-1 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1994</xref>) at nucleotides 2190â2208 (GGGCUCUAAACGUGCCUCC; PCM-1.1) and 1465â1483 (UCAGCUUCGUGAUUCUCAG; PCM-1.2) with dTdT overhangs at each 3â² terminus, deprotected, and desalted (Xeragon). Oligomers against centrin-3 (UGAAGUUGUGACAGACUGG), pericentrin (recognizing both pericentrin-A and -B; GCAGCUGAGCUGAAGGAGA), and ninein (UAUGAGCAUUGAGGCAGAG) were prepared accordingly. All oligomers were identical to both human and mouse sequences, except for PCM-1.1, which was human-specific. For annealing of siRNAs, 20-Î¼M single strands were incubated in annealing buffer (100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 30 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) for 1 min at 90Â°C, followed by 1 h at 37Â°C (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Elbashir et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
        <p>Transfections were performed using Oligofectamineâ¢ (Invitrogen) with 3 Î¼g siRNA on HeLa, U-2 OS, or C2C4 cells grown overnight on 6-well dishes at 3 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. For time points beyond 60 h, cells were split 48 h after the first transfection and then immediately subjected to a second treatment with siRNA. 3â² Rhodamine-labeled and unlabeled control oligonucleotides (CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA plus 3â² dTdT overhangs; control) were used to optimize transfection efficiency and to control for nonspecific effects due to the presence of siRNAs in cells, respectively. The level of protein depletion due to RNA silencing was determined by quantitative immunoblotting of cell extracts using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and quantification was performed on immunoblots using a PhosphorImager. Photometric quantification of immunofluorescence signals was performed from digital image files taken with a 40Ã/0.75-NA lens that allowed a large depth of focus. Mean pixel values of 1â2-Î¼m<sup>2</sup> areas were calculated using Adobe Photoshop<sup>Â®</sup>. Control cells stained with nonimmune serum and cells treated with control RNA, stained with the respective centrosomal antibodies, were used to calculate background levels and average control protein levels.</p>

        <title>Microinjection experiments</title>
        <p>Affinity-purified PCM-1 antibody was injected into <italic>Xenopus</italic> A6 cells cultured on glass coverslips at 2 mg/ml in injection buffer (100 mM KCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4). At 24 or 48 h after injection, coverslips were fixed with methanol at â20Â°C and processed for immunofluorescence as above. Control injections were performed using rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) at the same concentration in injection buffer. Purified dynamitin (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wittmann and Hyman, 1999</xref>) at a concentration of 9 mg/ml was injected into CHO cells. After 2â4 h of incubation, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Control cells were injected with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody.</p>

        <title>Centrin copurification experiments</title>
        <p>Human centrin-3 was obtained by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library (provided by S. Kandels-Lewis, University of Edinburgh, UK) using primers ATGGATCCATGAGTTTAGCTCTGAGAAGTGAGC and TAGAATTCTTAAATGTCACCAGTCATAATAGCA and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) using BamH1 and EcoR1. Sequencing confirmed it to be identical to the previously published human centrin-3 sequence (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Middendorp et al., 1997</xref>). Bacterial fusion protein in PBS was loaded on a glutathione Sepharose 4B column and purified using reduced glutathione according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences), and dialyzed against PBS.</p>
        <p>HeLa cell extracts were prepared by resuspending cell pellets from 6 near-confluent 10-cm plates (â¼6 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells) in 1 ml PBS using a Dounce homogenizer. <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts were prepared as described by <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Murray (1991)</xref>. Protein concentrations of the extracts prepared varied between 2â5 mg/ml for HeLa cell extracts and 40â100 mg/ml for <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. In each copurification experiment, 200 Î¼g GST-centrin-3 or GST alone was added to 1 mg HeLa extract or 10 mg <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract, diluted to 1 ml total volume in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 4Â°C. GST fusion protein and associated interactors were then recovered by incubating the mixture with 100 Î¼l glutathione Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4Â°C. After extensive washes with PBS, bound protein was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0, followed by TCA precipitation and boiling for 5 min in gel loading buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol. Recovery of the GST fusion protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and the copurification of PCM-1 tested by immunoblotting.</p>
