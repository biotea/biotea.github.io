      <abstract>
        <p>5â²-nucleotidases catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates. As catabolic enzymes they contribute significantly to the regulation of cellular nucleotide levels; misregulation of nucleotide metabolism and nucleotidase deficiencies are associated with a number of diseases. The seven human 5â²-nucleotidases differ with respect to substrate specificity and cellular localization. Recently, the novel cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase III-like protein, or cN-IIIB, has been characterized in human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. cN-IIIB exhibits a strong substrate preference for the modified nucleotide 7-methylguanosine monophosphate but the structural reason for this preference was unknown. Here, we present crystal structures of cN-IIIB from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> bound to the reaction products 7-methylguanosine or cytidine. The structural data reveal that the cytosine- and 7-methylguanine moieties of the products are stacked between two aromatic residues in a coplanar but off-centered position. 7-methylguanosine is specifically bound through Ï-Ï interactions and distinguished from unmodified guanosine by additional cation-Ï coulomb interactions between the aromatic side chains and the positively charged 7-methylguanine. Notably, the base is further stabilized by T-shaped edge-to-face stacking of an additional tryptophan packing perpendicularly against the purine ring and forming, together with the other aromates, an aromatic slot. The structural data in combination with site-directed mutagenesis experiments reveal the molecular basis for the broad substrate specificity of cN-IIIB but also explain the substrate preference for 7-methylguanosine monophosphate. Analyzing the substrate specificities of cN-IIIB and the main pyrimidine 5â²-nucleotidase cN-IIIA by mutagenesis studies, we show that cN-IIIA dephosphorylates the purine m<sup>7</sup>GMP as well, hence redefining its substrate spectrum. Docking calculations with cN-IIIA and m<sup>7</sup>GMP as well as biochemical data reveal that Asn69 does not generally exclude the turnover of purine substrates thus correcting previous suggestions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nucleoside monophosphate phosphohydrolases or 5â²-nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes catalyzing the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates to nucleosides and orthophosphate (nucleoside monophosphate+H<sub>2</sub>Oânucleoside+PO<sub>4</sub>
<sup>3â</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0090915-Bianchi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As catabolic enzymes, nucleotidases participate in the regulation of nucleotide levels in living cells <xref rid="pone.0090915-Rampazzo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Reaves1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In humans, seven different 5â²-nucleotidases have been characterized differing with respect to their substrate specificity, subcellular localization, oligomerization state and size <xref rid="pone.0090915-Hunsucker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Five of them, namely cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase IA (cN-IA), cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase IB (cN-IB), cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase II (cN-II), cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase IIIA (cN-IIIA; previously called cN-III) and cytosolic 5â²(3â²)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN) are located in the cytosol whereas one is mitochondrial (mitochondrial-5â²(3â²)-deoxyribonucleotidase, mdN) and one is an extracellular enzyme (ecto-5â²-nucleotidase, eN). Crystal structures are available for five of the seven nucleotidases including the mitochondrial (mdN) <xref rid="pone.0090915-RinaldoMatthis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Walldn2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and the extracellular nucleotidase (eN) <xref rid="pone.0090915-Knapp1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Heuts1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> as well as the cytosolic nucleotidases cdN <xref rid="pone.0090915-Walldn2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, cN-II <xref rid="pone.0090915-Walldn3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Jordheim1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and cN-IIIA <xref rid="pone.0090915-Bitto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Grobosky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although the intracellular 5â²-nucleotidases generally share a low sequence similarity, all enzymes are magnesium-dependent and belong to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily <xref rid="pone.0090915-Burroughs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. They are characterized by a modular architecture, containing a structurally conserved HAD core domain, which contains the catalytic residues, and an enzyme-specific cap domain consisting of one or more cap insertions. The various substrate specificities of intracellular 5â²-nucleotidases are mainly achieved by different cap domains, which contain the substrate specificity motif S, while the catalytic platform is provided by the conserved HAD core domain <xref rid="pone.0090915-Burroughs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Within the HAD core domain, the canonical motifs I-III include the residues for magnesium ion coordination and catalysis <xref rid="pone.0090915-Burroughs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Aravind1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. During catalysis of cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidases, the first aspartate of motif I (<underline>D</underline>X<underline>D</underline>X[<underline>T/V</underline>]) performs a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate moiety of the bound substrate involving a pentavalent phosphate transition state <xref rid="pone.0090915-Allegrini2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Lahiri1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Consequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the carboxyl group of this aspartate forming a covalent phospho-enzyme intermediate, which is subsequently resolved by hydrolysis. For that purpose, the second aspartate of this motif is thought to coordinate the attacking water molecule <xref rid="pone.0090915-Bitto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. During the reaction, a serine or threonine residue from motif II (Î¦Î¦Î¦[<underline>S/T</underline>]), preceded by 3 hydrophobic Î¦-residues, interacts with the phosphate group and stabilizes the pentavalent phosphate transition state. The conserved catalytic motif III (<underline>K</underline>(X)<sub>x</sub>
<underline>D</underline>(X)<sub>0â4</sub>
<underline>D</underline>) contains a lysine and two aspartate residues that stabilize the phosphorylated intermediate and coordinate the magnesium ion, respectively <xref rid="pone.0090915-RinaldoMatthis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although the catalytic mechanism of 5â²-nucleotidases has been characterized in detail due to a number of available crystal structures and biochemical data, the structural basis for substrate recognition and discrimination remains elusive for some of them.</p>
      <p>Recently, a novel member of the family of cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidases, the cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase III-like protein, has been characterized in humans and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090915-Buschmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and subsequently renamed cN-IIIB (UniProt IDs Q969T7 and Q9W197). Human cN-IIIB (<italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIB) exhibits a sequence identity and similarity of 59% and 80% to the human cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase IIIA (<italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA). Interestingly, although both enzymes share significant sequence similarity they appear to have different substrate specificities <xref rid="pone.0090915-Buschmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA is the main pyrimidine 5â²-nucleotidase in erythrocytes; its activity was thought to be restricted to (d)CMP, (d)UMP and dTMP <xref rid="pone.0090915-Amici1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A lack of this enzyme in human erythrocytes results in hemolytic anemia, which probably is due to the accumulation of pyrimidine nucleotides and precipitation of unhydrolyzed ribosomal RNA <xref rid="pone.0090915-Rees1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Valentine1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In contrast to human cN-IIIA, human cN-IIIB has a broad substrate specificity, efficiently converting CMP and UMP and, with significantly lower efficiency, GMP and AMP <xref rid="pone.0090915-Buschmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Remarkably, cN-IIIB dephosphorylates the modified purine 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (m<sup>7</sup>GMP) with the lowest <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> among all substrates tested. Due to the presence of the mRNA cap structure, 7-methylguanosine nucleotides are released during degradation of all eukaryotic mRNAs: Either Dcp2 and related enzymes cleave off m<sup>7</sup>GDP, which is further converted to m<sup>7</sup>GMP, or m<sup>7</sup>GMP is released directly by the scavenger decapping enzyme DcpS <xref rid="pone.0090915-vanDijk1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Additionally, 7-methylguanosine was shown to be present in several tRNA and rRNA species of archaea, bacteria and eukarya <xref rid="pone.0090915-Machnicka1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Until recently, it was not known by which enzymatic activity m<sup>7</sup>GMP is further degraded after RNA decay. As a potential alternative to decay, accumulation of m<sup>7</sup>GMP in the cytosol and subsequent incorporation into nucleic acids seems possible but biologically highly undesirable <xref rid="pone.0090915-vanDijk1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0090915-Reichard1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To gain insight into the broad substrate specificity of cN-IIIB and especially its unusual preference for m<sup>7</sup>GMP, we determined crystal structures of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cN-IIIB (<italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB) bound to different reaction products. The overall structure of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB is similar to cN-IIIA, however, critical residues conferring substrate specificity and determining the size of the substrate-binding pocket are different. The co-crystallized reaction product, 7-methylguanosine or cytidine, is bound in a deep cavity formed by the cap domain and the HAD core domain and is surrounded by three aromatic amino acids forming an aromatic slot. The structures explain why cN-IIIB prefers m<sup>7</sup>GMP over GMP as substrate but also efficiently converts pyrimidines. In combination with biochemical data from mutagenesis experiments of cN-IIIA and cN-IIIB and molecular docking calculations we define the structural basis for m<sup>7</sup>GMP dephosphorylation by 5â²-nucleotidases.</p>

After all amino acids had been placed, additional density was observed in the active center, which, based on its shape, could be assigned as an octahedrally coordinated magnesium ion, the co-crystallized product nucleoside m<sup>7</sup>G as well as a metal fluoride transition state analog. It was shown that for pH values higher than 7.0, enzyme-MgF<sub>3</sub> complexes rather than enzyme-AlF<sub>3</sub> complexes are formed <xref rid="pone.0090915-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Baxter1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

        <title>Overall Structure of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB</title>
        <p>The overall structure of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB consists of two domains: the globular core domain and a smaller cap domain. The globular core domain is a haloacid dehalogenase domain (HAD domain) and resembles a Rossmannoid-like Î±/Î² structure with a central seven-stranded Î²-sheet exhibiting the topology Î²1âÎ²9âÎ²8âÎ²7âÎ²2âÎ²3âÎ²4â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g001">
<bold>Figure 1</bold>
</xref>). Between two consecutive Î²-strands, one or more Î±-helices build right-handed crossover connections generating a Î²-sheet flanked by several Î±-helices on either side. The Î²-sheet is twisted in a way that the two outermost strands are arranged in an almost perpendicular orientation with respect to each other. The HAD core is distinguished from other Rossmannoid folds by two additional structural key features. The âsquiggleâ (amino acids Phe56-Thr61, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090915.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>) is a single helical turn (in some structures resembling a Ï-helix) located immediately downstream of the first core Î²-strand (Î²2) and is followed by the âflapâ â a short Î²-turn (amino acids Thr65-Gly68). Both structural motifs provide the structural flexibility required for nucleotidases to switch between open (substrate binding) and closed (catalytically active) conformations. The sequence of the HAD domain in <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB includes two insertions, the caps, at two distinct sites. The first one lies between Î²2 and Î±-helix 9 and, due to its location, is termed C1-type cap <xref rid="pone.0090915-Burroughs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It comprises the Î±-helices 5â8 (amino acids 74â143) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g001">
<bold>Figure 1</bold>
</xref>). The second insertion is named C2-type cap, compasses Î²5 and Î²6 (amino acids 195â216) and is positioned between Î²4 and Î±-helix 11. These two insertions protrude from the Î±/Î² Rossmannoid core of the structure and form the cap domain, which serves as a movable lid for the active site of the enzyme as suggested by different orientations of the domain in crystal structures of cN-IIIA <xref rid="pone.0090915-Bitto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Grobosky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and cN-IIIB (reported here).

In homologous enzymes, the first aspartate was shown to be the nucleophile responsible for the in-line attack on the Î±-phosphate of the bound nucleoside monophosphate. In the reaction, the cleaved-off phosphate is transferred to this aspartate, initially generating a pentavalent transition state and, later, a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate. During subsequent hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, the side chain carboxyl of Asp57 is likely to be involved in donation of a proton to the bound phosphate, thus acting as the general acid-base residue in this reaction <xref rid="pone.0090915-Bitto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In fact, this state is represented in the crystal structures with the transition state analog MgF<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> coordinated by Asp55 and the attacking water occupying the second apical coordination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g003">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). The transferred proton may originate from the water molecule, which is further bound by the side chains of Asp57 (motif I) and Ser171 belonging to motif II in the crystal structure (see below). Alternatively, the proton may stem from the 5â²-hydroxyl of another bound nucleoside, which results in a phosphotransferase activity observed in some members of the cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase family <xref rid="pone.0090915-Amici1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Amici2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

        <title>7-methylguanosine Binding by <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB</title>
        <p>It has recently been shown that the Michaelis constant (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub>) for the <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB-mediated dephosphorylation of m<sup>7</sup>GMP (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub>â=â13 ÂµM) is significantly lower than for AMP (32 ÂµM), CMP (48 ÂµM), UMP (91 ÂµM) and GMP (102 ÂµM). For the human ortholog <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIB, the preference for m<sup>7</sup>GMP in terms of the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> value is even more pronounced <xref rid="pone.0090915-Buschmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. At least to some extent, this also reflects a higher binding affinity for m<sup>7</sup>GMP compared to the unmodified purines and pyrimidines. However, the structural basis for this preference, unusual among 5â²-nucleotidases, and the broad substrate specificity in general has so far been unknown.</p>
        <p>Overall, the C1-type cap containing the substrate specificity motif (motif S) together with the HAD core domain generates a substrate-binding pocket which neatly accommodates the bound 7-methylguanosine in a deep binding cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g001">
<bold>Figure 1</bold>
</xref>). Both the base and the ribose moiety of m<sup>7</sup>G are in contact with diverse protein residues. In detail, the 7-methylguanine moiety of the nucleoside is stacked in a parallel displaced orientation between the aromatic side chains of Trp120 and Phe75, bridging typical stacking distances of 3.5 Ã between the side chains and the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g004">
<bold>Figure 4A</bold>
</xref>). Besides a Ï-Ï stacking interaction resulting from the parallel orientation of the Ï-electron systems of the purine ring and the aromatic amino acid side chains, there is also a cation-Ï stacking coulomb interaction between the side chain Ï-electrons of Trp120 or Phe75 and the positive charge of m<sup>7</sup>G. It has been shown that the positive charge of m<sup>7</sup>G mainly localizes to nitrogen 7 <xref rid="pone.0090915-Ruszczynska1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which interestingly is positioned above the center of the indole ring of the stacking Trp120. The cation-Ï stacking thus seems to be a major contribution and one of the structural reasons for the high affinity of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB for the monomethylated m<sup>7</sup>GMP and the discrimination against the unmethylated GMP. Notably, the binding pocket is completed by another aromatic side chain of Trp121, which packs by T-shaped edge-to-face stacking perpendicular against the methylated purine ring, bridging a distance of 3.8 Ã between the methyl group of m<sup>7</sup>G and the plane of Trp121. This binding pattern results in the formation of an aromatic slot by Trp120, Phe75 and Trp121 neatly enclosing the base and shielding it from surrounding charged amino acids and water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g004">
<bold>Figure 4A</bold>
</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g005">
<bold>5A</bold>
</xref>). This binding mode is reminiscent of 5â²-cap dinucleotide binding by the nuclear import adapter Snurportin 1 <xref rid="pone.0090915-Strasser1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, where the hypermethylated 5â²-guanine of the snRNA is stacked between a tryptophan side chain and the second RNA base while it is shielded from the aqueous surrounding by a second tryptophan. Moreover, in <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB the residues Ser124, Phe209, Trp120, Trp121 and Phe75 form a cavity that harbors the N7-methyl group of the modified base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g005">
<bold>Figure 5A</bold>
</xref>). In addition, residues Phe78, Thr128, Leu199, Phe209 and Leu174 form a deep and elongated second cavity near O6 of the m<sup>7</sup>G, which would be able to accommodate diverse alkylated adenine nucleotides such as N6-isopentyladenosine, N6-glycinylcarbamoyladenosine or N6-N6-dimethyladenosine that have been found in different RNA species <xref rid="pone.0090915-Machnicka1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

The ribose 5â² hydroxyl makes contacts with the side chain of Asp57 as well as two water molecules, one of which would be in the position for the in-line attack on the phospho-aspartate 55 (see above). Moreover, O6 of the purine ring is in close contact with Ser124 of motif S as well as with two conserved water molecules. Furthermore, nitrogens N1, N2 and N3 of the base are in contact with several water molecules coordinated by protein residues.</p>
        <p>In summary, m<sup>7</sup>GMP is converted with a â¼10-fold lower <italic>K</italic>

Moreover, the slightly higher affinity of human cN-IIIB for m<sup>7</sup>GMP compared to <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB could be explained by the fact that one of the stacking residues in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein, Phe75, is replaced by a tyrosine (Tyr60) in the human counterpart (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090915.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). It has been shown for a viral m<sup>7</sup>G-cap binding methyltransferase (VP39) that the exchange of such a stacking tyrosine in the binding pocket by phenylalanine reduces the affinity for the m<sup>7</sup>G-cap by a factor of four <xref rid="pone.0090915-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Whereas the human enzyme, compared to <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB, has a 2-fold higher apparent affinity for m<sup>7</sup>G, it shows reduced affinities for the substrates CMP (2-fold higher <italic>K</italic>

<sub>m</sub>), AMP (14-fold higher <italic>K</italic>

        <title>Cytidine Binding by <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB</title>
        <p>In contrast to other cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidases, cN-IIIB dephosphorylates both pyrimidines and purines (see above). To compare binding of purines and pyrimidines and explain this broad substrate specificity, we crystallized <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB in complex with cytidine and solved the crystal structure by means of molecular replacement using the structure of the <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB m<sup>7</sup>G complex as starting model. Remarkably, there was no density for MgF<sub>3</sub>
<sup>â</sup> in the active site of the cytidine bound structure. The overall conformation of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB in complex with cytidine is highly similar to the m<sup>7</sup>G-bound structure with an rmsd of 0.32 Ã for 293 common C<sub>Î±</sub> atoms of the molecules A. Differences between both structures are mainly restricted to the flap (amino acid Thr65-Gly68), which is not defined in the cytidine bound structure and thus most likely disordered. In contrast to the m<sup>7</sup>G-bound structure, several amino acids in the C1-type cap have poorly defined side chains, however all main chain atoms as well as the important residues for substrate binding are well defined in the electron density map.</p>
        <p>
<italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB binds cytidine in a similar fashion as m<sup>7</sup>G, using the same substrate-binding pocket, however the hydrogen-bonding pattern is different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g004">
<bold>Figure 4B</bold>
</xref>). The pyrimidine ring is stacked in an almost coplanar fashion between Phe75 and Trp120, bridging plane distances of 3.5 and 3.4 Ã, respectively. The side chain of Trp121 packs in an edge-to-face fashion with a distance of 3.5 Ã to the C5 atom of cytidine. When superimposed to m<sup>7</sup>G, the centroid of the pyrimidine ring is in close proximity to the methylated nitrogen 7 of the guanine base, thus the cytosine ring captures the position of the 5-membered imidazole ring of m<sup>7</sup>G.</p>
        <p>Besides the described stacking interactions, the cytidine makes only one direct hydrogen bond to Ser124, which is in contact to the N4 of the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g004">
<bold>Figure 4B</bold>
</xref>). Consequently, the water-mediated interactions of Asn79, Thr92, Trp120 and Ser171 of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB bound to m<sup>7</sup>G are missing in the cytidine-bound structure, partly explaining the lower affinity of the enzyme for pyrimidines.</p>

        <p>Although all cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidases share similar HAD core folds, overall the structures are different due to the structural variability of their cap domains, which confer substrate specificity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090915.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>). The modular architecture of nucleotidases, with the conserved HAD core domain as catalytic platform and the structurally variable cap domain, allows different substrate specificities while maintaining catalytic efficiency. The closest nucleotidase homolog to cN-IIIB is the cytosolic 5â²-nucleotidase IIIA (former cN-III, sequence alignment in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090915.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>), which has been structurally and functionally characterized in detail <xref rid="pone.0090915-Bitto1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090915-Grobosky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA (originally called pyrimidine-specific 5â²-nucleotidase 1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of CMP and UMP <xref rid="pone.0090915-Valentine1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

Superposition of the HAD core domains of cN-IIIA and cN-IIIB shows that the orientation of the cap domains with respect to the HAD core are slightly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g006">
<bold>Figure 6</bold>
</xref>). The crystal structures of the cN-IIIA UMP complex and the cN-IIIB m<sup>7</sup>G complex superpose with an rmsd of 1.19 Ã for 218 common C<sub>Î±</sub> atoms. In the crystal structure of the cN-IIIA UMP complex, the enzyme completely encloses the substrate in a deep cavity between the HAD core and the cap domain <xref rid="pone.0090915-Grobosky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In contrast, in cN-IIIB bound to m<sup>7</sup>G, the tip of the cap domain (loop between Î±-helices 6 and 7) is shifted by 4 Ã away from the HAD core representing a more open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g006">

</xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090915.s005">Movie S1</xref></bold>). This structural difference in the orientation of the cap domain relative to the HAD core may be due to the fact that cN-IIIA is bound to the reaction substrate including the phosphate (UMP), while cN-IIIB is bound to a reaction product missing the phosphate (7-methylguanosine). Notably, there are several direct contacts of the UMP phosphate with Lys213, Ser164 and Asp51 of the HAD core domain as well as with the active site magnesium ion, which stabilize the closed conformation of cN-IIIA. Instead, the corresponding residues Ser171, Lys219 and Asp55 in cN-IIIB are in direct contact with the transition state analog MgF<sub>3</sub>

As a consequence, bond cleavage between the Î±-phosphate, coordinated in part by the HAD core, and the nucleoside, which is tightly bound by the cap domain, allows both domains to move away from each other and to subsequently release the reaction products (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090915.s005">Movie S1</xref></bold>).</p>

        <p>The ability of <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA to dephosphorylate m<sup>7</sup>GMP with high efficiency is inconsistent with the proposed role of Asn69 in preventing binding of purine nucleotides <xref rid="pone.0090915-Grobosky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This proposal was further tested by mutagenesis studies. For the enzyme variants, the following code was used: Amino acids Phe75-Gly76-Trp120-Trp121 of <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB, forming the binding pocket for the nucleobase, are abbreviated FGWW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g005">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>). Asn69 in <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA corresponds to Gly76 in <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB, and the amino acids of <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA corresponding to the FGWW motif were abbreviated HNWY (His68-Asn69-Trp113-Tyr114). When Gly76 of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> enzyme was replaced by an asparagine (variant FNWW), the specificity constants for CMP and m<sup>7</sup>GMP changed very little, but the apparent affinity for m<sup>7</sup>GMP was increased rather than decreased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090915-t003">
<bold>Table 3</bold>
</xref>). Introduction of the entire HNWY motif into <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB had modest effects, partially converting the substrate preferences of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> enzyme to those of its human counterpart. When, in this context, Asn was replaced by Gly (variant HGWY), the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> for both CMP and m<sup>7</sup>GMP was decreased and <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> was strongly increased only for m<sup>7</sup>GMP due to different effects on <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090915-t003">
<bold>Table 3</bold>
</xref>). In a comparison of FNWY and FGWY, the glycine variant lowered <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> and increased <italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub> for both substrates, leading to a preference for m<sup>7</sup>GMP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090915-t003">
<bold>Table 3</bold>
</xref>). Thus, the effect of the amino acid occupying the position corresponding to <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA Asn69 is context-dependent; a general function of this asparagine in this position to exclude purine substrates is not supported by the data.</p>

        <p>To further test the hypothesis that Asn69 of cN-IIIA does not discriminate against purine substrates and explain the ability of cN-IIIA to convert m<sup>7</sup>GMP, molecular docking calculations were performed. The crystal structure of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> cN-IIIA (PDB ID 4FE3) was used to dock the potential substrate m<sup>7</sup>GMP as well as UMP into the âside-chain flexibleâ substrate-binding pocket, while UMP served as a control of the docking procedure since it is the co-crystallized substrate (see Materials and Methods for details). As expected, docking of UMP to <italic><sup>Mm</sup></italic>cN-IIIA led to a model that was virtually identical to the one revealed by the complex crystal structure. It had been suggested previously that Asn69 of cN-IIIA prevents binding of purine substrates for sterical reasons because it restricts the size of the substrate-binding pocket. However, when m<sup>7</sup>GMP was docked into the substrate-binding pocket of cN-IIIA, the side chain of Asn69 rotated by 180 degrees, adopting the conformation of another common rotamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090915-g005">
<bold>Figure 5C</bold>
</xref>). Due to this movement, the size of the binding pocket was significantly increased, neatly accommodating the purine ring of m<sup>7</sup>GMP. Taken together, the results from activity assays and the docking analyses strongly suggest that Asn69 of cN-IIIA is not discriminating against purine nucleotides.</p>
        <p>A second important residue in the substrate-binding pocket of cN-IIIB is Phe75, which is one of the aromates stacking against the nucleobase. Phe75 is replaced by a histidine (His68) in cN-IIIA decreasing the contribution of the Ï-Ï stacking interaction significantly although this position is occupied by a tyrosine or histidine in cN-IIIB orthologs of other species as well. Our set of mutants contains three pairs differing in the presence of phenylalanine or histidine at this position: FGWW versus HGWW; FGWY versus HGWY; and FNWY versus HNWY. In all three pairs, and with both CMP and m<sup>7</sup>GMP as substrates, the apparent affinities were consistently higher with the variants containing a phenylalanine at this position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090915-t003">
<bold>Table 3</bold>
</xref>). This fact underlines the importance of Ï-Ï stacking in substrate binding by 5â²-nucleotidases and may explain in part the generally lower affinities of cN-IIIA for its substrates.</p>

The SUMO-<italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB fusion construct was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta 2(DE3) (Merck) at 24Â°C in kanamycin- and chloramphenicol-containing 2YT-medium. Expression was induced at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 by addition of 0.6 mM IPTG. The cells were harvested after 4 hours of induction (5,000Ãg, 20 min, 4Â°C) and resuspended in lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol). Cells were disrupted using a microfluidizer 110S (Microfluidics) and the lysate, which was clarified by centrifugation (30,000Ãg, 30 min, 4Â°C), was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Afterwards, imidazole was removed from the solution by passing the eluate over a 50 ml desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in desalting buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol). For cleavage, the SUMO-<italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB fusion-protein was incubated with SUMO protease (Invitrogen) overnight at 4Â°C and in a 1â¶ 100 molar ratio of protease : fusion protein. In order to remove the His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag as well as the protease, the solution was passed through a second HisTrap column. The flow through of this column, mainly containing <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB, was finally purified using a Superdex S75 (26/60) gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol. The pure protein was concentrated to 15 mg/ml using Millipore concentrators with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 Da (Merck) and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C.</p>

        <p>Full-length <italic><sup>Dm</sup></italic>cN-IIIB (amino acids 1â319) was crystallized by vapor diffusion in 24-well sitting drop crystallization plates at 20Â°C. Plate-shaped crystals were obtained in a condition containing 26% (w/v) PEG 4,000, 0.1 M HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5 and 0.2 M NaCl at a protein concentration of 12 mg/ml and when the protein was previously mixed with 5 mM AlCl<sub>3</sub>, 30 mM NaF and with a 15-fold molar excess of m<sup>7</sup>G or cytidine, respectively. The crystals belong to space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub> and were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen after soaking in reservoir solution containing additionally 8% (w/v) PEG 4,000 as cryo protectant. Diffraction images from crystals containing m<sup>7</sup>G or cytidine were collected at the beamline BL14.1 of the Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY II, Berlin) <xref rid="pone.0090915-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Expression was induced by mixing the culture with 800 ml ice-cold TB medium including kanamycin (30 Âµg/ml) and IPTG (1 mM), and incubation was continued at 16Â°C for 5 hours. After harvesting, cells were resuspended in 25 ml lysis buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% (w/v) glycerol) and incubated for 1 h at 8Â°C with 10 mg of lysozyme, 5 mg of DNase I and 30 mg PMSF. The cells were disrupted twice with a French Press and centrifuged at 30,000Ãg for 75 minutes. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2 ml Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer. After washing with lysis buffer, including a step with lysis buffer containing 2 M KCl, bound protein was eluted stepwise with lysis buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (50â500 mM). Fractions containing His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-cN-IIIA were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and pooled. For SUMO-cleavage, 1.5 mg recombinant Ulp1 protease (expression plasmid obtained from Christopher D. Lima <xref rid="pone.0090915-Mossessova1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>), 5 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA were added, and the mixture was dialysed for 4 h at 0Â°C against lysis buffer containing 10% (w/v) sucrose instead of glycerol. Cleaved protein was again applied to a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-agarose column, and the flow-through fraction was loaded onto a Heparin column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6, 75 mM KCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose). Bound proteins were eluted with 7 CV of a linear gradient from buffer A to buffer B (as buffer A, but containing 2 M KCl). Fractions containing <italic><sup>Hs</sup></italic>cN-IIIA were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and pooled for dialysis against 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 200 mM potassium acetate, 3 mM magnesium acetate and 10% (w/v) sucrose.

The charge of the active site magnesium ion was set to +1.2. Calculations were done using a box size of 18Ã22Ã22 Ã encompassing the ligand binding site as well as all residues that were kept flexible during docking (Thr66, His68, Asn69, Lys89, Trp113, Tyr114, Ser117). Exhaustiveness and energy range of the calculations were set to 1000 and 4, respectively, and docking calculations were repeated twice in order to verify reproducibility of results.</p>
