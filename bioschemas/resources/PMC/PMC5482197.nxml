        <p>We recently found that integrin Î±vÎ²3 binds to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-Î±vÎ²31 (FGF1), and that the integrin-binding defective FGF1 mutant (Arg-50 to glutamic acid, R50E) is defective in signalling and antagonistic to FGF1 signalling. R50E suppressed angiogenesis and tumour growth, suggesting that R50E has potential as a therapeutic. However, FGF1 is unstable, and we had to express R50E in cancer cells for xenograft study, since injected R50E may rapidly disappear from circulation. We studied if we can develop antagonist of more stable FGF2. FGF2 is widely involved in important biological processes such as stem cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Previous studies found that FGF2 bound to Î±vÎ²3 and antagonists to Î±vÎ²3 suppressed FGF2-induced angiogenesis. However, it is unclear how FGF2 interacts with integrins. Here, we describe that substituting Lys-119/Arg-120 and Lys-125 residues in the predicted integrin-binding interface of FGF2 to glutamic acid (the K119E/R120E and K125E mutations) effectively reduced integrin binding to FGF2. These FGF2 mutants were defective in signalling functions (ERK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis) in NIH3T3 cells. Notably they suppressed, FGF2 signalling induced by WT FGF2 in endothelial cells, suggesting that the FGF2 mutants are antagonists. The FGF2 mutants effectively suppressed tube formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, sprouting in aorta ring assays <italic>ex vivo</italic> and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. The positions of amino acids critical for integrin binding are different between FGF1 and FGF2, suggesting that they do not interact with integrins in the same manner. The newly developed FGF2 mutants have potential as anti-angiogenic agents and useful tools for studying the role of integrins in FGF2 signalling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family consists of 22 related polypeptides that are expressed in almost all tissues and are multifunctional. Some FGFs, like FGF1 and FGF2, have potent angiogenic activity and are implicated as promoters of angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, in cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FGFs also increase the motility and invasiveness of a variety of cell types. The biological effects of FGFs are mediated by four structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases: FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 (FGFR1), FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. The binding of FGF to its receptor results in receptor dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain. This leads to the activation of intracellular signalling cascades. Integrins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that recognize extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands and cell surface ligands [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Integrins are transmembrane Î±âÎ² heterodimers, and at least 18 Î± and 8 Î² subunits are known [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Integrins are involved in signal transduction upon ligand binding and their functions are in turn regulated by signals from within the cell [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous studies found that antagonists to integrin Î±vÎ²3 suppressed angiogenesis induced by FGF2 [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suggesting that this integrin is involved in FGF2 signalling (FGFâintegrin cross-talk). Cross-talk between integrins and FGFs are an important signalling mechanism during normal development and pathological processes [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Current models of integrin-growth factor cross-talk propose that integrins contribute to growth factor signalling through interaction of integrins with the ECM [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We previously reported that FGF1 specifically binds to the classical RGD-binding site of integrin Î±vÎ²3 (KD approximately 1 Î¼M) using docking simulation and mutagenesis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The integrin-binding site in FGF1 is distinct from the FGFR-binding site. An FGF1 mutant (Arg-50 to glutamic acid mutant, R50E), which is defective in integrin binding but still binds to heparin and FGFR1, is defective in inducing DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, cell migration and chemotaxis, suggesting that the direct integrin binding to FGF1 is critical for FGF1 signalling [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We propose a model in which integrin and FGFR bind to FGF1 simultaneously and make a ternary complex on the cell surface. We discovered that R50E is a dominant-negative antagonist of FGF1. R50E suppressed DNA synthesis and cell proliferation induced by WT FGF1 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and suppressed angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using cancer cells that stably express WT FGF1 or R50E, we showed that WT FGF1 markedly enhanced tumour growth and R50E suppressed it [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the R50E mutant of FGF1 has potential as a therapeutic (FGF1 decoy). FGF1 is, however, thermodynamically unstable (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> =40Â°C). We had to express R50E in cancer cells to demonstrate its antagonistic effects on tumour growth and angiogenesis, since, we believed that R50E is quickly removed from circulation if we inject R50E systematically into mice in xenograft experiments [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. FGF2 is thermodynamically more stable (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> =59Â°C) and has a longer half-life in circulation than FGF1. FGF2 is widely involved in important biological processes such as stem cell proliferation and angiogenesis partly due to its stability [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been reported that integrin Î±vÎ²3 binds to immobilized FGF2 and promotes endothelial cell adhesion and spreading [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, anti-Î±vÎ²3 monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specifically inhibit cell proliferation and up-regulation of the urokinase type plasminogen activator induced by soluble FGF2 in GM 7373 cells grown on tissue culture plastic [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is unclear, however, how FGF2 interacts with integrins. The goal of the present study is to determine how integrins bind to FGF2 and to determine if integrin-binding defective FGF2 is dominant negative as in the case of FGF1. In the present study, we have developed FGF2 mutants that are defective in integrin binding and found that such FGF2 mutants act as antagonists of FGF2 signalling (FGF2 decoys). Notably, these FGF2 mutants effectively suppressed angiogenesis. Such FGF2 mutants have potential as therapeutics.</p>

        <p>All chemicals were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) unless otherwise stated. NIH3T3 embryonic mouse fibroblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (A.T.C.C.) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan) and were routinely cultured in EGM-2 Bullet kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 2% FBS. K562 erythroleukaemia cells and K562 cells that express recombinant Î±vÎ²3 were described before [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recombinant soluble Î±vÎ²3 was synthesized as described [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Experiments involving animals have been performed in accordance with the legal requirement of the UC Davis and the Osaka University.

        <title>Docking simulation</title>
        <p>Docking simulation of interaction between FGF2 (PDB code 2FGF) and integrin Î±vÎ²3 (PDB code 1L5G, open-headpiece form) was performed using AutoDock 3.05 as described [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cations were not present in Î±vÎ²3 during docking simulation [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ligand is presently compiled to a maximum size of 1024 atoms. Atomic solvation parameters and fractional volumes were assigned to the protein atoms by using the AddSol utility and grid maps were calculated by using AutoGrid utility in AutoDock 3.05. A grid map with 127 Ã 127 Ã 127 points and a grid point spacing of 0.603 Ã included the headpiece of Î±vÎ²3 (residues 1â438 of Î±v and residues 55â432 of Î²3). Kollman âunited-atomâ charges were used. AutoDock 3.05 uses a Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) that couples a typical Darwinian genetic algorithm for global searching with the Solis and Wets algorithm for local searching. The LGA parameters were defined as follows: the initial population of random individuals had a size of 50 individuals; each docking was terminated with a maximum number of 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> energy evaluations or a maximum number of 27000 generations, whichever came first; mutation and crossover rates were set at 0.02 and 0.80 respectively. An elitism value of one was applied, which ensured that the top-ranked individual in the population always survived into the next generation. A maximum of 300 iterations per local search were used. The probability of performing a local search on an individual was 0.06, whereas the maximum number of consecutive successes or failures before doubling or halving the search step size was 4.</p>

Briefly, soluble Î±vÎ²3 was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip using a standard amine coupling procedure [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The WT and mutant FGF2 were individually two-fold serially diluted from 2 Î¼M in HBS-P buffer (0.01 M Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.0005% of surfactant P20) with 1 mM of Mn<sup>2</sup>. Samples were injected at 50 Î¼l/min for 1.8 min. The HBS-P buffer with 1 mM of Mn<sup>2</sup> was then injected at 50 Î¼l/min for 3 min to allow the bound FGF2s to dissociate from the integrin.</p>

        <title>Identification of amino acid residues that is critical for integrin binding</title>
        <p>To identify how integrin Î±vÎ²3 and FGF2 interact, we performed docking simulation of interaction between Î±vÎ²3 (PDB code 1L5G) and FGF2 (PDB code 2FGF) using autodock3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). The simulation predicted that FGF2 binds to the classical RGD-binding site of Î±vÎ²3 with high affinity (docking energy â22 kcal/mol). When the FGFR1âFGF2 complex (1FQ9) was superposed on the Î±vÎ²3âFGF2 complex, there was little or no steric hindrance, suggesting that FGF2 can simultaneously bind to FGFR1 and Î±vÎ²3. The predicted integrin-binding interface overlaps with the heparin-binding site (residues 119â128, KRTGQYKLGS). To generate FGF2 mutants that are defective in integrin binding, we introduced mutations into several amino acid residues (Lys<sup>39</sup>, Arg<sup>44</sup>, Lys<sup>46</sup>, Lys<sup>119</sup>/Arg<sup>120</sup> and Lys<sup>125</sup> to glutamic acid) within the predicted integrin-binding interface of FGF2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We studied if the FGF2 mutants support adhesion of K562 cells that express recombinant integrin Î±vÎ²3 (Î±vÎ²3âK562 cells) and parent K562 cells. K562 cells that are deficient in proteoglycans were chosen because FGF2 strongly binds to cell surface proteoglycans (e.g. on CHO cells). Unexpectedly, FGF2 supported adhesion of both Î±vÎ²3âK562 and K562 cells to the similar extent, suggesting that FGF2 binds to Î±5Î²1 in addition to Î±vÎ²3 since Î±5Î²1 is the only integrin expressed in K562 cells [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We found that the K125 to E mutation (K125E) and K119E/R120E markedly suppressed adhesion of K562 cells to FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). The R44E mutation, which corresponds to R50E in FGF1, did not affect integrin binding, suggesting that FGF1 and FGF2 do not bind to integrins in the same manner. SPR study using immobilized soluble Î±vÎ²3 indicated that WT FGF2 bound to immobilized soluble Î±vÎ²3 on the sensor chip at <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> =7.75 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c). The K125E mutant showed lower affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> =1.1 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup> M) and lower RU than WT FGF2 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> =7.75 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d). The K119E/R120E mutant did not show detectable binding to Î±vÎ²3 in SPR. K119E/R120E was defective in binding to heparin, but K125E of FGF2 bound to heparin (results not shown). These findings are consistent with the docking model and K125E and K119E/R120E in the predicted integrin-binding site of FGF2 suppresses FGF2 binding to integrin Î±vÎ²3 and Î±5Î²1. We do not rule out the possibility, however, that substitution of these residues indirectly affects integrin binding through global conformational changes.

        <p>To study the role of integrin binding to FGF2 in FGF2 signalling, we determined if K119E/R120E and K125E induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells. Sustained ERK1/2 activation (&gt;3 h after stimulation) is integrin dependent and crucial to cell-cycle entry upon FGF stimulation [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study establishes that substituting Lys-119/Arg-120 and Lys-125 of FGF2 to glutamic acid effectively reduced the binding of FGF2 to integrins. The positions of key residues for integrin binding in FGF2 are not identical with that in FGF1 (Arg-50), suggesting that FGF2 and FGF1 interact with integrins differently, while the structures of FGF1 and FGF2 are superimposable, and the direct binding to integrins is equally critical for both FGF1 and FGF2. It has previously been proposed that the AspâGlyâArg (DGR) motif (residues 37â39) in FGF2 is involved in integrin binding [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The DGR motif is close to or within the predicted integrin-binding interface of FGF2, but the R39E mutation did not affect integrin binding. This suggests that the DGR motif may not be important for integrin binding. Importantly, the integrin-binding defective FGF2 mutants (K119E/R120E and K125E) are defective in signalling functions (DNA synthesis, sustained ERK1/2 activation and cell migration). Furthermore, they are dominant-negative antagonists of FGF2 signalling and potently suppressed WT FGF2-induced DNA synthesis, ERK1/2 activation and cell migration. These results suggest that the direct binding of FGF2 to integrins is involved in FGF2 signalling, as in the case of FGF1. We have introduced the K119E and R120E mutations individually to FGF2, but these mutations only partially reduced integrin binding and did not affect FGF2 signalling (results not shown). Therefore we need to substitute both Lys<sup>119</sup> and Arg<sup>120</sup> to glutamic acid simultaneously to reduce FGF2 signalling.</p>
      <p>Notably, K119E/R120E and K125E FGF2 potently suppressed WT FGF2-induced angiogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> (tube formation), <italic>ex vivo</italic> (aorta ring assays) and angiogenesis <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic>. These findings suggest that they are potent anti-angiogenic agents. K119E/R120E and K125E are comparable as inhibitors of angiogenesis. It has been proposed that the thermal stability of FGF2 is a major reason why FGF2 is involved in so many more biological processes than FGF1 and why FGF2 is a determinant factor in regulating self-renewal, differentiation, reprogramming in human pluripotent stem cells [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The consequence of high stability of FGF2 is a long half-life <italic>in vivo</italic> (7.6 h) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since FGF2 binds to all FGFR isoforms [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it is likely that K119E/R120E and K125E FGF2 mutants will be theoretically able to suppress signalling from all members of the FGF family as in the case of FGF1. Therefore, it is likely that K119E/R120E and K125E FGF2 mutants are potentially useful to suppress biological or pathological events that include FGF signalling. Since K125E bound to heparin and K119E/R120E did not, it is likely that the ability to bind heparin may not be directly related to their dominant-negative actions.</p>
      <p>Potential advantage of the FGF2 mutants is that: (i) they are highly specific to FGFR compared with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are selective rather than specific. Also, (ii) FGF2 mutants are small in size compared with IgG, and therefore FGF2 mutants have better penetrance (access to) to diseased tissues. (iii) Currently used targeting therapeutics (antibodies and kinase inhibitors) almost always induce resistance. This is partly due to point mutations in antibody epitopes or inhibitor-binding sites. Cancer cells obviously benefit from mutations that block the binding of antagonists. We believe that K119E/R120E and K125E of FGF2 may not induce such mutations in FGFR because the FGF2 mutants bind to FGFR exactly the same way as WT FGF2 and block binding of FGF2 (and other members of the FGF family) to FGFR would not benefit cancer cells.</p>
      <p>The specifics of the role of integrins in FGF signalling are unclear. Î±vÎ²3 integrin is highly expressed in endothelium during angiogenesis and is involved in neovascularization induced by FGF2 [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous studies found that the binding of FGF2 to FGFR is not sufficient to induce cell proliferation in endothelial cells and that an interaction of FGF2 with a cell surface integrin receptor is also required [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is consistent with the observation that anti-Î±vÎ²3 antibody inhibited the angiogenic activity exerted <italic>in vivo</italic> by FGF2 without affecting neovascularization induced by vascular endothelial cell growth factor, transforming growth factor-Î± or phorbol ester [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The present study also suggests that integrins other than Î±vÎ²3 may bind to FGF2. If this is the case, then, we need to use antagonists to multiple integrins to block FGF2âintegrin interaction. It would be necessary to address the integrin-binding specificity of FGF2 in details in future studies. On the other hand, it is likely that the K119E/R120E and K125E mutations suppress binding to multiple integrins regardless of integrin species. If this is the case, then the FGF2 mutants may be more effective than antagonists for individual integrins. The integrin-binding defective FGF2 mutants will be useful to study the molecular details of the FGF2/FGFR/integrin cross-talk.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to study if other members of the FGF family require integrin binding for their signalling functions in future studies. If this is the case, then, we may be able to generate dominant-negative inhibitors of FGFs by generating integrin-binding defective mutants.</p>
