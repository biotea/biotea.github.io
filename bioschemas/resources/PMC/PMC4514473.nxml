          <p>Various kinds of transmembrane and secreted proteins play pivotal roles in development through cell-cell communication.

        <sec id="sec002">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>First, we found that O-glycosylation of the Obif protein occurs at serine residue 36 in the Obif extracellular domain. Next, we observed that <italic>Obif<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice exhibit bone dysplasia in association with significantly increased osteoid volume per osteoid surface (OV/OS) and osteoid maturation time (Omt), and significantly decreased mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate per bone surface (BFR/BS). In addition, we observed that <italic>Obif<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice show a significant decrease in testis weight as well as in sperm number. By histological analysis, we found that <italic>Obif</italic> is expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids in the developing testis and that spermatogenesis is halted at the round spermatid stage in the <italic>Obif<sup>â/â</sup></italic> testis that lacks sperm. However, the number of litters fathered by male mice was slightly reduced in <italic>Obif<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice compared with wild-type mice, although this was not statistically significant.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Vertebrates are characterized by possession of bones and cartilage as major components of the skeletal system. Bone formation occurs through two distinct processes: endochondral ossification, in which a cartilage model is replaced by bone, and intramembranous ossification, in which bones are shaped directly from condensations of mesenchymal cells without a cartilage intermediate [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Normal bone remodeling is mediated by a balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity, whereby bone tissues maintain bone mass and mineral homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent advances have shown the importance of cell-cell communications for osteoblast differentiation, including Notch-Delta, Ephrin-Eph, and Semaphorin-Plexin pathways [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of osteoblast differentiation mediated by cell-cell communication have not been well elucidated. In addition, we propose that unidentified membrane proteins essential for cell-cell communication in osteoblast development are still likely to exist.</p>
      <p>We previously identified a gene encoding a single transmembrane protein, Obif, which is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts during mouse bone development [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Obif protein contains several O-glycosylation consensus sites between the signal sequence and the transmembrane domain. We observed several strong smeary bands of higher molecular weight than the unmodified Obif molecular weight by Western blot analysis with an anti-Obif antibody using primary cultured calvarial cells containing osteoblast cells and preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell lysates, suggesting that the Obif protein is glycosylated in osteoblasts. We showed that osteoblast differentiation is stimulated when <italic>Obif</italic> is overexpressed and inhibited when <italic>Obif</italic> is knocked down in MC3T3-E1 cells. We then generated <italic>Obif</italic> mutant mice by targeted gene disruption. Micro computed tomography (Î¼CT) analysis revealed that the femur of <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice show a significant decrease of cortical thickness as well as cancellous bone volume (BV/TV) at postnatal day 14 (P14) and progressive bone hypoplasia was observed at 8 weeks of age (8 wks) [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The expression levels of osteoblast marker genes were significantly reduced in the calvaria of <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice at P4. These data suggested that <italic>Obif</italic> plays an important role in bone formation through the regulation of osteoblast development.</p>
      <p>Recent findings showed that some molecules playing critical roles in bone development are also involved in spermatogenesis. Osteocalcin is an osteoblast- secreted molecule, and <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-deficient mice showed increased bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent study showed that osteocalcin also promotes Leydig cell maturation, and that <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-deficient mice exhibit a decrease in testis and epididymis weights as well as sperm number. These phenotypes are caused by low circulating testosterone levels in <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-deficient mice, suggesting that <italic>osteocalcin</italic> is required for male fertility in mice by promoting testosterone production in Leydig cells. [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>GPRC6A</italic> is a candidate as an osteocalcin receptor, which is expressed in osteoblasts and Leydig cells [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133704.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>GPRC6A</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice showed osteopenia and reproduction phenotypes similar to those seen in <italic>Osteocalcin</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During spermatogenesis in mammalian testis, spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes, which then proceed to round spermatids. Round spermatids undergo an elongation phase, transforming into mature spermatozoa (the sperm cells) [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In these spermatogenesis processes, cell-cell communications play important roles [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133704.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Impairment in any of these spermatogenesis steps can lead to oligozoospermia or azoospermia, which are major causes for male infertility in humans [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the current study, we first biochemically characterized the Obif protein and found that O-glycosylation of Obif protein occurs at serine residue 36 in the Obif extracellular domain. We examined the development of various bones in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice in more detail than in our previous study. We found that bone formation and bone mineralization are reduced in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice. We then investigated biological phenotypes of <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice in other tissues, because <italic>Obif</italic> transcripts are significantly detected in the brain, heart, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle, ovary, testis, and epididymis at the adult stage. Interestingly, we found that testis weight and sperm number significantly decreased in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice. We observed <italic>Obif</italic> expression in spermatocytes and spermatids in the developing testis. We found that late testicular differentiation is disturbed in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup><bold>â/â</bold></sup> mice, revealing the possibility that <italic>Obif</italic> plays a role in the development of normal male fertility.</p>

        <title>Obif protein is O-glycosylated at serine residue 36</title>
        <p>In our previous study, we identified five potential O-glycosylation sites (serine residues 36 (S36) and S43; and threonine residues 54 (T54), T60, and T67) in the mouse Obif protein, using online prediction server NetOglyc 3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), although we did not detect any N-glycosylation consensus site. S36, S43, T54, and T60 are conserved between mouse and human Obif proteins, while T67 is specific to the mouse Obif protein (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, yellow boxes). To determine whether the Obif protein is O-glycosylated, we generated constructs expressing a FLAG-tagged full length wild-type mouse Obif (mObif-WT) and FLAG-tagged mutants in which one or all of the five predicted O-glycosylation residues were replaced with alanine residues (mObif-S36A,-S43A,-T54A,-T60A,-T67A, and-ALL). We transfected the constructs into HEK293T cells and the transfected cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Our previous report showed that a band of approximately 37 kDa represented the nascent form of mObif by Western blot analysis with an anti-Obif antibody using primary cultured calvarial cells containing osteoblast cells and preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell lysates [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, we detected several strong smeary bands of higher molecular weight than the unmodified Obif molecular weight in that analysis [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We found that the approximately 60 kDa bands in the S36A- or ALL-transfected cell lysates were markedly fainter than those of mObif-WT-transfected cell lysates (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, arrowheads), while the band pattern was unaltered in the other mutant-transfected cell lysates (S43A, T54A, T60A, T67A) compared with mObif-WT-transfected cell lysates. Then, to confirm that the Obif protein modification is O-glycosylation, we transfected mObif-WT into HEK293T cells with or without a specific O-glycosylation inhibitor, benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-Î±-D-galactopyranoside (benzyl-GalNAc), and analyzed them by Western blot (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). We produced constructs expressing FLAG-tagged GFP (GFP) as a negative control and FLAG-tagged human CD55 (hCD55), which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, as a positive control for benzyl-GalNAc treatment [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In GFP-transfected cell lysates, we detected a single band of approximately 30 kDa in the presence of 2 mM benzyl-GalNAc. A previous report showed that a band of approximately 70 kDa represented the mature form of hCD55, and a band of approximately 40 kDa represented the nascent form of hCD55 [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the hCD55- transfected lysates, we detected an approximately 70 kDa band of hCD55 in the absence of benzyl-GalNAc. In contrast, in the presence of benzyl-GalNAc, the ~70 kDa band in the hCD55-transfected lysate was undetectable and the 40 kDa band markedly increased, indicating that hCD55 is an O-glycosylated protein as previously reported. In mObif-WT-transfected lysates, we detected an approximately 60 kDa band, the expected mObif-WT size, in the absence of benzyl-GalNAc. On the other hand, we found that the 60 kDa band in the presence of 0.5 mM benzyl-GalNAc became weaker than that in the absence of benzyl-GalNAc (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, arrowheads). The 60 kDa band of mObif-WT was undetectable in the cell lysates treated with 2 mM of benzyl-GalNAc. Taken together, these results suggest that Obif protein is O-glycosylated at serine 36.</p>

<sup>â/â</sup> mice</title>
        <p>To investigate how loss of <italic>Obif</italic> affects spermatogenesis, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis on mature testis sections from wild-type and <italic>Obif</italic>

<sup>â/â</sup> mice (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Notably, both <italic>Acrosin</italic> and <italic>Calmegin</italic> expression patterns were distinctively affected in the <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> testis compared with that in the wild-type testis. In the <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> testis, <italic>Acrosin</italic> and <italic>Calmegin</italic> were detected in the central region of seminiferous tubules, which are occupied by spermatozoa in the wild-type testis at the adult stage (<xref rid="pone.0133704.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>3Î²-HSD</italic> expression in Leydig cells and <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in Sertoli cells were unchanged between the wild-type and <italic>Obif</italic>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We previously identified a gene encoding a single transmembrane protein, Obif, and we showed that <italic>Obif</italic> can promote osteoblastic differentiation with only the N-terminus fragment prior to the membrane domain, suggesting that Obif functions as a ligand in osteoblast differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, we generated an <italic>Obif</italic> null allele by targeted gene disruption, and revealed that <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice showed a significant decrease of cortical thickness as well as cancellous BV/TV in the femur. In addition, the expression levels of osteoblast marker genes, including <italic>Collagen 1a1</italic>, <italic>Osteopontin</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>, and <italic>Osterix</italic>, were significantly reduced in the calvaria of <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup><bold>â/â</bold></sup> mice [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These data suggested that <italic>Obif</italic> plays an essential role in bone formation in association with reduced osteoblastogenesis. In the current study, in order to clarify how <italic>Obif</italic> increase volume, we performed bone histomorphometry on <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup><bold>â/â</bold></sup> mice. We found that activities of bone formation and bone mineralization significantly decreased in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup><bold>â/â</bold></sup> mice, and that the bone mineralization defect in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice is independent of calcium and phosphate metabolisms. These findings suggest that lack of <italic>Obif</italic> impaired bone mineralization through reduced osteoblast activity.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we found that <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup><bold>â/â</bold></sup> mice show a decrease in testis weight as well as sperm number. In addition, we found that <italic>Obif</italic> is expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids in the developing testis, and that spermatogenesis is completely halted at the round spermatid stage in the <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> testis that lacks sperm. However, the number of litters fathered by male mice were slightly reduced in <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice, although this was not statistically significant. Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>Obif</italic> has a possible role in the development of normal male fertility. Recent studies showed that junctions between Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells are essential for normal spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For example, Junctional adhesion molecule C (Jam-C) on the surface of spermatids binds to Jam-B on the surfaces of Sertoli cells. <italic>Jam-C</italic>-null male mice are infertile due to a failure of round spermatids to differentiate into spermatozoa [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, Nestin-2 protein on the surfaces of Sertoli cells interacts with Nestin-3 protein on the surface of elongated spermatid heads. <italic>Nestin-2</italic>-deficient mice are infertile due to aberrant morphogenesis of spermatids [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Considering that Obif is a membrane protein and that Obif expression was detected in spermatocytes and spermatids, we hypothesize that Obif binds to an unidentified partner on Sertoli cells to mediate the cell-cell communication that plays a role in normal testis differentiation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, recent studies have shown that <italic>Obif</italic> transcripts are highly enriched in microglial cells [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], however, <italic>Obif</italic> functions in microglial cells remain unknown. Moreover, a large-scale functional screen using mouse knockouts for secreted or transmembrane proteins revealed that <italic>Obif</italic>
<sup><bold>â/â</bold></sup> mice in the <italic>129/B6</italic> mixed genetic background appear to show abnormalities in neurology including the open field test and tail suspension test [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, behavioral analysis using mice with the C57BL/6 genetic background is needed.</p>
      <p>In our previous study, we identified several potential O-glycosylation sites in extracellular domain of mouse and human Obif proteins using the online prediction server NetOglyc 3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The surface membranes of mammalian cells are abundant in N- and O-linked glycoproteins which are related to cellular events and closely involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To confirm O-glycosylation of the Obif protein, we used an O-glycan inhibitor benzyl-GalNAc, which is widely used in cell culture assays [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We narrowed down the O-glycosylation site to serine residue 36 in the Obif extracellular domain using benzyl-GalNAc and Obif mutants. This observation suggests that Obif is a type Ia transmembrane protein in which the N-terminal region is O-glycosylated. It should be noted that other studies have reported that <italic>Obif</italic> interacts with Smad-1, -5 and Runx2 transcription factors involved in osteoblastic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0133704.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our observation of Obif glycosylation may not support this mechanism.</p>
      <p>Our current and previous studies suggest that the Obif protein functions through cell-cell interactions in bone and testis development. In future studies, it will be important and interesting to identify a partner molecule for Obif in these tissues as well as to elucidate Obif functions in microglial cells.</p>

        <p>Mouse testes were perfusion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in TissueTec OCT compound, frozen, and sectioned. Frozen 10 Î¼m sections on slides were dried for 30 min at room temperature, rehydrated in PBS for 5 min, incubated with blocking solution (10% newborn calf serum/0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h, and then incubated with the primary antibodies for 4 h at room temperature. Slides were washed three times with PBS for 10 min and incubated with a secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The specimens were observed under a laser confocal microscope (LSM700, CarlZeiss). Rabbit anti-mouse SPACA1 polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. M. Ikawa (1:1000, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Cy3-conjugated IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody.</p>
