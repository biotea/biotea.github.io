        <p>Inturned-mediated complex formation of NPHP4 and DAAM1 is important for ciliogenesis and ciliary function in multiciliated cells, presumably because of its requirement for the local rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Motile cilia polarization requires intracellular anchorage to the cytoskeleton; however, the molecular machinery that supports this process remains elusive. We report that Inturned plays a central role in coordinating the interaction between cilia-associated proteins and actin-nucleation factors. We observed that knockdown of <italic>nphp4</italic> in multiciliated cells of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> epidermis compromised ciliogenesis and directional fluid flow. Depletion of <italic>nphp4</italic> disrupted the subapical actin layer. Comparison to the structural defects caused by <italic>inturned</italic> depletion revealed striking similarities. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the two proteins interact with each other and that Inturned mediates the formation of ternary protein complexes between NPHP4 and DAAM1. Knockdown of <italic>daam1</italic>, but not <italic>formin-2</italic>, resulted in similar disruption of the subapical actin web, whereas <italic>nphp4</italic> depletion prevented the association of Inturned with the basal bodies. Thus, Inturned appears to function as an adaptor protein that couples cilia-associated molecules to actin-modifying proteins to rearrange the local actin cytoskeleton.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although most cells express nonmotile primary cilia, epithelial cells in the central nervous system, respiratory tract, and fallopian tubes of the uterus are equipped with multiple motile cilia (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). Motile cilia are polarized in several ways to generate directional fluid or particle flows (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wallingford, 2010</xref>). The ârotational polarizationâ describes the polarity of cilia and their appendages within a single cell and enables the motile cilia to beat in a directional fashion. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> epidermal cells, this type of polarity is established by an early positional bias and subsequent positive hydromechanical feedback mechanisms that reinforce the directional beating pattern (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>); it is characterized by the orientation of the basal foot in the direction of the effective stroke and the striated rootlet, pointing to the opposite direction (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wallingford, 2010</xref>). Dishevelled (Dvl), which associates with the basal bodies at the apical membrane, appears to activate RhoA in multiciliated cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Ultimately, Dvl is asymmetrically localized within the center of the ciliary rootlet, and this asymmetry is essential for a normal rotational polarity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2008</xref>). The anaphase-promoting complex, which is found in the proximity of basal bodies and targets Dvl for degradation, may contribute to the confined Dvl localization in fully polarized cilia because knockdown of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome disrupts ciliary polarity (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ganner et al., 2009</xref>). The planar cell polarity effector molecule Inturned is also required for normal ciliary polarization, and it recruits RhoA to the apical membrane. Depletion of Inturned prevents the association of RhoA with the apical membrane, resulting in a thinning of the apical actin cytoskeleton and abnormal ciliary polarization (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, the precise function of Inturned remains unknown.</p><p>The role of the actin cytoskeleton for ciliogenesis, basal body docking, and ciliary polarization is well established (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dawe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bershteyn et al., 2010</xref>). The apical actin web consists of two layers: a dense net-like apical layer immediate underneath the plasma membrane and a subapical layer with short actin filaments that connect neighboring basal bodies (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Werner et al., 2011</xref>). These short interconnecting actin fibers are particularly important in generating the metachronal wave of synchronously beating axonemes across multiciliated cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). The actin-depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D disrupts these actin fibers in stage 29 <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and disturbs metachrony without reversing the rotational polarity (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Werner et al., 2011</xref>). However, the molecular machinery that generates these specific subapical actin fibers is unknown.</p><p>Formation of actin filaments or branched actin polymers requires actin nucleation factors to overcome unfavorable initial association rates (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Qualmann and Kessels, 2009</xref>). There are three classes of actin nucleation factors: (a) Arp2/3, a multimeric protein complex involved in actin branching; (b) formins (mDIA1-mDIA3, FRL1-2, DAAM1-2, FHOD1/3, FMN1-2, Delphin, and INF1-2); and (c) WH2-containing proteins (SPIRE1, SPIRE2, COBL, and LMOD1-LMOD3). Although these factors are critical for actin polymerization, dynamic changes of actin polymerization require the presence of additional actin nucleation-promoting factors (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>). Several actin-modifying proteins have been identified in the ciliary proteome, including the two Formins DAAM1 and FHOD3. Daam1 was identified through interaction with the PDZ domain of Dvl2 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Habas et al., 2001</xref>). Daam1 binds both Dvl2 and RhoA and is required for normal gastrulation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Habas et al., 2001</xref>), a process accompanied by extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements.</p><p>Nephronophthisis (NPH), a heterogenetic autosomal recessive ciliopathy, is characterized primarily by cystic kidney disease with progression to end-stage renal disease, retinopathy, and varying cerebral defects (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Benzing and Schermer, 2012</xref>). Proteins of the NPH gene family reside within the ciliary compartment but also colocalize with focal adhesions at the plasma membrane. Recently, several focal adhesion proteins were found to associate with the basal bodies of multiciliated cells and are required for normal basal body migration and docking (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Antoniades et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, two NPH proteins, nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1) and nephrocystin-4 (NPHP4), interact with focal adhesion molecules and have been implicated in cellâcell contacts and directed cell migration (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Benzing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">BurcklÃ© et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liebau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Slanchev et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations of NPH proteins also affect motile cilia. Whereas the fluid and particle flow across the ventral node is disrupted in NPHP2/Inversin-deficient mice (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 1999</xref>), NPHP2, NPHP3, and NPHP16 mutations cause situs inversus (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Otto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hoff et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, patients with NPHP4 mutations display spermatogenesis defects (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alazami et al., 2013</xref>), and an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, indicating a dysfunction of motile cilia in the respiratory tract, has been observed in patients with NPHP1 mutations (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fliegauf et al., 2006</xref>). NPHPs appear to form large protein networks to participate in defined cellular functions (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sang et al., 2011</xref>); these protein complexes have been extensively studied in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, where they participate in structural elements of the transition zone and control the access of molecules to the ciliary axoneme (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jauregui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Warburton-Pitt et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the role of NPHPs in ciliary motility and polarization remains largely unknown. We report now that NPHP4 interacts with Inturned, which facilitated the formation of a tertiary complex between NPHP4 and the actin-nucleating protein Daam1. Knockdown of <italic>nphp4</italic>, <italic>inturned</italic>, or <italic>daam1</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> resulted in strikingly similar abnormalities of the subapical actin layer. Furthermore, NPHP4 was required for Inturned to localize to the basal bodies of motile cilia. Our findings suggest that the subapical actin web is controlled by interactions between cilia-associated molecules such as NPHP4, which can recruit Inturned, and actin-modifying proteins such as Daam1 to modify the local actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s02"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s03" sec-type=""><title>A C-terminal fragment localizes NPHP4 to the basal body/transition zone in multiciliated epidermal cells of <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos</title><p>We found that <italic>Xenopus nphp4</italic> is present in oocytes and during early stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> development (stages 1â42; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502043/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, AâC</ext-link>), preferentially in ciliated tissues such as the pronephric duct, olfactory placode, and multiciliated cells of the epidermis. To explore the epidermis of developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos as a model system to study the molecular functions of NPHP4 in motile cilia, we targeted the expression of NPHP4 to the epidermis. Injection of mRNA encoding full-length GFP-tagged human NPHP4 (200 pg) revealed the localization of NPHP4 to the basal bodies, labeled by RFP-Centrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1 D). 3D reconstruction of confocal images revealed that NPHP4 localized to a region extending from the basal body to a region immediately distal of the basal body referred to as the transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Lower doses (70 pg) of microinjected <italic>NPHP4</italic> restricted the localization of fluorescently labeled NPHP4 almost exclusively to the presumptive transition zone. The association between the basal body and NPHP4 was already detectable at stage 19, well before nucleation of the ciliary axoneme (Fig. S1 E), suggesting essential functions of NPHP4 during early ciliogenesis and before basal body docking. We next determined whether NPHP4 contains a certain targeting sequence typically required for intraflagellar transportâdependent ciliary trafficking (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sung and Leroux, 2013</xref>). Analysis of GFP-tagged NPHP4 truncations revealed that the C-terminal half of NPHP4 (amino acids 863â1,426) is sufficient to recruit NPHP4 to the basal bodies, fully recapitulating the localization of full-length NPHP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502043/DC1" id="supp2">Table S1</ext-link>). This C-terminal domain could be further divided into two distinct subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). One is spanning amino acids 1,251â1,426 delineating a minimum necessary sequence for NPHP4 localization; smaller fragments (e.g., amino acids 1,251â1,324) failed to localize to the basal bodies. The other domain spans amino acids 863â1,250. This subdomain was not confined to the basal body but is also colocalized with the ciliary rootlets labeled by RFP-Clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These findings suggested that targeting of NPHP4 is not mediated by a short linear recognition motif but rather by a more complex 3D structure.

These cilia are uniformly distributed across the apical cell surface as revealed by the distribution of basal bodies from which cilia nucleate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Depletion of nphp4 by a translation-blocking MO (<italic>nphp4</italic> ATG MO) targeting <italic>nphp4</italic> mRNA resulted in a reduction of intact cilia that penetrated the surface of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, AâC</xref>); instead, signal intensity for acetylated-tubulin staining was increased within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, bottom).

These basal bodies still nucleated microtubular structures positive for acetylated tubulin within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). However, transmission electron microscopy revealed that only a few of these structures represented typical ciliary axonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>), suggesting that basal bodies rarely nucleate a ciliary axoneme before reaching the apical membrane. The apical actin cytoskeleton also appeared slightly thinner in <italic>nphp4</italic>-deficient cells than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>).

We observed that injection of this MO caused identical defects elicited by <italic>nphp4</italic> ATG MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C, D, and F</xref>). Although the reduction in cilia number appeared the main cause for the reduced flow speed, we examined ciliary polarization, using the combination of fluorescently labeled Clamp/Centrin to determine basal body polarity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2008</xref>).

Colocalization of GFP-fused Lifeact (Lifeact-GFP) with the phalloidin-labeled F-actin structure in fixed <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (Fig. S2 C) prompted us to use Lifeact-GFP for studying the actin dynamics in multiciliated cells. Lifeact-GFP in combination with time-lapse imaging revealed that actin bundles continuously formed and dissolved during the initial stages of ciliogenesis (stage 20; Fig. S2 D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502043/DC1" id="supp6">Video 3</ext-link>). Basal bodies seemed to stabilize actin bundles because areas devoid of basal bodies contained fewer actin bundles, suggesting a direct impact of basal bodies on actin cytoskeleton formation (Fig. S2, D and E). By late tailbud stage, ciliogenesis was completed and fully functional cilia were formed. In these mature multiciliated cells, basal bodies were embedded in a dense actin network at the apical surface of the cell (Fig. S2 F). Consistent with recently reported findings (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Werner et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that the most apical actin layer formed a meshwork-like structure immediately below the apical plasma membrane, whereas the subapical actin layer contained evenly distributed filament-like structures (Fig. S2 G). The subapical actin layer developed â¼1 Âµm below the apical layer with filaments connecting neighboring basal bodies along the stroke direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

To obtain further insight, we decided to identify potential binding partners through a candidate approach based on two criteria: (1) mutant proteins displaying an overlapping ciliary phenotype, and (2) actin-modifying proteins that have been identified in cilia. Immunoprecipitation assays in HEK 293T cells revealed that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> actin-nucleating factor cappuccino as well as human INTURNED interacted with NPHP4; other actin-nucleating factors did not or only weakly bound to NPHP4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502043/DC1" id="supp7">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>).

DAAM1 interacted only weakly with NPHP4 but revealed a strong interaction with INTURNED (Fig. S3, C and D). Because NPHP4 immobilized INTURNED, we next tested if INTURNED can mediate the formation of a ternary complex between NPHP4 and DAAM1. NPHP4 failed to interact with DAAM1 when coexpressed with DAAM1 (Fig. S3 E). However, when INTURNED was added, DAAM1 precipitated NPHP4, suggesting that NPHP4, INTURNED, and DAAM1 indeed form heteromeric complexes (Fig. S3 E).</p><p>Because we identified INTURNED and DAAM1 as binding partners of NPHP4, we next examined the effects of <italic>inturned</italic> and <italic>daam1</italic> depletion in the multiciliated cells of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermis.

Because a reduced density of cortical actin web in inturned-deficient cells has been reported (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>), we analyzed the actin organization in detail and found that the formation of the subapical actin network was similarly altered as in <italic>nphp4</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>); however, <italic>inturned</italic> depletion also affected the apical actin network.

In <italic>inturned</italic>-deficient embryos, we observed no striking effect on the accumulation of GFP-NPHP4 at the basal bodies; most of the basal bodies were decorated with the GFP-NPHP4 signal, and only a small subset of basal bodies was devoid of the GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). In contrast, the staining pattern of GFP-INTURNED at the apical membrane became homogenous, and the accumulation of GFP-INTURNED at the basal bodies was strongly reduced in <italic>nphp4</italic>-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>), whereas depletion of <italic>nphp4</italic> or <italic>inturned</italic> reduced both actin and Daam1 accumulation in the subapical actin layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Thus, Nphp4 appears to recruit Inturned to the basal bodies of motile cilia, interaction of Inturned with Daam1 can then modify the actin cytoskeleton in a spatially restricted manner. Because NPHP4 associates with basal bodies already during early developmental stages (Fig. S1 E), the protein complex could modify the actin cytoskeleton before basal bodies reach the apical plasma membrane. The InturnedâDaam1 interaction likely plays a role in other cellular programs. Although both proteins have been implicated as downstream effectors of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2006</xref>), the role of Inturned in mammalian convergent extension as a downstream effector molecule of Frizzled (Fz)/Dvl signaling has remained unclear. For example, whereas Daam1 is recruited by the PCP core proteins Celsr1/Fz/Dvl to adherent junctions and is essential for convergent extension movements during neural tube closure (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>), Inturned is not required for this process, but rather seems to function in neural tube patterning, requiring the presence of cilia (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Heydeck and Liu, 2011</xref>). Cilia are linked to PCP signaling; however, the hierarchical relationship between PCP core proteins and cilia is not fully understood (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). Although genetic analysis has placed Inturned downstream of Fz during <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Adler, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adler et al., 2004</xref>), Inturned in association with other PCP effector molecules can also act upstream of PCP core proteins to instruct their localization (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Inturned physically interacts with âMultiple wing hairsâ (Mwh), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein that contains a Diaphanous GTPase-binding and an FH3 domain (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). Although Inturned affects the localization of Mwh (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2010</xref>), recent results demonstrate that Mwh can directly regulate the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest an evolutionary conserved pathway, where Inturned interacts with site-specific proteins to assume a distinct subcellular localization and then recruits actin-modifying proteins to alter the local actin cytoskeleton. Because NPHP4 can target Dvl for degradation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">BurcklÃ© et al., 2011</xref>), NPHP4 could antagonize Dvl2/Daam1-mediated Rho activation to redirect the function of Daam1 in a spatially restricted manner.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s07"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s08" sec-type=""><title>Embryo manipulations</title><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were manipulated as described previously (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lienkamp et al., 2010</xref>).

For most experiments, microinjections were made into the two ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage to target the epidermis. Each blastomere was injected with 10-nl solution containing 8â20 ng of antisense MOs (GeneTools) and various amounts of mRNAs using a time- and pressure-triggered microinjection system (Narishige).

Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously, with some modifications (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lienkamp et al., 2010</xref>). In brief, fixed embryos were rehydrated in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), treated with 10 Âµg/ml Proteinase K for 10 min, washed with triethanolamine with and without 0.25% acetic anhydride, and refixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at RT. After washing with PBST, embryos were prehybridized with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5Ã SSC, 100 Âµg/ml heparin, 1Ã Denhartâs, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml Torula RNA, and 0.1% CHAPS) at 60Â°C for 5â6 h and incubated with 1â2 Âµg/ml probe in hybridization buffer at 60Â°C overnight. After a wash with hybridization buffer followed by washes with 2Ã SSCT (2Ã SSC with 0.1% Tween 20) at 60Â°C, embryos were treated with RNases (100 Î¼/ml RNase T [Sigma-Aldrich] and 20 Âµg/ml RNase A [QIAGEN]) in 2Ã SSCT for 30 min at 37Â°C and washed with 2Ã SSCT, 0.2Ã SSCT, and maleic acid buffer (MAB; 100 mM maleic acid and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). After sequential blocking with 2% blocking reagent (Roche) in MAB for 15 min at RT and 2% blocking reagent/20% sheep serum in MAB for 1 h at RT, embryos were incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of alkaline phosphataseâconjugated sheep anti-DIG antibody (Roche) at 4Â°C overnight. After washes in MAB and alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 M Tris, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20, and 5 mM levamisole, pH 9.5), embryos were stained with BM purple (Roche). After the desired signal strength was obtained, reaction was stopped with MAB and refixation was performed with 10% formaldehyde/5% glacial acetic acid at 4Â°C overnight followed by washes in 70% ethanol/30% PBS and 1Ã SSC. Wild-type embryos were cleared in bleaching solution (0.5Ã SSC, 2% formaldehyde, and 1.2% hydrogen peroxide) for 1â2 h at RT. Double staining for acetylated tubulin was performed after in situ hybridization. Embryos in PBS were imaged at RT using an MZ16F stereomicroscope (Leica) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 1.0Ã objective and a DFC450C camera (Leica). LAS V4.3 software (Leica) was used for image acquisition.

After blocking for 30â60 min in PBST containing 10% FBS and 5% DMSO, the embryos were incubated with mouse antiâacetylated-tubulin antibody (1:500 dilution; T6793; Sigma-Aldrich), or with a mouse antiâÎ³-tubulin antibody (1:2,500 dilution; T6557; Sigma-Aldrich,) at 4Â°C overnight. The embryos were then washed three times with PBST, incubated for 2â5 h at RT with Alexa Fluor 546â or 647âlabeled secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen), and washed three times with PBST. For F-actin staining, embryos were washed three times with TBSN (TBS with 0.05% NP-40) after MEMFA fixation, incubated for 2â5 h at RT with Alexa Fluor 488â or Alexa Fluor 568âphalloidin (1:300 dilution; Invitrogen), and then washed three times with TBSN. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed at RT with an Axiovert 200 LSM 510 Duo-Live microscope equipped with an LCI Plan Neofluar 63Ã/1.3 NA water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss). The excitation of fluorophores (GFP/Alexa Fluor 488, RFP/Alexa Fluor 568, and Alexa Fluor 647) was performed at 488, 561, and 633 nm, respectively. For detection of the emission signal at specified ranges, the spectral metal detector or normal photomultiplier channels were used with band-pass filter 505â550, long-pass (LP) 575, and LP 650 nm. Confocal pinhole diameters were always adjusted to 0.8-Âµm sections (according to 1 airy unit at 488 nm excitation) and z stacks (â¼60 z planes, 0.4 Âµm z distance, pixel time 1.21 Âµs, line average 16) were recorded. Pictures were taken with scan speed 9 and 8 bit. Zen 2010 software (Carl Zeiss) was used for image acquisition. Confocal fluorescence microscopy for the Daam1 localization analysis in Fig. S3 G was performed at RT with a TCS SP8 microscope equipped with an HC PL APO 63Ã/1.3 glycerine objective (Leica). The excitation of fluorophores (GFP, RFP, and Alexa Fluor 647) was performed sequentially at 488, 561 and 633 nm. The spectral emission detection unit was set to the following wavelength ranges: 492â581, 566â658, and 640â738 nm, accordingly. Confocal pinhole diameter was always adjusted to 0.8-Âµm z sections (according to 1 airy unit at 488 nm excitation), and z stacks (â¼40 planes, 0.2 Âµm distance, pixel time 975 ns, frame accumulation 2, and line average 2) were recorded. Pictures were taken with a 400-Hz scan speed and 8 bit. Leica Application Suite X was used for image acquisition. The acquired images were deconvolved with Huygens essential software (Scientific Volume Imaging), applying the classic maximum likelihood estimation mode and using a theoretical point spread function. Scanning electron microscopy was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hoff et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were fixed using Bouin solution. Dehydration with 70% EtOH, 80% EtOH, 90% EtOH, and 100% EtOH was followed by incubation in 50:50 EtOH/HMDS. After incubation in 100% HMDS, the solvent was allowed to evaporate. All samples were coated with gold using a Cool Sputter Coater E 5100 (Polaron). Samples were imaged using a Leo 1450 VP electron microscope (Carl Zeiss). Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Epting et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were fixed with 4% PFA/1% glutaraldehyde in PBS overnight at 4Â°C and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min at RT, dehydrated with two 10-min ethanol (50% and 60%) washings, and incubation in 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol overnight at 4Â°C. Embryos were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. After washing in propylene oxide, embryos were embedded in Durcupan (Fluka). Transverse ultrathin sectioning (60 nm) was performed using a Leica EM UC6. The sections were mounted on copper grids and examined in an electron microscope (LEO 906E; Carl Zeiss). For analyzing ciliary flow, embryos were placed in 0.3Ã MMR containing the anesthetic drug MS222 (0.02%; Sigma-Aldrich) and small fluorescent beads (Invitrogen). Time-lapse microscopy was performed at RT with a SPOT Insight FireWire system (Diagnostic Instruments) at 10Ã on a Leica MZ16 stereomicroscope. Images were analyzed with Imaris software (Bitplane) and the mean speed of beads was calculated for each embryo. For analyzing ciliary beating, embryos were injected at the four-cell stage with MO, together with mRNA for membrane-targeted GFP to label cilia, placed in MS222-containing 0.3Ã MMR at stage 32, and the GFP fluorescence was recorded at RT using an Axiovert 200 LSM 5 high-speed line scanning microscope equipped with an LCI Plan Neofluar 63Ã/1.3 NA water immersion objective (Carl Zeiss). LP495 filter was used for detection of the emission signal. Scanning area was 256 Ã 256 pixels, 108 frames/s, pixel size was 0.42 Âµm, and pixel dwell time was 15.4 Âµs. The confocal slit diameter was fully opened, resulting to an optical section thickness of 5.8 Âµm. Zen 2010 software was used for image acquisition. Pictures were digitized with 8 bit.
