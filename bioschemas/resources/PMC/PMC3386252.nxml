      <abstract>
        <p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer Disease and Huntington Disease. PUMA (<italic>p</italic>53 <italic>u</italic>pregulated <italic>m</italic>odulator of <italic>a</italic>poptosis) and BIM (<italic>B</italic>CL2 <italic>i</italic>nteracting <italic>m</italic>ediator of cell death), pro-apoptotic BH3 domain-only, BCL2 family members, have previously been shown to regulate ER stress-induced cell death, but the upstream signaling pathways that regulate this response in neuronal cells are incompletely defined. Consistent with previous studies, we show that both PUMA and BIM are induced in response to ER stress in neuronal cells and that transcriptional induction of PUMA regulates ER stress-induced cell death, independent of p53. CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein also known as GADD153; gene name <italic>Ddit3</italic>), a critical initiator of ER stress-induced apoptosis, was found to regulate both PUMA and BIM expression in response to ER stress. We further show that CHOP knockdown prevents perturbations in the AKT (protein kinase B)/FOXO3a (forkhead box, class O, 3a) pathway in response to ER stress. CHOP co-immunoprecipitated with FOXO3a in tunicamycin treated cells, suggesting that CHOP may also regulate other pro-apoptotic signaling cascades culminating in PUMA and BIM activation and cell death. In summary, CHOP regulates the expression of multiple pro-apoptotic BH3-only molecules through multiple mechanisms, making CHOP an important therapeutic target relevant to a number of neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ability to sense perturbations in the function of the ER is critical to eukaryotic cell survival. ER stress triggers an evolutionarily conserved intracellular response called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in an attempt to restore cellular homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0039586-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The evolutionarily oldest branch of the UPR is triggered by the activation of a combined nuclease and kinase called IRE1 (inositol requiring protein-1). A second branch of the UPR is initiated by activation of the kinase PERK (protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase), which similarly to IRE1, responds to ER stress by autophosphorylation and homomultimerization. A third branch of the UPR involves the protease-mediated activation of a transcriptional factor called ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6) <xref rid="pone.0039586-Schroder2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The UPR strives to maintain ER function during stress; however, if the stress is not resolved, apoptotis is activated <xref rid="pone.0039586-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Death inducing signals from the ER are integrated and amplified at the mitochondria and mouse embryonic fibroblasts from <italic>Bax</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup>
<italic>Bak</italic>
<sup>â/â</sup> mice are resistant to ER stress induced-apoptosis, indicating a critical role for BAX and BAK in ER stress-triggered death <xref rid="pone.0039586-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Emerging evidence has implicated ER stress-induced apoptosis in a variety of chronic diseases such as diabetes, ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0039586-Volchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0039586-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Whether stressed cells live or die is largely determined by the interplay between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 protein family <xref rid="pone.0039586-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The BH3-only proteins monitor cellular well-being and, when activated by cytotoxic signals, interact with pro-survival BCL2 relatives leading to downstream BAX and BAK activation and cell death by permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane <xref rid="pone.0039586-Willis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Different cell types may require different BH3-only proteins to activate apoptosis in response to the same cellular stress, while within a given cell type different BH3-only proteins may be required for activating the apoptosis machinery in response to different stimuli <xref rid="pone.0039586-Bouillet1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Based on recent progress in the study of BH3-only proteins, it has become clear that they have individual differences not only in the pathways through which they are activated or induced but also in their function. The emerging diversity in the function of BH3-only proteins indicates that they are involved in more intricate molecular interplay than previously estimated, allowing them to regulate apoptosis in a more efficient manner. PUMA and BIM are the most potent of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins due to their ability to bind to and neutralize all pro-survival BCL2 members <xref rid="pone.0039586-Bouillet2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Both PUMA and BIM have been implicated as key initiators of the apoptotic machinery in response to prolonged ER stress <xref rid="pone.0039586-Reimertz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Puthalakath1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. BIM is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis in a broad range of cell types, including thymocytes, macrophages and epithelial cells from breast or kidney, though different BH3-only proteins have also been implicated in this process. Gene expression profiling showed that <italic>PUMA</italic> and not <italic>BIM</italic> is transcriptionally induced in neuroblastoma cells undergoing ER stress, and RNAi-mediated suppression of PUMA protected HCT116 cells against thapsigargin-induced apoptosis, albeit not completely <xref rid="pone.0039586-Reimertz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Alternately, PUMA as well as NOXA were reported to be critical mediators of ER stress-induced apoptosis in MEF's in a p53-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0039586-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is thus conceivable that BIM cooperates with PUMA in this apoptotic pathway and may regulate cell death to varying extents in different cell types in response to ER stress. ER stress was shown to activate BIM through two novel pathways, involving protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation, which prevents its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and CHOP-mediated direct transcriptional induction <xref rid="pone.0039586-Puthalakath1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In another recent study, CHOP was shown to bind to the <italic>Puma</italic> promoter during ER stress and CHOP knockdown attenuated PUMA induction and neuronal apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0039586-Galehdar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>

      <p>CHOP is thought to be the critical mediator of ER stress-induced apoptosis and studies using <italic>Chop</italic>-null mice have established the role of CHOP in ER stress-induced apoptosis in a number of disease models <xref rid="pone.0039586-Zinszner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0039586-Namba1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. CHOP is present in the cytosol under non-stressed conditions and ER stress leads to its induction and nuclear accumulation <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ron1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Expression of CHOP is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level <xref rid="pone.0039586-Okada1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, though CHOP protein undergoes phosphorylation by the p38 MAP kinase family which enhances its transcriptional ability and the apoptotic response <xref rid="pone.0039586-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Maytin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. FOXO3a (forkhead box, class O, 3a) belongs to the family of mammalian forkhead transcription factors, including FOXO3a (or FKHRL1), FOXO1a (or FKHR), and FOXO4a (or AFX), which are regulated by growth factor receptor-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (or protein kinase B) signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0039586-Brunet1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0039586-del1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Activation of AKT causes phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factors, in the case of FOXO3a at the threonine32, serine253, and serine315 sites <xref rid="pone.0039586-Brunet1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Phosphorylation of FOXO3a promotes its redistribution from the nucleus to the cytosol and therefore reduces its DNA binding and transcriptional activity <xref rid="pone.0039586-Biggs1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that activation of FOXO3a by decreasing its phosphorylation and increasing its nuclear content can stimulate the expression of proteins that are involved in either apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0039586-Brunet1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or cell cycle arrest <xref rid="pone.0039586-Kops1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> in different types of cells. FOXO3a is an important regulator of BIM expression in neurons in response to NGF withdrawal <xref rid="pone.0039586-Gilley1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and alterations in the AKT-FOXO3a axis have been reported to affect BIM expression in neurons in response to hypoxia-ischemia <xref rid="pone.0039586-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> or ER stress <xref rid="pone.0039586-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. FOXO3a has also emerged as a key transcriptional regulator of PUMA expression in response to cytokine withdrawal <xref rid="pone.0039586-You1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and other cytotoxic stimuli <xref rid="pone.0039586-Dudgeon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Amente1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>

<sup>â/â</sup> mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). All mice were backcrossed for at least 6 generations onto the C57BL/6J background. The morning on which a vaginal plug was seen was designated as embryonic Day 0.5 (E0.5). Pregnant mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane and sacrificed on gestational day 14 by cervical dislocation. Embryos (E14.5) were removed for generation of telencephalic neuronal cultures and tail and limb samples were taken for DNA extraction and PCR analyses. Mice were housed and cared for according to the <italic>NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

        <title>CHOP interacts with FOXO3a in neuronal cells in response to ER stress</title>
        <p>ER stress causes an induction of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP that then activates its various downstream targets. Similarly, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0039586-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> FOXO3a undergoes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation in neuronal cells in response to ER stress in a PI3K-AKT dependent manner. To assess the localization of CHOP and FOXO3a in response to ER stress, we performed nuclear and cytosolic fractionation studies and assessed the levels of CHOP and total FOXO3a in these fractions. Consistent with previous reports, we found an increase in CHOP protein levels in the nuclear fraction after treatment with tunicamycin. Similarly, we observed an increase in the levels of FOXO3a in the nuclear fraction after treatment with tunicamycin, while the transcriptionally inactive, phosphorylated FOXO3a remained in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039586-g007">Fig. 7a</xref>). Thus our results suggest alterations in the nuclear fractions of the key transcription factors CHOP and FOXO3a in response to tunicamycin treatment. To test for a functional interaction between CHOP and FOXO3a in response to ER stress, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Protein extracts from untreated and tunicamycin treated cells were subjected to Co-IP with an antibody against FOXO3a or control resin, and subsequently analyzed through Western blotting with an anti-CHOP polyclonal antibody. Representative results demonstrate that CHOP was co-precipitated with the anti-FOXO3a antibody but not with the control resin in comparison to the input controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039586-g007">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Increasing evidence points to the role of ER stress in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. Aberrant aggregated proteins and elevation of markers of ER stress have been observed in dying neurons in animal models of ischemia <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ogawa2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, Parkinson disease <xref rid="pone.0039586-Silva1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, Huntington disease <xref rid="pone.0039586-Reijonen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and Alzheimer disease <xref rid="pone.0039586-Kudo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. It is thus essential to delineate the mechanisms by which ER stress can induce apoptosis in neuronal cells. Our current results support previous studies indicating that ER stress in neuronal cells upregulates key pro-apoptotic molecules PUMA and BIM, and that PUMA critically regulates ER stress-induced neuronal apoptosis. Loss of CHOP expression attenuated PUMA and BIM induction in response to ER stress in neuronal cells. Our results also indicate that CHOP may potentially interact with FOXO3a, a common upstream transcriptional regulator of <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Bim</italic> expression in neuronal cells in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039586-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), though further knockdown studies are needed in support of our preliminary data and to determine the functional significance of this interaction. These findings highlight the complex roles of CHOP in mediating ER stress-induced apoptosis by transcriptional mechanisms and also by mediating protein-protein interactions.</p>
      <p>The BH3-only proteins sense and relay stress signals, and are activated in a cell-type- and stimulus-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0039586-Willis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The BH3-only proteins activate BAX and BAK directly or indirectly, by engaging and neutralizing their pro-survival relatives, which otherwise constrain BAX and BAK from causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization <xref rid="pone.0039586-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. PUMA and BIM have been implicated in regulating apoptosis in response to ER stress <xref rid="pone.0039586-Puthalakath1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Galehdar1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and consistent with previous studies, we show that PUMA and BIM are both induced in neuronal cells in response to ER stress, though the transcriptional induction of <italic>PUMA</italic> alone is critical for the apoptotic response. We and others have previously demonstrated that the induction of PUMA in response to genotoxic stress is mediated by p53 <xref rid="pone.0039586-Akhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Wyttenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, we did not observe changes in upstream p53 signaling in response to ER stress in neuronal cells, and p53-deficient telencephalic neurons were not protected against tunicamycin-induced cell death or caspase-3 activation suggesting that PUMA-dependent ER stress-induced death occurs independent of p53 expression.</p>
      <p>The most significant ER stress-induced apoptotic pathway is mediated through CHOP. CHOP/GADD153 is a bZiP transcription factor that is induced through the ATF6 and PERK UPR pathways <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ron1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. One of the more widely cited mechanisms of CHOP-induced apoptosis is suppression of the pro-survival protein BCL2 <xref rid="pone.0039586-McCullough1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Other CHOP-induced molecules that have been implicated in apoptosis include death receptor-5 (DR5; TRAIL-R2) and Tribbles-related protein 3 (TRB3). A previous study using multiple ER stressors demonstrated the importance of BIM in ER-stress-induced apoptosis in some cell types but not others. ER stress increased BIM levels through both decreased proteasomal degradation and CHOP C/EBPÎ±-mediated gene induction <xref rid="pone.0039586-Puthalakath1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our results indicate that CHOP regulates expression of both PUMA and BIM in neuronal cells in response to ER stress, but that PUMA plays a more significant role than BIM in mediating death. Although our study clearly demonstrates the important involvement of CHOP signaling in ER-stress-induced neuronal apoptosis, it is evident that inhibition of this pathway does not completely abrogate the transcriptional induction of PUMA or cell death. This suggests that additional transcriptional factors may contribute to PUMA activation during ER-stress-induced apoptosis or PUMA may co-operate with other BH3-only proteins such as BIM and BID to mediate the full apoptotic response. One such key transcription factor that is known to modulate neuronal expression of PUMA and BIM in response to cytokine withdrawal is FOXO3a <xref rid="pone.0039586-You1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. FOXO3a undergoes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation in response to ER stress and this modification allows its transcriptional activation <xref rid="pone.0039586-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, though its downstream targets in response to ER stress are not well defined.</p>
      <p>CHOP protein is composed of two known functional domains, an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain consisting of a basic amino-acid-rich DNA-binding region followed by a leucine zipper dimerization motif <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ron1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ubeda1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Deletion mutant analysis of CHOP revealed that the bZIP domain is important for CHOP-induced apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0039586-Maytin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The high conservation (&gt;90%) in the bZIP domain of the C/EBP members allows for formation of homodimers and heterodimers of the members <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ron1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, CHOP can enhance the transcriptional activation of AP-1 by tethering to the AP-1 complex without direct binding of DNA <xref rid="pone.0039586-Ubeda2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. A growing body of evidence also suggests that CHOP-mediated apoptosis occurs through non-transcriptional mechanisms such as proteinâprotein interactions <xref rid="pone.0039586-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039586-Gotoh1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Thus, the regulation of CHOP-mediated apoptosis and its downstream targets is complex. According to a recent report, CHOP co-operates with AP-1 to mediate PUMA expression in a model of hepatic lipoapoptosis <xref rid="pone.0039586-Cazanave1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. TRB3 a recently characterized downstream target of CHOP, was shown to directly interact with AKT and suppress the phosphorylation of this kinase in liver <xref rid="pone.0039586-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Our results indicate that a knockdown of CHOP expression in SH-SY5Y cells causes a decrease in PUMA protein and <italic>Puma</italic> mRNA levels in response to ER stress, suggesting that CHOP is a direct regulator of PUMA expression in response to ER stress. However, CHOP knowkdown does not completely restore PUMA expression to baseline levels suggesting that alternate transcription factors may also play a role. Our results indicate that CHOP knockdown inhibits the dephosphorylation of AKT and FOXO3a in response to ER stress in neuronal cells, suggesting that CHOP can feed into alternate signaling pathways such as the AKT/FOXO3a axis that may play a role in regulating expression of downstream pro-apoptotic genes <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Bim</italic>. The observed interaction between CHOP and FOXO3a suggests that CHOP regulation of downstream target genes such as Puma and Bim can also occur through modulation of the AKT/FOXO3a axis.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study extends and further integrates present knowledge regarding the mechanisms linking ER stress, CHOP and the induction of BH3-only molecules in ER stress-induced apoptosis. Insights into the network regulating CHOP-mediated apoptosis will potentially provide a basis for new CHOP-targeted therapeutic approaches to ER stress-associated neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
