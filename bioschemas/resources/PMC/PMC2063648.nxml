      <abstract>
        <p>Proteins that are unfolded or misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) must be refolded or degraded to maintain the homeostasis of the ER. Components of both productive folding and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanisms are known to be up-regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). We describe two novel components of mammalian ERAD, Derlin-2 and -3, which show weak homology to Der1p, a transmembrane protein involved in yeast ERAD. Both Derlin-2 and -3 are up-regulated by the UPR, and at least Derlin-2 is a target of the IRE1 branch of the response, which is known to up-regulate ER degradation enhancing Î±-mannosidaseâlike protein (EDEM) and EDEM2, receptor-like molecules for misfolded glycoprotein. Overexpression of Derlin-2 or -3 accelerated degradation of misfolded glycoprotein, whereas their knockdown blocked degradation. Derlin-2 and -3 are associated with EDEM and p97, a cytosolic ATPase responsible for extraction of ERAD substrates. These findings indicate that Derlin-2 and -3 provide the missing link between EDEM and p97 in the process of degrading misfolded glycoproteins.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ER provides an environment that facilitates the folding and assembly of newly synthesized secretory and transmembrane proteins and actively participates in the quality control of these proteins. By these means, correctly folded proteins are allowed to exit the ER to reach their final destination, whereas incompletely folded or misfolded molecules are retained in the ER. Quality control in the ER is achieved by two independent mechanisms, the productive folding mechanism, which uses various molecular chaperones and folding enzymes localized in the ER (ER chaperones), and the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanism, by which unfolded or misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytoplasm to be degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Gething and Sambrook, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Helenius et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Under a variety of conditions collectively termed ER stress, however, quality control becomes inefficient, resulting in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Essentially, all eukaryotic cells are equipped with a system to cope with protein unfolding or misfolding in the ER. Interestingly, the strategy taken is well conserved from yeast to humans: components of both the productive folding and ERAD mechanisms are induced in response to ER stress by a transcriptional program termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to accelerated refolding and degradation of unfolded proteins, respectively (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Patil and Walter, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Harding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schroder and Kaufman, 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, an as-yet-unanswered critical question is how eukaryotic cells maintain the homeostasis of the ER by balancing the refolding and degradation mechanisms to counteract ER stress or, in other words, how proteins to be refolded are discriminated from those to be degraded.</p>
      <p>Transmembrane proteins are capable of transmitting signals across the membrane, and eukaryotic cells indeed use some of these molecules as sensors and transducers of ER stress for the UPR. Among these, Ire1p/Ire-1/IRE1 is an ER membraneâbound endoribonuclease conserved from yeast to humans. IRE1 initiates unconventional (frame switch) splicing in response to ER stress and has the substrates yeast HAC1 mRNA and metazoan XBP1 mRNA encoding the UPR-specific transcription factors Hac1p and XBP1, respectively. As a result of frame-switch splicing, the DNA binding domain and activation domain of these substrates are joined to produce a transcription factor capable of activating transcription efficiently (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mori, 2003</xref>). A second transmembrane UPR signal transducer is pek-1/PERK, an ER membraneâbound protein kinase conserved in metazoan cells. PERK activated in response to ER stress phosphorylates the Î± subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, resulting in a general attenuation of translation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ron, 2002</xref>). The third UPR transducer is ATF6, an ER membraneâbound transcription factor whose involvement in the UPR has to date been clarified for mammalian cells only. Upon ER stress, ATF6 is subjected to regulated intramembrane proteolysis, leading to liberation of the cytosolic transcription factor domain, which translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mori, 2003</xref>). We are currently investigating the roles of the IRE1âXBP1 and ATF6 pathways in the homeostasis of the ER and have proposed a time-dependent phase-transition model based on differential properties of the two signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>; see Discussion).</p>
      <p>Various components of ERAD have also been identified (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wilhovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2002</xref>). Among these, ER degradation enhancing Î±-mannosidaseâlike protein (EDEM) is a key component, as it targets misfolded glycoproteins to the proteasome, presumably by directly recognizing a signal that is present in misfolded glycoproteins, such as Man8GlcNAc2 structure (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hosokawa et al., 2001</xref>). Transcription of EDEM is ER stress inducible, and its induction depends on the IRE1âXBP1 pathway (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>). The mammalian genome contains two further EDEM-like molecules, designated EDEM2 and -3, which are also involved in the ERAD of misfolded glycoproteins and are ER stress inducible in a manner dependent on the IRE1âXBP1 pathway (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mast et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Olivari et al., 2005</xref>; Molinari, M., personal communication).</p>
      <p>Recently, two groups independently identified an interesting human protein that shows weak homology to yeast Der1p, a protein involved in yeast ERAD (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hiller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Knop et al., 1996</xref>), and designated it Derlin-1 (Der1p-like protein; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). This protein is involved in a process similar to the ERAD used by human cytomegalovirus to escape from the immune system (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wiertz et al., 1996a</xref>). In this process, the US11 protein of human cytomegalovirus causes retrotranslocation of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain (HC) from the ER to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome, in which the cytosolic ATPase p97 plays an essential role in extracting class I HC through the ER membrane (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2001</xref>). Given that Derlin-1 interacts with functional US11 but not with nonfunctional US11 and that it recruits p97 to the ER membrane, Derlin-1 is considered to provide the missing link between events on the lumenal side of the ER (recognition of class I HC by US11) and those on the cytosolic side (extraction catalyzed by p97; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). The mammalian genome contains two additional Der1p-homologous proteins, designated Derlin-2 and -3. It was recently shown that Derlin-2 forms a complex not only with p97 but also with mammalian homologues of yeast Hrd1p and -3p, proteins involved in yeast ERAD (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wilhovsky et al., 2000</xref>), similar to Derlin-1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is not known whether Derlin-2 or -3 is required for ERAD.</p>

      <p>We demonstrate that Derlin-2 and -3, proteins regulated by the UPR, are functional components of ERAD for misfolded glycoproteins and that Derlin-2 at least is a target of the IRE1âXBP1 pathway, similar to EDEM. We also discuss the role of the mammalian UPR in distinguishing proteins to be refolded from those to be degraded.</p>

        <title>Derlin-2 and -3 are novel genes regulated by the UPR</title>
        <p>We conducted a microarray analysis to identify novel ER stressâinducible genes that might be involved in determining the fate of proteins that are unfolded or misfolded in the ER. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells that had been treated for 8 h with or without tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation known to cause ER stress (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman, 1999</xref>), and the difference in expression levels was determined using the DNA chip cDNA Microarray kit human I carrying 12,814 genes. Results showed â¼300 genes that were induced more than twofold, among which we focused on one, CGI-101, because of its 2.9-fold induction by tunicamycin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>),the ability of hydrophobic stretches in its translational product to span the ER membrane several times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), and, most important, the weak homology it exhibited to yeast Der1p (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Although the role of Der1p in ERAD remains poorly understood, these results implied that CGI-101 may be a gene that connects the UPR with ERAD. Our database search also indicated that the human genome contains a gene somewhat similar to CGI-101 (designated <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FLJ43842">FLJ43842</ext-link>; available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FLJ43842">FLJ43842</ext-link>), the transcription of which we subsequently found to be induced in response to ER stress (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p>
        <p>During the course of our subsequent analyses, proteins encoded by CGI-101 and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FLJ43842">FLJ43842</ext-link> turned out to be identical to Derlin-2 and -3, respectively (see Introduction). We decided to follow this nomenclature hereafter and continued to investigate their functions, which remain largely uncharacterized. A database search indicated the presence of two variants of Derlin-3, probably resulting from alternative splicing. We refer to these short and long forms as Derlin-3 transcriptional variant (tv) 1 and 2, respectively; tv2 has 30 more amino acids at the COOH terminus than does tv1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Derlin-2 and -3 show â¼75% identity, whereas that between Derlin-1 and -2 or Derlin-1 and -3 is â¼30%.</p>
        <p>Transcript structures for Derlin-1, -2, and -3 deposited in the data bank are schematically shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>. Northern blot hybridization revealed that both a short form and a long form of Derlin-2 mRNA are expressed in both human and mouse and that in both species the short form is more abundant than the long form (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Similarly, short and long Derlin-3 mRNAs also exist, with the short form being more abundant in most human tissues; however, neither short nor long Derlin-3 mRNA was detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; unpublished data). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (B and C), Derlin-1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously. Expression of Derlin-2 mRNA also appeared ubiquitous; the apparent discrepancy in the level of Derlin-2 mRNA in skeletal muscle between <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> (lane 6) and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> (lane 3) is likely attributable to a difference in the amount of mRNA loaded (compare the levels of Î²-actin mRNA). In contrast, expression of Derlin-3 mRNA was restricted to several tissues. Both Derlin-2 and -3 mRNAs were detected abundantly in placenta and pancreas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), whereas Derlin-3 mRNA was much more abundant than Derlin-2 mRNA in spleen and small intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The biological significance of these findings remains a subject for future investigation. We conclude that the summed expression of Derlin-2 and -3 mRNAs is comparable with that of Derlin-1 mRNA.</p>

        <title>Derlin-1, -2, and probably -3 are targets of the IRE1âXBP1 pathway</title>
        <p>We asked whether the transcriptional induction of Derlin-2 in response to ER stress depends on the IRE1âXBP1 pathway, similar to that observed for EDEM. Northern blot hybridiza- tion was performed for total RNA isolated from IRE1Î±+/+, IRE1Î±â/â, XBP1+/+, and XBP1â/â MEFs that had been treated with 10 Î¼g/ml tunicamycin. Consistent with our previous results (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>), mRNA encoding binding protein (BiP), a major ER chaperone, was similarly induced in response to tunicamycin treatment in both wild-type cells and cells lacking IRE1Î± or XBP1, whereas induction of EDEM mRNA observed in wild-type cells was abolished in cells lacking IRE1Î± or XBP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We found that Derlin-2 mRNA was induced in response to tunicamycin treatment, albeit less efficiently than BiP mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 1â5 and 11â15), consistent with the results of microarray analysis shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>. We also found that Derlin-1 mRNA was ER stress inducible (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 1â5 and 11â15). Importantly, induction of Derlin-1 or -2 observed in wild-type cells was greatly attenuated in cells lacking IRE1Î± or XBP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 6â10 and 16â20). These results indicated that Derlin-1 and -2 are targets of the IRE1âXBP1 pathway of the UPR.</p>
        <p>Derlin-3 mRNA was induced in tunicamycin-treated human cells, such as 293T, and HeLa cells, and the extent of induction was greater than that of Derlin-2 mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). However, the dependence of Derlin-3 mRNA induction on the IRE1âXBP1 pathway could not be examined because Derlin-3 mRNA was not detected in MEFs (unpublished data). Nonetheless, Derlin-3 is considered to be a target of the IRE1âXBP1 pathway because the induction time course of Derlin-3 mRNA was similar to that of Derlin-2 and EDEM mRNA but clearly slower than that of BiP mRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), reflecting the differences in DNA binding specificity and activation mechanisms between ATF6 and XBP1 (see Discussion). These results suggested that, similar to Derlin-1 and EDEM, Derlin-2 and -3 might be components of ERAD.</p>

        <p>To determine the localization of Derlin-2 and -3, their NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal c-myc epitopeâtagged versions were transfected into HeLa cells. An indirect immunofluorescence analysis of transfected cells revealed that Derlin-2 or -3 was colocalized with Sec61Î² (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), a component of the translocon in the ER (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 1994</xref>).

<bold>Characterization of Derlin-2 and -3.</bold> (A) HeLa cells were trans-fected with plasmid to express each Derlin tagged with the c-myc epitope at the respective NH<sub>2</sub> terminus.

(B) HEK293 cells were trans-fected with plasmid to express each Derlin tagged with the c-myc epitope at the respective COOH terminus. Postnuclear supernatant of transfected cells was incubated with increasing amounts of trypsin (0, 4, 8, and 16 Î¼g for lane 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) for 15 min at 4Â°C. Immunoblotting analysis of the samples was performed using anti-myc, antiâNH<sub>2</sub> terminus of calnexin (CNX[N]), antiâCOOH terminus of calnexin (CNX[C]), and anti-calreticulin (CRT) antibodies.

        <p>Derlin-1 is considered to be a protein that spans the ER membrane four times, with both its NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini facing the cytosol (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2004</xref>), and Derlin-2 and -3 contain four hydrophobic stretches at positions similar to that of Derlin-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To determine actual topology, Derlin-2 or -3 tagged with the c-myc epitope at the respective COOH terminus was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and microsomes isolated from transfected cells were digested with trypsin. Calnexin, which is a type I transmembrane protein in the ER, and calreticulin, which is a soluble lumenal protein, were used as controls. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, the COOH termini of Derlin-2 and -3 were not protected against trypsin digestion, as was also the case for Derlin-1 and calnexin but not for calreticulin and the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of calnexin, which remained intact.</p>
        <p>Similar protease-sensitivity experiments conducted on Derlin-2 and -3 tagged with the c-myc epitope at the respective NH<sub>2</sub> terminus gave rise to complicated results (unpublished data). The mode of insertion into the ER membrane may not have been uniform when NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally tagged Derlin-2 or -3 was overexpressed, even though they were functional (see the following section). This notion was supported by the finding from the pulse-chase analysis that NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally tagged proteins were much more unstable than COOH-terminally tagged proteins, albeit with more abundant expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Formal conclusion that endogenous Derlin-2 and -3 are four-transmembrane proteins in the ER with both their NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini facing the cytosol thus requires analysis of their topology by raising antibodies against their NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini.</p>

        <title>Derlin-2 and -3 are required for ERAD</title>
        <p>We next examined whether Derlin-2 and -3 are indeed involved in ERAD using two approaches, overexpression and knockdown experiments. Because a previous study indicated that Derlin-2 does not participate in US11-mediated degradation of class I HC, a transmembrane protein in the ER (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>), we chose as substrate a soluble lumenal protein misfolded in the ER, the null Hong Kong (NHK) mutant of Î±1-proteinase inhibitor (Î±1-PI, also called Î±1-antitrypsin; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sifers et al., 1988</xref>). NHK glycosylated and misfolded in the lumen of the ER is recognized by EDEM for destruction by the proteasome in the cytosol (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hosokawa et al., 2001</xref>). Pulse-chase experiments followed by immunoprecipitation analysis with antibody against Î±1-PI showed that NHK was degraded with a half-life of &lt;3 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, lanes 1â3). Importantly, overexpression of Derlin-2 or -3 accelerated the degradation of NHK to a half-life of â¼1.5 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, lanes 4â9). This acceleration was comparable with that observed with overexpression of EDEM (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hosokawa et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, both Derlin-2 and -3 were coimmunoprecipitated with NHK when cells were lysed with buffer containing 1% NP-40 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), and this association was lost when they were lysed with buffer containing 1% SDS (not depicted). Thus, as in the case of Derlin-1, Derlin-2 and -3 interact with the substrate to be degraded.</p>

        <p>We then asked whether overexpression of Derlin-2 and -3 also affects degradation of nonglycoproteins misfolded in the ER. A previously modified NHK designated NHK(QQQ), in which all asparagines of three potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites are mutated to glutamine, was shown to degrade quite rapidly (Hosokawa, N., personal communication) with a half-life of â¼1 h, which is even shorter than that of NHK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, lanes 1â3). Results showed that overexpression of Derlin-2 or -3 did not significantly accelerate the degradation of NHK(QQQ) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, lanes 4â9), indicating that Derlin-2 and -3 induced by the UPR assist in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins but not in that of misfolded nonglycoproteins. Unexpectedly, both Derlin-2 and -3 coimmunoprecipitated with NHK(QQQ) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), indicating that the binding activity of Derlin-2 and -3 is not simply correlated with their degradation activity. In this connection, we also found that EDEM located upstream of Derlin-2 and -3 in the degradation process (see the following section) can bind to NHK and NHK(QQQ) with similar efficiency (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>We then examined the effect of reducing Derlin-2 and -3 levels on the degradation of NHK. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to two regions each of Derlin-2 or -3 were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pSUPER to produce short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that act as short interfering RNAâlike molecules in transfected cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Brummelkamp et al., 2002</xref>). The knockdown efficiencies of these constructs were determined by Northern blot hybridization. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, they effectively suppressed expression of Derlin-2 or -3 without affecting that of other Derlins significantly. We therefore transfected HEK293 cells with these pSUPER derivatives together with the plasmid for expression of NHK. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that degradation of NHK became inefficient in cells with reduced levels of Derlin-2 or -3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>), indicating that they are functional components of ERAD for misfolded glycoprotein. We obtained no indication from reporter assays that the UPR was activated in these knockdown cells (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>Because a reduction in the expression of Derlin-2 or -3 alone effectively blocked the degradation of NHK, we explored the possibility that Derlin-2 and -3 are heterooligomerized. Results of cotransfection experiments clearly showed coimmunoprecipitatation of HA-tagged Derlin-3 with myc-tagged Derlin-2 and that of myc-tagged Derlin-2 with HA-tagged Derlin-3 in a fairly stoichiometric manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, lanes 6 and 8, respectively). On the other hand, Derlin-1 was found to be poorly associated with Derlin-3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that Derlin-2 and -3 may constitute a group distinct from Derlin-1, as suggested from the distances in the phylogenic tree (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>). As a reduction in the expression of Derlin-2, Derlin-3, or both had little effect on the synthesis and secretion of the wild-type Î±1-PI (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>), we concluded that they are required for the ERAD of a soluble misfolded glycoprotein but not for the maturation of a correctly foldable protein.</p>

        <title>Derlin-2 and -3 are associated with p97 and EDEM</title>
        <p>We next determined whether Derlin-2 and -3 are able to associate with known components of ERAD, such as p97, by pulse labeling HEK293 cells expressing COOH-terminal c-mycâtagged versions of Derlin-2 or -3 by transfection, followed by immunoprecipitation. Analysis with anti-p97 antibody revealed that every Derlin coimmunoprecipitated with p97 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, a, lanes 7â10). In contrast, analysis with anti-myc antibody did not detect significant p97 coimmunoprecipitation with any of the Derlins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, a, lanes 2â5). However, when FLAG-tagged p97 was overexpressed by cotransfection, each Derlin coimmunoprecipitated with p97 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, b, lanes 7â10) and FLAG-p97 coimmunoprecipitated with each Derlin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, b, lanes 2â5).

        <p>We then examined whether Derlins are also able to associate with EDEM. A similar immunoprecipitation analysis was performed in HEK293 cells expressing HA-tagged EDEM and one of the three Derlins tagged with the c-myc epitope at the respective NH<sub>2</sub> terminus by transfection. Immunoprecipitation with both anti-myc and anti-HA antibodies revealed an association between EDEM and Derlin-2 and -3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, a, lanes 2â4 and 7â9) but not Derlin-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, a, compare lanes 5 and 10 with lanes 1 and 6, respectively), indicating a functional difference between Derlin-1 and a group consisting of Derlin-2 and -3. This notion was further confirmed by the next series of immunoprecipitation analyses. Immunoprecipitation with anti-p97 antibody revealed no association between EDEM and p97, even though HA-tagged EDEM was overexpressed in HEK293 cells by transfection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, b, compare lane 6 with 5). Importantly, however, immunoprecipitation with anti-p97 antibody did reveal that there was an association between EDEM and p97 when Derlin-2 was overexpressed simultaneously with EDEM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, b, compare lane 7 with 6). In contrast, cooverexpression of Derlin-1 did not mediate the association of p97 with EDEM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, b, compare lane 8 with 6). As the level of Derlin-1 coimmunoprecipitated with p97 was lower than that of Derlin-2 in this experiment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, b, compare lane 8 with 7), we increased the amount of Derlin-1âexpressing plasmid DNA in the next experiment. As a result, the level of Derlin-1 coimmunoprecipitated with p97 became comparable with that of Derlin-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, c, compare lane 4 with 3). Nevertheless, only Derlin-2 mediated the association of EDEM with p97 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, c, compare lane 3 with 4).</p>
        <p>We further examined whether Derlin-2 mediates association of NHK with p97. Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed in HEK293 cells expressing NHK and Derlin-2 or -1 tagged with the c-myc epitope at the respective NH<sub>2</sub> terminus by transfection. Immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody revealed coimmunoprecipitation of NHK with Derlin-2 but not with Derlin-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 7 with 5). Immunoprecipitation with anti-p97 antibody showed no direct interaction between p97 and NHK (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, lane 2). Importantly, however, p97 became associated with NHK when Derlin-2 was overexpressed simultaneously (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, lane 3) and the NHKâDerlin-2 complex recovered with anti-p97 antibody was quantitatively similar to that recovered with anti-myc antibody (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, lanes 3 and 6, respectively), strongly indicating that Derlin-2 associated with p97 was the same molecule as that associated with NHK. In contrast, Derlin-1 failed to mediate the association of NHK with p97 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>, lane 4).</p>
        <p>These results prompted us to examine the effect of a reduction in the level of Derlin-1 on the degradation of NHK. It was recently reported that a sequence corresponding to a part of Derlin-1 successfully decreased the level of Derlin-1 without affecting that of Derlin-2 when incorporated into the shRNA vector (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2005</xref>). We confirmed this observation by immunoblotting in our system (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 3). Similarly, our shRNA vector for Derlin-2 succeeded in decreasing the level of Derlin-2 without affecting that of Derlin-1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 4). Interestingly, knockdown of Derlin-1 had little effect on the degradation of NHK, whereas that of Derlin-3 reproducibly blocked it (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>). On the basis of these results, we concluded that Derlin-2 and -3, but not Derlin-1, function downstream of EDEM and are required for the degradation of NHK, a misfolded glycoprotein substrate of ERAD, although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that the residual amount of Derlin-1 in Derlin-1 knocked down cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, lane 3) is sufficient for the degradation of NHK.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Proteins misfolded in the ER are degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol via a process called ERAD, in which misfolded proteins are recognized inside the ER lumen, targeted to a channel, extracted from the ER membrane, and delivered to the proteasome (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wilhovsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2002</xref>). Misfolded glycoproteins are recognized by presentation of an N-linked oligosaccharide processing intermediates, such as Man8GlcNAc2 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Jakob et al., 1998</xref>), which acts as a motif that triggers binding to EDEM (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hosokawa et al., 2001</xref>). In this way, glycoproteins that are unable to fold properly are transferred from calnexin, a glucoprotein-specific molecular chaperone, to EDEM (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Molinari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Oda et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequently, the cytosolic multifunctional protein p97 acts to extract the glycoprotein from the ER membrane (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Dai and Li, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Braun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2002</xref>). However, the events that link these two steps have remained undefined.</p>
      <p>The recent identification of Derlin-1 has brought new insights into the molecular mechanism of the US11-mediated retrotranslocation of class I HC, providing a missing link between events in the ER and those in the cytosol (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). Further, the findings that Derlin-1 binds to misfolded and ubiquitinated proteins and that RNA interference of Derlin-1 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> evokes ER stress suggest a more generalized role of Derlin-1 in ERAD (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). Recent studies demonstrated that Derlin-1 is associated with ubiquitin ligases such as HRD1 and gp78 via binding to p97 and vasolin-containing protein (VCP)âinteracting membrane protein and that Derlin-2 also forms such a multiprotein complex, consisting of p97, VCP-interacting membrane protein, HRD1, and HRD3/SEL1L (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2005</xref>). However, it remains to be determined whether Derlin-2 is required for ERAD.</p>
      <p>We show that the properties of Derlin-2 and -3 are exactly those expected for proteins able to provide the missing link between EDEM and p97 in the process of degrading glycoproteins misfolded in the ER. Derlin-2 and -3 are transmembrane proteins that span the ER membrane multiple times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and are required for the ERAD of misfolded glycoprotein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). They are associated with the degradation substrate, p97, and EDEM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). p97 and EDEM form a complex only in the presence of Derlin-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>), and Derlin-2 mediates the association of p97 with the degradation substrate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). In contrast, Derlin-1 does not mediate the association of p97 with either EDEM or the degradation substrate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>). This specificity might be attributable to differences in amino acid sequences between Derlin-1 and -2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or, as Derlin-1 and -2 or -3 appear to be associated with different cellular proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), to differences in accessory proteins.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, MEFs express only Derlin-2 mRNA, whereas human cells express both Derlin-2 and -3 mRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and not depicted). In addition, Derlin-2 and -3 mRNAs are distributed differently in various human tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The finding that the knockdown of Derlin-2 or -3 alone effectively blocked the degradation of a misfolded glycoprotein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>) suggested that they may form heterooligomers to function when expressed simultaneously, and this was indeed shown to be the case (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Similarly, they may form homooligomers when expressed singularly. It is of great interest whether Derlin-2 and -3 themselves can form a channel through which misfolded glycoproteins move from the ER lumen to the cytosol, as has been proposed for Derlin-1 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2004</xref>). We are also aware of a recent study showing that the proteasome binds directly to Sec61 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Kalies et al., 2005</xref>), supporting the idea that misfolded proteins are retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol through the translocon as originally proposed (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wiertz et al., 1996b</xref>). Thus, it appears that we are a far way from any conclusive determination on this issue.</p>
      <p>The UPR consists of transcriptional control only in yeast, and the Ire1p-mediated program covers transcriptional induction of not only ER chaperones but also components of ERAD in response to ER stress (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Patil and Walter, 2001</xref>). On this basis, the UPR plays little role in determining the fate of unfolded or misfolded proteins in yeast ER. The activated refolding system and degradation system may deal with unfolded proteins in a competitive manner. In contrast, metazoan cells have developed the ability to attenuate translation via activation by PERK in response to ER stress, thereby decreasing the burden on the ER (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ron, 2002</xref>). Mammals have further evolved two signaling pathways, namely the ATF6 and IRE1âXBP1 pathways, for transcriptional induction of ER chaperones and components of ERAD in response to ER stress (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mori, 2003</xref>). The transcription factor ATF6 is activated by a posttranslational mechanism, whereas the transcription factor XBP1 is activated by a posttranscriptional mechanism, causing the active form of ATF6 to be detected in cell extracts earlier than the active form of XBP1. In addition, XBP1 has broader target specificity than ATF6. Thus, the transcription of genes unaffected by the active form of ATF6 can be later induced by the active form of XBP1, allowing a time-dependent decision (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Accumulating evidence indicates that the ATF6 pathway mainly controls the expression of ER chaperones, whereas the IRE1âXBP1 pathway regulates the expression of not only ER chaperones but also components of ERAD such as EDEM, EDEM2, and HRD1 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kaneko et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Olivari et al., 2005</xref>). Our present analysis adds Derlin-1, -2, and probably -3 to the list of targets of the IRE1âXBP1 pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). We have also found that the misfolded glycoprotein NHK was degraded more slowly in IRE1Î±â/â cells than in IRE1Î±+/+ cells (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the misfolded nonglycoprotein NHK(QQQ) was degraded at similar rates in both cell types (unpublished data). These results strongly support our time-dependent phase-transition model for determining the fate of proteins that are unfolded or misfolded in the mammalian ER, at least as far as glycoproteins are concerned, in which the ATF6-mediated unidirectional phase (refolding only) is shifted to the XBP1-mediated bidirectional phase (refolding plus degradation) depending on the quality, quantity, or both of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>). The availability of multiple pathways for transcriptional control confers diversity for mammalian cells to adjust to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER.</p>

In the other three analyses, the labeling dyes were swapped to avoid false induction resulting from biased labeling. Labeled cDNAs were mixed and hybridized with a human 1 cDNA microarray kit (Agilent Technologies), on which 12,814 human cDNA clones were spotted. Fluorescence intensities of cyanine 3 and 5 were determined for each spot using a GenePix 4000B and GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and normalized so that the sum of cyanine 3 intensities of all spots was equal to that of cyanine 5 intensities of all spots. Fold induction caused by tunicamycin treatment was defined as the ratio of normalized intensity for treated cells to that for untreated cells.</p>
