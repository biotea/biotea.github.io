      <abstract>
        <p>Cellular stresses trigger autophagy to remove damaged macromolecules and organelles. Lysosomes âhost' multiple stress-sensing mechanisms that trigger the coordinated biogenesis of autophagosomes and lysosomes. For example, transcription factor (TF)EB, which regulates autophagy and lysosome biogenesis, is activated following the inhibition of mTOR, a lysosome-localized nutrient sensor. Here we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate TFEB via a lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism independent of mTOR. Exogenous oxidants or increasing mitochondrial ROS levels directly and specifically activate lysosomal TRPML1 channels, inducing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. This activation triggers calcineurin-dependent TFEB-nuclear translocation, autophagy induction and lysosome biogenesis. When TRPML1 is genetically inactivated or pharmacologically inhibited, clearance of damaged mitochondria and removal of excess ROS are blocked. Furthermore, TRPML1's ROS sensitivity is specifically required for lysosome adaptation to mitochondrial damage. Hence, TRPML1 is a ROS sensor localized on the lysosomal membrane that orchestrates an autophagy-dependent negative-feedback programme to mitigate oxidative stress in the cell.</p>

    <p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated mainly as byproducts of mitochondrial respiration, and their cytosolic levels are tightly controlled by multiple anti-oxidant mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A regulatory imbalance can result in elevated ROS levels and oxidative stress, which are believed to underlie a variety of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as aging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Although high levels of ROS may additionally cause severe oxidative damage of proteins and lipids, a moderate ROS increase may serve as a sufficient âsignal' to trigger autophagy and other cell-survival mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Autophagy can target oxidized and damaged biomaterials selectively for lysosomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Because unhealthy mitochondria may further augment ROS production, ROS-induced mitophagy is required for effective removal of excess ROS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Hence, ROS and autophagy may constitute a negative feedback mechanism that mitigates oxidative stress and promotes cell survival.</p>
    <p>Autophagy is a multi-step catabolic process that involves initiation (that is, phagophore formation), autophagosome biogenesis, lysosome biogenesis, autophagosomeâlysosome fusion and lysosomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. ROS are known to induce autophagy, but the mechanisms underlying this induction are poorly understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. ATG4, a cysteine protease and component of the cellular autophagy machinery, was recently identified as a direct target of ROS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Oxidized ATG4 promotes lipidation of LC3 (a.k.a. ATG8), a process that is essential for autophagy initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Because coping with prolonged oxidative stress may require sustained autophagy and sufficient lysosome supplies to achieve efficient autophagosomeâlysosome fusion in an ongoing manner, it is hypothesized that the lysosome-participating steps of autophagy need to be upregulated in a coordinated manner by ROS signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Indeed, given the essential role of lysosomes in autophagic clearance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, inadequate lysosomal function inevitably leads to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, even though autophagy induction is often elevated under these pathological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
    <p>Lysosomes are organelles that âhost' important nutrient-sensitive molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. mTOR (the mechanistic target of rapamycin), described as the master regulator of growth, is a nutrient sensor that resides on lysosomal membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Under starvation conditions, inhibition of mTOR results in a decrease in the phosphorylation of transcription factor (TF)EB, a master transcriptional regulator of both autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Dephosphorylated TFEB proteins translocate rapidly to the nucleus from the cytosol and lysosomes, inducing or increasing the expression of a unique set of genes that are related specifically to autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. It is not yet known whether the mTORâTFEB pathway regulates lysosome function in response to other cellular stresses.</p>
    <p>Very recently, it was reported that TFEB-nuclear translocation can also be stimulated by lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase calcineurin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is believed to be mediated by mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1 (a member of the transient receptor potential channel family), a.k.a. TRPML1), a key Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting channel on the lysosomal membrane that releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the lumen into the cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, it is unclear whether and how TRPML1 is activated by specific autophagy-inducing conditions, for example, oxidative stress and nutrient starvation.</p>
    <p>Lysosomes are required for quality-control regulation of mitochondria, and oxidative stress is a common feature of lysosome storage diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Recent studies suggest that mitochondria, the major source of endogenous ROS, are localized in close physical proximity to lysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Hence the lysosomal membrane is potentially an accessible and direct target of ROS signalling. Given that ROS reportedly regulate ion channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we hypothesize that lysosomal conductances, particularly through lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels such as TRPML1, may mediate ROS regulation of lysosomal function.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we demonstrate a direct and specific activation of lysosomal TRPML1 channels by both exogenous oxidants and mitochondria-derived ROS in the endolysosomal patch-clamp recordings. This ROS-induced TRPML1 activation leads to lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, calcineurin-dependent TFEB-nuclear translocation and increases of LC3-II expression and autophagy. Genetic inactivation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPML1 impairs ROS-induced autophagy and blocks the clearance of damaged mitochondria and removal of excess ROS.</p>

        <title>Oxidants specifically activate lysosomal TRPML1 channels</title>
        <p>We investigated the effects of oxidants on whole-endolysosome conductances in vacuolin-1-enlarged endolysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> under a variety of experimental conditions in various cell types. In COS-1 cells overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged TRPML1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), whole-endolysosome TRPML1-mediated currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub><sc>)</sc> were activated strongly by bath application of chloramine T (ChT), a non-selective strong oxidant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Unlike the responses to known TRPML1 agonists (that is, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and mucolipin-specific synthetic agonists (ML-SAs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), activation by ChT persisted several minutes after washout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Sustained ChT-activated <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> was inhibited by the mucolipin-specific synthetic inhibitors (ML-SIs), but at concentrations higher than that are typically used to block TRPML1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). ChT activated <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 73.5Â±9.5âÎ¼M (meanÂ±s.e.m., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and with a potency comparable to those of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and ML-SA1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). ChT-, but not ML-SA1-, activation was abolished selectively by pretreatment with dithiothreitol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), a reducing agent that is presumed to affect the overall redox status of the cell. Several other commonly used oxidants, including NaOCl, <italic>N</italic>-chlorosuccinimide, thimerosal, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and <italic>t</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) also readily, albeit less potently, activated <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Although relatively high concentrations (for example, 1â10âmM; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were required for noticeable <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> activation <italic>in vitro</italic>, TBHP, a stable form of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), elicited <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> at much lower concentrations (&lt;1âmM; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). On the other hand, cysteine-modifying oxidants that are known to modulate several TRP channels, such as DTNP and DTNB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), failed to activate <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Likewise, the NO-donor SNAP and the reactive lipid peroxidation intermediate 4-HNE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> did not affect <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that oxidants activate lysosomal TRPML1 channels via a distinct and novel mechanism.</p>
        <p>We next investigated the mechanisms of oxidant-induced TRPML1 activation. Specifically, we tested whether the effect is direct in HEK293 cells expressing TRPML1-4A, a surface-expressing mutant TRPML1 channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In the inside-out, but not whole-cell, configuration, both ChT and NaOCl activated <italic>I</italic><sub><sc>TRPML1-4A</sc></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 7 and 8</xref>), suggesting that the action is from the cytoplasmic side. ChT induced a dramatic and sustained increase in the channel open probability (NPopen) of single TRPML1 currents, which had a single-channel conductance comparable to the ML-SA1-activated currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>).

        <p>Unlike mouse and human TRPML1, oxidants failed to activate several other closely-related lysosome-localized channels, which include mouse TRPML2, mouse TRPML3, mouse two-pore channel-2 (TPC2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 7â9</xref>), and a zebrafish homologue of mammalian TRPML1 (zTRPML1.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

In contrast, no measureable ChT-activated inward currents were detected in TRPML1 knockout (KO) mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>), suggesting that TRPML1 is the primary ROS-regulated conductance in the lysosome.</p>

Following 1âh exposure to CCCP (5â10âÎ¼M) or rotenone (10âÎ¼M), intracellular ROS levels increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), as reflected by visualization of CM-H2DCFDA, a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a commonly used membrane-permeable antioxidant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, abolished CCCP- or rotenone-induced increases in ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).

        <p>Next, we investigated the effect of CCCP-generated mitochondrial ROS on lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In COS-1 cells transfected with EGFPâTRPML1, ML-SA1-evoked lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> was increased on CCCP (10âÎ¼M) pretreatment for 1âh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2dâf</xref>). Under our experimental settings, CCCP, although known as a proton gradient de-coupler<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, did not have a direct effect on <italic>I</italic><sub>TRPML1</sub> or lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 13 and 14</xref>).

The constant Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in CCCP-treated cells, presumably mediated by constitutive activity of TRPML1, is expected to continuously decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in lysosomes. To test this possibility, glycyl-<sc>L</sc>-phenylalanine-beta-naphthylamide (GPN), a lysosome-specific substrate that causes channel-independent âleakage' of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, was employed to probe lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

        <title>TRPML1 is specifically required for ROS-induced autophagy</title>

To investigate the role of TRPML1 in this process, we measured autophagic induction in HeLa cells stably expressing mRFPâGFPâLC3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Because LC3-II is recruited specifically to phagophores and autophagosomes, and because of the pH sensitivity of the GFP signal, mRFP<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> and mRFP<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>â</sup> puncta indicate non-acidified autophagosomes and acidified autolysosomes, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Three-hour exposure to CCCP (5âÎ¼M) led to a dramatic increase in autophagosomes, and this increase could be prevented by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>).

Consistently, CCCP treatment also dramatically increased endogenous LC3-II levels in human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). All these effects of CCCP were abolished by NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>), suggesting that CCCP-induced autophagy is mediated exclusively by ROS. Consistent with the hypothesis that ROS mediated the CCCP effect, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100âÎ¼M, 3âh) treatment was sufficient to enhance autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that, in agreement with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, CCCP-mediated ROS generation induces autophagy.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, CCCP- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced autophagosome formation was blocked by BAPTA-AM (membrane-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) or ML-SI3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 17 and 18</xref>), suggesting that ROS induce autophagy via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and TRPML1-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, CCCP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment failed to increase LC3-II levels in mucolipidosis IV patient-derived TRPML1 KO (ML-IV) fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>), which exhibited high basal levels of LC3-II compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). In both WT and ML-IV cells, LC3-II levels were readily increased by Torin 1, a potent inhibitor of mTOR that is commonly used to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>), suggesting that TRPML1 has a role specifically for ROS-mediated, but not for general autophagy induction. On the other hand, artificial activation of TRPML1 by the synthetic agonist ML-SA1, or the more potent agonists ML-SA3 and ML-SA5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), was sufficient to induce mRFP<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> LC3 puncta formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>), but these effects were insensitive to NAC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>). Furthermore, the induction effect of ML-SA5 on LC3-II levels was observed in WT but not ML-IV fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that CCCP treatment may increase mitochondrial ROS, thereby activating TRPML1 to induce autophagy.</p>

        <title>TRPML1 is required for the clearance of damaged mitochondria</title>
        <p>Sustained elevation of ROS levels can cause severe oxidative damage to mitochondria, triggering mitophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. ROS-induced mitophagy may facilitate the removal of damaged mitochondria and excess ROS products in the cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. To investigate the role of TRPML1 in ROS-induced autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, we induced severe mitochondrial damage and fragmentation by exposing cells to high concentrations of CCCP for extended periods of time (for example, 10â20âÎ¼M for 3âh) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). Using JC-1 fluorescence dye<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential, we found that such CCCP treatment resulted in rapid depolarization of mitochondria (data not shown). PARKIN proteins are known to be recruited specifically to the damaged mitochondria, which are then autophagocytosed and delivered to lysosomes for degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In HeLa cells stably expressing mCherryâParkin (PARKIN stable cells), PARKIN-positive puncta were increased significantly following CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). Meanwhile, the increased LC3 puncta were often co-localized with PARKIN aggregates in GFPâLC3-overexpressing PARKIN stable cells, suggestive of increases in mitophagy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). After CCCP washout, the majority of the PARKIN-positive puncta disappeared and most mitochondria returned to the repolarized state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4aâd</xref>). The LC3-PARKIN co-localization, however, persisted during the recovery phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>), suggesting a continuous removal of damaged mitochondria through active mitophagy. In contrast, acute inhibition of TRPML1 with ML-SI3 or ML-SI4 during the CCCP treatment phase was sufficient to block the disappearance of PARKIN, even though ML-SI3 or ML-SI4 alone did not induce the prolonged accumulation of PARKIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). Accordingly, CCCP-induced LC3-PARKIN co-localization (mitophagy) was significantly suppressed by ML-SI3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). Furthermore, JC-1 recovery was also blocked in ML-IV fibroblasts, compared with WT fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that TRPML1 is required for ROS- and mitophagy-dependent clearance of damaged mitochondria.</p>
        <p>Ongoing basal level of mitophagy may protect mitochondria from damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Although low-dose (for example, 5âÎ¼M) CCCP did enhance LC3 accumulation, no significant PARKIN aggregation could be observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 16 and 23</xref>). Likewise, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (100âÎ¼M for 3âh) did not produce significant PARKIN aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>), although it did increase LC3 puncta formation and expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). However, in the presence of ML-SI3, low-dose CCCP treatment was sufficient to increase the number of PARKIN-positive puncta, although neither treatment alone had obvious effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>). Hence, low levels of ROS may be sufficient to induce mitophagy, even though not detected experimentally by PARKIN recruitment. Taken together, these results suggest that TRPML1 may have a role in preventing the accumulation of damaged mitochondria.</p>

Recent evidence suggests that TRPML1 and TFEB may form a positive-feedback loop in regulating autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In HEK293 cells stably expressing mCherryâTFEB (TFEB stable cells), we found that a mild increase in ROS levels due to CCCP treatment (5âÎ¼M for 1âh) was sufficient to induce TFEB-nuclear translocation (nuclear to cytosol ratio increased from 0.54Â±0.02 to 2.67Â±0.14 (meanÂ±s.e.m., <italic>n</italic>=3 experiments for each treatment); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Likewise, endogenous TFEB in human fibroblasts was also activated (that is, underwent nuclear translocation) in response to CCCP administration in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 24</xref>). The specificity of TFEB immunoreactivity was confirmed in TFEB KO HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 25</xref>) generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In addition, nuclear isolation analyses also demonstrated that CCCP treatment induced nuclear translocation of TFEB proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>) in TFEB stable cells. In both WT and PARKIN stable cells, CCCP (5â20âÎ¼M) activated TFEB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 26</xref>), even in the presence of NOX inhibitors, which block mitochondria-independent ROS-generating NADPH oxidases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 27</xref>). Likewise, rotenone (10âÎ¼M for 2âh) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (50âÎ¼M for 1âh) were also sufficient to induce TFEB translocation in WT HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 28 and 29</xref>). Remarkably, in all cases, TFEB-nuclear translocation, induced by CCCP, rotenone or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, was largely blocked by NAC, BAPTA-AM or ML-SI3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5aâf</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 23, 28 and 29</xref>).</p>
        <p>ROS levels are reportedly elevated during starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, a condition that activates TFEB and promotes autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Indeed, short-term (4â6âh) starvation increased ROS levels and caused TFEB-nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 30 and 31</xref>). However, starvation-induced TFEB activation was not blocked by NAC or its more potent derivative NACA, nor by ML-SI3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 30 and 31</xref>). These results suggest that starvation may induce TFEB activation via mechanisms that do not require TRPML1. Consistently, 4-h starvation induced TFEB-nuclear translocation in both WT and ML-IV human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 31</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that whereas ROS activation of TRPML1 is sufficient to activate TFEB, additional TRPML1-independent mechanisms may be responsible for starvation-induced TFEB activation.</p>

This ML-SA5-induced TFEB translocation was sensitive to BAPTA-AM, but not NAC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 32</xref>). Neither CCCP nor ML-SA5 affected the activity of mTOR, as reflected by levels of phosphorylated S6K, a primary mTOR substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 33</xref>).

Hence, TRPML1 and lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> appear to play a specific role in ROS-induced, but not the general mTOR-inhibition-mediated, autophagy. More strikingly, in PARKIN stable cells, when TFEB translocation was blocked by ML-SI3, obvious aggregation of PARKIN-positive puncta was observed even with a low-dose CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the current study, we identified the missing links between ROS and autophagy: lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, TRPML1 and TFEB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Our results suggest a model wherein an elevation of ROS levels (for example, due to mitochondrial damage) leads to TRPML1 activation and lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, acting via calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, induces TFEB-nuclear translocation, promoting both autophagosome biogenesis and lysosome biogenesis. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> may also directly regulate lysosome biogenesis and autophagosomeâlysosome fusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The subsequent increase in autophagic flux may facilitate removal of damaged mitochondria and restoration of redox homeostasis. Hence TRPML1 may serve as a ROS sensor in the lysosome that regulates an autophagy-dependent negative-feedback mechanism essential for cellular redox homeostasis.</p>
      <p>Although the connection between ROS and autophagy has been well-documented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the mechanisms by which ROS promote autophagy are largely unknown. Several TFs, including NRF2 and FOXO3, are known to become active under oxidative stress conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Recently, ATG4, a cytosolic negative regulator of LC3/ATG8, was identified as a direct ROS target that provides a rapid switch mechanism for autophagy induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. TRPML1 is activated rapidly by exogenous oxidants in isolated lysosomes, or in excised patches containing TRPML1 re-directed to the plasma membrane. Hence, it is very likely that direct oxidation of TRPML1 occurs, and such oxidation favours the channel adopting a âVa-like' constitutively-open state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Because autophagy is a multi-step process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, there may be multiple ROS sensors involved in regulating autophagy. Notwithstanding, in our experimental paradigm, in which endogenous mitochondrial ROS are generated to induce autophagy, autophagy induction is almost completely blocked by Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators and TRPML1 inhibitors. The robustness of these results suggests that TRPML1 may play a pivotal role in autophagy regulation.</p>
      <p>Our findings are consistent with the reported role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in autophagosome biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, in light of the observations that increasing autophagosome formation alone does not result in an increase in autophagic flux, ROS-dependent mechanisms that promote lysosome biogenesis and function must exist. Given the established roles of TRPML1 and TFEB in lysosomal trafficking and biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, our identification of TRPML1 as a lysosomal ROS sensor has revealed a unique ROS-regulated paradigm in which both initiation and maturation of autophagy are coordinated.</p>
      <p>Lysosomal membranes are the focal sites of multiple nutrient-sensitive kinases that regulate autophagy, including mTOR and AMPK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. It may not be coincidental that TRPML1, acting as a major autophagy-regulating ROS sensor, is also localized on the lysosomal membrane. TRPML1, a protein implicated in lysosome reformation and autophagosomeâlysosome fusion, is upregulated in response to cellular stress, such as nutrient starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. TRPML1 and TFEB/TFE3 may form a positive-interaction loop to regulate lysosome function and autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. TRPML1's direct role in stress-sensing makes TRPML1 and TFEB well-situated to play important roles in lysosome adaptation to environmental cues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, TFEB can also be activated by TRPML1-independent pathways, such as by mTOR inhibition and PIKfyve inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Hence TRPML1 appears to be uniquely positioned to respond to certain stress pathways, including ROS signalling.</p>
      <p>ROS regulation of TRPML1 may also affect other lysosome-related functions. ROS can be generated within lysosomes when heavy metal ions (for example, iron) catalyse the Fenton reaction, thereby generating free radicals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Indeed, TRPML1's iron permeability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and ROS sensitivity are well-suited to constitute a negative feedback mechanism to regulate redox homeostasis in the lysosome, preventing lysosomal membrane permeability and lysosomal cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Likewise, ROS regulation of TRPML1 may also be involved in membrane repair and phagocytic killing of bacteria, both of which are known to involve oxidant signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p>
      <p>Under physiological conditions, a mild increase in ROS levels may act as a âsurvival' signal triggering autophagy for the âquality control' purpose, whereas a large increase in ROS levels may produce severe oxidative damage and stress and serve as a âdeath' signal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Hence before the âdeath threshold' is reached, ROS can signal both autophagy induction and lysosome biogenesis, promoting autophagic flux. Supra-threshold ROS, however, may cause lysosomal membrane permeability, lysosomal dysfunction and autophagic failure. For example, the excessive and sustained surge in ROS that occurs during cardiac ischemiaâreperfusion may actually inhibit autophagy, contributing to cardiomyocyte death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, under pathological hyper-sensitive conditions, in which lysosome function and autophagy are not functioning appropriately, even a mild increase in ROS levels may cause oxidative stress. For example, when the TRPML1âTFEB pathway is inactive or compromised, as is seen in several lysosomal storage diseases, cells exhibit mitochondrial fragmentation, elevation of basal ROS levels and oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. On the other hand, when TRPML1âTFEB activity is upregulated, oxidative stress is mitigated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Hence, the TRPML1âTFEB pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target by which preemptive modulation of oxidative stress may alleviate symptoms in patients with lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by excess ROS.</p>

(<bold>e</bold>) A working model to illustrate the role of TRPML1 in ROS-induced TFEB activation and autophagy. An increase in mitochondrial ROS (for example, by CCCP-mediated mitochondrial depolarization) may activate TRPML1 channels on the perimeter membranes of lysosomes, inducing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release of that activates calcineurin. Subsequently, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound calcinurin dephosphorylates TFEB, which is otherwise kept in its phosphorylated form by the nutrient-sensitive lysosome-localized mTOR kinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Nucleus-localized TFEB then activates the transcription of a unique set of genes related to autophagy induction, autophagosome biogenesis and lysosome biogenesis. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release may also directly promote lysosome reformation/biogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Subsequently, autophagy is promoted to facilitate clearance of damaged mitochondria and removal of excessive ROS.</p>
