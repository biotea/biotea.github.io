        <p>Omecamtiv Mecarbil (OM) is a small molecule allosteric effector of cardiac myosin that is in clinical trials for treatment of systolic heart failure. A detailed kinetic analysis of cardiac myosin has shown that the drug accelerates phosphate release by shifting the equilibrium of the hydrolysis step towards products, leading to a faster transition from weak to strong actin-bound states. The structure of the human Î²-cardiac motor domain (cMD) with OM bound reveals a single OM-binding site nestled in a narrow cleft separating two domains of the human cMD where it interacts with the key residues that couple lever arm movement to the nucleotide state. In addition, OM induces allosteric changes in three strands of the Î²-sheet that provides the communication link between the actin-binding interface and the nucleotide pocket. The OM-binding interactions and allosteric changes form the structural basis for the kinetic and mechanical tuning of cardiac myosin.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Heart failure is a common human disease with a significant lifetime risk that increases with age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In its most common manifestation, heart failure is marked by a decrease in cardiac contractility culminating in systolic heart failure. Recently, a novel approach to the treatment of systolic heart failure has been developed on the basis of pharmacologic agents called âcardiac myosin activators' that bind directly to myosin and target the kinetic mechanism driving contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Directly targeting the contractile mechanism of cardiac myosin could theoretically improve heart performance without altering intracellular cAMP or calcium transients. A large, high-throughput, drug screen of a biochemically reconstituted contractile system identified a series of potential cardiac myosin activators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Omecamtiv Mecarbil (OM) is one such small molecule effector of cardiac myosin that is in clinical trials for treatment of systolic heart failure. Initial characterization of OM with bovine cardiac myosin shows that it binds directly to the myosin catalytic domain and operates by an allosteric mechanism to increase the transition rate of weak to strong bound actin states and enhance force generation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In animal models, OM increases cardiac muscle function by extending the duration of systolic ejection without altering the heart rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>We have elucidated the precise action of OM on steady state and transient kinetics of the actomyosin mechanism and motor activity of porcine ventricular heavy meromyosin (HMM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We find that OM shifts the equilibrium of the hydrolysis step of the myosin ATPase towards products, and this accelerates the flux through the product dissociation steps of the actomyosin mechanical cycle without altering the ADP dissociation rate, the key step that regulates the maximum shortening velocity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The subtle changes in the kinetic mechanism lead to an increase in the transition rate of weak to strong bound actin states, resulting in increased number of force-producing crossbridges and, paradoxically, a dramatic reduction in the unloaded shortening velocity measured <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. These fascinating kinetic results led to an intense effort to determine the drug-binding site and define the structural interactions within the human Î²-cardiac myosin motor domain that alter the motor activity.</p>
    <p>Purification of human cardiac myosin was not an option for accomplishing this objective because of limited availability and poor stability of clinical specimens. The alternative, expression and purification of recombinant cardiac muscle myosin, had been technically unfeasible until we showed that the principal obstacle for the expression of vertebrate striated muscle myosin was that motor domain folding follows a regulated pathway that is unique to striated muscle cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To demonstrate this principle, we designed a striated muscle myosin motor domain (MD)::green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeric protein and expressed it in muscle cells using adenovirus-mediated expression vectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This unique single-chain motor design is functionally active, fluorescent and ideally suited for structural studies.</p>
    <p>Here we present the structure of the human Î²-cardiac motor domain (cMD) fused to GFP determined without drug (Apo structure) and with OM bound (OM+ structure). OM binds in a narrow cleft that separates the N-terminal 25-K domain from the lower portion of the 50-K domain of the cMD. The drug interacts with the key residues involved in coupling structural elements that are linked to the rotation of the lever arm into the pre-power stroke conformation. Strong binding to actin triggers the reversal of the rotation, leading to the power stroke and force production. Surprisingly, OM binding induces an allosteric change in the conformation of three strands of a Î²-sheet that are crucial to communication between the nucleotide pocket and actin-binding interface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Together, these interactions form the basis of the kinetic and mechanical effects of the drug. This structural analysis characterizes a highly significant binding cleft for drugs designed to modulate myosin motor activity.</p>

        <title>Human Î²-cardiac myosin motor domain design</title>
        <p>The human Î²-cardiac myosin motor domain was expressed as a single-chain fusion protein with GFP. The protein design was based on a single-chain embryonic skeletal muscle MD::GFP chimera that was used to analyse motor domain folding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The lever arm Î±-helix projecting from the myosin MD is truncated within the IQ motif that forms the essential light-chain-binding site and joined to a short amino terminal Î±-helix of GFP. This corresponds to residues 1â787 of the human Î²-cardiac myosin fused to residues 5â238 of <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> GFP. The chimeric gene was cloned into a replication-deficient adenovirus expression vehicle, and high-titre adenovirus stocks were used to infect post-mitotic C2C12 myocytes. The brightly fluorescent cardiac MD::GFP protein was harvested from the myotubes and purified for crystallization. Nucleotide-free crystals of the Î²-cardiac MD::GFP were grown in hanging drops without OM (Apo structure) and with 125âÎ¼M OM (OM+ structure). SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectroscopy of the crystallized protein established that the full-length 117-kDa cMD::GFP chimera was crystallized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Structure of the Apo and OM+ cMD</title>
        <p>The structure of the cardiac MD::GFP chimera (cMD) was determined to a resolution of 3.2âÃ for the Apo and 2.25âÃ for the OM+ crystals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The drug-free Apo cMD crystallized in space group P1, and with OM bound, the protein crystallized in space group P2<sub>1</sub>. There are two molecules (A and B chains) in the asymmetric unit in both crystal forms, and the overall conformation of the A and B chains in each structure is very similar, independent of drug. The protein was crystallized without nucleotide and is in the extended, near-rigour conformation. The folding pattern and domain structure of the Apo and OM+ cMD structures are typical of the striated myosin II from chicken skeletal muscle root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.)=0.70âÃ for 558 CÎ± atoms), scallop striated muscle (r.m.s.d.=0.64âÃ for 544 CÎ± atoms) and human Î²-cardiac myosin with AMPPNP bound (0.45âÃ for 608 CÎ± atoms)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The domains and features of the cMD structure are illustrated for the A chain of the OM+ structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. The model is colour-coded to highlight the various regions of the structure associated with motor activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
        <p>The bound OM is nestled in a cleft and is just visible in the space-filling model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The OM is more apparent in the ribbon diagram nestled between the 25-K domain and the lower portion of the 50-K domain. The N-terminal 25-K domain (blue) forms one face of the OM-binding cleft. About 35âÃ removed from the drug cleft the 25-K domain also forms one face of the nucleotide-binding pocket. The lower 50-K domain (red) includes major elements of the actin-binding surface and forms the other face of the OM-binding cleft. The upper 50-K domain (orange) includes additional elements of the actin-binding surface that are separated by a deep cleft from the lower 50-K domain. The upper 50-K domain forms the other surface of the nucleotide pocket. The converter domain (yellow) abuts the OM-binding cleft and couples the motor domain to the lever arm helix (LAH).</p>
        <p>In all myosin II molecules, including Î²-cardiac myosin, the LAH forms the light-chain-binding domain; however, in this chimeric protein the helix was truncated in the centre of the essential light-chain IQ-binding motif and fused to a short N-terminal helix of GFP (residues 791â1026; green). As a consequence, the GFP domain is positioned by design in the space normally occupied by the light chains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The GFP chromophore occupies a cavity in the centre of the GFP Î²-barrel.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Effect of OM on cardiac myosin motor activity</title>
        <p>The GFP domain substitutes a rigid Î²-barrel for the myosin light chains and provides a convenient handle for assaying the effect of drug binding on cMD motor activity by using anti-GFP to immobilize the cMD on surfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The unloaded shortening velocity was measured using the <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The cMD::GFP chimera supports sliding actin filament velocities of 0.8âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup>, equivalent to the human Î²-cardiac HMM (cHMM) and comparable to the velocity measured for porcine ventricular HMM (0.96âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Addition of OM to the assay dramatically slows the filament velocity (15â20-fold) powered by both the cMD and cHMM. This is identical to what was found with porcine ventricular HMM and is explained by a drug-induced increase in crossbridges interacting with the actin filaments that impose an internal load on the sliding filament movement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for OM inhibition of the sliding velocity powered by the cMD is 100ânM, indicating a high affinity for the intermediates of the mechanochemical cycle. The sliding filament velocity powered by a fast skeletal muscle myosin is much faster (6.3âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup>) than the cMD, as is expected, but is virtually unaffected by the drug, consistent with the report that OM does not bind to skeletal muscle myosin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
        <p>OM modulates the steady-state ATPase of the cMD, decreasing the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> from 5.3 to 1.9âs<sup>â1</sup> but also lowering the K<sub>ATPase</sub> for actin activation fourfold from 22.5 to 5.4âÎ¼M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). This is consistent with the effect of OM on the porcine ventricular HMM ATPase activity. The effects of OM on the cMD motor activity and ATPase activity and the 100-nM <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for modulating the activity corroborate the specificity of the binding site observed in the crystal structure.</p>

        <title>OM-binding site and the coupling region</title>
        <p>The drug, OM, is tightly nestled in a narrow cleft separating the lower 50-K domain from the N-terminal 25-K domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). OM is in an extended conformation that lies along the SH1 helix (698â707) and is adjacent to C705 (SH1) on one side and extends to and interacts with the first strand (711â713) of the three-stranded Î²-sheet of the converter domain. The drug packs against and wraps around two loops from the 25-K domain. OM binding involves extensive interaction with at least six residues from the 25-K domain (A91, M92, L96, S118, G119 and F121), two from the relay helix (M493 and E497), four from the SH1 helix (V698, G701, I702 and C705) and four from the Î²-sheets of the converter domain (P710, N711, R712 and L770; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). There are four potential hydrogen-bonding interactions between the protein and drug that involve A91, M92, S118 and N711. The N711 H-bond to the OM methyl-pyridine ring is of interest because this residue is a serine in fast skeletal muscle myosin and is one of only three sequence differences in the binding cleft that might account for the selectivity of the drug for modulating the activity of cardiac myosin but not skeletal myosin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The same interactions are found in the proteinâdrug-binding site of the A and B chains of the OM+ structure, although the conformation of the drug and binding cleft is slightly different in the two molecules. The A chain-binding site is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>.</p>
        <p>The conformation of the main chain and the side-chain rotamers of residues lining the drug-binding cleft are essentially the same in the Apo and OM+ structures, indicating that drug binds to an existing cleft and does not induce significant local perturbation of the cMD conformation. However, analysis of the proteinâdrug interface indicates that OM binding results in extensive solvent shielding of residues that couple the structural elements that are central to the conformation changes of the recovery stroke: the SH1 helix, the relay helix and the converter domain. Photo-crosslinking of a benzonphenone derivative of OM had identified this cleft as the potential OM-binding site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The drug-binding site is consistent with that crosslinking experiment; however, the drug is deeper in the cleft than previously imagined.</p>
        <p>The recovery stroke involves the priming of the lever arm at the start of the mechanical cycle resulting in the rotation of the converter domain and LAH through â¼65Â°. The priming step is a conformational equilibrium driven by the nucleotide bound in the active site. The nucleotide state is transmitted via the relay helix to a coupling region that links the SH1 helix, relay helix and converter domain together. The packing of the drug against the SH1 helix, relay helix and converter domain shields these elements from solvent and enhances interactions among them<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. For example, OM buries the only solvent-accessible surface of the E497-R712 salt bridge that links the relay helix to the converter domain, thereby fortifying the bond. It also shields the M493-C705 H-bond that links the relay helix to the SH1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Converter domainâLAHâGFP rotation</title>
        <p>There are two distinct molecules in the unit cell (A and B) of both the Apo and OM+ structures. In both structures the core motor domains (residues 2â708) are packed tightly together in the crystal lattice with extensive non-crystallographic symmetry between them. The conformation of the core motor domain is very similar in the two molecules of the Apo (r.m.s.d.=0.305âÃ for 567 CÎ± atoms) and the two molecules of the OM+ (r.m.s.d.=0.311âÃ for 550 CÎ± atoms) structures. The similarity is shared between corresponding core motor domains of the Apo and OM+ in pairwise comparison (Apo-A to OM-A r.m.s.d.=0.33âÃ; Apo-B to OM-B r.m.s.d.=0.36âÃ). The organization of the converter domains, the position of the GFP domains and the LAH linking the two are markedly different between the A and B chains in the asymmetric unit of both crystal structures. There is an â¼15Â° rotation of the converter domainâLAHâGFP domain as a unit between the two molecules in the unit cell of both crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The apparent 15Â° rotation of the LAH from the A to the B position is in the same direction as a much larger LAH rotation during the recovery stroke (â¼65Â°). The conformation change involves movement of the relay helix and a portion of the N-terminal 25-K region called the SH3 domain in addition to the converter domainâLAH. The hinge point for the rotation is G708 of the cMD, adjacent to the OM-binding cleft. As a consequence, the conformation of the drug-binding cleft is different between the OM+ A and B chains.</p>

        <title>OM moves with the rotation of the converter domain</title>
        <p>The changes in the drug cleft as a consequence of the 15Â° rotation of the converter domainâLAH in the two molecules of the OM+ structure (OM-A and OM-B) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>. To accommodate changes in the position of the converter domain, there is rotation of the fluoro-benzene and methyl-pyridinyl rings and the amino-carbamoyl linker of OM. These changes mirror the shift in position of the residues interacting with the drug. In particular, the bond distance for the H-bond with N711 remains constant despite significant movement of the Î²-strands of the converter domain. OM follows the linkage between the SH1 helix and converter domainâLAH elements in the two molecules (OM-A and OM-B). The carboxymethyl-piperazine ring of OM is most deeply buried in the drug-binding cleft and changes very little between the two conformations of the cleft. This OM ring interacts with residues of strands Î²1 and Î²2 of the central seven-stranded Î²-sheet of the cMD structure. Comparison of the Apo and OM+ structures reveals subtle changes in the seven-stranded Î²-sheet that propagate out from the drug-binding cleft, perhaps arising from the interaction with these first two strands.</p>

        <p>Twisting and distortion of the last three strands (Î²5, Î²6 and Î²7) of the seven-stranded Î²-sheet of the myosin MD is essential for rearrangements within the nucleotide-binding pocket depending on the nucleotide state and forms the structural basis for communication between the actin-binding interface, the nucleotide pocket and the converter domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The structural elements have been called collectively âThe Transducer' and include Loop 1 (204â210), the Î²-bulge (252â259) connecting strands Î²6 and Î²7 and the loop-linking helix O (HO) to the Î²5-strand (448â455). The Î²5-strand leads directly into Switch II (SW-II): the Î³-phosphate-sensing loop in the nucleotide pocket. Switch II in turn leads into the relay helix, the coupling region and the drug-binding cleft.</p>
        <p>OM interactions within the binding cleft include residues of the strands Î²1 and Î²2 of the central seven-stranded Î²-sheet. Comparison of the Apo and OM+ structures reveals changes in the Î²-sheet that propagates out from the drug-binding cleft and results in a twist of the final three strands (Î²5, Î²6 and Î²7) of the sheet affecting the Î²-bulge and the HO-Î²5 loop, key elements of the Transducer region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The conformations of the two molecules in the OM+ structure (OM-A and OM-B) are not identical to one another in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). The OM-B conformation has a greater twist, an extension of the Î²6 and Î²7 strands of the sheet into the Î²-bulge, and displacements of 1â3âÃ in the CÎ± positions for residues of the Î²-bulge and the HO-Î²5 loop. There also is subtle shift at the transition of Î²5-strand into SW-II (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The conformations of these elements in both molecules of the Apo structure are essentially identical and differ from both molecules in the OM+ structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). The nucleotide-free conformation of the Transducer region of the OM-B molecule is in fact more similar to that in the cardiac myosin MD with AMPPNP bound<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> than either Apo structure or the OM-A molecule in the same unit cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
        <p>The crystallographic packing between the two molecules of the Apo and the OM+ structures is essentially identical and does not involve the elements of the Transducer region, suggesting that crystal packing is not the source of this highly localized conformational change. In addition, this region of the structure is well defined in both the Apo and OM+ structures with B-factors that are about half of the average for the protein as a whole. All of these changes are â¼35âÃ distant from the OM-binding site and thus are allosteric changes affecting a link in the communication between the nucleotide pocket and the actin-binding interface.</p>
        <p>We conclude that the stabilization of the coupling between the SH1 helix, relay helix and converter domain within the drug-binding cleft and the allosteric distortion of the Î²-sheet in the Transducer region are the principal structural changes associated with drug binding. These changes may be sufficient to account for the shift in the hydrolysis equilibrium in the nucleotide pocket and the accelerated rate of Î³-phosphate release contributing to the measured kinetic effects of drug binding on cardiac myosin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report the structural basis for the allosteric mechanism of the novel cardiac myosin-specific drug, OM. The drug binds to the human Î²-cardiac myosin motor domain in a narrow cleft between the N-terminal 25-K domain and the lower portion of the 50-K domain. Within the binding cleft the drug is intimately involved with the key elements of the recovery stroke. In addition, OM binding induces allosteric changes distant from the binding cleft that affect the twist of the central seven-stranded Î²-sheet of the motor domain. These interactions help explain how the drug modulates cardiac myosin motor activity.</p>
      <p>In addition to OM, there are several other reversible allosteric effectors of myosin activity that bind to the motor domain including blebbistatin, halogenated pseudilins and EMD 57033. Blebbistatin binds at the apex of the myosin cleft separating the upper and lower 50-K domains blocking the myosin in a product complex with low actin affinity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The halogenated pseudilins are a class of myosin inhibitors with activity similar to blebbistatin that also bind in the cleft but at a site that is â¼7.5âÃ from the blebbistatin site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. EMD 57033 is a thiadiazinone derivative that stabilizes myosin against thermal denaturation and is an allosteric activator of Î²-cardiac myosin ATPase and myofilament contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. <italic>In silico</italic> docking studies suggest that it binds in a pocket near the N-terminal SH3 domain. None of these other allosteric effectors bind in or near the OM cleft or are under consideration for therapeutic potential.</p>
      <p>The key to the actomyosin mechanochemical cycle is the ability of the myosin motor domain to couple small changes in the catalytic ATPase site to large conformational changes in both the actin-binding and force-generating domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This pathway is summarized in the actomyosin kinetic scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>. The nucleotide bound in the active site (ATP, ADPÂ·P<sub>i</sub> or ADP) defines the conformation of the MD and its affinity for actin. This requires a communication pathway to amplify changes in the nucleotide pocket and couple them to domain movements. OM acts along this pathway as a traditional allosteric effector binding â¼35âÃ from the nucleotide pocket and altering the ATP hydrolysis mechanism and motor activity of cardiac myosin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. A detailed analysis of the transient kinetics of porcine ventricular HMM reveals that OM does not activate of the actomyosin ATPase activity as was originally suspected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and instead inhibits the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> by two- to threefold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This was shown here for the human Î²-cardiac myosin as well. The principal effect of OM on the myosin kinetic mechanism is a shift in the equilibrium for ATP hydrolysis in the active site towards product formation (MâÌADá¹P<sub>i</sub>) that is coupled to an increase in the rate of the fast phase of phosphate release. These changes produce an increase in the flux of the intermediates through the actomyosin mechanochemical pathway leading to a faster transition of weak to strong bound actin states. In the kinetic assays, we measured the unloaded rate of ADP dissociation from actomyosin ADP at the end of the contractile cycle and showed that OM does not affect this step. Faster phosphate release without a change in ADP dissociation leads to a higher fraction of myosin bound to actin in a strong È¦MâÌADP state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
      <p>OM produces a large (15â20-fold) reduction in the unloaded shortening velocity measured in the <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The reported <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> reflects the apparent affinity of OM for a composite of steps in the kinetic pathway rather than a binding constant for any single step. Specifically, OM affects both the hydrolysis equilibrium (MâÌATP to MâÌADá¹P<sub>i</sub>) and P<sub>i</sub> release (AMâÌADá¹P<sub>i</sub> to AMâÌADP transitions). Thus, the measured <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> reflects the interaction of OM with an ensemble of states. The effect on the motility assay is likely a result of the recruitment of crossbridges to the actin filament as a consequence of the faster transition from weak to strong bound actin states, resulting in a higher fraction of cMDs tightly bound to actin producing an internal drag on filament movement. Although this slows the velocity of filament movement, it also leads to more force production per filament, a favourable outcome for improving cardiac systolic function. A strain-dependent slowing of the ADP dissociation rate has recently been reported for porcine Î²-cardiac myosin, and this additional mechanism could contribute to the decrease in filament velocity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A strain-dependent step would extend the duration of systole as is reported in animal models of heart failure treated with OM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. An increase in strongly attached crossbridges induced by OM also could facilitate systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation in the heart by triggering movement of the Tpm-Tn switch out of the inhibitory state. However, the significance of this activation mechanism under physiological conditions in heart muscle has been questioned recently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p>
      <p>The communication pathway linking the ATPase state to the rotation of the lever arm has been delineated by crystal structures of non-cardiac myosin motor domains with different bound ATP analogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. These structures reveal distinct orientations of the converter domain that lead to an â¼65Â° rotation of the LAH. On the basis of these known structural states, mutational analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, it has been proposed that with ATP bound the myosin motor domain exists in two alternative conformations, the pre-recovery Mâ state (down state) and post-recovery Mâ state (up state with rotated LAH)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The transition between these myosin conformations is controlled by the myosin nucleotide interaction and is called the recovery stroke. The pre-recovery state (Mâ) has nucleotide bound with SW-II in the open position. In the Mâ state the SW-II loop closes and a glycine in the loop makes a hydrogen bond with the nucleotide Î³-phosphate. This small change is transmitted to the coupling region where concerted domain movements result in the rotation of the LAH into the primed, pre-power stroke conformation. In myosin, ATP hydrolysis is a reversible equilibrium in the active site that occurs predominantly in the post-recovery MâÌATP state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This prevents unproductive release of hydrolysis products from a pre-recovery state (MâÌATP). We have shown that OM specifically shifts the hydrolysis equilibrium towards products (ADá¹P<sub>i</sub>). This in turn shifts the coupled equilibria (<italic>K</italic><sub>RS</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>H</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>) towards the primed LAH conformation (MâÌADá¹P<sub>i</sub>) for rebinding to actin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
      <p>The SW-II loop is contiguous with N terminus of the relay helix providing a link from the nucleotide pocket to the SH1 helix and the converter domain. A defining feature of the Mâ primed conformation is a kink in the relay helix around F489 of the human cMD. On the transition from Mâ to Mâ, the bend in the relay helix is strongly coupled to the position of the SH1 helix and the converter domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The converter domain remains anchored to the relay helix as the converterâLAH undergoes its sweeping rotation. OM binds in the centre of the region that couples the SH1 helix, relay helix and converter domain and involves the key residues linking the SH1 helix to the relay helix (M493-C705 sulfhydryl H-bond) and the relay helix to the converter domain (E497-R712 salt bridge). OM binding shields these interactions from solvent and strengthens the links responsible for the concerted domain movement of the recovery stroke.</p>
      <p>An extensive hydrophobic cluster involving Y501, I506, W508, F510, I511, F513, F709 and F764 is also involved in coupling the relay helix and loop with the SH1 helix and the converter domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The E497-R712 salt bridge lies immediately below this aromatic cluster and is shielded from solvent on three sides by it; thus, OM binding completes the burial of the salt bridge in a hydrophobic pocket. This salt bridge is found in both the near-rigour and pre-power stroke conformation of the scallop myosin II MD structure, suggesting that it is essential to the coupling mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We have shown here that the drug-binding interactions are maintained through a 15Â° rotation of the converter domain and LAH (â¼25% of the recovery stroke), suggesting that the drug may stabilize this coupling region throughout the recovery stroke.</p>
      <p>Both E497 and R712 have been identified as sites of cardiomyopathy-associated mutations: an E497D mutation results in a benign hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and a R712L mutation is associated with a severe HCM phenotype and sudden cardiac death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Three of the eight aromatic residues involved in the hydrophobic cluster are also sites associated with HCM (Y501, F513) and DCM (F764) mutations. Five of the sixteen residues that form the drug-binding cleft and interact with OM (M493, E497, V698, P710 and R712) are sites of missense mutations associated with human cardiac pathology. The clustering of cardiomyopathic mutations in this region correlates with the importance of these links to the communication pathway between the nucleotide state and priming of the LAH.</p>
      <p>The Transducer is a structural element of the motor domain near the nucleotide-binding site that includes the last three strands of the central seven-stranded Î²-sheet of the MD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Distortion of the Î²-sheet is essential for the domain movements needed to accommodate closure of the cleft between the upper and lower portions of the 50-K domain on strong binding to actin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. That in turn reverses the rotation of the LAH leading to the power stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). The movements involve a twist of the last three strands (Î²5, Î²6 and Î²7) of the Î²-sheet, changes in the loops linking Î²6 to Î²7 (Î²-bulge) and the HO helix to Î²5, and Loop 1 (204â210). It has been suggested that the twist provides the structural basis for communication between the actin interface and the nucleotide pocket and may be involved in the Î³-phosphate release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. We have found that OM binding alters the conformation of the Î²-bulge and HO-Î²5 loop and the twist of the Î²5, Î²6 and Î²7 strands when compared with the Apo structure and between the two cMD conformations within the OM+ structure. These structural changes are consistent with a mechanism, whereby OM accelerates the rate of P<sub>i</sub> release and the weak to strong actin-binding transition by facilitating Î²-sheet distortion.</p>
      <p>We conclude that OM binding acts to stabilize the interactions within the coupling region. This region is central to the recovery stroke and the priming of the cMD for a productive contractile cycle. In addition, drug binding shifts the conformational equilibrium of the Transducer region to favour phosphate release. Together, these subtle changes alter the mechanical tuning of Î²-cardiac myosin producing changes in activity that in cardiac muscle will increase force production at the expense of speed of contraction. The candidate drugs from which OM was developed were originally identified by a high-throughput screen of a biochemically reconstituted contractile system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. That screen and subsequent selection of OM has identified a fundamentally important site for fine-tuning the motor activity of myosin.</p>

Reflections were indexed, integrated and scaled with iMosflm and Aimless from the ccp4 package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. The Apo structure was determined first by molecular replacement with Phaser<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> using residues 4â780 of chicken skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1 structure, PDB ID: 2MYS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, together with the structure of GFP, PDB ID: 2QLE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, as the search ensemble. The molecular replacement map clearly identified two motor domains associated with one GFP per domain. The helix linking the MD to the GFP was not included in the search models; however, new density corresponding to the helix was apparent in the initial maps. After building the linking helix into the density and joining the MD and GFP domains, the cMD and GFP sequence were built into the model with PHENIX Autobuild<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. The structure was refined with PHENIX refine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> and iterative model building in Coot<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Only a very limited number of well-defined water molecules and two sulfate anions in the cMD Î²-phosphate-binding loop were included in the structure at this resolution. The statistics for favoured, allowed and outlier Ramachandran angles are 93.4%, 6.1% and 0.5%, respectively. The Molprobity score for the refined structure is 2.16 and the coordinates are deposited as PDB ID: 4P7H<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.</p>
        <p>The OM+ structure was solved by molecular replacement using the motor domain (2â708) of the Apo structure A chain and the helixâGFP domain as separate models in the search ensemble followed by PHENIX Autobuild. After limited initial refinement, unassigned density likely coming from the ligand was apparent. PHENIX LigandFit was used to search and dock OM into the map using Resolve<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Ligand restraints for refinement were generated with eLBoW<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. The structure was refined as with the Apo structure. The statistics for favoured, allowed and outlier Ramachandran angles are 95.3%, 4.2% and 0.5%, respectively. The Molprobity score for the refined structure is 1.87.</p>
        <p>The Karplus and Diederichs CC* data and model quality-assessment tool were applied to both models and data sets to assess the high-resolution cutoff<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. The Apo data set was truncated at 3.2âÃ, with mean (<italic>I</italic>/<italic>Ï</italic>(<italic>I</italic>))=2 and a CC*&gt;0.88 for the highest-resolution shell (3.3â3.2âÃ). The CC* statistic for the OM+ data is &gt;0.73 for the highest-resolution shell (2.33â2.25âÃ), supporting the inclusion of the full data range in determination of the model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Alternatively, applying traditional cutoff criteria of the mean (<italic>I</italic>/<italic>Ï</italic>(<italic>I</italic>))â¥2 to the OM+ data would make this a nominal 2.40-Ã resolution structure. The coordinates for the OM+ structure are deposited as PDB entry 4PA0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

The upper 50-K domain (211â470; orange) is separated by the âCleft' from the lower 50-K domain. There is no nucleotide in this structure, the cleft is âopen' and the lever arm is extended consistent with the near-rigour conformation. The converter domain (residues 709â777) and LAH (residues 778â787) are in yellow and the GFP domain is in green.

        <p>Titration of the effect of OM on the unloaded shortening velocity measured with the <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assay. The cMD was bound indirectly to surfaces through an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (â) and compared with the human Î²-cardiac HMM (â) bound directly to the nitrocellulose surface. In the absence of the drug, both cardiac myosin fragments support actin filament velocities of 0.8âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup>. Titration with OM from 0.42 to 12.5âÎ¼M dramatically slowed the velocity of filament movement by 15â20-fold. The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for OM binding is 100â150ânM for the human cMD and cHMM. Adult fast skeletal muscle myosin (â´) moves actin filaments at 6.3âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup>, and even the highest concentration of OM tested has little effect on filament velocity. Assays were conducted at 32âÂ°C. The cardiac motor activity was fit to the hyperbolic inhibition curve: <inline-formula id="d33e785"><inline-graphic id="d33e786" xlink:href="ncomms8974-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula>; where, <italic>v</italic><sub>o</sub> is the observed velocity, <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> is the unloaded shortening velocity, <italic>V</italic><sub>i</sub> is the maximum inhibited velocity and [OM] is the concentration of drug.

        <title>OM-binding site on the human Î²-cardiac MD.</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) A ribbon diagram of the A chain of the OM+ structure is shown with OM (space-filling model) nestled in a narrow cleft separating the 25-K domain (blue) from the lower 50-K domain (red), and interacting with residues from these domains and the converter domain (yellow). The drug is in an extended conformation with the carboxymethyl-piperazine group buried deeply in the cleft. One surface of this ring and the fluoro-benzene ring of OM make extensive packing interactions with residues along one face of the SH1 helix including C705 (SH1). The drug bridges the gap from the SH1 helix to the first strand (N711-I713) of the three-stranded Î²-sheet of the converter domain. In bridging the gap, OM buries a bi-dentate salt bridge, E497-R712, beneath the fluoro-benzene ring. The amido group of N711 forms a H-bond with the nitrogen of the OM methyl-pyridinyl ring. The other surface of OM wraps around a turn (A91-L96) of the 25-K domain and interacts with the first two strands (Î²1âÎ²2) and connecting loop of the seven-stranded Î²-sheet of the cMD. The 25-K domain residues S118, A91 and M92 form likely H-bonds with OM (shown with dotted lines), and there are at least 12 packing and hydrophobic interactions as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

In this view the converter domain moves up and towards the viewer, shifting the position of both N711 and R712. The fluoro-benzyl and methy-pyidinyl rings of OM rotate between OM-A and OM-B conformations as does the amino-carbamoyl group linking them. This maintains the H-bond to N711 and the shielding of the E497-R712 salt bridge.

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) The core cMD (2â708) of the OM-A and OM-B chains were aligned. Overall, the conformations of the two chains are nearly identical (r.m.s.d.=0.31âÃ); however, strands Î²5, Î²6 and Î²7 of the Î²-sheet and the elements of the Transducer region (the Î²-bulge and HO-Î²5 loop) are significantly different.

        <p>The myosin motor domain (M, blue) is shown at the top left at the end of the cycle, tightly bound to actin (A, red) in the nucleotide-free rigour state (AÂ·M). ATP binds rapidly and releases the MD from actin. The MD then undergoes a conformational equilibrium before ATP hydrolysis between two states designated as Mâ and Mâ. These states correspond to the near-rigour (Mâ) and pre-power stroke (Mâ) conformations. The arrows indicate the down position of the LAH (Mâ) and the up position in the pre-power stroke state (Mâ) and correlate with intrinsic fluorescent states. The âRecovery Stroke' is the rapid equilibrium (<italic>K</italic><sub>RS</sub>) between these states. The hydrolysis equilibrium (<italic>K</italic><sub>H</sub>) is coupled to this transition before binding to actin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. On rebinding to actin the weak to strong transition is coupled to Î³-phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) release. This results in a conformation change triggering rotation of the LAH producing the âPower Stroke' and force production. Rapid ADP dissociation follows, completing the cycle. OM influences the hydrolysis equilibrium (<italic>K</italic><sub>H</sub>), and it accelerates P<sub>i</sub> release associated with the weak to strong actin-binding transition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These steps are boxed with dotted lines.</p>
