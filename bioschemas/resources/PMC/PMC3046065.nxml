      <abstract>
        <p>When activated by high NaCl, tonicity-responsive enhancerâbinding protein/osmotic response elementâbinding protein (TonEBP/OREBP) increases transcription of osmoprotective genes. High NaCl activates TonEBP/OREBP by increasing its phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transactivating activity. In HEK293 cells, mass spectrometry shows phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP-S120, -S134, -T135, and -S155. When those residues are individually mutated to alanine, nuclear localization is greater for S155A, less for S134A and T135A, and unchanged for S120A. High osmolality increases phosphorylation at T135 in HEK293 cells and in rat renal inner medullas in vivo. In HEK293 cells, high NaCl activates cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which directly phosphorylates TonEBP/OREBP-T135. Inhibition of CDK5 activity reduces the rapid high NaClâinduced nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP but does not affect its transactivating activity. High NaCl induces nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP faster (â¤2 h) than it increases its overall protein abundance (â¥6 h). Inhibition of CDK5 reduces the increase in TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity that has occurred by 4 h after NaCl is raised, associated with less nuclear TonEBP/OREBP at that time, but does not reduce either activity or nuclear TonEBP/OREBP after 16 h. Thus high NaClâinduced increase of the overall abundance of TonEBP/OREBP, by itself, eventually raises its effective level in the nucleus, but its rapid CDK5-dependent nuclear localization accelerates the process, speeding transcription of osmoprotective target genes.</p>

Protection is provided by tonicity-responsive enhancerâbinding protein/osmotic response elementâbinding protein (TonEBP/OREBP) (Miyakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1999</xref>; Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>), often called NFAT5, a rel family transcription factor whose activation by hypertonicity increases enzymes and transporters that elevate intracellular organic osmolytes and heat shock proteins (Burg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). High NaCl activates TonEBP/OREBP by increasing its abundance (Miyakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1999</xref>; Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>), phosphorylation (Dahl <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2001</xref>), nuclear localization (Miyakawa <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1999</xref>; Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>), and transactivating activity (Ferraris <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2002</xref>). Numerous proteins, including kinases and phosphatases, contribute to the activation of TonEBP/OREBP (Burg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). For example, concurrent high NaClâinduced activation of c-Abl kinase (Gallazzini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>) and inhibition of SHP-1 phosphatase (Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2010</xref>) increase phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP on tyrosine 143, resulting in increased TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and transactivating activity, dependent on association of phospholipase C (PLC)âÎ³1 with TonEBP/OREBP at phospho-Y143 (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). Also, high NaClâinduced activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase contributes to the subsequent increase of TonEBP/OREBP nuclear localization (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2005</xref>) as well as increase of transcriptional and transactivating activity, dependent on TonEBP/OREBP-S1274 and -S1367 (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>).</p><p>In the present studies we used protein mass spectrometry to search for additional phosphorylation sites in TonEBP/OREBP, and we tested for possible roles of those phosphorylation events in regulation of TonEBP/OREBP activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Discovery of additional phosphorylation sites in TonEBP/OREBP</title><p>Native TonEBP/OREBP is not sufficiently abundant in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells for analysis by protein mass spectrometry. Therefore, in order to discover amino acids that are phosphorylated, we stably expressed TonEBP/OREBP-1â547-V5 in the cells (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2007</xref>) and immunoprecipitated it from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of cells bathed in medium kept at 300 mOsm/kg or changed for 2 h to 200 or 500 mOsm/kg by adjusting NaCl. This region of TonEBP/OREBP contains nuclear localization, DNA binding, and dimerization domains (Burg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). To maximize coverage of phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry, we used two different proteolytic enzymes, trypsin and endoproteinase Arg C. We used the SEQUEST (Eng <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1994</xref>) algorithm for initial identification of phosphorylated amino acids, and Ascore (Beausoleil <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>) for confirmation. Ascore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Ascore.med.harvard.edu">http://Ascore.med.harvard.edu</ext-link>) estimates the probability of correct identification of phosphorylation sites from the presence and intensity of site-determining ions in tandem mass spectometry (MS/MS) spectra. Ascore &gt; 19 predicts &gt;99% probability of correct identification of phosphorylation sites. We found numerous peptides from TonEBP/OREBP in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionsâup to 12 unique peptides in a single sample. We identified four likely phosphorylation sites in three different phosphopeptides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We found phospho-S120 in nuclear extracts at 200 and 500 mOsm/kg and cytoplasmic extracts at 500 mOsm/kg. We found phospho-S134 and -T135, always together, in nuclear extracts at 500 mOsm/kg. We found phospho-S155 in cytoplasmic extracts at 200 mOsm/kg. Each peptide was detected in several independently prepared samples.

Mutation of the amino acids in TonEBP/OREBP that are sites of phosphorylation has varying effects.

The relative amounts of TonEBP/OREBP-V5 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio were calculated from Western blots with anti-V5 antibody (mean Â± SEM, *P â¤ 0.05, n = 3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="703fig2"/></fig><p>Because mutation of S120 to alanine does not affect nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, we elected not to study it further at this time and turned our attention to S134 and T135. For this purpose, we produced phosphospecific antibodies against each of them. The antibody against TonEBP/OREBPâphospho-S134 detects a peptide (TonEBP/OREBP-130â139) containing phosphorylated, but not nonphosphorylated, TonEBP/OREBP-S134 (Supplemental Figure 1A). Unfortunately, it does not recognize phosphorylation at that site if T135 is also phosphorylated (Supplemental Figure 1A), as occurs in peptides that we identify by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Further, it recognizes TonEBP/OREBP-S134A-V5, in which the amino acid at that site (alanine) cannot be phosphorylated (Supplemental Figure 2). Because we were able to produce an antibody against TonEBP/OREBPâphospho-T135 that does not suffer from those limitations, we elected to study the role of phosphorylation at that site.</p></sec><sec><title>High-NaCl induces phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP at threonine 135, catalyzed by CDK5 kinase</title><p>TonEBP/OREBP-T135 is within a consensus cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) phosphorylation site that is conserved among mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We used a specific anti-TonEBP/OREBPâphospho-T135 antibody to test for phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP-T135. The antibody cross-reacts with a TonEBP/OREBP peptide containing T135 (QQHPS<underline>T</underline>PKRH) only when the T135 is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel, and Supplemental Figure 1B). To test whether CDK5 catalyzes phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP-T135, we performed in vitro kinase assays using the TonEBP/OREBP peptide containing T135 as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel) and various recombinant kinases. The peptide is strongly phosphorylated by CDK5, less by CDK1, and not at all by other serine/threonine kinases: extracellular signalâregulated kinase 1 (ERK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and p38. It is not surprising that CDK1 phosphorylates this peptide in vitro because CDK1 and CDK5 consensus phosphorylation sites are similar. However, CDK1 is inhibited by high NaCl (Dmitrieva <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2002</xref>) and is thus unlikely to be the kinase of interest. We also tested the kinase activity of native CDK5 immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells. The cells were exposed to medium kept at 300 or increased to 500 mOsm/kg (NaCl added) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate containing CDK5 phosphorylates TonEBP/OREBP-T135, but the control immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoprecipitate does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel). Also, native CDK5 kinase activity is greater when the cells from which it is immunoprecipitated have been exposed to high NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). Further, in HEK293 cells high NaCl increases phosphorylation at T135 of recombinant WT TonEBP/OREBP-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) and of native TonEBP/OREBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Because CDK5 is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine 15 (Zukerberg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2000</xref>), we tested for phosphorylation at that site, using a phosphospecific antibody. High NaCl increases phosphorylation of CDK5-Y15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). We conclude that high NaCl increases CDK5 kinase activity, leading to increased phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP-T135.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><p>High NaCl induces phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP on threonine 135.

Their molecular partners, the cyclins, activate and confer specificity to Cdks. Although CDK5 (Rosales and Lee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2006</xref>; Dhariwala and Rajadhyaksha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2008</xref>; Lalioti <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2010</xref>) has homology to CDK1 and 2, its function is vastly different because it does not regulate cell cycle and it is activated by noncyclin proteins, p35 and p39. While CDK5 is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues and phosphorylates a variety of proteins, its activator proteins are predominantly expressed in postmitotic neurons and its activity has been studied mainly in the central nervous system. Cellular processes previously known to be regulated by CDK5 include cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, apoptosis, and senescence. Interestingly, some of these same processes are also altered in osmotically stressed cells, as will be noted.</p><p>Cytoskeletal dynamics and the proteins that regulate them are among the major known targets of CDK5. CDK5 controls the reorganization of the cytoskeleton involved in cell propulsion and in expansion and guidance of cell outgrowths. Rho GTPases are among preferred targets of CDK5 and are critical elements in the complex pathways that regulate actin and microtubule dynamics in the cytoskeleton. Rho GTPases are also involved in cytoskeletal changes associated with restoration of cell volume following changes in tonicity (Hoffmann and Pedersen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>), but it is not clear what role, if any, CDK5 has in this control of cell volume.</p><p>CDK5 also regulates other transcription factors and events besides the high NaClâinduced increase of TonEBP/OREBP activity identified in the present studies. CDK5 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 by phosphorylating it on Ser-727 (Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2004</xref>), resulting in increased transcription of many genes, including c-fos, junB, and fibronectin. CDK5 is expressed in insulin-producing Î² cells of the pancreas. Elevation of glucose increases p35/CDK5 activity, which stimulates transcription of the insulin gene (Ubeda <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2004</xref>). CDK5 also increases transcription of the acetylcholine receptor (Fu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2001</xref>). Further, CDK5 is involved in gene regulation that promotes apoptosis. Thus it promotes apoptosis by inhibiting myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2003</xref>). It also stabilizes the transcription factor, p53, by phosphorylating it on Ser-15, Ser-33, and Ser-46 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses. The phosphorylation prevents association of p53 with Mdm2, an association that would otherwise facilitate ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>). Thus the p53 phosphorylated by CDK5 is stabilized, contributing to the induction of proapoptotic gene expression. Hypertonicity activates p53, but this activation protects against apoptosis, rather than promoting it (Dmitrieva <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2000</xref>; Dmitrieva <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2001</xref>). The role, if any, of CDK5 in hypertonicity-induced apoptosis and activation of p53 has not been investigated.</p><p>CDK5 has a role in cellular senescence. Senescent cells are enlarged and flattened and express senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-Gal). CDK5 plays a central role in these changes by reducing Rac1 activity (Alexander <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2004</xref>). CDK5 activity increases in cells induced to senesce by a variety of stimuli, and inhibition of CDK5 activity reduces the morphological changes and the expression of SA-Î²-Gal. Repression of Rac1 activity by CDK5 is necessary for expression of the senescent phenotype, particularly for the actin polymerization accompanying senescent morphology. Interestingly, we previously found that high NaCl accelerates senescence both in cell culture and in the renal inner medulla in vivo (Dmitrieva and Burg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>), and we now find that it increases CDK5 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore it is plausible that activation of CDK5 contributes to high NaClâinduced cellular senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity by its nuclear localization</title><p>One factor determining the effectiveness of transcription factors like TonEBP/OREBP is how much of them is available in the nucleus. The amount available in the nucleus depends on both the total amount in the cell and its nuclear localization. High salt rapidly increases nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), but not the total amount of it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Later, both increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, B and C). Inhibition of CDK5 rapidly reduces high NaClâinduced nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), but not its total abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), and this reduction is associated with decreased transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, after 16 h of high NaCl, inhibition of CDK5 does not affect either the amount of TonEBP/OREBP in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) or its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). We propose that the reduction of high NaClâinduced increase of TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity at 4 h caused by inhibition of CDK5 is due to the reduction of the amount of TonEBP/OREBP in the nucleus. The effect disappears by 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) because the amount of TonEBP/OREBP in the nucleus is no longer affected by inhibition of CDK5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP apparently is a significant determinant of its transcriptional activity under these conditions. The CDK5-dependent, rapid nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP serves to accelerate transcription of its osmoprotective target genes.</p></sec><sec><title>CDK5 does not affect TonEBP/OREBP transactivating activity</title><p>Transactivating activity is another determinant of its transcriptional activity. Although the assay of TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity depends on the amount of native TonEBP/OREBP available in the nucleus, the assay of transactivating activity does not because the reporter of TonEBP/OREBP transactivating activity is a dual GAL4-based system that locates constitutively in the nucleus and is driven by a recombinant TonEBP/OREBP transactivating domain that is independent of native TonEBP/OREBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) (Ferraris <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional consequences of phosphorylation of TonEBP/OREBP-S155</title><p>S155 was previously found to be phosphorylated in HeLa cells and to affect nuclear localization (Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2008</xref>).

However, it is exported to the cytoplasm at 250 mOsm/kg (Tong <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2006</xref>).

Our finding that nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP-S155A is enhanced at all osmolalities, including 500 mOsm/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), is consistent with the previous finding that phosphorylation at TonEBP/OREBP-S155 contributes to its nuclear export (Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2008</xref>).

There are regulators of TonEBP/OREBP transcriptional activity that affect only its transactivating activity (Ferraris <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2002</xref>) without affecting its nuclear localization, namely, MDC1, a DNA damage response protein (Kunin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2010</xref>); HSP90, a chaperone and coactivator (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2007</xref>); Fyn, a tyrosine kinase (Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2002</xref>); and p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ko <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2002</xref>). Four additional proteins regulate both nuclear localization and transactivating activity, namely, c-Abl (Gallazzini <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>), PLC-Î³1 (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>), ATM (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2005</xref>), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase IA (PI3K-IA) (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2006</xref>). CDK5, however, is unique in that it regulates transcriptional activity by affecting nuclear localization without affecting transactivating activity. Considering the modular composition of TonEBP/OREBP, it has seemed surprising that any individual protein could affect both nuclear localization and transactivating activity. TonEBP/OREBPâs nuclear localization and export domains are located within its N-terminal one-third and its transactivating domain is located in the C-terminal two-thirds, as are the sequences involved in modulating it (Burg <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). The explanation for the combined actions may lie in dual activities of PLC-Î³1 (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>), plus its network connections. PLC-Î³1 signals both through its lipase activity and through association with other proteins via its SH3 domain (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). The lipase activity is necessary for its effect on nuclear localization of TonEBP/OREBP and the SH3 domain for its effect on transactivation, possibly by guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). Its probable network connections include c-Abl (Plattner <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2003</xref>), PI3K-IA (Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2002</xref>; Ye, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2005</xref>), and ATM (Khanna <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1997</xref>), explaining how they could participate in activating both the nuclear localization and transactivating activity of TonEBP/OREBP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>HEK293 cells in passages 38â48 were cultured at 300 mOsm/kg in Eagleâs minimal essential medium (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) as previously described (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>). Osmolality of the control medium was 300 mOsm/kg, and at experiment-specific time points, medium was replaced with ones at 300 mOsm/kg, 200 mOsm/kg (NaCl added to NaCl-free medium; Biofluids, Rockville, MD), or 500 mOsm/kg (NaCl added). CDK5 inhibitors roscovitine and CDK1/5 inhibitor were from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). Inhibitors were added to medium bathing HEK293 cells 60 min before changing the osmolality and were added in any subsequent changes of medium. All cells were cultured at 37Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and were studied while subconfluent. Anti-TonEBP/OREBP, antiâaldose reductase, anti-BRG1, anti-CDK5 and antiâCDK5-phospho-Y15 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-tubulin from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Anti-V5 was from AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC). The rabbit antiâTonEBP/OREBP-phospho-T135 and âphospho-S134 were produced by PhosphoSolutions (Aurora, CO). HEK293 cells stably expressing TonEBP/OREBP-1â547-V5-His were previously described (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids and transfection</title><p>Human TonEBP/OREBP cDNA clone KIAA0827 was a gift from Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). Sequences coding for amino acids 1â547 or 1â1531 of KIAA0827 were cloned into expression vector pcDNA6V5-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate 1â547- or 1â1531-V5-His, as previously described (Irarrazabal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2005</xref>). Mutants S120A, S134A, T135A, and S155A of 1â1531-V5 were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the supplierâs instructions. CDK5 WT or kinase dead dominant negative (KD) were kindly provided by Harish C.

Cell extracts were precleared with mouse IgG plus Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) at 4ÂºC for 1 h and then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody or anti-CDK5 antibody plus Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose at 4ÂºC overnight. The agarose beads were washed gently once with the lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with the SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, then subjected to Western analysis or kept at 4Â°C for kinase assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparation for mass spectrometry</title><p>HEK 293 cells stably transfected with TonEBP/OREBP-1â547-V5-His were grown in 15-cm dishes. Osmolality was increased to 500 mOsm/kg by adding NaCl for 2 h, and then nuclear extracts were prepared with NE-PER (Pierce, Rockford, IL), according to the supplierâs instructions, with added protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I and II (Sigma-Aldrich). Extracts were precleared for 1 h with rabbit IgG, biotin conjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), on Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Precleared supernatants were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-V5, biotin conjugated (ICL Lab, Newberg, OR), on Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Beads were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 and three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100. Both buffers included phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails. The beads were resuspended in 6 M guanidine-HCl/50mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> to denature the proteins and elute them from the beads. Protein samples were then reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 56Â°C and alkylated using 100 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The sample buffer was exchanged to 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (for trypsin digestion) or to 100 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.6 (for endoproteinase Arg-C digestion). Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used for buffer exchange. Proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) or endoproteinase Arg-C (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) in a ratio of 1:50 wt/wt overnight at 37Â°C. Peptide samples were desalted using a 1-ml hydrophilic-lipophilicâbalanced cartridge (Oasis, Milford, MA), followed by volume reduction in vacuo. Samples were resuspended in 50 Î¼l of 5% acetic acid, pH 2.5â3.0 and then loaded onto an IMAC column (Pierce) for phosphopeptide enrichment. Peptides were incubated with this Ga<sup>3+</sup> resin for 20 min agitating gently every 5 min and then washed and eluted according to the supplierâs protocol. Samples were then dried in vacuo, resuspended in 1% formic acid, and desalted with C18 Ziptips (Millipore) before analysis by MS/MS.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphopeptides identification and validation</title><p>IMAC eluates and flow-through fractions were both analyzed on an Agilent 1100 nanoflow system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) LC connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. MS spectra were analyzed with BIOWORKS software (Thermo Electron), using the SEQUEST search algorithm for peptide identification. Peak masses were searched against the most current version of the Human RefSeq Database (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and its reversed complement with the following parameters: fixed carbamidomethylation of Cys; variable phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr when searching MS<sup>2</sup>; and use of a preliminary exclusion filter to remove poor-quality spectra. The filter removed any spectrum with the following values for the charge state of the peptide and the associated Xcorr score: +1 â¤ 1.5; +2 â¤ 2.0; and +3 â¤ 2.5. Xcorr takes into account the number of peaks matched between actual and theoretical spectra and is directly proportional to spectral quality. We used Ascore, a probability-based score (Beausoleil <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>), to estimate the probability of correct phosphorylation site localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinase assays</title><p>Beads containing CDK5 immunoprecipitated from cell extracts were suspended in Kinase Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and then incubated with 1 Î¼g TonEBP/OREBP-T135 peptide (QQHPSTPKRH) in assay buffer supplemented with 200 Î¼M ATP (Cell Signaling Technology) at 30Â°C for 30 min. Supernatants were analyzed by dot blot for phosphorylated TonEBP/OREBP-T135. The relative amounts of CDK5 present on the beads were measured by Western analysis after decanting the supernatant. For in vitro kinase assay, the following recombinant kinases were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: ERK1, JNK1, PKAc, PKC, p38, CDK1, and CDK5; 100 ng of recombinant kinase was incubated in kinase buffer containing 200 Î¼M ATP and 1 Î¼g TonEBP-T135 peptide in 30 Î¼l final volume for 30 min at 30Â°C and analyzed by dot blot for phosphorylated TonEBP/OREBP-T135.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphospecific antibodies</title><p>Antibodies against TonEBP/OREBPâphospho-S134 and -T135 were prepared by PhosphoSolutions.
