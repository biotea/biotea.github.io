          <title>Background</title>
          <p>RhoGDI proteins are important regulators of the small GTPase Rac, because they shuttle Rac from the cytoplasm to membranes and also protect Rac from activation, deactivation and degradation. How the binding and release of Rac from RhoGDI is regulated is not precisely understood.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We report that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fer is able to phosphorylate RhoGDIÎ± and form a direct protein complex with it. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal end of RhoGDIÎ±. Activation of Fer by reactive oxygen species caused increased phosphorylation of RhoGDIÎ± and pervanadate treatment further augmented this. Tyrosine phosphorylation of RhoGDIÎ± by Fer prevented subsequent binding of Rac to RhoGDIÎ±, but once a RhoGDIÎ±-Rac complex was formed, the Fer kinase was not able to cause Rac release through tyrosine phosphorylation of preformed RhoGDIÎ±-Rac complexes.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Rac proteins belong to the larger family of Rho GTPases that act as molecular switches. When bound to GTP, they are in an active conformation. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP causes an inactivating conformational change. Racs are post-translationally modified by the removal of C-terminal amino acid residues, followed by the attachment of a lipid moiety in the form of a geranyl-geranyl group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Because of this modification, mature Rac proteins are lipophilic and are only present in the cytosol when bound to the chaperone and transport protein RhoGDI. RhoGDI regulates the movement of Rac between the cytosol and membranes. Moreover, a recent study showed that Rho proteins compete for binding to a limited pool of RhoGDI, which, once it has bound them, provides stabilization and protection from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>There are only three distinct RhoGDI proteins, of which RhoGDIÎ± is the most ubiquitously expressed. The structure of RhoGDI bound to small GTPases has been elucidated. Rac makes contact with both N-and C-terminal regions in RhoGDI, with its hydrophobic tail fitting into a pocket in the C-terminal part of RhoGDI. However, the exact mechanism by which binding and release of Racs from RhoGDI is mediated is not well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>RhoGDI can be phosphorylated on serine S101 and S174 by the serine/threonine kinase Pak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and PKCÎ± also phosphorylates RhoGDIÎ±, on residue S96 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, constitutively activated oncogenic Src, which has a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, was shown to phosphorylate RhoGDIÎ± on tyrosine residue Y156 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the current study we report that a normal cellular tyrosine kinase which is member of the Src family, Fer, is able to specifically tyrosine phosphorylate RhoGDIÎ± and that this can regulate the binding to Rac1.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>The <italic>BCR/ABL </italic>oncogene encodes a chimeric protein that contains most of the Abl tyrosine kinase. Proteomic analysis of cells transfected with Bcr/Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reported changes in phosphorylation of RhoGDI. To investigate if the deregulated Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase, similar to oncogenic Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], is able to modify RhoGDIÎ±, we performed an immunocomplex kinase assay with cells expressing Bcr/Abl or with Fer, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase related to Abl, in the presence of added recombinant GST-RhoGDIÎ± or control GST. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, left panel, the Bcr/Abl protein exhibited strong autophosphorylation activity, as expected. However, there was very little phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ±. In contrast, there was a prominent signal of phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ± in the sample expressing Fer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> right panel).</p>

      <p>To examine whether Fer and RhoGDIÎ± interact in cells, we transfected COS-1 cells with pEGFP-Fer (wild type, WT) or kinase dead D742R mutant pEGFP-Fer (mutant, MT), with or without RhoGDIÎ± and investigated possible protein complex formation between these by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, left panel, Fer-WT clearly co-immunoprecipitated with RhoGDIÎ±, which was phosphorylated on tyrosine, as judged by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine antibodies. In the converse experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel, Fer IP) we confirmed the interaction between Fer-WT and RhoGDIÎ±. In the presence of the Fer mutant lacking tyrosine kinase activity, no tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ± was detected, indicating that Fer tyrosine kinase activity is directly or indirectly needed to generate tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ±. Interestingly, the kinase-defective Fer protein exhibited a reduced ability to form a complex with RhoGDIÎ± (compare lanes in IP Fer, IB for RhoGDIÎ±), suggesting that the binding of these two proteins is facilitated by tyrosine phosphorylation. This is in agreement with the finding that the isolated Fer SH2 domain binds to RhoGDIÎ± on far-Western blots (not shown). Importantly, we also were able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Fer with endogenous RhoGDIÎ± in a lysate of the mast cell line RBL-2H3. This indicates that the complex formation between RhoGDIÎ± and Fer also takes place without overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) were originally identified as a bactericidal mechanism, a role for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>as secondary messenger has now been well-established. Many groups suggest that Src may be a primary target of ROS, with some studies reporting activation of Src kinase activity upon ROS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since constitutively activated oncogenic Src had been shown to phosphorylate RhoGDIÎ± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we tested if exposure of c-Src to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>would activate it to phosphorylate RhoGDIÎ±. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, in the presence of c-Src and after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>exposure, we could detect tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ±. Sangrar et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] showed that ROS also induce Fer tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as trans-phosphorylation activity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we confirmed Fer activation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in different types of cells by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In addition, when we co-transfected Fer with RhoGDIÎ± and treated the cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, increased RhoGDIÎ± tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ± was visible as two discrete bands, indicating this protein is subject to processive phosphorylation.</p>

      <p>Tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins in the absence of an oncogenic, constitutively activated tyrosine kinase may be difficult to detect due to the transient nature of the phosphorylation and the activity of phosphatases. Wang et al. reported that pervanadate treatment allows detection of phosphorylation on RhoGDIÎ± because this inhibits protein-tyrosine phosphatases and traps proteins in their tyrosine-phosphorylated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Next, we examined if pervanadate would further activate Fer and increase RhoGDIÎ± tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, when cells co-expressing RhoGDIÎ± and Fer were exposed to pervanadate for 5 minutes, a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was seen both in Fer and RhoGDIÎ± proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The N-terminal regulatory domain of RhoGDI binds to the switch region of Rac whereas the C-terminal end adopts a conformation that accommodates the hydrophobic tail of Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To examine which domain interacts with Fer, we expressed the N- and C-terminus of RhoGDIÎ± as Xpress-tagged proteins, together with Fer, and immunoprecipitated each fragment of RhoGDIÎ± with Xpress antibodies. We could not detect a clear interaction of the N-terminal end with Fer (data not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> (RhoGDIÎ±-CT + Fer), in immunoprecipitates with the C-terminal end of RhoGDIÎ± and in the presence of pervanadate, we recovered tyrosine-phosphorylated Fer. Moreover, this domain of RhoGDIÎ± also was tyrosine phosphorylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This indicates that Fer interacts with and tyrosine phosphorylates residues in the part of RhoGDIÎ± that includes the domain that binds to the C-terminal end of Rac. We were also able to demonstrate that endogenous RhoGDIÎ± was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to pervanadate, which activates Fer in RBL-2H3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p>

      <p>We used purified proteins to examine if tyrosine phosphorylation of RhoGDIÎ± could regulate its ability to bind Rac. Fer was expressed as a GST fusion protein in baculovirus. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> (left panel), we first incubated GST-RhoGDIÎ± with Rac to allow these proteins to form a complex. Then GST-Fer or control GST was added with a kinase reaction buffer and the kinase reaction was initiated. As shown in the top panel (pY20 blot), both autophosphorylation of Fer and transphosphorylation of RhoGDIÎ± occurred as expected. However, there was no evidence that Rac was tyrosine phosphorylated (not shown). Rac protein was recovered in immunoprecipitates from both Fer-treated and non-Fer treated samples, indicating that the presence or absence of Fer does not affect preformed Rac-RhoGDIÎ± complexes. A different result was obtained when Fer was first incubated with RhoGDIÎ± and a kinase reaction was done. When Rac was subsequently added and allowed to bind, we found that it was not co-immunoprecipitated with RhoGDIÎ± in the Fer-treated sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The lack of binding of Rac to RhoGDIÎ± could be because tyrosine-phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ± has decreased affinity for Rac, or because the binding of Fer to RhoGDIÎ± prevented subsequent binding of Rac to RhoGDIÎ±. Interestingly, this effect is similar to that reported for oncogenic Src: when Src phosphorylated RhoGDIÎ±, the affinity of RhoGDIÎ± for Rac was also significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Tyrosine phosphorylation as a mechanism to regulate RhoGDIÎ± has not been widely investigated, although it was recently reported that pervanadate treatment of a pancreatic islet beta cell line caused the appearance of phosphotyrosine on RhoGDIÎ± and was accompanied by lack of Cdc42 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. There is also increasing evidence that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>regulates the balance of tyrosine phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation in cells. The current study shows that non-oncogenic tyrosine kinases are likely to play a role in regulating the binding of Rac GTPases to RhoGDIÎ± and through this, the cellular pool of Rac.</p>

Antibodies against pY20 and Rac1 were purchased from BD Bioscience (Franklin Lakes, NJ). pSG5-Fer was constructed by subcloning a 2.9 kb BamHI fragment from human Fer clone L3, encompassing the entire coding region and small 5' and 3' untranslated regions, into the BamHI site of pSG5. pEGFP-Fer (WT), pEGFP-Fer (MT D742R) and RhoGDIÎ± have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The N- and C-terminal fragments of RhoGDIÎ± were subcloned from pEGFP-RhoGDIÎ±-NT and pEGFP-RhoGDIÎ±-CT into pcDNA3.1/HisB by digestion with EcoRI/XbaI and have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. p-LNCX mouse c-Src was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA).</p>

        <p>A fragment containing the start codon of human Fer (5'-ggggatcc<underline>atg</underline>gggtttgggagtgacctg) was used to introduce a BamHI site immediately 5' to the Fer ATG. A 155 bp fragment amplified with this primer and a 3' oligonucleotide was digested with BamHI Ã NsiI and the 5' BamHI-NsiI fragment ligated with a 3' 1.2 kb NsiI-KpnI fragment isolated from plasmid Fer SV-7-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] into pSK digested with BamHI Ã KpnI. A 1.4 kb BamHI-KpnI fragment from this plasmid was ligated with a 1.3 kb KpnI-EcoRI fragment into the pAcG2T baculovirus transfer vector digested with BamHI Ã EcoRI. <italic>S. frugiperda </italic>Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's Insect medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (heat-inactivated) and 10 Î¼g/ml Gentamycin (Invitrogen). DNA transfections used 0.5 Î¼g BaculoGold viral DNA and 2 Î¼g of recombinant baculovirus transfer vector. Three rounds of viral amplification were performed and the third amplification used for large-scale infection and baculovirus production. GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose. GST-Fer was washed and concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon) filter. Bacterially expressed RhoGDIÎ± and Rac1 were prepared as previously described, with the GST tag removed from the Rac1 protein by thrombin cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>

        <p>COS-1 cells and rat basophilic leukemia/mast cell RBL-2H3 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). All tissue culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). COS-1 cells were cultured in DMEM or RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml), L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (1 mM). RBL-2H3 cells were cultured in MEM containing 15% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p>

        <title>Immunocomplex kinase assay</title>
        <p>The kinase activity of Fer or Bcr/Abl was measured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Briefly, Fer-transfected COS-1 cells were lysed with 1Ã RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA) containing PMSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin and then incubated with Fer antibody, CH-6 for 2 h at 4Â°C. After incubation with protein A agarose for 30 min at 4Â°C, the affinity complex was washed with ice-cold high salt HNTG buffer (80 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton-X100, 500 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol) and then with ice-cold low salt HNTG buffer (80 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton-X100, 150 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol). For kinase reactions, 10 Î¼l of 40 mM PIPES and 10 Î¼l of 40 mM MnCl<sub>2 </sub>were added as well as 0.5 Î¼g of GST-RhoGDIÎ± protein or GST protein. The reactions were initiated by addition of 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham). After 40 min on ice, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2Ã SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were run on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and the radioactively labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography.</p>

        <title><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assay for interaction of RhoGDIÎ± and Rac1</title>
        <p>To investigate possible binding of phosphorylated-RhoGDIÎ± to Rac1, GST-RhoGDIÎ± protein (50 pmol) was first combined with GST-Fer (25 pmol) or GST alone (25 pmol) in 100 Î¼l of kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT). 20 Î¼M of ATP was added to the mixture, which was incubated for 30 min at 4Â°C for the kinase reaction. Next, 400 Î¼l of binding buffer (1Ã DPBS, 0.1% IgePal, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT containing the protease inhibitors PMSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and 50 pmol Rac1 protein were added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4Â°C. Incubation with antibody against RhoGDIÎ± for 1 h at 4Â°C was followed by Protein A agarose addition and a second incubation 1 h at 4Â°C. To investigate if phosphorylation of RhoGDIÎ± by Fer releases Rac1, GST-RhoGDIÎ± protein was incubated with Rac1 in binding buffer for 1 h at 4Â°C; GST-Fer or GST alone was added, and a pull down with glutathione agarose was done, followed by washing of the precipitate. Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of kinase buffer and ATP for 30 min at 4Â°C.</p>
