      <abstract>
        <p>The WNK (with no lysine kinase)âSPAK (SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase)/OSR1
(oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) signalling pathway plays an important role in controlling
mammalian blood pressure by modulating the activity of ion co-transporters in the kidney. Recent
studies have identified Gordon's hypertension syndrome patients with mutations in either CUL3
(Cullin-3) or the BTB protein KLHL3 (Kelch-like 3). CUL3 assembles with BTB proteins to form
CullinâRING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. To explore how a CUL3âKLHL3 complex might
operate, we immunoprecipitated KLHL3 and found that it associated strongly with WNK isoforms and
CUL3, but not with other components of the pathway [SPAK/OSR1 or NCC
(Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>â</sup> co-transporter)/NKCC1
(Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>â</sup> co-transporter 1)]. Strikingly, 13 out of the
15 dominant KLHL3 disease mutations analysed inhibited binding to WNK1 or CUL3. The recombinant
wild-type CUL3âKLHL3 E3 ligase complex, but not a disease-causing CUL3âKLHL3[R528H]
mutant complex, ubiquitylated WNK1 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic>. Moreover, siRNA (small
interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of CUL3 increased WNK1 protein levels and kinase activity in
HeLa cells. We mapped the KLHL3 interaction site in WNK1 to a non-catalytic region (residues
479â667). Interestingly, the equivalent region in WNK4 encompasses residues that are mutated
in Gordon's syndrome patients. Strikingly, we found that the Gordon's disease-causing WNK4[E562K]
and WNK4[Q565E] mutations, as well as the equivalent mutation in the WNK1[479â667] fragment,
abolished the ability to interact with KLHL3. These results suggest that the CUL3âKLHL3 E3
ligase complex regulates blood pressure via its ability to interact with and ubiquitylate WNK
isoforms. The findings of the present study also emphasize that the missense mutations in WNK4 that
cause Gordon's syndrome strongly inhibit interaction with KLHL3. This could elevate blood pressure
by increasing the expression of WNK4 thereby stimulating inappropriate salt retention in the kidney
by promoting activation of the NCC/NKCC2 ion co-transporters. The present study reveals how
mutations that disrupt the ability of an E3 ligase to interact with and ubiquitylate a critical
cellular substrate such as WNK isoforms can trigger a chronic disease such as hypertension.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Mutations that increase expression of the <italic>WNK</italic> (with no lysine kinase)
<italic>1</italic> gene result in an inherited hypertension syndrome termed Gordon's syndrome or
PHAII (pseudohypoaldosteronism typeÂ II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Missense
mutations in the related <italic>WNK4</italic> gene that alter three close-by non-catalytic residues
(Glu<sup>562</sup>, Asp<sup>564</sup> and Gln<sup>565</sup>) also cause Gordon's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. How these mutations influence WNK4 function is unknown. Most
evidence points towards the WNK1 and WNK4 isoforms exerting their effects on blood pressure through
their ability to phosphorylate and activate two highly related protein kinases termed SPAK
[SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase; also known as STK39 (serine threonine kinase 39)] and
OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. SPAK and OSR1 interact with MO25 (mouse protein-25) isoform
subunits to form a maximally activated complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The SPAK
and OSR1 kinases, once activated by WNK kinases, phosphorylate and activate members of the
electroneutral cation-coupled chloride co-transporters [SLC12 (solute carrier family 12)], including
the NCC (Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>â</sup> co-transporter) and NKCC
(Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>â</sup> co-transporter) 1 and 2, that are targets for
the blood-pressure-lowering thiazide diuretic and loop diuretic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Consistent with the critical role that the WNK1/WNK4-mediated activation of SPAK and OSR1 plays
in regulating blood pressure, knockin mice expressing a form of SPAK in which the T-loop residue is
changed to alanine to prevent activation by WNK isoforms have low blood pressure and reduced
phosphorylation of NCC in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. SPAK-knockout mice display a similar phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Patients with Gordon's syndrome are also highly sensitive to
thiazide diuretics that target NCC, which is consistent with the WNK signalling pathway regulating
these critical ion co-transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Previous work has
revealed that a significant number of Chinese patients with a low blood pressure condition, termed
Gittleman's syndrome, possess a mutation of the major SPAK/OSR1-activating phosphorylation site on
NCC (T60M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Exciting recent research has revealed about 50 unrelated familial patients with Gordon's
syndrome, possessing no mutations in the WNK isoforms, but instead displaying mutations in either
CUL3 (Cullin-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or the BTB-domain containing protein
KLHL3 (Kelch-like 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. CUL3 is the core scaffolding subunit of a subtype of the largest class of E3 ubiquitin
ligases in the cell, called CRLs (CullinâRING E3 ligases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Like all ubiquitin E3s, CRLs transfer
ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme on to other proteins, resulting in the formation of ubiquitin chains
linked to the substrate. These chains are recognized by a large protease called the 26S proteasome,
leading to the proteolytic degradation of the ubiquitin-tagged protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. CUL3 assembles a multi-subunit modular CRL complex by associating with the
RING-finger protein RBX1 (RING-box 1, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) and variable BTB-containing
substrate adaptor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The BTB domain directly interacts with the Cullin N-terminus, whereas the
substrate is recruited through other protein-interaction domains. The best-studied CUL3 substrate
adaptor is the Kelch-like protein KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which regulates the
proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor NRF2 {NF-E2-related factor 2; also known as
NFE2L2 [nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2]} [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Structural studies have revealed that NRF2
directly interacts with the Kelch-like domain of KEAP1 to position NRF2 for efficient ubiquitylation
by the CUL3âRBX1 core ubiquitin ligase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Many other BTB proteins that are known to
assemble with CUL3 also bind their substrates through a Kelch-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>The identification of mutations in CUL3 and KLHL3Â in Gordon's syndrome patients suggests
that these two proteins may also form a CRL E3 complex that regulates blood pressure. The KLHL3
mutations found are either recessive or dominant, whereas CUL3 mutations are dominant. Dominant
KLHL3 mutations are clustered in short segments within or nearby the âKelch propeller
motifâ or the âBTB domainâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that they interfere with either substrate binding
or CUL3 binding. All of the CUL3 mutations identified result in skipping of exon 9, producing an
in-frame fusion of exon 8 and 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As with mutations in WNK1 and WNK4, patients with CUL3 and KLHL3 mutations can
be effectively treated with thiazide diuretics, which inhibit NCC in the distal nephron of the
kidney, suggesting that these mutations activate these ion co-transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. KLHL3 is reportedly also highly
expressed in the distal convoluted tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>As a first step in exploring the role that a CUL3âKLHL3 complex may play in regulating
blood pressure, we searched for KLHL3-interacting partners. Strikingly, we found that the wild-type
KLHL3 immunoprecipitated from mammalian cell extracts indeed interacts with CUL3 and also associates
with WNK isoforms, but not other components of the pathway we have tested. We observed that most of
the disease-causing mutations in KLHL3 or CUL3 investigated impaired binding to WNK1 or CUL3. We
demonstrate that a recombinant wild-type CUL3âKLHL3, but not a disease-causing
non-WNK1-binding CUL3âKLHL3 complex, robustly ubiquitylates WNK1
<italic>inÂ vitro</italic> and that siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown of CUL3 increases
expression of WNK1. We also present evidence that the two missense mutations in WNK4 that cause
Gordon's syndrome abolish its ability to interact with KLHL3. The results of the present study
demonstrate that the CUL3âKLHL3 complex may regulate blood pressure by interacting with and
modulating the ubiquitylation of WNK isoforms. Our findings highlight that disease-causing mutations
that disrupt KLHL3âWNK interactions lead to Gordon's syndrome.</p>

        <title>Evidence that overexpressed KLHL3 associates with WNK1</title>
        <p>To gain insight into how KLHL3 functions, we generated HEK-293 cells that stably overexpress low
levels of wild-type KLHL3 or two reported dominant KLHL3 mutations observed in Gordon's syndrome
patients (S432N and R528H). We immunoprecipitated KLHL3 and analysed the immunoprecipitations after
electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel stained with Colloidal Blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and Orbitrap MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This revealed
that in the wild-type and mutant purifications, KLHL3 was indeed the dominant Colloidal
Blue-staining band migrating at the expected molecular mass of ~65Â kDa, and as
expected was not observed in the control immunoprecipitate from HEK-293 cells not overexpressing
KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Consistent with CUL3 representing a key
binding partner for KLHL3 we observed that CUL3 migrating with a molecular mass of
~90Â kDa was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B), indicating that KLHL3 can
form a CRL complex with CUL3. Interestingly, the two selected mutant KLHL3[S432N] and KLHL3[R528H]
proteins associated with CUL3 at a similar extent as the wild-type KLHL3, indicating that these
mutations do not disrupt the ability to interact with CUL3. The most striking feature of the KLHL3
immunoprecipitations was an intensely Colloidal Blue-staining band migrating at
&gt;250Â kDa observed with wild-type KLHL3 whose intensity was markedly reduced in the
KLHL3[R528H] mutant and was absent from the KLHL3[S432N] mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This band was also absent from the control immunoprecipitate undertaken from
non-KLHL3-overexpressing HEK-293 cells. Strikingly, MS analysis revealed that this region of the gel
derived from wild-type KLHL3 immunoprecipitate contained significant levels of WNK1, WNK2 and WNK3
isoforms emphasized by very high Mascot scores (WNK1-3228, WNK2-842 and WNK3-463; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). WNK1 was also detected within the KLHL3[R528H] mutant
immunoprecipitate, but consistent with the reduced intensity of the &gt;250Â kDa band
observed by Colloidal Blue staining, the Mascot scores for WNK1 was markedly lower (455) than
observed for the wild-type KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). No WNK2 or WNK3
was detected associated with the KLHL3[R528H] mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure
1</xref>B). In accordance with the absence of the &gt;250Â kDa Colloidal Blue-staining
band in the KLHL3[S432N] immunoprecipitate, no detectable presence of any WNK isoforms was revealed
by MS analysis of these samples.</p>

was observed with SPAK/OSR1 (immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes both kinases) or
NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We also overexpressed KLHL3Â in

        <title>WNK1 is a substrate for the CUL3âKLHL3 complex
<italic>inÂ vitro</italic></title>
        <p>To investigate the ability of the CUL3âKLHL3 complex to directly ubiquitylate WNK1, we
expressed and purified the CUL3âRBX1 core complex, as well as the wild-type KLHL3 and mutant
KLHL3[R528H] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Wild-type KLHL3 and CUL3âRBX1
were mixed and used in <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> ubiquitylation reactions that also contained
ubiquitin E1, ubiquitin E2 (UBE2D3) and ubiquitin. When immunoprecipitated WNK1 was added to the
reaction in the presence of magnesium and ATP, we observed extensive ubiquitylation of WNK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Moreover, we observed no WNK1 ubiquitylation when the
WNK1-binding mutant form of KLHL3[R528H] was used in the assay in place of the wild-type protein
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). WNK1 ubiquitylation was not detected in the
absence of either CUL3 or KLHL3 or any of the proteins that function upstream of the CRL in the
ubiquitylation cascade (E1, E2D and ubiquitin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).
These results demonstrate that CUL3âKLHL3 forms an active CRL complex that through the
binding of KLHL3 to WNK1 can target WNK1 for ubiquitylation. We furthermore detected
CUL3âRBX1-dependent ubiquitylation of KLHL3Â in the <italic>inÂ vitro</italic>
ubiquitylation reactions, indicating that CUL3âRBX1 could directly regulate KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). This reaction was more pronounced in the presence of WNK1
and further work is required to establish whether binding of WNK1 to the KLHL3âCUL3 complex
stimulated CRL complex activity resulting in increased ubiquitylation of KLHL3.</p>

        <title>siRNA knockdown of CUL3 increases WNK1 expression and activity in HeLa cells</title>
        <p>We next attempted to reduce CUL3 or KLHL3 expression employing an siRNA approach to establish the
impact this had on WNK1 expression and activity. Although we were unable to reduce KLHL3 expression
robustly with any siRNA tested (results not shown), we could reduce CUL3 expression over 4-fold by
employing two different siRNA oligonucleotides purchased from Thermo Scientific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510111add.htm">http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510111add.htm</ext-link>). Consistent with the CUL3-dependent
ubiquitylation of KLHL3 we observed <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D), the knockdown of CUL3 was associated with a marked increase in the expression
levels of KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and Supplementary Figure S1),
further suggesting that CUL3 directly regulates the levels of KLHL3. We also observed that CUL3
knockdown consistently increased endogenous WNK1 expression approximately 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D, and
Supplementary Figure S1). Using qRT-PCR we studied the relative mRNA expression of WNK1 and found
that CUL3 knockdown did not impact on <italic>WNK1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E), suggesting that the up-regulation of WNK1 under these conditions is not
triggered by an elevation of gene expression. We also measured endogenous WNK1 activity after its
immunoprecipitation assessed by its ability to phosphorylate kinase-inactive SPAK expressed in
<italic>E. coli</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This revealed that CUL3
knockdown was accompanied by a ~1.6-fold increase in WNK1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Evidence that Gordon's syndrome WNK4 missense mutations inhibit binding to KLHL3</title>
        <p>To map the region on WNK1 that mediates binding to KLHL3 we expressed various fragments of
GST-tagged WNK1Â in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the wild-type GFPâKLHL3 and tested
which WNK1 fragments interacted. This revealed that the smallest fragment of WNK1 tested that
interacted with KLHL3 encompassed residues 479â667, a non-catalytic region immediately
C-terminal to the kinase domain that possesses a coiled-coiled domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Interestingly, the equivalent
region in WNK4 encompasses residues Glu<sup>562</sup>, Asp<sup>564</sup> and Gln<sup>565</sup>
located near to the coiled-coiled domain that are mutated in patients with Gordon's hypertension
syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Transgenic and knockin mice expressing
these WNK4 mutations display marked hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but the molecular mechanism by which these mutations disrupt
WNK4 function to cause hypertension is unclear. To test whether WNK4 missense mutations affected
interactions with KLHL3 we expressed GFPâKLHL3Â in HEK-293 cells stably expressing
similar levels of the wild-type WNK4 as well as two reported disease-causing mutations (WNK4[E562K]
and WNK4[Q565E]). Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that the wild-type WNK4 robustly bound to
KLHL3, but interaction with either disease-causing WNK4 mutant tested was strikingly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). As the residues whose mutation in WNK4 causes Gordon's
syndrome are conserved in WNK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), we generated the
equivalent disease-causing mutations in the KLHL3-binding WNK1[479â667] fragment and observed
that all mutations (E633K, D635A and Q636E) ablated binding to KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The identification of mutations in CUL3 and KLHL3 that cause Gordon's syndrome suggested that
this CUL3âKLHL3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure.
We have now demonstrated that CUL3 and KLHL3 indeed interact to form a functional CRL E3 complex.
Importantly, we found that in addition to CUL3, KLHL3 also interacts with the WNK1 and WNK4 isoforms
mutated in patients with Gordon's syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Moreover, many
of the identified Gordon's disease-causing mutations (Q309R, R384Q, L387P, S410L, S432N, R528H,
R528C and N529K) located within the putative substrate-binding Kelch-like domain of KLHL3 markedly
interfere with binding to WNK1. These data, together with the fact that we were able to successfully
reconstitute the KLHL3-dependent ubiquitylation of WNK1 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> and to
increase WNK1 expression following CUL3 knockdown <italic>inÂ vivo</italic>, suggest that WNK1
is a substrate for CUL3âKLHL3 and therefore defines a new substrate adaptor/substrate module
for a CUL3 complex implicated in human disease.</p>
      <p>The results of the present study furthermore suggest that WNK1 is the critical substrate for
CUL3âKLHL3Â in the control of blood pressure, as 8 out of 15 mutations that we have
tested disrupt the interaction of KLHL3 with WNK1. We have identified five other mutations that
interfere with binding to CUL3, which would also be expected to impair the ability of CUL3 to
regulate ubiquitylation of WNK1. As expected from these results, a disease-causing mutation of KLHL3
that no longer binds to WNK1 also abolished WNK1 ubiquitylation <italic>inÂ vitro</italic>. As
hyperactive WNK1 is known to cause high blood pressure, the control of WNK1 protein abundance by
ubiquitylation through CUL3âKLHL3 may be critical for blood pressure control. Thus we propose
that a lack, or reduction, of WNK1 ubiquitylation in patients carrying mutations in CUL3 or KLHL3
may result in the observed hypertensive phenotype. Further work is required to investigate this
hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Given that it is the role of the WNK signalling pathway in the key DCT (distal convoluted tubule)
and TAL (thick ascending limb) of the kidney that controls blood pressure, it is possible that
regulation of WNK isoforms by the CUL3âKLHL3 occurs mainly in these highly specialized cells
geared to regulate salt reabsorption. This might explain why siRNA knockdown of CUL3Â in HeLa
cells only moderately affected WNK1 expression and possibly more striking effects would be observed
in DCT or TAL cells expressing mutated CUL3âKLHL3. Relating to this point it is worth
stressing that even a moderate, less than 2-fold, effect on WNK isoform expression in DCT/TAL kidney
cells could still have a sufficient impact on WNK signalling to stimulate NCC/NKCC2 inappropriately
and induce hypertension. It is likely that further analysis of this system will need to await the
availability of Gordon's disease knockin mutations in KLHL3 whose design will be facilitated by the
results of the present study. It will be fascinating to establish how mutations that impair KLHL3
binding to WNK isoforms have an impact on WNK isoform protein expression, ubiquitylation and
activity and how this affects NCC/NKCC2 ion co-transporters and hence blood pressure.</p>
      <p>How missense mutation of three close-by non-catalytic residues on WNK4, namely Glu<sup>562</sup>,
Asp<sup>564</sup> and Gln<sup>565</sup>, which lie immediately after the coiled-coiled domain, lead
to Gordon's hypertension syndrome was unknown. In previous work we have not observed any significant
change in the intrinsic kinase specific activity of any of the WNK4 disease-causing mutants that we
have tested (D. R. Alessi, unpublished work). The finding that disease-causing mutations of
Glu<sup>562</sup> and Gln<sup>565</sup> markedly impair binding to KLHL3 is very exciting, as this
suggests that loss of interaction with CUL3âKLHL3 may lie at the heart of understanding how
missense mutations in these residues of WNK4 results in Gordon's syndrome. Interestingly, we have
also found that mutating the highly conserved equivalent residues in WNK1 ablates interaction with
KLHL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). These findings suggest that this region of
WNK1 and WNK4 may operate as the major recognition site for the KLHL3âCUL3 complex. In future
work it will be important to study levels of WNK4 protein in patient-derived cells (DCT and TAL if
feasible) with missense WNK4 mutations of Glu<sup>562</sup>, Asp<sup>564</sup> and
Gln<sup>565</sup>. It would be critical to establish whether WNK4 mutations enhanced the levels of
WNK4 protein and how mutations affected the ubiquitylation of WNK4. Although WNK4[D564A] knockin
mice that develop hypertension have been described, unfortunately no direct quantitative comparison
of the relative expression levels of the wild-type and mutant WNK4Â in any tissue was
presented in that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This will be essential to
undertake in future work.</p>
      <p>It will also be interesting to investigate whether WNK1 ubiquitylation by CUL3âKLHL3
occurs constitutively or in response to a given environmental stimulus. It will be interesting to
establish whether binding of KLHL3âCUL3 to the WNK isoforms activates E3 ligase activity. An
important question to answer is also whether ubiquitylation of WNK targets it for proteasomal
degradation and/or is involved in regulating WNK activity in some other manner. The fact that levels
of WNK1 increase after CUL3 knockdown suggests that proteasomal degradation may play some part in
WNK regulation. The transcription factor NRF2, the best-studied substrate of CUL3, is constitutively
ubiquitylated and targeted for degradation by the ubiquitinâproteasome system and is only
stabilized when the cell encounters oxidative stress, which allows it to initiate its protective
transcriptional programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. One could similarly imagine a
situation where WNK1 is a constitutive substrate of CUL3âKLHL3 and ubiquitylation is only
halted upon a hypotonic stimulus to allow salt retention in the kidney. However, the degradation of
other CRL substrates is not constitutive, but rather initiated by a signal, which usually results in
post-translational modification of the substrate allowing it to be recognized by the CRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Which of these two possibilities pertains to WNK1
ubiquitylation remains to be determined.</p>
