      <abstract>
        <p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based sensory organelles that organize numerous key signals during developments and tissue homeostasis. Ciliary microtubule doublet, named axoneme, is grown directly from the distal end of mother centrioles through a multistep process upon cell cycle exit; however, the instructive signals that initiate these events are poorly understood. Here we show that ubiquitin-proteasome machinery removes trichoplein, a negative regulator of ciliogenesis, from mother centrioles and thereby causes Aurora-A inactivation, leading to ciliogenesis. Ciliogenesis is blocked if centriolar trichoplein is stabilized by treatment with proteasome inhibitors or by expression of non-ubiquitylatable trichoplein mutant (K50/57R). Started from two-stepped global E3 screening, we have identified KCTD17 as a substrate-adaptor for Cul3-RING E3 ligases (CRL3s) that polyubiquitylates trichoplein. Depletion of KCTD17 specifically arrests ciliogenesis at the initial step of axoneme extension through aberrant trichoplein-Aurora-A activity. Thus, CRL3-KCTD17 targets trichoplein to proteolysis to initiate the axoneme extension during ciliogenesis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The primary cilium is a membrane-bound, microtubule-based sensory organelle that is composed of nine doublet microtubules, also called ciliary axoneme, elongated directly from the distal end of mother centriole or basal body. Defects in formation, maintenance and function of cilia often results in numerous diseases and developmental disorders, commonly known as ciliopathies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Ciliogenesis is evoked upon cell cycle exit and follows a series of ordered steps that have been characterized by detailed ultrastructural analysis of ciliated cells although there are some differences depending on cell type<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the intracellular pathway, the recruitment of Golgi-derived ciliary vesicles (CVs) to the distal end of mother centrioles marks the first morphological event during ciliogenesis, followed by the extension of ciliary axoneme and its associated ciliary membrane, and finally, the docking of this complex to the plasma membrane.</p>
    <p>Ciliogenesis and cell division are mutually exclusive events as the centrioles must be released from the plasma membrane to function as a mitotic apparatus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. It is therefore conceivable that a set of robust regulatory mechanism is required to suppress the inappropriate ciliogenesis in proliferating cells, and a growing number of centrosomal and ciliary components are actually reported to serve these functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. On the other hand, these proteins must be eliminated when cells exit from cell cycle and form cilia. It has been shown that some protein kinases, such as TTBK2 and MARK4, act to initiate ciliogenesis by excluding CP110 from the mother centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Moreover, autophagy-mediated protein degradation was recently reported to remove OFD1 from centriolar satellites to promote ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), one of the most important protein degradation system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, appears to be controversial and/or indirect, nevertheless a subset of ubiquitin E3 ligases, including pVHL and MIB-1, has been reported to promote ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
    <p>We have previously shown that trichoplein, originally identified as a keratin-binding protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, is concentrated at the subdistal/medial zone of both mother and daughter centrioles and activates centriolar Aurora-A kinase in growing cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. During ciliogenesis, trichoplein disappears from the mother centrioles, and depletion of this protein induces the aberrant ciliogenesis, whereas overexpression blocks ciliogenesis, indicating that trichoplein negatively regulates ciliogenesis at the mother centrioles.</p>
    <p>Trichoplein also controls the recruitment of microtubules to centrioles thorough interaction with Odf2 and ninein in non-ciliated HeLa cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Other groups have reported that in some tumour cells, trichoplein (also called mitostatin) exists at mitochondria and its overexpression causes the mitochondria fragmentation, thereby inhibiting tumour growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. A mitochondrial protein VDAC3 is also shown to negatively regulate ciliogenesis at the mother centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here we provide definitive evidence that UPS functions to initiate ciliogenesis by removing trichoplein from the mother centrioles. Our global E3 screening has identified KCTD17 as a substrate-adaptor for the Cul3-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL3s) that polyubiquitylates trichoplein at Lys-50 and Lys-57. The CRL3-KCTD17-meidated trichoplein polyubiquitylation and degradation plays a pivotal role in the initial step of axonemal extension during ciliogenesis through the inactivation of centriolar Aurora-A.</p>

        <title>UPS targets trichoplein to proteolysis during ciliogenesis</title>
        <p>When human RPE1 (telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelia) cells were exposed to cell cycle signals that induce ciliogenesis by serum starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, trichoplein prominently disappeared from the mother centrioles and partly from the daughter centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (mother centriole was judged by the nucleating cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; insets) or the presence of Odf2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34;</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>)). We further found that its protein level was notably decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, these reductions were completely blocked in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (MG132, Epoxomicin, ALLN and Lactacystin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1aâc</xref>). CP110 also disappears from the mother centrioles during ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, but its protein level was not regulated by proteasomal degradation after serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Considering that trichoplein was strikingly polyubiquitylated upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), the trichoplein removal from mother centriole depends upon the UPS.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Trichoplein degradation is essential for ciliogenesis</title>
        <p>Proteasome inhibition also blocked the ciliogenesis when the respective inhibitors were added at the timing of serum starvation in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,c</xref>). In contrast, if cells were treated with these inhibitors from the point at which trichoplein was considerably degraded but cilia were not formed yet, for example, 9âh after serum starvation, cilia were newly grown thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1câ²</xref>). We also added these inhibitors 24âh after serum starvation (trichoplein was more degraded at 24âh than at 9âh; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and found a marginal effect on ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The inverse correlation between the trichoplein level and ciliogenesis suggests that proteasomal degradation of trichoplein is a critical event for ciliogenesis.</p>
        <p>In addition to these observations, we previously found that overexpression of trichoplein at centrioles blocked the serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We therefore investigated whether the decrease in overexpressed trichoplein level permits the ciliogenesis using the non-degradable trichoplein mutant. We generated a series of myc-tagged trichoplein (myc-trichoplein) constructs in which Lys residues were substituted to non-ubiquitylatable Arg, and found that mutation at Lys-50 and Lys-57 (K50/57R) diminished its polyubiquitylation in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Polyubiquitylation of myc-trichoplein wild type (WT) was dramatically accelerated by serum starvation in RPE1 cells; however, K50/57R mutation, but not K50R or K57R, diminished this polyubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Blockade of new protein synthesis of myc-trichoplein by treatment with cycloheximide rapidly decreased the WT levels in serum-starved but not serum-grown conditions; in contrast, the K50/57R levels were stable in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results suggest that trichoplein polyubiquitylation at Lys-50 and Lys-57 triggers its degradation. As this mutation had no effect on its ability to activate Aurora-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), we decided to use a K50/57R mutant in the following studies. However, we were unable to evaluate the effect on ciliogenesis using cycloheximide because transcriptional control of ciliary gene expression plays a critical role in ciliogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>
        <p>We therefore established the Tet-On RPE1 cell lines that expressed MBP (maltose-binding protein)-tagged trichoplein (MBP-trichoplein) in a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent manner. In these cells, Dox withdrawal promptly decreased the protein level of MBP-trichoplein WT, but not K50/57R, in a polyubiquitylation-dependent manner upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>), as was the case with myc-trichoplein in cycloheximide-treated RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), eliminating the concern that the differences in regent (cycloheximide versus Dox) and protein tag affected the trichoplein degradation in RPE1 cells. In the presence of Dox, both overexpressed WT and K50/57R comparably activated Aurora-A and suppressed the serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>). Twenty-four hours after Dox withdrawal, WT level was drastically decreased to 10% and thereby resulted in Aurora-A inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>; lanes 3 and 4), whereas 70% of K50/57R remained present and kept on activating Aurora-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>; lanes 1 and 2). Under such conditions, cilia were newly formed only in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>; compare WT and K50/57R). These results collectively indicate that UPS-mediated proteolysis of trichoplein is essential for ciliogenesis.</p>

        <title>A trichoplein-binding protein KCTD17 controls ciliogenesis</title>
        <p>To identify a ubiquitin E3 ligase that controls ciliogenesis through trichoplein degradation, we carried out the two-stepped global E3 screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the primary screen, 1,172 E3 ligase proteins (including putative E3s; listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were purified from the human proteome expression resource library (HuPEX) using wheat germ cell-free expression system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We evaluated their binding to bacterially purified MBP-trichoplein by protein array, and identified ten potential E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We then performed the secondary screen using four distinct small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) per potential E3 ligase; depletion of KCTD17 (K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization domain-containing 17) protein by four independent siRNAs considerably interfered with the serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis both in RPE1 cells and IMR-90 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Immunofluoresence analyses of cell cycle markers, including cyclin A and BrdU incorporation, exclude the possibility that the defective ciliogenesis is due to the inappropriate cell cycle re-entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). In addition, KCTD17 silencing attenuated the serum starvation-induced polyubiquitylation of trichoplein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Thus, KCTD17 is a novel regulator of ciliogenesis that involves in trichoplein polyubiquitylation.</p>

KCTD17, Cul3 and a RING protein Rbx1/Roc1 were co-immunoprecipitated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), indicating that they are in the same complex.</p>
        <p>As similar to KCTD17 loss, siRNA-mediated depletions of Cul3 and Rbx1 also interfered with the serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis both in RPE1 and IMR-90 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), we reasoned that the ternary complex should function as an E3 ligase that polyubiquitylates trichoplein. To test this hypothesis, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution assays using bacterially purified ubiquitin, trichoplein, KCTD17, E1 (Ube1) and respective E2 enzymes, and Cul3-Rbx1 complex purified from HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Trichoplein was polyubiquitylated only when all of them were existed in reaction buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>; lane 3). KCTD17âtrichoplein interaction is essential for the polyubiquitylation because a KCTD17 mutant (ÎC; 1-241aa) that could bind Cul3 but not trichoplein was insufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>; lane 4). Among E2s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> we tested, UbcH5a and UbcH5b catalyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> polyubiquitylation of trichoplein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>; lane 6 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We further found that trichoplein was most efficiently polyubiquitylated in HEK293T cells when exogenous KCTD17, Cul3 and Rbx1 were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Taken together, KCTD17 serves as a substrate-adaptor for CRL3 that polyubiquitylates trichoplein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>

        <title>KCTD17 controls ciliogenesis via trichoplein and Aurora-A</title>
        <p>As noted above, serum starvation caused the trichoplein removal from mother centriole through its proteolysis in control RPE1 cells, but these were prevented in KCTD17-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). KCTD17 silencing also disrupted the serum starvation-induced inactivation of centriolar Aurora-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>), as trichoplein is a centriolar activator of Aurora-A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Expression of siRNA-resistant myc-KCTD17 rescued all these phenotypes caused by KCTD17 depletion, namely the defective ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and the deregulated trichoplein-Aurora-A pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Similar results were also obtained in MBP-trichoplein-expressing Tet-On RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h,i</xref>; compare WT and WT+KCTD17 siRNA). HEF-1 is also reported to regulate ciliary dynamics by activating Aurora-A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, but its protein levels were unchanged by KCTD17 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These results indicate that KCTD17 contributes to trichoplein degradation and thereby inactivates Aurora-A to induce ciliogenesis.</p>
        <p>It has been shown that trichoplein has numerous binding proteins other than Aurora-A<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and its overexpression causes the mitochondrial fragmentation in some tumour cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (see also Introduction). We found little changes in their protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) and the mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig.11</xref>) by overexpression, depletion or stabilization of trichoplein in RPE1 cells under our experimental conditions, suggesting that trichoplein may have the cell type-specific functions. Furthermore, the defective ciliogenesis caused by KCTD17 depletion was completely reversed by co-silencing of trichoplein or Aurora-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, we propose that the KCTD17-trichoplein-Aurora-A pathway controls ciliogenesis in RPE1 cells.</p>

        <title>KCTD17 depletion blocks extension of ciliary axoneme</title>
        <p>To get more insight how KCTD17 regulates ciliogenesis, we analyzed mother centrioles and ciliary structures of serum-starved RPE1 cells lacking KCTD17 by transmission electron microscopy. Ciliogenesis follows a series of stereotyped steps that begin with the docking of CVs to the distal appendages of mother centrioles, followed by the formation and extension of ciliary axoneme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>). After 24âh serum starvation, control cells often demonstrated the mother centrioles that were associated with the ciliary pockets with extended axonemal shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In contrast, as approximately 90% of KCTD17-depleted cells lacked the elongated ciliary axoneme (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>; KCTD17 siRNA #1), in most of these cells (12 out of 16), the CVs efficiently docked to the mother centrioles, judged by the appearance of appendages, and became invaginated by the accumulated electron-dense materials at the distal end of centrioles (named the ciliary buds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). No gross alteration was detected in the ultrastructure of mother centriole. We therefore conclude that KCTD17 is not required for the maturation of mother centriole and the centriole-to-membrane docking, but instead, plays a crucial role in the initial step of axoneme extension during ciliogenesis.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Trichoplein localizes to centrioles and suppresses the aberrant ciliogenesis by activating centriolar Aurora-A in growing cells, but disappears from the mother centrioles when cells are exposed to cell cycle signals that induce ciliogenesis by serum starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In this study, we show that the trichoplein removal depends on UPS and that CRL3-KCTD17 targets trichoplein to proteolysis through polyubiquitylation at Lys-50 and Lys-57 during ciliogenesis. If trichoplein is stabilized at mother centrioles by treatment with proteasome inhibitors, expression of non-ubiquitylatable trichoplein mutant (K50/57R) or KCTD17 depletion, in any of these cases, ciliogenesis is blocked. Thus, the trichoplein degradation is an essential event for ciliogenesis. We also demonstrate that Aurora-A silencing completely reverse the defective ciliogenesis caused by trichoplein stabilization, indicating that the KCTD17-trichoplein-Aurora-A cascade controls ciliogenesis at the initial step of axoneme extension (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
      <p>CP110 is also thought to inhibit the axonemal extension from the mother cenrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Similar to trichoplein, CP110 disappears from mother centrioles during ciliogenesis and this removal is essential. However, there are numerous differences between trichoplein and CP110. In contrast to trichoplein localization at the subdistal/medial zone of centrioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, CP110 localizes at the distal end of centrioles and structurally caps the centriole microtubles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Therefore, siRNA-mediated depletion of CP110, but not trichoplein, induces the elongation of centriolar microtubules in non-ciliated cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In addition, the CP110 loss is accompanied by a recruitment of the protein kinase TTBK2 to the distal end of mother centriles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, but do not depends on proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), during ciliogenesis. Whether or not trichoplein-mediated and CP110-mediated regulations are mutually interrelated in axoneme extension is an interesting area for further experimentation.</p>
      <p>CRL3-KCTD17 targets trichoplein to proteolysis in response to serum starvation, but the CRL3-KCTD17 protein levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>). Serum starvation had less effect on the myc-KCTD17 localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13b</xref>) and the trichopleinâKCTD17 interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Thus, serum starvation-induced trichoplein degradation appears to require additional mechanisms. One possibility is that CRL3-KCTD17 activity may be modulated through post-translational modification like phosphorylation by MARK4 or TTBK2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Alternatively, an unidentified deubiquitylating enzyme that counteracts the trichoplein polyubiquitylation may be active in growing cells and become inactive upon serum starvation. It will be future work to investigate whether the trichoplein degradation is regulated by these protein kinases or deubiquitylating enzyme and its physiological contribution to axoneme extension during ciliogenesis.</p>
