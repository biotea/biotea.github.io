      <abstract>
        <p>Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a DNA-bridging protein, highly conserved in metazoans. BAF binds directly to LEM (LAP2, emerin, MAN1) domain nuclear membrane proteins, including LAP2 and emerin. We used site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis to map functionally important residues in human BAF, including those required for direct binding to DNA or emerin. We also tested wild-type BAF and 25 point mutants for their effects on nuclear assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, which contain â¼12 Î¼M endogenous BAF dimers. Exogenous BAF caused two distinct effects: at low added concentrations, wild-type BAF enhanced chromatin decondensation and nuclear growth; at higher added concentrations, wild-type BAF completely blocked chromatin decondensation and nuclear growth. Mutants fell into four classes, including one that defines a novel functional surface on the BAF dimer. Our results suggest that BAF, unregulated, potently compresses chromatin structure, and that BAF interactions with both DNA and LEM proteins are critical for membrane recruitment and chromatin decondensation during nuclear assembly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> is a DNA-bridging protein with a dimer mass of 20 kD, which is highly conserved in metazoans (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 1998</xref>). BAF is not homologous to any known proteins, but has a helixâhairpinâhelix structural motif (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>) conserved among proteins that bind nonspecifically to DNA (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Shao and Grishin, 2000</xref>). BAF was first discovered as an activity in NIH3T3-cell cytosol that prevents reverse-transcribed retroviral DNA from undergoing suicidal autointegration (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Engelman, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Craigie, 1998</xref>). BAF dimers are proposed to associate with viral preintegration complexes in vivo, and noncovalently crossbridge viral DNA (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Craigie, 1998</xref>). Biochemical analysis showed that BAF dimers bind nonspecifically to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA); BAF does not bind RNA or single-stranded DNA (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). However, the conserved function of BAF in uninfected cells was not known.</p>
      <p>In a two-hybrid screen (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Furukawa, 1999</xref>), BAF was found to interact with lamin associated polypeptide (LAP)2Î², a nuclear inner membrane protein (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Foisner and Gerace, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, BAF appeared to localize predominantly on chromatin in the nucleus (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Furukawa, 1999</xref>), suggesting that BAF might function in the nucleus, despite its original purification from NIH3T3-cell cytosol (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Craigie, 1998</xref>). LAP2Î² is an abundant nuclear membrane protein with an â¼40-residue motif known as the LEM (LAP2, emerin, MAN1) domain. The LEM domain defines a growing family of nuclear membrane proteins (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2000</xref>), whose members include multiple splicing isoforms of LAP2 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gant et al., 1999</xref>), plus emerin, MAN1 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2000</xref>), Lem-3 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2000</xref>), and otefin (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg et al., 1998</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of LAP2 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Shumaker et al., 2001</xref>) and emerin (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>) show that the LEM motif is essential for binding to BAF and to BAFâDNA complexes. LEM domain structure, solved by NMR (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2001</xref>), complements both the shape and hydrophobicity of a surface on the BAF dimer (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, BAF can bind simultaneously to both LAP2 and DNA in vitro (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Shumaker et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that BAF might play a key role in attaching chromatin to the inner nuclear membrane. In addition, both LAP2Î² and emerin interact with nuclear intermediate filament proteins named lamins (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Foisner and Gerace, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clements et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan et al., 2001</xref>), which comprise a key structural element of the nucleus and play critical roles in nuclear assembly (for review see <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Stuurman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2001</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest an important hypothesis: by binding to LEM proteins, BAF might link chromatin directly to the inner nuclear membrane and indirectly to lamin filaments. This model predicts that BAF may be essential for nuclear assembly, or for the structural integrity of interphase nuclei, or both.</p>
      <p>In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to define and map functionally important surfaces on the BAF dimer. Through biochemical assays, we identified residues required for BAF to bind to DNA or emerin, and residues important for BAF dimer interactions. We then tested wild-type human BAF protein and our 25 point mutants for their effects on nuclear assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lohka and Masui, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Newport, 1988</xref>). The wild-type and mutant BAF proteins fell into four classes with respect to their nuclear assembly phenotypes, and were interpreted based on the biochemical activities of each mutant. Our results support the hypothesis that BAF has fundamental roles during nuclear assembly, and that BAF interactions with both DNA and LEM proteins are critical for chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope growth.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We used site-directed mutagenesis to make point mutations throughout the human BAF protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Twelve charged residues were changed to the opposite sign, charges were introduced at seven sites, and six residues exposed to solvent in the BAF dimer (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>) were replaced by alanine. All 25 His-tagged mutant proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria (see Materials and methods). These point mutants were used to identify residues in BAF required to bind emerin or DNA, and to examine interactions between wild-type and mutant BAF proteins.</p>

        <title>Residues in BAF required for emerin binding</title>
        <p>To identify residues required for binding to emerin, we tested the binding of wild-type and mutant BAF proteins to blot-immobilized recombinant emerin residues 1â222, comprising the full nucleoplasmic domain (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; see Materials and methods). Each BAF protein was <sup>35</sup>S labeled in coupled transcriptionâtranslation reactions, and used to probe human emerin on blots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Seven mutants (25E, 25Q, 46E, 47E, 51E, 53E, and 54E) showed little or no detectable binding to emerin, and six (6E, 8E, 9A, 27E, 27Q, and 75E) had consistently reduced binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), relative to the amount of each input probe (unpublished data), as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>. Three residues essential for binding to emerin clustered in a concave valley (see below) that complements the LEM domain (see Discussion).</p>

        <title>Mutations in BAF that affect DNA binding</title>
        <p>BAF binding to DNA was previously tested using gel-shift assays and short (21-bp) pieces of DNA (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Engelman, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Shumaker et al., 2001</xref>). Nearly all tested mutations disrupted binding to short DNA. By contrast, we examined BAF binding to longer pieces of dsDNA (200â6,000 bp) using native DNA-cellulose beads. Wild-type and mutant <sup>35</sup>S-labeled BAF proteins were each incubated for 2 h in the presence (+) or absence (â) of DNA-cellulose beads, to control for possible DNA-independent BAF aggregation. Samples were washed, and pelleted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Four mutants (6E, 25E, 27E, and 46E) had severely reduced or undetectable DNA binding activity, and six (9A, 25Q, 27Q, 51E, 54E, and 75E) had reduced DNA binding activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The remaining mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type. Residues critical for DNA binding were consistent with predictions from the BAF crystal structure (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>; see below).</p>

        <p>Unexpectedly, all mutations that disrupted binding to DNA also reduced binding to emerin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that these mutations might cause misfolding. Therefore, we tested a subset of all our mutants (14A, 25E, 41E, 47E, and 53E) by circular dichroism (CD) to measure Î±-helix integrity, and by size exclusion chromatography to assess dimer formation (unpublished data). Mutants 14A, 41E, and 47E folded as well as wild-type, ruling out misfolding. Mutants 25E and 53E had a slight decrease in helical content, but otherwise had CD spectra similar to wild-type BAF, indicating no gross disruption of secondary structure. Size exclusion on Sephadex 25 columns, which discriminate 10-kD monomers and 20-kD dimers, showed that wild-type BAF eluted as two peaks, as expected: one with a retention time indicative of dimers, plus a higher molecular weight aggregate (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Engelman, 2000</xref>). Mutants 14A, 41E, and 53E clearly had a major dimer peak, like wild-type BAF. There was no dimer peak for mutant 25E; instead, there was some larger aggregate and a peak that eluted slightly slower than dimers, suggesting that mutant G25E does not form normal dimers. Mutant 47E had a dimer peak. This was surprising because residue 47 maps to Î±-helix 3, and was predicted to disrupt dimerization. Based on these assays, we concluded that mutants 14A, 41E, 53E, and, surprisingly, 47E, were folded and formed homodimers as well as wild-type BAF. In contrast, mutant 25E was not grossly disordered but failed to form homodimers. Gly-25 mediates a tight turn between helices 1 and 2, and changing this residue to glutamate may stiffen the polypeptide backbone, in addition to introducing a negative charge.</p>
        <p>We did one further assay, to anticipate the behavior of each BAF mutant when added to <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts containing wild-type <italic>Xenopus</italic> BAF. Selected His-tagged BAF mutants were incubated with equal amounts of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled wild-type BAF and then immunoprecipitated using anti-His antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). This subunit exchange assay tested the ability of wild-type <sup>35</sup>S-BAF dimers (and/or oligomers) to exchange or oligomerize with BAF mutants. Compared with wild-type BAF, we expected that mutants with weaker dimer interactions would exchange more frequently with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled wild-type BAF. The wild-type control showed relatively low (ratio â¼ 0.1) levels of subunit exchange or oligomerization with wild-type <sup>35</sup>S-BAF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, left). The same low signal was seen for mutants 25E and 41E (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, left) and 14A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, right), relative to input His-tagged wild-type BAF. Note that a low signal was consistent with either (a) stable dimerization with no exchange of subunits, or (b) complete failure to dimerize or oligomerize. Slightly higher signals were seen for mutants 18A, 53E, 54E, and 75E, but this difference may not be significant. However, wild-type <sup>35</sup>S-BAF exchanged at abnormally high levels with mutants 47E and 51E (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). We concluded that mutants 47E and 51E had high potential to exchange subunits (forming heterodimers or heterooligomers) with wild-type BAF, and that other mutants (18A, 53E, 54E, and 75E) had a slightly increased potential. The surprising result was that mutants 51E and 47E, which map to Î±-helix 3 and were predicted not to dimerize (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>), can form homodimers and weak heterodimers/heterooligomers with wild-type BAF. However, another surface of BAF, distinct from helix 3, and not affected by mutations 47E and 51E, might independently mediate dimer or oligomer interactions.</p>

        <title>Characterization of <italic>Xenopus</italic> BAF</title>
        <p>To test our hypothesis that BAF might function during nuclear assembly, we wanted to add exogenous BAF to nuclear assembly reactions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, which contain endogenous LEM proteins (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gant et al., 1999</xref>) and endogenous BAF (see below). We first cloned <italic>Xenopus</italic> BAF (xBAF), which is 84% identical and 91% similar to human BAF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Affinity-purified antibodies against a <italic>Xenopus</italic>-specific BAF peptide (residues 19â35) specifically recognized bacterially expressed recombinant xBAF as an â¼10-kD protein on blots of SDS gels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B, Recombinant), as expected. This same antibody predominantly recognized a â¼40 kD protein on immunoblots of the soluble fraction of <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B, Endogenous). This 40-kD band was not recognized by pre-immune serum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, pre), and immune recognition was specifically competed by the antigenic peptide (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, + pep). This 40-kD band probably represents a disulfide-bridged aggregate formed during cell lysis and boiling in SDS sample buffer, because BAF is highly sensitive to oxidation and contains four cysteines. When stained by indirect immunofluorescence in cultured <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelial (A6) cells, BAF localized diffusely in the nucleus, and was enriched at the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that BAF mediates chromosome attachment to membrane-bound LEM proteins. The intranuclear signal was consistent with BAF binding to intranuclear LEM proteins, such as LAP2Î± (Dechat et al., 2000). The same localizations were seen in an independent line of <italic>Xenopus</italic> kidney cells (XLK-WG) stained with affinity-purified immune (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E, Imm) and preimmune (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E, Pre) antibodies. Importantly, these experiments also revealed a low but reproducible signal for BAF in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E; see Discussion).</p>

        <title>Wild-type BAF can enhance or block chromatin decondensation in assembling nuclei</title>
        <p>To test for possible roles in nuclear assembly, we added recombinant wild-type <italic>Xenopus</italic> BAF protein to <italic>Xenopus</italic> nuclear assembly reactions, which consist of fractionated egg cytosol and membranes, plus demembranated sperm chromatin (see Materials and methods). For simplicity, we assumed that our recombinant BAF proteins were all dimers. Nuclei were assembled for two hours, then stained for DNA and imaged by light microscopy. The no-addition control nuclei assembled normally and had decondensed chromatin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, 0 Î¼M BAF). Added wild-type xBAF caused two opposite effects, depending on its concentration. With 0.5 Î¼M added xBAF dimers, nuclei were larger and appeared to have enhanced chromatin decondensation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). With higher levels of added xBAF (2.5 to 5 Î¼M), the chromatin remained small (condensed phenotype). We concluded that excess BAF might saturate its endogenous binding partners or regulators, allowing BAF to act in an unregulated DNA-bridging manner. Human BAF gave the same results, including better enhancement of chromatin decondensation at 0.5 Î¼M (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B).</p>

        <p>We next viewed the timecourse of nuclear assembly in the presence of 0 or 5 Î¼M added xBAF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). The condensed phenotype was established early; the sperm chromatin failed to either swell (an ionic effect; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Philpott et al., 1991</xref>, see 20-min timepoint) or decondense, and appeared to compress further over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). We hypothesized that the condensed phenotype might be due to excess BAF (a) blocking membrane binding to chromatin, (b) dominantly compressing chromatin, or (c) both.</p>
        <p>To determine if exogenous BAF also disrupted intact (preassembled) nuclei, we assembled nuclei in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts for 1 h, and then added 0.5 or 5 Î¼M BAF dimers. Exogenous BAF had no obvious effect on chromatin or nuclear growth, relative to buffer-treated controls (unpublished data). However, this does not rule out roles for BAF in interphase nuclear structure or function, because we do not know if exogenous BAF can disrupt preassembled endogenous BAF complexes.</p>

        <title>Transmission electron microscopy analysis of BAF-arrested nuclei</title>
        <p>When imaged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after 2 h of assembly, the control (no addition) nuclei had typical nuclear membranes with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, NPCs marked by asterisks). In contrast, nuclei arrested by 5 Î¼M added BAF had patches of double membranes separated by gaps (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, arrow), and areas devoid of membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). However, the most prominent abnormalities in these condensed nuclei involved chromatin. There was a compressed outer shell of electron-dense chromatin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, paired arrowheads) that appeared to encapsulate the interior chromatin. Indirect immunofluorescence with a lamin-specific antibody showed that this outer shell did not include lamins (Fig. S1 D, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200202019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200202019/DC1</ext-link>). BAF was detected on these nuclei by immunofluorescence, concentrated at the periphery (Fig. S1 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200202019/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200202019/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, the interior chromatin had a novel lattice-like morphology (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B).

        <p>To interpret the concentration-dependent effects of BAF, it was critical to know how much endogenous BAF is present in the soluble and membrane fractions of <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs. An affinity-purified anti-peptide antibody (serum 3710) was used to detect BAF by western blotting (see Materials and methods). BAF was present only in the soluble fraction (unpublished data), suggesting that BAF is released from membrane-bound LEM proteins during mitosis. The endogenous concentration of BAF monomers in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts is 25 Î¼M (12.5 Î¼M dimeric BAF), based on titrating <italic>Xenopus</italic> cytosol against known amounts of recombinant xBAF on blots (unpublished data; see Materials and methods). Because BAF is an essential protein (unpublished data), its abundance in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cytosol is no surprise. <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs are also stockpiled with histones, polymerases and nucleoporins, which enable rapid cell divisions in early embryos (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Woodland and Adamson, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Meier et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts contain about 12.5 Î¼M endogenous BAF dimers, we reinterpreted <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> as follows. Increasing the total BAF concentration in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts by only 4% (adding 0.5 Î¼M xBAF dimers) enhanced chromatin decondensation and nuclear growth, suggesting a positive role for BAF in nuclear assembly. However, increasing BAF by 20% (adding 2.5 Î¼M xBAF) compacted chromatin and blocked nuclear growth. The strong dominant effects of 20% extra BAF suggested that BAF is normally regulated by binding partners that are stoichiometrically limiting, such as LEM proteins (or novel partners), but not DNA (see Discussion).</p>

        <p>Human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> BAF are nearly identical (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A), and had the same effects on nuclear assembly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

Each mutant was added to nuclear assembly reactions at concentrations of 0.5, 2.5, or 5 Î¼M, incubated for 2 h, and imaged by light microscopy. BAF mutants fell into four phenotypic classes termed wild-type (decondensed-to-condensed), inactive, always condensed, and inactive-to-condensed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

This class included all six mutations in conserved (but not identical) hBAF residues. The inactive class (mutants 25E, 25Q, 27E, 27Q, and 46E) had no detectable effects, suggesting complete loss of activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B), consistent with their lack of binding to DNA or emerin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). These nuclei appeared normal by TEM (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The three always condensed mutants (14A, 18A, and 47E) caused chromatin to condense at all concentrations tested (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C). All three had normal binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), but then split into two subclasses: mutants 14A and 18A can bind emerin, but 47E cannot (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). We concluded that DNA (but not emerin) binding activity is required for the always condensed phenotype. When seen by TEM, nuclei assembled with low (0.5 Î¼M) or high (5 Î¼M) amounts of mutant 14A had thin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, A and F</xref>) or thick (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, B and G</xref>) shells of condensed chromatin, respectively, and patches of double membranes. Residues 14 and 18 define the top surface of the BAF dimer (see below). Because these mutants bind normally to both DNA and emerin, yet cause the condensed phenotype, we conclude that the top surface of BAF has a novel function.</p>

        <p>The 47E mutant was unique. At low (0.5 Î¼M) levels, 47E-arrested condensed nuclei had normal chromatin, and appeared to be enclosed by two parallel membranes that lacked pores (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> C). This was distinct from nuclei growth arrested by the addition of LAP2, which accumulate NPCs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gant et al., 1999</xref>). At high levels of 47E, chromatin had an electron-dense appearance similar to the original sperm chromatin template (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C), and few attached membranes, suggesting that this mutant lacked chromatin-remodelling activity.</p>

This class comprised at least two subclasses when examined by TEM, exemplified by mutants 41E (binds to DNA and emerin) and 53E (binds DNA, but not emerin). At 5 Î¼M, mutant 41E compressed chromatin like wild-type BAF (unpublished data). The same was true for mutant 53E, except that 53E also completely abolished membrane binding to chromatin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, E and I</xref>). Mutant 53E, which binds DNA but not emerin, suggests that BAF binding to LEM proteins may be crucial for membrane attachment to chromatin.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results suggest that BAF has important roles in chromatin architecture during nuclear assembly and nuclear growth, and may directly mediate chromatin condensation. Our major findings were as follows: we experimentally defined and mapped DNA- and emerin-binding residues on BAF, and residues required for dimerization; we discovered a proposed new functional surface on top of the BAF dimer; we showed that wild-type BAF has profound effects on chromatin structure during nuclear assembly; and identified an important subset of mutants (14A, 25E, 47E, and 53E) with distinct biochemical activities and phenotypes. Interestingly, wild-type BAF had either positive or negative effects on chromatin condensation, depending on BAF concentration. We propose that BAF has essential roles in chromatin attachment to membranes and chromatin decondensation during nuclear assembly.</p>
      <p>Our current model is that LEM proteins bind centrally on the BAF dimer (as seen in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B, front view), whereas DNA binds to the left and right sides (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> C). We propose that residues Pro-14 and Lys-18, on top of the BAF dimer, define a novel functional surface, because mutations at these sites had no effects on dimerization or binding to emerin or DNA, yet caused a distinct nuclear arrest phenotype (always condensed). We propose that this surface of BAF mediates either the oligomerization of BAF dimers (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>), or a novel function. Selected aspects of BAF function are discussed below.</p>

        <title>DNA-binding activity</title>
        <p>We identified only four mutants (6E, 25E, 27E, and 46E) that failed to bind 200â6,000 bp dsDNA, and six mutants (9A, 25Q, 27Q, 54E, and 75E) with reduced DNA binding activity. The remaining 15 mutants bound to DNA as well as wild-type BAF in our assay, in contrast to previous reports that mutants 8E, 32E, 33E, 53E, 60E, and 64E do not bind short (21-bp) DNA fragments (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>). We attribute this difference to DNA length. In previous studies, short DNA fragments were chosen deliberately to avoid BAF-mediated DNA-bridging activity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Craigie, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, short-DNA assays may fail to detect BAF mutants that can bind longer DNA. Our conclusions are supported by evidence that mutations at residues Lys-6 and Lys-18 do not abolish BAF's barrier-to-autointegration activity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Engelman, 2000</xref>), which requires BAF binding to retroviral DNA. We suggest that our assay identified physiologically-relevant residues required to bind DNA. Our findings point to residues 6, 25, 27, and 46 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> C) as critical for BAF binding to DNA. These residues map predominantly to the left and right sides of the BAF dimer (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> C), consistent with DNA binding sites predicted from the BAF crystal structure (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

        <title>Model: BAF dimers have two conformational states</title>
        <p>The three residues (51, 53, and 54) essential for binding to emerin clustered as shown in light blue (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> B), and defined a LEM-domain binding site on the dimer. This experimentally determined LEM-binding valley is consistent with the shape and hydrophobicity of the LEM domain of LAP2, and with chemical shift mapping results (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2001</xref>). One major finding from our work was that all residues required to bind DNA were also important for emerin binding (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This finding supports two conformational states for BAF: a DNA-bound conformation (which enhances affinity for LEM proteins), and a DNA-free conformation. A DNA-induced conformational change in BAF was independently deduced from our previous mutational analysis of the LEM domain of LAP2; we found that a LEM domain carrying the m13 mutation could not bind BAF, but did bind BAF-DNA complexes, implying that the LEM domain sees a different BAF structure in the presence of DNA (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Shumaker et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

        <title>BAF residues essential for binding to emerin</title>
        <p>We identified two mutants with wild-type DNA-binding that were completely defective for emerin binding: mutants 47E and 53E (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). When added at 5 Î¼M, both mutants blocked membrane attachment to chromatin, suggesting that interactions between BAF and LEM proteins may be critical for nuclear membrane recruitment during nuclear assembly. Native residue Gly-47 is buried, and our data suggest that introducing a negative charge at this site caused BAF to form weak dimers. Given that the LEM-binding site spans the dimer interface, we conclude that BAF dimerization may be essential for binding to emerin. At low concentrations, mutant 47E blocked nuclear growth even though by TEM the chromatin and enclosing nuclear membranes appeared normal, except for a possible lack of NPCs. Growth arrest by 47E could be explained by lack of nucleocytoplasmic transport. However, we do not understand how BAF might affect pore formation. Native residue Lys-53 is more easily interpretable because it is surface exposed at the predicted LEM-binding site, and the 53E mutation cleanly disrupted binding to emerin without harming protein folding, dimerization, or DNA binding. Nuclei assembled in a high concentration of either mutant 53E or 47E lacked attached membranes. These mutants, which do not bind emerin, support a model in which DNA-bound BAF must interact with LEM proteins to recruit membranes and promote chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope growth. Note that BAF was tested for binding to only one LEM protein, emerin, in our studies. It will be interesting to determine if our BAF mutants behave identically towards LAP2 and MAN1.</p>

        <title>Inactive mutant G25E: nonfunctional in vitro, yet toxic in HeLa cells</title>
        <p>Residues Gly-25 and Gly-27 are proposed to make crucial backbone contacts to DNA (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Umland et al., 2000</xref>). DNA binding activity was abolished when Gly-25 was changed to a negatively charged Glu, consistent with charge repulsion of the DNA. As discussed above, mutant G25E was defective for all BAF functions assayed. Nonetheless, when mutant G25E is expressed in living HeLa cells, it has no apparent effect until mitosis, when it lethally disrupts nuclear assembly (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>). As cells progress into telophase, mutant G25E prevents wild-type BAF and emerin from localizing at the core region of telophase chromosomes, and blocks the assembly of emerin, LAP2Î² and lamin A (but not lamin B) at the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>). We speculate that living cells can somehow rescue the G25E mutant. Alternatively, the G25E mutant might retain a function for which we did not assay, such as DNA-induced oligomerization (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>), or a novel function.</p>

        <title>BAF localization in interphase cells</title>
        <p>In cultured <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells, BAF localizes diffusely within the nucleus and concentrates near the nuclear envelope, consistent with its affinity for LEM proteins, most of which are anchored at the nuclear inner membrane. Nuclear envelopeâenriched localization was not previously reported for BAF (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Furukawa, 1999</xref>), but is seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (unpublished data) and HeLa cells (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>). In telophase HeLa cells, the colocalization of BAF and emerin at specific regions on telophase chromosomes is critical for emerin to subsequently assemble at the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>). During interphase, BAF is also found in the nuclear interior and the cytosol. Inside the nucleus, we hypothesize that BAF interacts with LAP2Î±, an abundant soluble (not membrane anchored) LEM protein that binds lamin A (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dechat et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2000a</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2000b</xref>). However, LAP2Î± fragments that lack the LEM domain localize normally in HeLa cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dechat et al., 1998</xref>), so the in vivo role of BAF with respect to LAP2Î± is not known. We also found BAF in the cytoplasm of cultured cells, consistent with the purification of BAF activity from the cytosol of NIH-3T3 cells (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Craigie, 1998</xref>). Although BAF is small, it seems unlikely that it would diffuse out of the nucleus, unless its DNA- and LEM-binding activities were inhibited. Our results neither address nor explain the potential roles of cytoplasmic BAF.</p>

        <title>Enhanced chromatin decondensation and nuclear growth: regulated BAF activity?</title>
        <p>We are intrigued by the enhanced chromatin decondensation and nuclear growth caused by adding 4% extra BAF to assembling nuclei. We propose that these positive effects are due to regulated interactions with endogenous LEM proteins. We hypothesize that properly regulated BAF has positive roles during nuclear assembly, in promoting membrane attachment, chromatin decondensation, and nuclear growth. We further propose that adding 20% extra BAF to assembling nuclei might saturate endogenous LEM proteins, or novel regulatory partner(s), and lead to unregulated (inherently compressive?) BAF interactions with DNA. Other models are also possible. Our results support the idea that a fundamental function of BAF is to bind LEM proteins during nuclear assembly, and thereby attach chromatin to the nuclear inner membrane. In the nuclear interior, BAF interactions with soluble lamin-binding LEM proteins (such as LAP2Î±) might link chromatin to intranuclear lamins. Our structureâfunction analysis of BAF, and the subset of biochemically-distinct BAF mutants (14A, 18A, 25E, 47E, and 53E) identified here, will provide a useful foundation for understanding this highly-conserved chromatin protein.</p>

        <p>A peptide comprising residues 19-35 of xBAF (KSVQCLAGIGEALGHRL) was synthesized by Boston Biomolecules, and rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced by Covance, Inc., in rabbit 3710, using as antigen the KLH-conjugated peptide. BAF antiserum 3710 was affinity purified by binding the BAF peptide (Reduce-Imm Reducing Kit and Sulfolink Kit, Pierce Chemical Co.), and used at dilutions of 1:100 for blots and 1:10 for indirect immunofluorescence (below).</p>
        <p>For immunoblots, proteins were loaded onto 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen Corp.), electrophoresed, and transferred onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes for 30 min. Blots were blocked for 1 h at 25Â°C in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk. Subsequent incubations in primary and secondary antibodies were done in PBST. xBAF was detected on blots using a 1:2,000 dilution of crude rabbit polyclonal serum 3710, or 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified serum 3710. Blots were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 25Â°C (or overnight at 4Â°C), washed in PBST for 20 min three times, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiârabbit antibodies (1:50,000 dilution; Pierce Chemical Co.), then washed in PBST for 20 min three times. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences).</p>
        <p>For indirect immunofluorescence of cultured <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelial cells (A6 and XLK-WG lines), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin.

Samples were immunoblotted as described above, probed with affinity-purified 3710 antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey antiârabbit antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and visualized by a colorimetric reaction (AP conjugate substrate kit; BioRad Laboratories). Blots were quantitated using FluorChem v.2 software (Alpha Innotech, Corp.). Intensities for known amounts of recombinant BAF were plotted as a standard curve using the Sigma Plot software (Jandel Scientific). The intensity of BAF in 1 Î¼l diluted cytosol fell within the linear range of detection, and the amount of endogenous BAF was calculated from the standard curve.
