        <p id="P1">The innate immune system responds to infections and tissue damage by activating cytosolic sensory complexes called inflammasomes. Cytosolic DNA is sensed by AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) during bacterial and viral infections and in autoimmune diseases. Subsequently, recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC links ALRs to the activation of caspase-1. A controlled immune response is crucial for maintaining homeostasis, but ALR inflammasome regulation is poorly understood. Here, we identified the PYRIN domain (PYD)-only protein 3 (POP3), which competes with ASC for recruitment to ALRs, as an inhibitor of DNA virus-induced ALR inflammasome activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a mouse model with macrophage-specific POP3 expression, the data emphasizes the importance of ALR inflammasome regulation in the monocytic/macrophage.</p>

    <p id="P2">Germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system are essential for host defense against pathogens through the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial factors. Cytosolic PRRs of the AIM2-like receptor (ALR, PYHIN or HIN-200 protein) and Nod-like receptor (NLR) families are necessary for the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18 and the induction of pyroptotic cell death, which requires the activation of pro-inflammatory caspases-1, -4 and -5 (caspase-1 and -11 in mice) within inflammasomes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The inflammasome adaptor ASC bridges PRRs to caspase-1, which facilitates caspase-1 activation by induced proximity<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In response to viral infections, inflammasomes sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including dsRNA, uncapped ssRNA and dsDNA. Thus, unique PRRs exist that sense cytosolic DNA and RNA<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In particular, ALRs sense viral DNA and assemble an inflammasome. Although absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) senses bacterial and viral cytosolic DNA<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, the interferon Î³-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) detects modified nuclear viral DNA and assembles an initially nuclear inflammasome<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. ALRs directly bind DNA with their HIN-200 domain<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and recruit ASC through their PYD<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. ALRs are highly diverse between mice and humans. While only four proteins exist in humans, mice contain 13 predicted members, but their function is largely unknown<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The antiviral host response depends on the production of interferons. The production of the type II interferon, IFN-Î³, by NK-cells, depends on IL-18 production in an AIM2-inflammasome dependent manner<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, but ALRs also regulate the type I IFN response<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Although inflammasome activation is essential for host defense and clearance of intracellular bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, excessive and uncontrolled inflammasome activation causes auto-inflammatory diseases and impaired activation promotes metabolic disease. Recognition of self-nucleic acids by PRRs directly contributes to the pathology associated with several autoimmune diseases, emphasizing the importance of a balanced inflammasome regulation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">The PYD-only proteins (POPs) represent a family of inflammasome regulators, which bind and occupy the PYD in ASC and PYD-containing PRRs and thereby abolish the PYD-PYD interactions necessary for inflammasome formation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Although POPs are encoded in several species, including humans, they are lacking from mice, suggesting development of a more complex mechanism of inflammasome regulation in some organisms<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, POP family members have not yet been studied <italic>in vivo</italic>. POP1 (also known as PYD-containing protein 1, PYDC1) is highly similar to the PYD of ASC and interacts with ASC, thereby affecting inflammasome activation and activation of NF-ÎºB<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. POP2 (also known as PYD-containing protein 2, PYDC2) interacts with the PYD of ASC, as well as with the PYD of several NLRPs<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. POP2 also prevents NLR-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The significance of POPs in regulating host defense is emphasized by certain poxviruses encoding a viral POP in order to evade the host immune response by blocking inflammasome and NF-ÎºB activation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Here we report the discovery of a previously undescribed type I IFN-inducible POP family member, POP3, which interacts with the ALRs AIM2 and IFI16 to inhibit ALR inflammasome formation. Thus we provide evidence that each major branch of inflammasome-activating PRRs evolved a POP regulator in humans. Silencing of POP3 in human macrophages enhances DNA and DNA virus-induced ALR inflammasome formation and hence the maturation and release of IL-1Î² and IL-18. Consistently, POP3 expression specifically in cells of the monocytic/macrophage lineage in transgenic mice, which is naturally not encoded in mice, impaired an ALR inflammasome response. Thus, POP3 functions as a key ALR inflammasome regulator in human and mouse macrophages and in an <italic>in vivo</italic> virus infection mouse model. The data also represents the first conditional inflammasome mouse model, emphasizing that inhibition of ALRs in macrophages is sufficient to impair systemic IL-18 and subsequent IFN-Î³ production to regulate the antiviral host response, which recapitulates global AIM2 deficiency.</p>

        <title>POP3 is expressed in response to type-I interferons</title>
        <p id="P5">We discovered a previously undescribed human POP family member, which we termed <italic>POP3</italic> (Genbank accession number: KF562078) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The <italic>POP3</italic> cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 342 bp (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) encoded from a single exon located within the IFN-inducible gene cluster between <italic>IFI16</italic> and pyrin and HIN domain family member 1 (<italic>PYHIN1</italic>) on chromosome 1q23, which also contains AIM2 and myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). In comparison, the syntenic mouse chromosomal region 1H3 is amplified and contains 13 predicted genes, but not a POP3 ortholog<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. <italic>POP3</italic> encodes a single PYD of 113 aa with 5 Î±-helices, whereas the PYD of AIM2 consists of 6 Î±-helices. Hence, the 3<sup>rd</sup> AIM2-PYD Î±-helix appears to be unstructured in POP3 (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), reminiscent to the structure observed for the PYD of NLRP1, which forms a flexible loop instead of Î±-helix 3 and is predicted to become stabilized upon PYD-PYD interaction<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. All 3 POPs exhibited low sequence homology to each other, implying that they might have unique functions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast to POP1 and POP2, POP3 showed high sequence similarity to the PYD of AIM2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and showed overall high similarity to the PYDs of HIN-200 family members (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. POP3 shared several of the characteristic sequence motifs within Î±-helices 1 and 2 of HIN-200 PYDs, but not those present within Î±-helices 5 and 6 (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Phylogenetic tree analysis of all PYD proteins also placed POP3 within the HIN-200 family (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Thus, POP3 most likely originated from exon duplication of the AIM2-PYD, reminiscent to POP1, which is derived from the PYD of ASC<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Consistently, POP3 revealed low sequence homology with the PYDs of mouse and human ASC and NLRP3 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <italic>POP3</italic> mRNA was expressed in monocytic cell lines and human primary macrophages (hMÎ¦), but not in B and T cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similar to ALRs, <italic>POP3</italic> expression was upregulated in response to IFN-Î² in hMÎ¦, but the TLR4 agonist LPS did not induce <italic>POP3</italic> expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Accordingly, POP3 was also detected by immunoblot in IFN-Î²-treated THP-1 macrophages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The <italic>POP3</italic> expression pattern was unique, since neither <italic>POP1</italic> nor <italic>POP2</italic> were regulated by IFN-Î², emphasizing a selective role of POP3 within the type I-IFN-mediated host response. <italic>POP3</italic> expression was upregulated as an early response gene within the first two hours, as well as a late response gene after 48 hours of IFN-Î² treatment, which was distinctive from <italic>AIM2</italic>, <italic>IFI16</italic>, <italic>IFNB</italic> and the IFN-stimulated gene <italic>RSAD2</italic> (also known as <italic>VIPERIN</italic>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Thus, the IFN-Î²-inducible POP3 is a member of the POP family and shows similarity to the PYDs of HIN-200 proteins.</p>

        <title>POP3 binds to ALRs and inhibits inflammasome formation</title>
        <p id="P6">Since PYDs usually exhibit homotypic interactions and POP3 contained several HIN-200 PYD -specific sequence motifs and displayed high homology to the PYD of AIM2, we investigated if POP3 was able to bind to the PYD of HIN-200 proteins. GST-POP3, but not GST control, bound to the PYD of AIM2 and IFI16. However, GST-POP3 showed no significant interaction with the PYDs of MNDA and PYHIN1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Upon transient co-transfection of POP3 with AIM2 and IFI16 in HEK293 cells, their interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">This observation was further supported by co-localization studies. AIM2 and IFI16 have been shown to co-localize with ASC, albeit at different sites and in response to different stimuli<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. While DNA from Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is sensed by AIM2 in the cytosol<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, modified DNA originating from latent Kaposiâs Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) infection is recognized by IFI16 within the nucleus <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. AIM2 was predominantly localized to cytosolic punctate structures, and this pattern was not altered in response to GFP adenovirus (AdV) infection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), while adenovirus-mediated GFP-POP3 expression resulted in co-localization in cytoplasmic punctate structures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also observed very limited co-localization of endogenous AIM2 with endogenous POP3 in a few cytosolic punctate structures in hMÎ¦ treated with IFN-Î² to up-regulate AIM2 and POP3 expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), but co-localization was greatly enhanced 2 hours after MVA infection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast to the predominantly cytosolic AIM2 localization, IFI16 localizes within the nucleus in endothelial cells, where it interacts with ASC<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, we observed solely nuclear IFI16 localization in hMÎ¦, which was not altered in response to control adenovirus infection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). However, in response to adenovirus-mediated expression of GFP-POP3, IFI16 was re-distributed to the cytosol, where it partially co-localized with GFP-POP3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). In agreement, we did not observe co-localization of endogenous IFI16 and POP3 in IFN-Î²-treated hMÎ¦ (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), nor did MVA infection alter IFI16 distribution or promote co-localization with POP3 at the tested times (data not shown). Yet, KSHV infection caused partial cytosolic redistribution of IFI16 as quickly as 2 hours p.i. (data not shown), which was more prominent 8 hours p.i.. At that time we observed partial co-localization of IFI16 with POP3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), although KSHV did not cause aggregation of IFI16 in hMÎ¦ at the titer used in our experiments. These results further supported an interaction of POP3 with ALRs.</p>
        <p id="P8">Accordingly, GST-POP3 also purified endogenous AIM2 and IFI16 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). However, in contrast to POP1 and POP2<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, POP3 did not bind to the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Unexpectedly, we also observed weak binding of recombinant POP3 to NLRP3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), in spite of the rather low degree of homology and the presence of the HIN-200 PYD-specific sequence motifs within POP3. Assembly of the inflammasome through PYD-PYD interactions is a key step for its activation and subsequent cytokine release. The PYD of ALRs and NLRP3 interact with the PYD of ASC and we hypothesized that the PYD-containing POP3 could interfere with this interaction. Contrary to the interaction of recombinant POP3 with NLRP3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, POP3 was not recruited to and did not disrupt the NLRP3-ASC complex in LPS-primed and nigericin-treated THP-1 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). However, POP3 was recruited to, and disrupted the endogenous AIM2-ASC complex in response to MVA infection in THP-1 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). Moreover, POP3 also caused a reduced interaction of ectopically expressed ASC and AIM2 in HEK293 cells by co-immunoprecipitation, indicating that POP3 is able to disrupt ALR inflammasome complex assembly by competing with ASC for the PYD binding site in AIM2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). These data suggest that POP3 functions selectively as an ALR inflammasome inhibitor.</p>
        <p id="P9">AIM2 inflammasome assembly causes the formation of ASC oligomers<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Only co-transfection of AIM2 and ASC in HEK293 cells caused the formation of ASC dimers and oligomers, but not transfection of ASC and POP3 or POP3, ASC or AIM2 alone. However, in the presence of POP3, AIM2-mediated ASC dimers and oligomers were significantly reduced (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>), thus supporting our hypothesis that POP3 can inhibit the PYD-dependent recruitment of ASC to AIM2. These data indicate that POP3 is a previously undescribed IFN-Î²-inducible protein, which directly interacts with the ALRs AIM2 and IFI16 through PYD-PYD interaction to prevent inflammasome formation.</p>

In the absence of POP3, following siRNA-mediated silencing in hMÎ¦, as determined by RT-PCR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), IL-1Î² release in response to cytosolic double strand (ds) DNA, such as transfection of poly(dA:dT) or infection with MVA, was significantly enhanced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Comparable results were also obtained with a second POP3-targeting siRNA (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).

THP-1 cells are widely used to study inflammasome responses and we also observed elevated AIM2-dependent release of IL-1Î² in POP3 silenced THP-1 cells in response to AIM2-, but not NLRP3-dependent stimuli (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). We also observed increased MVA-induced IL-18 release upon silencing of POP3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). This effect of POP3 was specific for inflammasome-dependent cytokines, since the release of the inflammasome-independent cytokines TNF (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) and IL-6 (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>) was not affected by POP3 silencing.

Conversely, THP-1 cells stably expressing GFP-POP3, but not GFP control, showed significantly reduced release of IL-1Î² (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>) and IL-18 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>), but not TNF (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>), in response to MVA and MCMV infection and transfection of poly(dA:dT), but not in response to MSU crystals, further supporting our observations obtained in hMÎ¦ upon POP3 silencing. Moreover, this cell system also recapitulated the IFN-Î²-inducible expression of POP3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). We next restored POP3 expression in POP3 silenced hMÎ¦ by adenoviral delivery of GFP-POP3, as determined by immunoblot (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>). While transduction with a GFP-expressing adenovirus into control siRNA transfected cells slightly increased MVA-induced IL-1Î² secretion, transduction with a GFP-POP3 expressing adenovirus strongly suppressed this response (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>). Overall our data suggest that POP3 functions as an inhibitor of DNA-induced inflammasome activation, while showing no impact on NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes.

Similar to the close chromosomal location of POP1 and ASC, POP3 is found next to AIM2 and IFI16, and POP3 is also absent in mice, despite significant amplification of this gene cluster (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). To study the POP3 function <italic>in vivo,</italic> and in particular its role in inflammasome regulation in macrophages, we generated transgenic (TG) mice expressing POP3 from the human <italic>CD68</italic> (<italic>hCD68</italic>) promoter in combination with the IVS-1 intron containing a macrophage-specific enhancer<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, which seemed the most promising after testing several commonly used macrophage-specific promoters (data not shown). Our promoter choice was further based on our observation that POP3 was specifically expressed in human CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages in inflamed lung lesions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), using a custom-raised antibody that did not cross react with other POPs, nor with the related IFI16 and AIM2 PYDs (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3i, j</xref>). Analysis of <italic>POP3</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>CD68-POP3</italic> TG mice by flow cytometry using SmartFlares, verified expression specifically in the monocyte/macrophage lineage, and particularly in the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> classical monocytes in peripheral blood and in CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> peritoneal macrophages (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), thus making this the first macrophage-specific mouse model to study inflammasomes and the first mouse model to study POPs. The low abundance POP3 expression in BMDM generated from <italic>CD68-POP3</italic> TG mice was induced by IFN-Î² as an early and late response gene at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), thus closely resembling its regulation observed in hMÎ¦. <italic>Aim2</italic>, <italic>Ifi16</italic> and <italic>Rsad2</italic> show higher inducibility in hMÎ¦ than in BMDM, despite the similar <italic>Ifnb</italic> transcription.

We also observed that POP3 protein expression could be stabilized in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), indicating that POP3 expression is not only tightly regulated on the transcriptional-, but also on the post-translational level. Post-translational regulation is further supported by the observation that THP-1 cells expressing GFP-POP3 from the constitutive CMV promoter express elevated levels of POP3 protein after treatment with IFN-Î² (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>).

Based on our observation that POP3 and IFI16 are able to interact, we investigated the release of IL-1Î² in response to KSHV infection, which was significantly decreased in the presence of POP3, establishing that POP3 impairs AIM2 and likely also IFI16 inflammasomes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). However, IFI16-dependent KSHV sensing still needs to be validated <italic>in vivo</italic> by utilizing <italic>Ifi16</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mice in the future. As for hMÎ¦, POP3 also inhibited DNA virus-induced IL-18 release (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>), but did not alter the release of the caspase-1-independent inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e, f</xref>). To ensure that random TG POP3 integration was not responsible for the observed phenotype, we validated our finding in an independent, second TG line with identical outcomes (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). We further generated TG mice ubiquitously expressing the human coxsackie and adenovirus receptor with deleted cytoplasmic domain (hCAR<sup>Îcyt</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> from the ubiquitin C promoter<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), which allows efficient infection with recombinant adenovirus at low MOI (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Infection of <italic>UbiC-hCAR<sup>Îcyt</sup></italic> BMDM with GFP-POP3 or GFP control expressing adenovirus further confirmed the inhibitory function of POP3 on the AIM2-induced IL-1Î² release independently of POP3 integration (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). As expected from low level ectopic expression of an inhibitor such as POP3, the AIM2-mediated IL-1Î² release by POP3 was not completely abolished, but nevertheless reached levels close to <italic>Aim2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> macrophages in response to AIM2-dependent stimuli.

This result further assured that the function of human POP3 would be translated in our mouse model. To delineate the mechanism by which POP3 inhibits ALR inflammasomes in mouse macrophages, we analyzed ASC oligomerization in response to AIM2 inflammasome stimulation with poly(dA:dT) in WT and <italic>CD68-POP3</italic> TG BMDM as a readout for AIM2 inflammasome formation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Insoluble ASC monomers, dimers and oligomers were drastically decreased in the presence of POP3 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), supporting impaired AIM2 inflammasome formation in the presence of POP3. Inflammasome formation is essential for caspase-1 activation, and although the protein amount of pro-caspase-1 was not altered in POP3 expressing BMDM, active caspase-1 p10 was significantly reduced in response to MVA and MCMV, but not in response to LPS + ATP in culture supernatants (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>), further emphasizing the functional specificity of POP3 for AIM2, but not NLRP3 inflammasome formation. The POP3 effect was specific for caspase-1 and was not caused by modulating NF-ÎºB activation, since the NF-ÎºB-inducible cytokines TNF and IL-6 were equally secreted (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e, f</xref>). In addition, we observed similar NF-ÎºB activation and MAPK signaling responses upon MVA infection in the absence and presence of POP3 in BMDM (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).

Enhanced IFN-Î² production in POP3 expressing BMDM was further supported by the increased and sustained phosphorylation of IRF3 in <italic>CD68-POP3</italic> TG BMDM in response to MVA infection (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). <italic>POP3</italic> expression was significantly elevated in response to MVA infection (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>), similar to its binding partners <italic>IFI16</italic> and <italic>AIM2</italic>, and reminiscent to what we observed by immunoblot in response to MVA infection and IFN-Î² treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P16">Although inflammasome-produced cytokines are necessary for host defense and metabolic health, excessive and uncontrolled cytokine production contributes to pathological inflammation and autoinflammatory diseases. Hence, factors that promote a balanced inflammasome response are essential for maintaining homeostasis. However, the regulation of inflammasomes is still poorly understood. In particular, mechanisms of self- and foreign DNA discrimination have not been completely elucidated, but a better understanding likely supports decoding the underlying causes that contribute to the onset of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Aicardi-GoutiÃ¨res syndrome or inflammatory myocarditis<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, a strict control system that properly regulates DNA-induced immune responses is of utmost importance. Here we show that the type I IFN-inducible POP3 is one of the proteins that might function to maintain a balanced inflammasome response in humans by specifically inhibiting ALR inflammasome assembly in response to immunogenic DNA. While other POPs directly interact with the inflammasome adaptor ASC<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, POP3 interacts with the PYD of ALRs and thereby prevents recruitment of ASC. Although, we find that recombinant POP3 interacted with NLRP3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we did not observe a functional impairment of NLRP3-dependent inflammasome formation and activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, POP3 was not recruited to the endogenous ligand-induced NLRP3-ASC complex, but was recruited to MVA-induced endogenous AIM2, where it prevented ASC recruitment. Thus, POP3 evolved as a specific ALR inflammasome regulator.</p>
      <p id="P17">Our study further revealed that the human HIN-200 cluster is more complex than previously described and differs from mice. However, mice may employ an alternative mechanism for ALR inflammasome regulation through the DNA-binding HIN-200 family member p202, which lacks the PYD and is not encoded in humans, but may function as an antagonist for AIM2 in mice<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. However, p202 is barely detectable in C57BL/6 mice, which were used in our study, but is highly expressed in BALB/c and NZB mouse strains<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. This may have been an important influence as to why POP3 expression in C57BL/6 mice was able to drastically alter the immune response upon MCMV infection in our study using âhumanizedâ C57BL/6 mice. Two proteins encoding only a PYD are predicted in mice within the HIN-200 cluster, which both lack a human ortholog. <italic>Pydc3</italic> (<italic>Ifi208</italic>) is predicted to encode only a PYD, but is significantly larger than POPs and might encode a HIN-200 domain, according to expressed sequence tags<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Two predicted <italic>Pydc4</italic> alternative transcripts encode only a PYD<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, but the longest transcript encodes a 586 aa protein, which is 95.2% identical to PYDC3. However, neither gene shows similarity with <italic>POP3</italic> and no expression data or functional data are available<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>Aim2b</italic>, a predicted <italic>Aim2</italic> splice form in mice, might most closely resemble the <italic>POP3</italic> function in mice. Similar to the human HIN-200 locus, the rat HIN-200 chromosomal region is also predicted to encode four HIN-200 proteins (<italic>Rhin2</italic>, <italic>Rhin3</italic>, <italic>Rhin4</italic>, <italic>Aim2</italic>) and the putative POP <italic>Rhin5</italic>, which is twice the size of <italic>POP3</italic> and shares less than 14% sequence identity and also lacks any expression data<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Contrary to mice, we speculate that humans evolved POP3 to interfere with ALR inflammasome assembly.</p>
      <p id="P18">The type I IFN-responsiveness further distinguishes POP3 from other POP family members. Thus, POP3 represents one of the type I IFN-inducible proteins that antagonizes IFN-Î³ in macrophages and inflammasome activation<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, and might contribute to the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions of type I IFNs<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. <italic>Aim2</italic><sup>â/â</sup> BMDM show elevated IFN-Î² production, although the mechanism by which AIM2 negatively regulates IFN-Î² production is unknown<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. We however, observed that POP3 silencing, which increases AIM2 signaling, also reduces IFN-Î² production, and accordingly, POP3 expression in hMÎ¦, THP-1 cells and BMDM promotes IFN-Î² production. Thus, besides promoting its own IFN-Î²-dependent production, POP3 might shift the immune response from an inflammasome-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production to anti-inflammatory IFN-Î² production, thereby further blunting IL-1Î² and IL-18 signaling through upregulation of IL-1RA and IL-18BP<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. A similar mechanism has been proposed for LRRFIP2, which inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by recruiting the pseudo caspase-1 substrate Flighthless-I<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, but also functions as a cytosolic DNA sensor, which promotes type I IFN production<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Significantly, the IFN-Î²-inducible expression pattern of POP3 as an early and late response gene was similarly observed in <italic>CD68-POP3</italic> TG mice. Thus, our humanized mouse is a valuable model to study inflammasome regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, which likely reflects POP3 functions in humans. Thus, there is the prospect that POP3 could also contribute to ameliorating DNA-driven autoimmune disease. Although, POP3 is lacking from mice, macrophage-specific TG expression revealed that POP3 is nevertheless functional in mice and thus, our study represents the first POP <italic>in vivo</italic> study. Although inflammasomes have been reported in multiple cell types, their relative importance for IL-1Î² and IL-18-dependent host responses <italic>in vivo</italic> have not been studied. Our study therefore also represents the first conditional inflammasome mouse model, emphasizing the key role of macrophages in DNA virus-induced inflammasome activation.</p>
