      <abstract>
        <p>The membrane lipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is continuously formed and degraded. Cells express two GlcCer-degrading Î²-glucosidases, glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and GBA2, located in and outside the lysosome, respectively. Here we demonstrate that through transglucosylation both GBA and GBA2 are able to catalyze in vitro the transfer of glucosyl-moieties from GlcCer to cholesterol, and vice versa. Furthermore, the natural occurrence of 1-<italic>O</italic>-cholesteryl-Î²-D-glucopyranoside (GlcChol) in mouse tissues and human plasma is demonstrated using LC-MS/MS and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-labeled GlcChol as internal standard. In cells, the inhibition of GBA increases GlcChol, whereas inhibition of GBA2 decreases glucosylated sterol. Similarly, in GBA2-deficient mice, GlcChol is reduced. Depletion of GlcCer by inhibition of GlcCer synthase decreases GlcChol in cells and likewise in plasma of inhibitor-treated Gaucher disease patients. In tissues of mice with Niemann-Pick type C disease, a condition characterized by intralysosomal accumulation of cholesterol, marked elevations in GlcChol occur as well. When lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol is induced in cultured cells, GlcChol is formed via lysosomal GBA. This illustrates that reversible transglucosylation reactions are highly dependent on local availability of suitable acceptors. In conclusion, mammalian tissues contain GlcChol formed by transglucosylation through Î²-glucosidases using GlcCer as donor. Our findings reveal a novel metabolic function for GlcCer.</p>

  <body><p>Membranes of higher eukaryotic cells contain glycerolipids, sterols, and sphingolipids. For each of these lipid classes, monoglucosylated structures have been reported. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the intermediate in biosynthesis and degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids (GSLs), is ubiquitous in mammalian cells, particularly located in the cell membrane (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Its presence in plants and some fungi is also documented. Glucosyldiacylglycerol has been identified in various plants, but its presence in mammalian cells is comparatively poorly documented (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Likewise, sterol-glucosides are known to occur in plants and fungal species (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but their existence in mammalian cells has not been extensively studied. Indications of the existence of glucosyl-Î²-D-cholesterol or 1-<italic>O</italic>-cholesteryl-Î²-D-glucopyranoside (GlcChol) in mammalian cells were first provided by Murofushi and coworkers (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). They described its occurrence in cultured human fibroblasts and gastric mucosa (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Heat shock was found to increase biosynthesis of GlcChol and, subsequently, induce HSP70 (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). GlcCer is formed by the enzyme GlcCer synthase (GCS, EC2.4.1.80). This transferase, first cloned by Hirabayashi and colleagues (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), is located at the cytosolic leaflet of the Golgi apparatus where it transfers the glucose-moiety from UDP-glucose to ceramide (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In a recent study, Akiyama et al. (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) showed that GCS does not synthesize GlcChol. They noticed that GM-95 cells deficient in GCS are unable to synthesize GlcChol without the addition of exogenous GlcCer. Furthermore, the same researchers demonstrated that, at least in vitro, the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA; E.C.3.2.1.45) generates, through transglucosylation, 25-[<italic>N</italic>-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) methyl] amino]-27-norcholesterol (25-NBD-cholesterol)-glucoside from GlcCer and artificial 25-NBD-cholesterol (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Such ability of GBA to perform transglucosylation was earlier demonstrated by Glew and coworkers, showing catalyzed transfer of the glucose moiety from 4-methylumbelliferyl-Î²-glucoside to retinol and other alcohols (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The enzyme GBA is well-studied because its deficiency underlies Gaucher disease (GD), a relatively common lysosomal storage disease (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Assisted by the small activator protein, saposin C, GBA degrades GlcCer to ceramide and glucose in lysosomes, the penultimate step in GSL catabolism (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Deficient GBA activity in GD patients consequently results in accumulation of GlcCer in lysosomes, most prominently in macrophages. These âGaucher cellsâ secrete specific proteins, as well as glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), the deacylated form of GlcCer (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The non-neuronopathic (type 1) variant of GD is presently treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), implying chronic twice-weekly intravenous infusion of macrophage-targeted recombinant enzyme (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). An alternative treatment of type 1 GD, named substrate reduction, is based on oral administration of an inhibitor of GCS (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells and tissues contain other Î²-glucosidases besides GBA that degrade GlcCer. All cells express the membrane-associated nonlysosomal glucosylceramidase, named GBA2 (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This enzyme is not deficient in GD patients. In fact, a compensatory overexpression of GBA2 in materials of GD has been reported (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). GBA2 has been found to be located outside lysosomes, being noted at the endoplasmic reticulum in hepatocytes (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in HEK293 cells overexpressing enzyme (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and at the endosomes in fibroblasts and COS-7 cells (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). GBA2 degrades GlcCer without need for an activator protein, and further differs from GBA in noted artificial substrate and inhibitor specificity (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Finally, some tissues express the enzyme GBA3, also referred to as broad-specific cytosolic Î²-glucosidase (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This enzyme shows relatively poor in vitro hydrolytic activity toward GlcCer and is thought to be primarily involved in detoxification of glucosylated xenobiotics (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). All three human retaining Î²-glucosidases employ the double displacement mechanism in catalysis. There are many documented examples of transglucosylation mediated by retaining glycosidases (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, theoretically, in addition to GBA, GBA2 and GBA3 might also generate GlcChol.</p><p>Modification of cholesterol by glucosylation changes the physicochemical properties of the sterol, rendering it far more water soluble. Given the potential physiological relevance, the natural occurrence of GlcChol and its metabolism in cells and tissues are of interest. We therefore studied the existence of the glucosylated sterol in mammalian tissues. For this purpose <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-isotope-labeled GlcChol was synthesized to be used as internal standard in sensitive quantitative detection of GlcChol by LC-MS/MS. Here we demonstrate the natural occurrence of GlcChol in mammalian cells and tissues. Moreover, we document the ability of both GBA and GBA2 to degrade, as well as synthesize, GlcChol. The importance of substrate and acceptor concentrations regarding the action of GBA and GBA2 in GlcChol metabolism is experimentally demonstrated. Our investigation demonstrates the surprising versatility of Î²-glucosidases, a finding discussed in relation to metabolism of sphingolipids and sterols in health and disease.</p><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The 25-NBD-cholesterol, <italic>N</italic>-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl]D-glucosyl-Î²1-1â²-sphingosine (C6-NBD-GlcCer), <italic>N</italic>-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl]D-erythro-sphingosine (C6-NBD-Cer), D-glucosyl-Î²-1,1â² <italic>N</italic>-palmitoyl-D-<italic>erythro</italic>-sphingosine (C16:0-GlcCer), and D-glucosyl-Î²-1,1â²<italic>N</italic>-oleoyl-D-<italic>erythro</italic>-sphingosine (C18:1-GlcCer) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

The physiological significance of glucosylation of cholesterol is hypothetically great because it renders a molecule far more water soluble. To establish the natural occurrence of GlcChol in mammals, we first needed to develop a quantitative and sensitive assay for quantification of GlcChol in plasma, cells, and tissues. The method developed by us makes use of newly synthesized <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-GlcChol as internal standard. Regarding extraction efficiency, chromatographic behavior, and ionization characteristics, the natural and isotope-labeled compounds are identical, so no correction for the sample matrix (ion suppression or ion enhancement) is required.</p><p>With sensitive quantification of GlcChol in place, we next observed that almost all tissues of mice show GlcChol. The relative high amount of the glucosylated sterol in the thymus, several nanomoles per gram wet weight, is striking and deserves special attention in view of noted abnormalities in NKT and B-cells in GBA-deficient GD patients (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It has been speculated by Mistry and colleagues that elevated GlcCer or GlcSph, via binding to CD1, may cause this phenomenon (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It will now be of interest to study whether GlcChol interacts with CD1 because abnormalities in concentration of this lipid in GBA-deficient GD patients are likely.</p><p>Indeed, we recapitulated the finding that GBA is able to form GlcChol by transglucosylation of cholesterol, at least in vitro. Artificial Î²-glucosides, like 4MU-Glc, may act as donor in this reaction in vitro, as well as natural GlcCer. GlcChol is, on the other hand, also an excellent substrate for hydrolysis by GBA. Our findings suggest that GBA normally lowers GlcChol levels. GBA-deficient LIMP2 KO mice show modestly elevated GlcChol in several tissues and the same is observed in GBA<sup>null/flox</sup> mice with induced type 1 GD (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Finally, plasma GlcChol is elevated in symptomatic type 1 GD patients. The actual role played by GBA in GlcChol metabolism, degradation versus synthesis, might be highly dependent on local concentrations of donors (GlcCer and GlcChol) and acceptors (ceramide and cholesterol) in the transglucosylation equilibrium of the enzyme. The importance of this is suggested by some observations made in the course of our investigation. In the first place, high intralysosomal cholesterol concentrations appear to favor formation of GlcChol by GBA. This is indicated by the 25-fold elevated GlcChol in the liver of two different models of NPC disease in mice. In accordance with this, induction of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation with U18666A in cells causes a rapid increase in GlcChol, which was noted to be abolished by inactivation of GBA. Consequently, under normal conditions, GBA seems to promote GlcChol degradation, but under excess cholesterol accumulation in lysosomal membrane, such as that found in NPC, the equilibrium of the metabolism is altered to favor GlcChol formation by GBA.</p><p>We observed that the nonlysosomal Î²-glucosidase, GBA2, can also generate GlcChol through transglucosylation in vitro. Again, GlcCer was found to be an excellent donor for this reaction. GBA2 is equally able to degrade GlcChol. Our finding of reduced GlcChol levels in GBA2 KO mice suggests, but does not entirely prove, that GBA2 in vivo contributes to the presence of GlcChol. The enzyme GBA2 is located differently in cells from lysosomal GBA, with its catalytic pocket exposed to the cytoplasmic leaflet of membranes. It likely encounters different concentrations of GlcCer and cholesterol than GBA, given its location close to the cellular sites of de novo synthesis of these lipids. To maximally form GlcChol through transglucosylation, high concentrations of GlcCer as donor and high concentrations of cholesterol as acceptor are optimal. Vice versa, low concentrations of GlcCer and cholesterol will reduce net GlcChol formation. This consideration holds equally for GBA2 and GBA. Fluctuations in sterols and sphingolipids conceivably occur in cells, for example, after uptake of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins or upon release of ceramide from sphingomyelin. The ability to maintain some equilibrium between (glucosylated) sphingolipids and sterols by transglucosylating Î²-glucosidases may have beneficial buffering effects for cells. Of interest in this respect is our finding that inhibition of GCS leads to reduction of GlcChol in cultured cells, plasma of mice, and plasma of GD patients. This strongly suggests that the availability of GlcCer is an important driver of formation of GlcChol through transglucosylation. Because the Î²-glucosidases, GBA and GBA2, also hydrolyze GlcCer, and thus tend to lower its concentration, the exquisite balance of various GlcCer-metabolizing enzymes and local cholesterol concentrations will determine GlcChol formation in subcellular compartments.</p><p>GlcChol is far more water soluble than cholesterol and, therefore, more suited for transport. The relatively low steady concentration of GlcChol does not exclude a vital role as intermediate in a transport pathway. Tentatively, water soluble GlcChol formed by transglucosylation at one cellular site would be transported and reconverted at the destination site back to more inert cholesterol. The combination of the two enzymes, GBA and GBA2, could provide such a mechanism without need for ATP. Of interest, in view of this speculation, is that LIMP2, the membrane protein interacting with GBA, has recently been shown to have a cholesterol binding site and potentially even a tunnel/channel function (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>A final consideration concerns the possible pathophysiological consequences of disturbed GlcChol metabolism. It seems likely that in individuals with abnormal GlcCer metabolism, as for example GBA-deficient GD patients, secondary abnormalities in GlcChol occur. Future research will need to reveal whether such abnormalities in GlcChol or in other glucosylated metabolites contribute to particular symptoms associated with GD. In conclusion, GlcCer has earlier been identified as an important structural membrane component and intermediate in GSL biosynthesis. In addition, it is known to act as an important sink for pro-apoptotic ceramide (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our study suggests that GlcCer may furthermore act as glucosyl-donor in the formation of GlcChol via transglycosylation.</p></sec>
