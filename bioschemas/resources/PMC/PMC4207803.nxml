      <abstract>
        <p>RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) plays a pivotal role in the detection of invading pathogens to initiate type I interferon (IFN) gene transcription. Since aberrant IFN production is harmful, RLR signaling is strictly regulated. However, the regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. By expression cloning, we identified Pumilio proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, as candidate positive regulators of RIG-I signaling. Overexpression of Pumilio proteins and their knockdown augmented and diminished IFN-Î² promoter activity induced by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respectively. Both proteins showed a specific association with LGP2, but not with RIG-I or MDA5. Furthermore, all of these components were recruited to NDV-induced antiviral stress granules. Interestingly, biochemical analyses revealed that Pumilio increased double-stranded (ds) RNA binding affinity of LGP2; however, Pumilio was absent in the dsRNA-LGP2 complex, suggesting that Pumilio facilitates viral RNA recognition by LGP2 through its chaperon-like function. Collectively, our results demonstrate an unknown function of Pumilio in viral recognition by LGP2.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mammals utilize innate immune system to counteract viral infections. The host pattern-recognition receptors, such as RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), sense invading pathogens and initiate innate immune responses. RLRs are composed of three RNA helicases, RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, and detect a series of RNA viruses, such as influenza or hepatitis C virus, in the cytoplasm. Upon RNA virus infection, RLRs transmit signals through mitochondrial adaptor protein, IPS-1, to activate transcription factor IRF-3/7, resulting in the production of type I interferon (IFN). Type I IFN plays a crucial role in innate immune system by inducing a hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes and its induction is tightly controlled at transcriptional and translational steps. Pumilio proteins are originally identified as translational repressor through direct binding to specific sequence motifs in the 3â² untranslated regions of specific mRNA, and regulate critical biological processes, such as development and differentiation. In this report, we identified human Pumilio proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, as candidate regulators of IFN signaling. Our results demonstrated an unknown function of Pumilio in viral recognition by LGP2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The host innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) detect pathogen molecules, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), to initiate innate immune responses <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoneyama1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Ireton1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Schlee1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Viruses invade host cells to replicate their genome and produce new infectious virions. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, sense the invasion and generation of viral RNA PAMPs and trigger antiviral responses <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoneyama2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoneyama3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the resting state, RIG-I and MDA5 exist in an autorepressed state, in which N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) are masked by the helicase domain; however, upon virus infection, these helicases are activated and oligomerized along with RNAs to form filament-like structures <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Peisley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Signals from RLRs are relayed to an adaptor, IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, VISA, Cardif) <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Seth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Meylan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kawai2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which then recruits TRAF adaptors, protein kinases TBK-1, IKK-i and IKK complex to activate transcription factors IRF-3, -7 and NF-ÎºB <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Knockout mouse studies have shown that RIG-I and MDA5 play a pivotal role in the detection of a series of RNA viruses in vivo <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. RIG-I detects Sendai virus, NDV and influenza A virus, whereas viruses belong to picornaviridae are sensed by MDA5. Although the mechanism underlying the differential sensing of different viruses by RIG-I and MDA5 is not completely understood, it is proposed that virus specificity comes from the dsRNA length and 5â²-end structure of viral RNA <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kato2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Pichlmair1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Hornung1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Schlee2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. LGP2 was originally thought to be a negative regulator because it lacks CARD, which is crucial for signal transduction. However, knockout and knock-in mouse studies have shown that LGP2 functions as a positive regulator via its ATPase activity <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, consistent with its high affinity binding with dsRNA <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoneyama3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Takahasi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have reported that RLR signaling is subject to numerous regulations <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kato3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. TRIM25 positively regulates signaling through interactions with RIG-I and ubiquitination <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Riplet (also termed RNF135 and REUL) positively regulates RIG-I signaling through ubiquitination of RIG-I, independent of TRIM25 <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. On the other hand, ubiquitin ligases, RNF125 <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Arimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and A20 <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and deubiquitinating enzymes, DUBA <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Kayagaki1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and CYLD <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Friedman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, are reported to function as negative regulators of RIG-I signaling. In addition to the ubiquitination of signaling peptides, involvement of the free ubiquitin chain has been proposed <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, accumulating reports suggest the importance of the virus-induced stress response in antiviral innate immunity. In particular, viral infection induces antiviral stress granules (avSGs), including RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2 and viral RNA <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Onomoto1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Fung1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our expression cloning for antiviral signal regulators identified Pumilio proteins. Pumilio proteins (also termed PUF, Pumilio/FBF) are evolutionary conserved from plants to mammals and were originally identified as translational repressors through direct binding to the specific sequence termed the Nanos response element (NRE) present within the 3â²-UTR of target mRNAs, thereby regulating various processes: embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, cell cycle and mitochondrial biogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Murata1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Forbes1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Parisi1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Dubnau1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In this report, we describe a novel and non-translational function of Pumilio proteins in viral recognition by LGP2.</p>

        <title>Pumilio Proteins Positively Regulate RIG-I Signaling in Response to NDV Infection</title>
        <p>We previously identified RIG-I by expression cloning of the human cDNA library using virus-inducible reporter gene activity as the readout <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoneyama2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This strategy allowed us to identify other candidate regulators of antiviral signaling, Pumilio proteins. Pumilio proteins share a highly conserved C-terminal Pumilio-homology domain (PUM-HD) <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In humans, two genes encoding PUM1 and PUM2 exist. Human PUM1 and PUM2 have similar domain structures and have high homology in their primary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). It was reported that PUM-HD is responsible for sequence-specific RNA binding, whereas the function of the N-terminal portion is unknown. We obtained two independent clones encoding full-length PUM1 and one clone of PUM2 (missing coding amino acids 1-368) by expression cloning. We constructed expression vectors for full-length PUM1 and PUM2 and examined their effect on <italic>IFNB</italic> promoter activity in L929 cells. Overexpression of PUM1 and PUM2 augmented <italic>IFNB</italic> promoter activity induced by NDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As <italic>IFNB</italic> promoter is regulated by both IRFs and NF-ÎºB, we investigated whether PUM1 and PUM2 affect promoter activity regulated by IRFs (p-55C1B) and NF-ÎºB (p-55A2). PUM1 and PUM2 augmented p-55C1BLuc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), as well as p-55A2Luc activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that PUM1 and PUM2 mediate the activation of both IRFs and NF-ÎºB transcription factors. In accord with the increased IFN promoter activity, NDV RNA replication was suppressed by the overexpression of PUM1 and PUM2 24 h after NDV infection, suggesting that PUM1 and PUM2 share antiviral potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). It is known that translational repression by PUM-HD depends on H850 in PUM2 <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Friend1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and this residue was conserved between PUM1 (H972) and PUM2. Therefore, we constructed expression vectors for their alanine mutants and tested their antiviral activity. Interestingly, these mutants markedly enhanced NDV-induced <italic>IFNB</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that the enhancing function is independent of the translational repression function of Pumilio proteins.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the function of PUM1 and PUM2 in IFN induction, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown. siRNA targeting for human PUM1 and PUM2 suppressed the expression of endogenous PUM1 and PUM2 protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, knockdown of endogenous PUM1 or PUM2 impaired the mRNA expression of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic>, one of the IFN-stimulated genes, in response to NDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g002">Figure. 2B and C</xref>). We also examined IRF-3 phosphorylation in the PUM knockdown cells, as well as IRF-3 dimerization. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004417.s001">Figure S1A and B</xref>, both phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF-3 were impaired in the Pumilio knockdown cells. Furthermore, the production of IFN-Î² protein was also reduced by PUM1 or PUM2 knockdown upon NDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Conversely, NDV RNA copies were increased by knockdown of PUM1 or PUM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). To rule out the possibility that Pumilio proteins regulate NDV-induced IFN production through affecting the expression level of RLRs, we examined the basal level of RLRs in the Pumilio knockdown cells. The knockdown of Pumilio proteins did not affect the basal and IFN-induced expression level of RLRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004417.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Finally, we also tested synthetic oligonucleotides, such as poly I:C, <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed 5â²pppRNA and poly dA:dT. In contrast to NDV infection, the knockdown of Pumilio proteins did not affect the IFN production in response to these stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004417.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).

        <p>LGP2 was shown to function as a positive regulator of RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated antiviral responses <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Specific associations between LGP2 and PUM1 and PUM2 prompted us to investigate the involvement of LGP2 in Pumilio-mediated transactivation.

        <title>Co-localization of PUM1 and PUM2 in avSGs upon NDV Infection</title>

In uninfected cells, PUM1 and PUM2 localized diffusely in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). NDV infection induced co-localization of PUM1 and PUM2 into cytoplasmic speckle-like aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We confirmed that a SG marker, TIAR, localized with the speckles containing PUM1 in NDV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g004">Figure 4B</xref>); therefore, these aggregates correspond to avSG.

        <title>PUM1 and PUM2 Augment dsRNA Binding Activity of LGP2</title>
        <p>Finally, to elucidate the mechanism of the enhancement of IFN gene expression by PUM1 and PUM2, we examined dsRNA binding activity of LGP2 in the presence or absence of PUM1 and PUM2. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using synthetic dsRNA and recombinant proteins. LGP2 bound to the probe, resulting in a slow-migrating complex. We confirmed that this slow-migrating band was a complex of the probe and LGP2 by a supershift experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). PUM1 and PUM2 exhibited very weak binding with the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the LGP2-dsRNA complex intensity was increased with the addition of PUM1 and PUM2; however, the mobility of the complex is hardly affected.

Viral infection such as NDV induces avSGs and accumulation of viral dsRNA, LGP2, PUM1, PUM2 and other avSG markers into avSGs. Within avSG, dsRNA interacts with LGP2/PUM complex, producing LGP2/dsRNA complex and Pumilio proteins are released from the complex.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We found that Pumilio proteins enhanced NDV-induced activation of the <italic>IFNB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Knockdown of PUM1 and PUM2 respectively attenuated gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g002">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that PUM1 and PUM2 function non-redundantly. Furthermore, PUM1 and PUM2 accelerated the activation of IRFs and NF-ÎºB transcription factors, suggesting their action in signal transduction, rather than post-transcriptional steps. Interestingly, PUM1 and PUM2 selectively interact with LGP2 but not with RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1 or TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). LGP2 knockdown diminished <italic>IFNB</italic> gene induction augmented by PUM1 and PUM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that PUM1 and PUM2 augment viral RNA sensing mediated by LGP2. It was shown that LGP2 does not participate in the detection of synthetic oligonucleotides, such as poly I:C or in vitro-transcribed 5â²pppRNA <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Consistent with this, the knockdown of PUM1 and PUM2 did not affect the IFN production induced by poly I:C, 5â²pppRNA or poly dA:dT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004417.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). LGP2 exhibits strong binding activity to dsRNA; however, it lacks CARD, through which the signal is relayed to IPS-1. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that LGP2 cooperates with either RIG-I or MDA5. Our findings uncovered a new mechanism of sensing viral RNA by LGP2, PUM1 and PUM2.</p>
      <p>Deletion analyses of PUM1 and PUM2 revealed that both N- and C-terminal regions are required for up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The N-terminal region is sufficient for interaction with LGP2 and to increase the binding affinity to dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004417.s007">S7</xref>). The C-terminal region, also termed PUM-HD, is sufficient for translocation to avSG upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), although the underlying mechanism is unknown.</p>
      <p>PUM1 and PUM2 have been known to regulate mRNA translation through sequence-specific recognition of NRE within the target mRNA. It was proposed that PUM-HD consists of 8 repeats of the module and each module recognizes a single nucleotide in NRE <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It was shown that single amino acid substitution is sufficient to abolish NRE binding and the translational regulation of PUM2 <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Friend1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. On the other hand, we found that NRE binding-deficient mutants (PUM1H972A and PUM2H850A) augment virus-induced signaling as strongly as the respective wt protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that Pumilio proteins facilitate two independent biological functions in translational and antiviral signal regulation. It is tempting to speculate that the repeated modules recognize component(s) associated with avSGs.</p>
      <p>Concerning the molecular mechanism, we found that PUM1 and PUM2 increased dsRNA binding affinity of LGP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, interestingly, we did not observe the ternary complex of dsRNA, LGP2 and PUM1 or PUM2; furthermore, the interaction between LGP2 and PUM1 or PUM2 was lost when dsRNA was added (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004417.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We therefore hypothesize that PUM1 and PUM2 have a cooperative function with LGP2 through physical association to increase its binding affinity to dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004417-g006">Figure 6</xref>). It has been shown that LGP2 facilitates RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated signaling <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Also it was shown that LGP2 and RIG-I interact <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In light of these observations, it is probable that increased dsRNA binding of LGP2 facilitates RLR signaling.</p>
      <p>Viral infection induces the formation of avSGs, including conventional SG markers, RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, PKR, OAS, RNase L, DHX36, TRIM25, PUM1 and PUM2, some of which are critical in sensing non-self viral RNA and triggering antiviral signaling. Unlike SGs induced by physical stress, viral RNA is accumulated in virus-induced avSGs <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Onomoto1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In summary, these results support the idea that avSGs act as a critical platform for sensing and discriminating viral RNA as a defense mechanism against viral infections. Although the IFN system is absent in plants, Pumilio proteins participate in the antiviral response in plants <xref rid="ppat.1004417-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, suggesting that the principal mechanism of sensing non-self RNA is evolutionarily conserved.</p>
