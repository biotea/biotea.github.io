        <p id="P3">Compelling evidence indicates that two autosomal recessive Parkinsonâs disease genes, <italic>PINK1</italic> (<italic>PARK6</italic>) and <italic>Parkin</italic> (<italic>PARK2</italic>), co-operate to mediate the autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy). Mutations in the F-box domain containing protein Fbxo7 (<italic>PARK15</italic>) also cause early onset autosomal recessive Parkinsonâs disease by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that Fbxo7 participates in mitochondrial maintenance through direct interaction with PINK1 and Parkin and plays a role in Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Cells with reduced Fbxo7 expression show deficiencies in Parkin mitochondrial translocation, ubiquitination of mitofusin 1 and mitophagy. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ectopic overexpression of Fbxo7 rescued loss of Parkin supporting a functional relationship between the two proteins. Parkinsonâs disease-causing mutations in Fbxo7 interfere with this process, emphasising the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinsonâs disease pathogenesis.</p>

    <p id="P4">Parkinsonâs disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Mutations in several genes have been linked to familial forms of Parkinsonâs disease, and studying their function has been valuable in highlighting pathways that may be important in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of the disease. Two of these, PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1; PARK6), a mitochondrial kinase, and Parkin (PARK2), an E3-ubiquitin ligase, act in a common pathway to control mitochondrial turnover. It has been shown that upon treatment of cells with a mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), Parkin is recruited to depolarised mitochondria which enables their selective autophagic clearance (mitophagy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This recruitment requires the kinase activity of PINK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, which is cleaved from the mitochondria under basal conditions, but whose full-length form accumulates on depolarised mitochondria under CCCP treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Parkin recruitment to mitochondria leads to ubiquitination of several targets including mitochondrial fusion proteins, mitofusins (Mfns)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, which promotes mitochondrial fragmentation prior to engulfment by the autophagosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">Mutations in the gene encoding F-box only protein 7 (<italic>Fbxo7</italic>) have been identified in a number of families with a severe form of autosomal recessive early onset Parkinsonâs disease similar to that caused by mutations in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>Parkin</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. F-box domain-containing proteins target substrates to SCF-type (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3-ubiquitin ligase complexes, usually by recruiting the substrate through a protein interaction domain and assembling a functional E3 ligase by associating with the adaptor protein Skp1 through an F-box domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Fbxo7 has a C-terminal proline rich substrate recruiting domain and also an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain which is present in the major isoform of Fbxo7 but is spliced out in a second isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Fbxo7 has both SCF-dependent and SCF-independent activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>; however, little is understood of its function in Parkinsonâs disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Here we demonstrate that Fbxo7 acts in a common pathway with Parkin and PINK1 to induce mitophagy in response to mitochondrial depolarisation and that disease-associated mutations in <italic>Fbxo7</italic> interfere with this pathway. We also show that Fbxo7 expression rescues the phenotype of <italic>Drosophila parkin</italic> mutants, confirming that the genes function in a common mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <title>Fbxo7 interacts directly with Parkin</title>
        <p id="P6">Given the clinical overlap between patients with <italic>Fbxo7</italic> and <italic>Parkin</italic> mutations, we investigated whether these two proteins might be functionally related. First, we tested whether they physically interact. In whole cell lysates extracted from U2OS osteosarcoma cells expressing Fbxo7-HA and FLAG-Parkin or in HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-Parkin, both exogenously expressed and endogenous Fbxo7 were detected in complex with Parkin after immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Performing the reverse experiment, immunoprecipitating overexpressed untagged Fbxo7 and immunoblotting for FLAG-Parkin, confirmed their interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">To identify the interacting region, T7-tagged Fbxo7 mutants lacking specific domains were tested using co-immunoprecipitation assays. The N-terminal 88 amino acids of Fbxo7 which comprise the Ubl domain appeared essential for an interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), and this was supported by the finding that FLAG-Parkin interacted with isoform 1 of Fbxo7 but not with isoform 2, a naturally occurring splice variant of Fbxo7 which lacks the Ubl domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Conversely, the removal of the C-terminal proline rich region of Fbxo7 did not affect the interaction with Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> pull-down assays were also performed using a GST-Fbxo7 (1-88) construct which was found to be sufficient for binding, confirming that the Ubl domain of Fbxo7 directly mediates Parkin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The Parkinsonâs disease-associated mutation T22M lies within this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), and this mutation significantly reduced Fbxo7 binding to Parkin by 88% Â± 3.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>). The R378G mutation caused a non-significant reduction in Parkin binding, and the R498X mutation had no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1c,d</xref>). Immunoprecipitating FLAG-Parkin from cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions revealed that although both proteins localise predominantly to the cytosol, the interaction occurred to a greater extent in the mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S3">
        <title>Fbxo7 participates in Parkin recruitment to mitochondria</title>
        <p id="P8">As Parkin has been shown to translocate to mitochondria upon treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, we investigated whether Fbxo7 also relocates to depolarised mitochondria. Over a time-course of CCCP treatment, endogenous Fbxo7 levels were found to decrease steadily in the cytosolic fraction and increase concurrently in the mitochondrial fractions of from HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). Immunoprecipitating FLAG-Parkin complexes from the mitochondrial fraction of SH-SY5Y cells revealed an increase in Fbxo7 protein levels in complex with FLAG-Parkin after CCCP treatment, consistent with an increase in the association of both proteins with the mitochondria following depolarisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">We next examined whether Fbxo7 regulates Parkin translocation in SH-SY5Y cells co-transfected with FLAG-Parkin and either non-targeting, scrambled (Scr) siRNA or Fbxo7 siRNA, which substantially attenuates Fbxo7 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). At 1 and 3 h CCCP treatment, silencing Fbxo7 significantly reduced the percentage of cells in which Parkin localised to the mitochondria compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2c, d</xref>), as scored by eye by an unbiased observer (see online methods). These data were independently confirmed by analysing the images using Pearsonâs correlation co-efficient (Rr) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2e</xref>). The reduction in Parkin translocation upon Fbxo7 silencing was rescued by overexpression of WT or R378G mutant Fbxo7 but not by T22M or R498X mutant Fbxo7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting that in addition to binding Parkin through its N-terminal Ubl domain, Fbxo7 requires its C-terminal proline rich region to recruit Parkin to the mitochondria.</p>
        <p id="P10">Although Parkin is known to localise to depolarised mitochondria it is not predicted to contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), raising the possibility that this translocation could depend on its interaction with a mitochondrially-targeted protein. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the primary sequence of the Fbxo7 protein suggested that it may possess such an MTS at the N-terminus of isoform 1, and this prediction depended on two critical residues (Arg-2 and Arg-6). To investigate the relevance of this putative MTS, we produced both a T7-tagged and an untagged Fbxo7 construct in which both residues are mutated (hereafter designated mt-MTS), and found that while a portion of WT T7-Fbxo7 was found to localise to the mitochondrial fraction of SH-SY5Y cells, mt-MTS T7-Fbxo7 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Furthermore, CCCP-induced mitochondrial translocation of FLAG-Parkin was not rescued by expression of mt-MTS Fbxo7 following silencing of endogenous Fbxo7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), indicating that this MTS is necessary for Fbxo7âs effect on Parkin relocation. None of the three Parkinsonâs disease-associated mutations affected the mitochondrial localisation of Fbxo7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2f</xref>). Overall, these data indicate that Fbxo7 facilitates Parkin translocation to the mitochondria in response to depolarisation.</p>

        <p id="P11">To assess a functional relationship between Fbxo7 and Parkin <italic>in vivo</italic> we used a well-established <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, which has proven useful in uncovering the neurodegenerative and mitochondrial phenotypes in <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> mutants and genetic dissection of this pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>Drosophila parkin</italic> mutants recapitulate several features of the disease phenotype including characteristic locomotor deficits in flight and climbing ability as well as dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The profound mitochondrial disruption evident in these mutants also leads to flight muscle degeneration and male sterility. Initial studies of transgenic lines bearing human Fbxo7 showed that ectopic expression of Fbxo7 caused no apparent phenotypes in a wild type background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3a-d</xref>). Notably, expression of Fbxo7 significantly rescued the <italic>parkin</italic> phenotypes, including locomotor defects, dopaminergic neuron loss, muscle degeneration, and mitochondrial disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-f</xref>). In contrast, the expression of neither the pathogenic mutants T22M, R378G and R498X, nor mutants lacking a functional MTS (mt-MTS or isoform 2) provided any rescue of flight or climbing ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). These results show that human Fbxo7 isoform 1 can functionally substitute for loss of Parkin <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this rescue is abolished by pathogenic mutations, suggesting they share a common role in mitochondrial biology.</p>
        <p id="P12">We next sought to determine whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> encodes an Fbxo7 homologue that may be required for Parkin function. Previous studies have suggested <italic>Drosophila nutcracker</italic> (<italic>ntc</italic>) is an Fbxo7 orthologue with some conserved functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Although the F-box domain of ntc shares 59% identity and 65% similarity with Fbxo7, their overall sequence homology is low (28% identity, 45% similarity). In addition, ntc entirely lacks the proline rich region of Fbxo7, with which some substrates interact. If ntc functions with Parkin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, similar loss-of-function phenotypes would be expected. While <italic>ntc</italic> mutant males are sterile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> they exhibit no overt disruption of the musculature or mitochondria, no loss of flight ability, or dopaminergic neurodegeneration (data not shown), hence do not phenocopy parkin mutants. We also found that expression of Fbxo7 was unable to rescue male sterility in these mutants (data not shown), indicating that ntc is not likely a functional homologue of Fbxo7.</p>

        <title>Fbxo7 functionally interacts with PINK1</title>
        <p id="P13">Parkin functions in a common pathway with PINK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, with Parkin translocation to the mitochondria following CCCP preceded by the accumulation of full-length PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). To investigate whether Fbxo7 also interacts with PINK1, U2OS cells were transfected with FLAG-Fbxo7 and PINK1-Myc and complexes were immunoprecipitated with FLAG beads. Both full-length and cleaved forms of PINK1 were found to co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG-Fbxo7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and this was also true for the reciprocal immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). This interaction was unaffected by Fbxo7 pathogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>). Immunoprecipitations using N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of Fbxo7 showed this interaction also mapped to the N-terminus of Fbxo7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). However, unlike Parkin, PINK1 retained partial binding to mutant Fbxo7 lacking the Ubl domain (89-522); a further truncation to amino acid 129 ablated Fbxo7 interaction with PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay using GST-Fbxo7 (1-398) or GST-Fbxo7 (129-398) with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated (IVT) PINK1-Myc verified that the PINK1 interaction required the first 129 amino acids and was direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In support of these data, we found that PINK1 retained partial binding to Fbxo7 isoform 2, which contains amino acids 92-522 of isoform 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4c</xref>). These data suggest that PINK1 binding is mediated by sequences within amino acids 92-129 of Fbxo7 and raise the possibility that the interactions of Fbxo7, Parkin and PINK1 may be mutually exclusive or form ternary complexes. Fbxo7 was found to interact with both full-length PINK1 and an N-terminal truncation (ÎN-PINK1) <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), indicating that the first 103 amino acids of PINK1 are dispensable for the interaction. <italic>In vitro</italic> pull downs of GST-Fbxo7 with either full-length or ÎN-PINK1, Parkin or a combination of the two revealed that neither Parkin nor PINK1 had any significant effect on the interaction of Fbxo7 with the other protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Performing the reciprocal pull down with GST-Parkin or GST-ÎN-PINK1 confirmed these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). These data suggest that Fbxo7, Parkin, and PINK1 interact in a non-competitive, non-synergistic manner.</p>
        <p id="P14">Since Fbxo7 and PINK1 interact, we sought to determine whether Fbxo7 was also required for PINK1 stabilisation at the mitochondria after CCCP treatment. Consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, PINK1-HA accumulates on mitochondria following CCCP treatment. However, cells co-transfected with PINK1-HA and Fbxo7 siRNA showed no significant effect on PINK1 accumulation compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. S5a and S5b</xref>), indicating that Fbxo7 is not required for PINK1 stabilisation. This was confirmed by immunoblot of both endogenous and overexpressed PINK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5c,d</xref>). To determine whether Fbxo7 instead functions downstream of PINK1 in the pathway, CCCP-induced relocation of endogenous Fbxo7 to the mitochondria was assessed by immunoblotting in cells transfected with scrambled or PINK1 siRNA, or in cells overexpressing PINK1-HA. Fbxo7 relocation was substantially reduced in cells transfected with PINK1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and increased in cells overexpressing PINK1-HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5e</xref>), indicating that PINK1 is required for its recruitment to the mitochondria.</p>
        <p id="P15">To further investigate the functional relationship between Fbxo7 and PINK1 <italic>in vivo</italic> we again turned to <italic>Drosophila</italic> models in which <italic>PINK1</italic> mutants phenocopy <italic>parkin</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Fbxo7 expression was not able to rescue the <italic>PINK1</italic> locomotor deficits, neuron loss, muscle degeneration or mitochondrial disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S6a,b</xref>), suggesting that Fbxo7 and PINK1 may lie in alternate pathways. However, using a <italic>PINK1</italic>-overexpression phenotypic assay previously used to study <italic>PINK1</italic> genetic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we found that <italic>Fbxo7</italic> does genetically interact with <italic>PINK1</italic>. While expression of <italic>Fbxo7</italic> alone causes no phenotype, when co-expressed with <italic>PINK1</italic> it substantially enhances the <italic>PINK1</italic> overexpression ârough eyeâ phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S6c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P16">These genetic interaction studies are consistent with Fbxo7 having a positive influence on the PINK1/Parkin pathway, but the inability of Fbxo7 to rescue <italic>PINK1</italic> mutants suggests that its function may be dependent on PINK1 activity. To test this hypothesis directly, we assessed the ability of Fbxo7 expression to suppress phenotypes in <italic>PINK1:parkin</italic> double mutants. In contrast to the <italic>parkin</italic> mutants Fbxo7 was unable to rescue climbing and flight defects in the <italic>PINK1:parkin</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Thus, even though overexpression of human Fbxo7 can suppress <italic>parkin</italic> mutants, Fbxo7 requires PINK1 activity for its protective function consistent with the data showing Fbxo7 requires PINK1 for its translocation to the mitochondria.</p>

        <title>Fbxo7 participates in Mfn ubiquitination</title>
        <p id="P17">Recent studies have demonstrated that amongst a number of OMM proteins, Mfns are substrates for Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and degradation in response to CCCP treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We therefore used ubiquitination of Mfn1 as an additional readout for activation of the Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. Treatment with CCCP results in the appearance of ubiquitinated forms of Mfns, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Immunoblotting of mitochondrial fractions revealed that ubiquitination of Mfn1 was significantly reduced in stable Fbxo7 knockdown SH-SY5Y cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7a</xref>; for level of knockdown see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7b</xref>). Mfn1 ubiquitination was rescued by overexpression of WT Fbxo7 in the knockdown cells, confirming that this effect is caused by loss of Fbxo7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7c</xref>). Moreover, expression of WT Fbxo7 rescued the loss of Mfn1 ubiquitination caused by knockdown of Parkin, but not PINK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7d</xref>). Mfn1 ubiquitination was additionally found to be reduced in patient fibroblasts homozygous for the R378G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), indicating that this mutation interferes with Fbxo7âs ability to facilitate Parkin-mediated Mfn1 ubiquitination. Basal Mfn protein levels frequently appeared reduced in Fbxo7 deficient cells compared to controls. This occurred despite a clear reduction in CCCP-induced ubiquitination which has previously been shown to be Parkin-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, pointing to a possible additional effect of Fbxo7 on Mfn1 levels. Further experiments would be necessary in order to fully investigate this phenotype.</p>
        <p id="P18">In <italic>Drosophila</italic> loss of parkin or PINK1 leads to an accumulation of unmodified Mfn and mitochondrial hyperfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In agreement with the previous results, expression of Fbxo7 significantly restored the steady state level of Mfn in <italic>parkin</italic> mutants but was unable to do so in <italic>PINK1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Similar results were observed with RNAi knockdown of <italic>parkin</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic> in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S7e</xref>). Consistent with these findings Fbxo7 could prevent mitochondrial hyperfusion in <italic>parkin</italic> but not <italic>PINK1</italic> knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). Altogether these results provide further substantial support <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> that, similar to Parkin, Fbxo7 expression can regulate Mfn levels but is unable to do this in the absence of PINK1.</p>

        <title>Fbxo7 plays a role in CCCP-induced mitophagy</title>
        <p id="P19">Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria has been previously shown to result in autophagic clearance of depolarised mitochondria following prolonged treatment with CCCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Since Fbxo7 appears to participate in Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria, we further investigated its effect on subsequent mitophagy. During induction of autophagy LC3-I is lipidated to its mature form LC3-II, which localises to the autophagosome as it engulfs the substrate for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Immunoblotting revealed that in control cells CCCP treatment results in a progressive increase in LC3-II at 1 and 5 h in mitochondrial but not cytosolic fractions, whereas in stable Fbxo7 knockdown SH-SY5Y cells formation of LC3-II at the mitochondria is substantially delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Similarly, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was substantially lower in the mitochondrial fraction of patient fibroblasts compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). LC3-II may be recruited to the mitochondria by the adaptor protein p62, which is also recruited to depolarised mitochondria in a Parkin-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Analysis of p62 localisation by both immunofluorescence and immunoblotting revealed that this accumulation was substantially reduced in cells transfected with Fbxo7 siRNA compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>), suggesting that Fbxo7 participates in p62-dependent mitophagy.</p>
        <p id="P20">A decrease in levels of LC3-II may be explained by a decrease in autophagy or an increase in autophagic turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We attempted to monitor autophagic flux by analysing p62 recruitment to mitochondria after treatment with CCCP and/or bafilomycin. However, we were unable to detect any significant increase in p62 recruitment when FLAG-Parkin SH-SY5Y cells were treated with CCCP and bafilomycin compared to those treated with CCCP alone (data not shown), indicating that this approach may not be appropriate to monitor mitophagy in this model. To specifically investigate mitochondrial clearance, we therefore employed an immunofluorescent assay as has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Consistent with these reports, a substantial proportion of SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing FLAG-Parkin were found to have no remaining mitochondria following 24 h CCCP treatment, while untransfected cells retained their mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). This mitochondrial disappearance could be inhibited by bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>), which inhibits the lysosomal degradation of proteins, resulting in an accumulation of undegraded LC3-II in the mitochondrial fraction of SH-SY5Y cells following CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S8c</xref>). This inhibition thus confirms that the mitochondrial disappearance observed is due to mitophagy in these cells. The percentage of cells with no remaining mitochondria following CCCP treatment was significantly lower in FLAG-Parkin overexpressing cells transfected with Fbxo7 siRNA compared to those transfected with scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). These data were further confirmed in live cells by measuring mitochondrial mass after 24 h CCCP treatment, using DsRed-Mito as an independent mitochondrial marker and calcein to measure cytosolic volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>; for representative images, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S8d</xref>). These data indicating Fbxo7 can promote mitophagy, coupled with the ability of Fbxo7 to substitute for Parkin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, prompted us to test whether Fbxo7 could promote mitophagy in the absence of Parkin in mammalian cells. However, overexpression of Fbxo7 in HeLa cells, which do not express Parkin, failed to induced mitophagy following 24 h CCCP (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that in mammalian cells Fbxo7 acts to promote mitophagy in a Parkin-dependent manner but is insufficient to induce mitophagy in the absence of Parkin.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P21">In the last few years, several studies have identified a molecular pathway for the clearance of damaged mitochondria involving the Parkinsonâs disease-associated proteins PINK1 and Parkin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Our data now show that a third protein associated with Parkinsonâs disease, Fbxo7, also plays a role in this pathway. We find that upon CCCP treatment, cytosolic Fbxo7 relocalises to the mitochondria. Furthermore, Fbxo7 interacts physically and genetically with Parkin and the loss of Fbxo7 expression results in a significant inhibition of Parkin recruitment to depolarised mitochondria and subsequent mitophagy.</p>
      <p id="P22">Importantly, our data show that three Parkinsonâs disease-causing mutations in Fbxo7 (T22M, R378G and R498X) interfere with this function in both flies and mammalian cells. The T22M mutation was found to prevent the interaction of Fbxo7 with Parkin, and was consequently unable to rescue Parkin translocation to the mitochondria. The R378G mutation located close to the F-box domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) impairs ubiquitination of Mfn1 but not the ability of Fbxo7 to recruit Parkin to damaged mitochondria, indicating that Fbxo7âs role in the PINK1-Parkin mitophagy pathway is not limited to the recruitment of Parkin but that it also participates in substrate ubiquitination. The R378G mutation was previously shown to impair Fbxo7âs interaction with Skp1 and through it, the SCF complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that Fbxo7 may facilitate Parkin-dependent ubiquitination in an SCF-dependent manner. Finally, the R498X truncation is unable to recruit Parkin to the mitochondria, indicating an involvement of the C-terminal proline rich region of the protein in this step. This domain is involved in forming protein-protein interactions but our data show that it does not participate in the interaction with Parkin, suggesting that another protein(s) interacting with this domain of Fbxo7 is important for recruitment of Parkin to the mitochondria.</p>
      <p id="P23">The precise mechanism by which Parkin, a cytosolic protein, translocates to depolarised mitochondria remains poorly defined despite a clear dependence on the mitochondrial localisation of PINK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We have identified an MTS in the N-terminus of Fbxo7 and find that this is essential for its recruitment of Parkin to the mitochondria, raising the possibility that Fbxo7 may participate in the physical translocation of Parkin to mitochondria. In support of this hypothesis, when both proteins were overexpressed in cells the interaction was found to occur in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions.</p>
      <p id="P24">It is worth noting <italic>Drosophila parkin</italic> mutants completely lack Parkin protein, ruling out the possibility that the observed rescue by human Fbxo7 could arise from an increased recruitment of residual parkin to the mitochondria and suggesting that Fbxo7 may cooperate with another E3 ubiquitin ligase which remains to be identified. The finding that none of the three pathogenic mutants were able to rescue loss of <italic>parkin</italic> mutants <italic>in vivo</italic> further supports the idea that this activity to maintain mitochondria homeostasis is defective in <italic>PARK15</italic> patients.</p>
      <p id="P25">We find that Fbxo7 functions downstream of PINK1 in mammalian cells since Fbxo7 relocation was PINK1 dependent, but that Fbxo7 overexpression fails to rescue the effects of PINK1 silencing in mammalian cells or in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This failure to rescue loss of PINK1 may be because Fbxo7âs role in the pathway absolutely requires PINK1 activity, for example if phosphorylation of either Fbxo7 itself or its substrate(s) by PINK1 is necessary for Fbxo7 function at the mitochondria. PINK1 has been reported to phosphorylate Parkin but not Fbxo7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that the latter hypothesis may be more likely.</p>
      <p id="P26">In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that Fbxo7 participates in Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria, Mfn1 ubiquitination and mitophagy. This finding places further emphasis on the importance of mitochondrial turnover in neuroprotection and as a contributing factor in Parkinsonâs disease.</p>

Samples were blocked for 30 min in 10% FCS/PBS solution before addition of the primary antibody for 2 h in blocking solution. Antibodies used were: mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma F3165, 1:2000); rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma F7425, 1:5000); rat anti-HA (Roche 11867423001, 1:500); rabbit anti-HtrA2 (Cell Signaling 2176, 1:1000); mouse anti-complex VÎ² subunit (Abcam ab14730, 1:500) and mouse anti-p62 (BD Transduction Labs 610833, 1:500).

        <p id="P34">To quantify accumulation of Parkin/PINK1 at the mitochondria or mitochondrial clearance by mitophagy, cells were scored visually by an observer who was blinded to the identity of each coverslip. In order to score positively for mitochondrial accumulation, a cell must exhibit a clear mitochondria distribution in the FLAG/HA stain with negligible fluorescence in the cytosol (see representative images, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). In order to score positively for mitochondrial clearance a cell must contain no staining for the integral mitochondrial protein CxVÎ² (see representative images, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). In all cases a minimum of 100-150 cells were scored per coverslip and each experiment was performed at least three times. Where indicated in the text, these results were confirmed by repeating the experiment in cells stably overexpressing FLAG-Parkin or PINK1-HA, then quantifying the colocalisation of FLAG or HA with mitochondrial markers by Pearsonâs correlation co-efficient (Rr) on a cell-by-cell basis using the software Colocalizer Pro (CoLocalization Research Software,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.colocalizer.com">www.colocalizer.com</ext-link>).
