        <p id="P1">Infantile hemangiomas are localized and rapidly growing regions of disorganized angiogenesis. We demonstrate that expression of VEGFR1 in hemangioma endothelial cells (hemEC) and tissue is only 10â20% of that in controls. Low VEGFR1 levels result in VEGF-dependent activation of VEGFR2 and downstream pathways.

Further studies indicate that the mutations result in increased interaction between VEGFR2, TEM8 and Î²1 integrin and inhibition of integrin activity. Normalization of the constitutive VEGFR2-signaling in hemEC with soluble VEGFR1 and antibodies that block VEGF or stimulate Î²1 integrin suggests that local administration of these or similar agents may be effective in hemangioma treatment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P3">Infantile hemangiomas, localized lesions of disorganized angiogenesis, are the most common tumors of infancy (10% of Caucasian infants). They typically appear around the second week of life, proliferate over 6â10 months and involute over 7â10 years<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Endothelial cells within the lesions (hemEC) exhibit X-chromosome inactivation patterns of clonality, upregulated expression of some markers and downregulation of others<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. This expression pattern is stably maintained in cultured hemEC, and it differs from that of other endothelial cells, including human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). It has been proposed that hemEC are either differentiated toward the placental microvascular phenotype or originate from placental endothelial cells<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Additionally, epidemiological studies and rare familial cases suggest a genetic influence<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P4">We report here that cultured hemEC from nine unrelated individuals with hemangioma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> online) share a phenotype of constitutively active vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling. This is associated with low expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), a receptor that is known to bind VEGF with high affinity, thereby preventing it from activating VEGFR2 and its downstream targets<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P5">In a candidate gene screen of these individuals for potential disease associated mutations, we find germline heterozygosity for missense mutations in the gene encoding the integrin-like receptor TEM8<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in one individual and in <italic>VEGFR2</italic> in two others. Investigation of the impact of these mutations elucidates a pathway controlling <italic>VEGFR1</italic> transcription that involves TEM8, VEGFR2, Î²1 integrin and NFAT. Although the mutations in TEM8 or VEGFR2 inhibit the activity of this pathway, reduced NFAT activity and VEGFR1 expression are found in all nine hemEC.</p>

        <title>VEGFR2-dependent signal transduction is upregulated in hemEC</title>
        <p id="P6">In initial experiments, we compared phosphorylation levels of VEGFR2 between HDMEC and hemEC primary cultures. Primary cells from nine individuals with hemangioma were carefully characterized and data on eight of these (all the females) were reported in a previous publication demonstrating clonality<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> online). Tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at residue Tyr1175 was very low in lysates of HDMEC cultured without exogenous VEGF, but high in lysates from hemEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Addition of VEGF-specific neutralizing antibodies to the cultures reduced levels of phospho-VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Using phospho-peptide arrays to assess kinase activities, hemEC lysates showed increased activity of kinases, reflected by increased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 peptides or of peptides representing multiple downstream targets. Phosphorylation patterns in hemEC were on average very similar to those of HDMEC treated with VEGF, consistent with activation of VEGFR2 signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Phosphorylation of peptides representing EGF and FGF receptors was at background levels for all lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> online).</p>
        <p id="P7">Quantitative measurement of VEGFR2 protein by ELISA showed that it was slightly reduced in hemEC compared to HDMEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> online). Quantitative multiplex assays confirmed high phosphorylation levels of VEGFR2 targets, ERK and Akt, in hemEC lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and demonstrated increased protein levels of several downstream targets of VEGFR2 signaling. For example, levels of endogenous VEGF and GLUT-1 were as high in unstimulated hemEC as in VEGF-stimulated HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Migratory and proliferative activities in hemEC were almost identical to activities of VEGF-stimulated HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Treatment with the soluble form of VEGFR1 (sR1) or <italic>VEGFR2</italic> silencing RNA (siRNA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> online) strongly inhibited these activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The results suggest that increased VEGFR2 phosphorylation depends on VEGF binding at the cell surface.</p>

        <title>Decreased VEGFR1 expression caused by reduced NFAT activation in hemEC</title>
        <p id="P8">Since addition of VEGF-specific antibody or sR1 protein to hemEC cultures reduced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and downstream targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>), we used ELISA to determine levels of the VEGF decoy receptor VEGFR1 in several types of control cells and in hemEC from all nine subjects with hemangioma. The results showed that VEGFR1 protein levels in hemEC were only 10â20% of those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Isoform-specific RT-PCR<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> showed that transcripts encoding both membrane-bound VEGFR1 (mR1) and sR1 were reduced in hemEC compared to HDMEC (not shown). Stable overexpression of mR1 in hemEC reduced phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ERK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant, mut mR1<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, had the same effect as mR1. Overexpression of a mutant VEGFR1 lacking the extracellular domain had no effect (not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the reduced expression of VEGFR1, combined with increased levels of endogenous VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), maintains increased VEGFR2 activation and signaling in hemEC.</p>
        <p id="P9">Low VEGFR1 transcript and protein levels in all the hemECs led us to sequence 1 kb of the <italic>VEGFR1</italic> promoter in hemEC DNA from all nine subjects. Finding no sequence changes, we asked how <italic>VEGFR1</italic> is transcriptionally regulated in endothelial cells. We identified a potential NFAT binding site (GGACCCT) at â83 to â89, next to an AP-1 binding site, in a region of the <italic>VEGFR1</italic> promoter reported to contain a transcriptional activator site<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Replacing GGA (at â87 to â89) with TCA in a luciferase-containing reporter essentially eliminated luciferase activity in HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, replacing GGA with TCA at a site (â65 to â67) downstream of the AP-1 binding site, had no effect on activation of the reporter (not shown). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the wild-type GGA sequence at â87 to â89 had substantial binding activity for NFATc1 (not shown) and NFATc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, an oligonucleotide containing TCA had no NFAT binding activity. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of NFATc1 stimulated <italic>VEGFR1</italic> transcription in both HDMEC and hemEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> online).</p>
        <p id="P10">NFAT is activated by the Ca<sup>++</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and is a target of VEGFR2 signaling in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, not only were <italic>VEGFR1</italic> transcripts reduced in hemEC, but transcript levels of other known NFAT-regulated genes, <italic>DSCR1 (MCIP1), MCP-1</italic> and <italic>COX-2</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, were also significantly lower in hemEC than in HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), indicating low basal NFAT activity in hemEC. No differences were found between transcript levels for <italic>NFATc1</italic> or <italic>NFATc2</italic> in HDMEC and hemEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, real-time PCR showed <italic>COX-2/VEGFR2</italic> and <italic>VEGFR1/VEGFR2</italic> transcript ratios to be considerably lower in proliferating hemangioma tissue and hemEC than in HDMEC and other control endothelial cells, control tissues and involuting hemangioma tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Incubation of HDMEC with a cell-permeable inhibitor of NFAT-calcineurin interaction decreased <italic>VEGFR1</italic> transcript levels and increased VEGFR2 and ERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), modeling the fact that NFAT inactivation is indeed associated with the hemangioma phenotype described above through VEGFR1 down-regulation. A low level of NFAT activation in hemEC was supported by finding that antibody staining for NFATc2 showed significantly less nuclear staining in hemEC than in HDMEC after stimulation with VEGF or ionomycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref> online). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that ionomycin-stimulated release of Ca<sup>++</sup> from intracellular stores was reduced in hemEC compared to HDMEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref> online).</p>

      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Reduced Î²1 integrin activity in hemEC</title>
        <p id="P11">To address the question of what may cause the suppression of the NFAT-VEGFR1 pathway in hemEC, we examined the activation state of their integrin receptors. A link between integrins and Ca<sup>++</sup> signaling is well established. For example, treatment with integrin-specific stimulatory antibody increases Ca<sup>++</sup> levels in endothelial cells<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, and integrin-mediated cell adhesion can trigger calcium influx<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P12">A connection between integrin and NFAT is supported by the following results: Treatment of HDMEC or hemEC with Î²1 integrin-specific stimulatory antibody increased association of NFATc2 with the <italic>VEGFR1</italic> promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and induced an increase in the transcript levels of <italic>VEGFR1</italic> and <italic>COX-2</italic> in both HDMEC and hemEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In hemEC, the antibody-stimulated increase in VEGFR1 expression reduced VEGFR2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> online). Treatment of HDMEC with siRNA for <italic>NFATc2</italic> blocked the stimulatory effect on <italic>VEGFR1</italic> expression (see below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P13">Therefore, we compared integrin functions in HDMEC and hemEC. Staining of cell cultures with antibody to total Î²1 integrin showed no difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). However, immunostaining with an antibody (HUTS-21) that recognizes only active Î²1 integrin<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, showed significantly decreased reactivity at the cell surface of hemEC compared with HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Consistent with decreased Î²1 integrin activity on the surface of hemEC we found that adhesion of hemEC to type I collagen or fibronectin was significantly lower than that of HDMEC, but no differences were seen on vitronectin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> online).</p>
        <p id="P14">Moreover, when suspended cells were incubated without fibronectin, the difference in expression levels of NFAT-regulated genes (<italic>VEGFR1</italic> and <italic>COX-2</italic>) were minimal; in the presence of fibronectin the levels were increased in HDMEC, but not in hemEC (not shown). Finally, phosphorylation of Tyr397 in focal adhesion kinase, an indicator of integrin activation<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, was significantly reduced in all the nine hemECs compared to HDMEC and HUVEC (not shown).</p>

        <title>TEM8 and VEGFR2 mutations and their effect on VEGFR1 expression</title>
        <p id="P15">In light of the evidence<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> for a genetic component to hemangioma formation, we asked whether suppressed NFAT activation and low VEGFR1 expression in hemEC could result from germline or somatic mutations. Using a targeted candidate gene approach, we sequenced the complete coding sequences of 24 selected genes using DNA from the nine hemEC cultures and confirmed specific results with DNA from blood of the relevant subjects. In addition to neutral and common polymorphisms, we found heterozygosity for nucleotide changes resulting in potential disease-associated amino acid substitutions in three of the nine individuals with hemangioma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 3</xref> online).</p>
        <p id="P16">A germline G-to-A transition replaces alanine with threonine in the transmembrane domain of the integrin-like molecule TEM8 in hemEC4 (referred to as hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> below) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Using allele-specific PCR, we screened for the A allele in blood genomic DNA samples collected from 110 individuals with a history of hemangioma and 295 âcontrolsâ (all Caucasian; see below). No other individual carrying the A allele was found.</p>

Stable retroviral overexpression of HA-tagged wild-type TEM8 in HDMEC stimulated VEGFR1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) without changing the low levels of phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ERK. Overexpression of HA-tagged mutant TEM8 or variant 3 (lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains) reduced VEGFR1 expression and increased phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ERK levels. Overexpression of wild-type TEM8 in hemEC2 and 21A as well as hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> increased VEGFR1 expression and reduced phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ERK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">A T-to-C germline transition replaces cysteine by arginine at position 482 in the Ig-like domain V of the VEGFR2 extracellular region in hemEC2 and 17B (referred to as hemEC2<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> and hemEC17B<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> below) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Allele-specific PCR identified heterozygosity for the same change in 8 blood genomic DNA samples collected from an additional 105 individuals with a history of hemangioma (10 total out of 114 individuals) and in 12 DNA samples from 295 âcontrolsâ (all Caucasian). The controls include individuals with hemangioma at the population frequency (10%) (see <bold>Methods</bold>). On that basis, the difference in the frequency of the C482R change among individuals with a history of hemangioma and controls is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02, Fisher's exact two-tailed test). No difference in receptor expression and VEGF-induced phosphorylation was apparent between wild-type and C482R mutant receptor transiently expressed in 293-EBNA cells (see below), probably because the mutation is located outside the VEGF-binding region<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P19">Retroviral overexpression of His-tagged wild-type VEGFR2 in HDMEC resulted in increased VEGFR1 expression, but no significant changes in phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ERK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Unlike mutant TEM8, overexpression of His-tagged mutant (C482R) VEGFR2 in HDMEC reduced VEGFR1 expression only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type VEGFR2 in hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> and 21A as well as hemEC2<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> and hemEC17B<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> increased VEGFR1 expression and reduced levels of phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). To address the question of whether this stimulatory effect requires signaling through the VEGFR2 kinase domain, we transfected various VEGFR2 expression constructs into hemEC. Truncating the cytoplasmic domain or replacing three of the tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain with phenylalanines did not compromise the ability of VEGFR2 to stimulate VEGFR1 expression. Mutating the Cys482 codon to a serine codon did not affect the ability of VEGFR2 to stimulate VEGFR1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Finally, a Q472H substitution, reported as a potential hemangioma mutation in VEGFR2<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, did not affect stimulation of VEGFR1 expression. We conclude, therefore, that the effect seen with the C482R mutation on VEGFR1 expression is specific to that particular amino acid substitution. Taken together, the results further indicate that sequences within the extracellular Ig-like domain V of VEGFR2 are critical for the ability of VEGFR2 to stimulate VEGFR1 expression.</p>

        <title>Abnormal interaction between VEGFR2, TEM8 and Î²1 integrin</title>
        <p id="P20">The levels of Î²1 integrin and TEM8 were almost the same in lysates of hemEC and control cells. However, immune complexes from hemEC extracts generated with antibody to VEGFR2 contained substantially higher amounts of Î²1 integrin and TEM8 than complexes from HDMEC or HUVEC extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Similar results were obtained in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays with antibody to TEM8 (not shown).</p>
        <p id="P21">To determine whether the (C482R) VEGFR2 and (A326T) TEM8 mutations affect the recruitment of the proteins into immune complexes with Î²1 integrin, we expressed mutant and wild-type receptors in 293-EBNA cells, since these cells express Î²1 integrin but neither VEGFR2 nor TEM8<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates generated with antibody to VEGFR2 showed that the mutations enhanced recruitment of the proteins into a complex with Î²1 integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), suggesting that they increase the affinity of VEGFR2 and TEM8 for each other, Î²1 integrin or another common partner within the complex. Similar results were obtained in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays with antibody to TEM8 (not shown).</p>
        <p id="P22">Treatment of HDMEC with siRNA for <italic>TEM8</italic>, <italic>VEGFR2</italic> or <italic>NFATc2</italic> blocked the stimulatory effect on <italic>VEGFR1</italic> expression by Î²1 integrin-specific stimulatory antibody or VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The data indicate that TEM8, VEGFR2 and Î²1 integrin functionally interact to control <italic>VEGFR1</italic> expression in an NFAT-dependent manner in endothelial cells. This interaction, and consequently regulation of VEGFR1 expression, is compromised in hemEC.</p>
        <p id="P23">Next, we examined the effects of expressing A326T mutant TEM8 or C482R mutant VEGFR2 on activation of NFAT and Î²1 integrin, proliferation and migration in HDMEC. Expression of mutant TEM8 significantly reduced association of NFATc2 with the VEGFR1 promoter; expression of wild-type TEM8 or wild-type VEGFR2 in hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> increased the association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Overexpression of mutant TEM8 in HDMEC significantly reduced the amount of active Î²1 integrin as assessed by staining with HUTS-21 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of mutant VEGFR2 reduced the amount of active Î²1 integrin only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type VEGFR2 or TEM8 in hemEC increased HUTS-21 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Finally, stably overexpressing mutant TEM8 in HDMEC stimulated BrdU incorporation and migration to levels approaching those of hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). These results correlate well with changes in VEGFR1 levels in HDMEC or hemEC transfected with wild-type or mutant TEM8 or mutant VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P24">We demonstrate that <italic>VEGFR1</italic> is an NFAT target gene in endothelial cells and that all nine hemEC studied here show downregulation of NFAT targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). As a consequence of reduced VEGFR1 decoy function, VEGFR2 and its downstream targets are activated/phosphorylated in a VEGF-dependent manner and the protein levels of downstream targets, such as VEGF and GLUT-1, are increased. Proliferation and migration of hemEC are also upregulated. In addition, reduced NFAT activation in hem EC is associated with low activity of Î²1 integrin. Finally, we find increased interaction between Î²1 integrin, the integrin-like receptor TEM8 and VEGFR2 in all nine hemEC. The only differences we have found between the nine hemEC are the missense changes in TEM8 and VEGFR2 in three of the nine hemEC. Both mutations have a dramatic effect on the amount of TEM8 and Î²1 integrin in immune complexes with VEGFR2 when the proteins are expressed in 293 cells, similar to what is seen with lysates from all hemECs. On this basis we suggest that the hemEC phenotype of low âsetpointâ of integrin-NFAT activation is a consequence of the formation of an abnormal complex between VEGFR2, TEM8 and Î²1 integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P25">In hemEC, increased complex formation is associated with reduced level of active Î²1 integrin at the cell surface, suggesting that Î²1 integrin (and possibly other integrins) are in the closed, low-affinity conformation or somehow blocked in hemEC. Thus, the phenotype of repressed integrin-NFAT activation and VEGFR1 expression in hemEC2<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup>, hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> and hemEC17B<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> may be caused by inhibition of integrin activation within the TEM8/VEGFR2-containing complex. Determining the detailed mechanistic steps in the integrin-NFAT pathway will require further studies. However, based on what is currently known about NFAT activation mechanisms such studies may address integrin control of processes related to dephosphorylation of inactive NFAT in the cytoplasm and the control of nuclear import of the transcription factor.</p>
      <p id="P26">Although all hemEC share a common phenotype, we have not found mutations among the candidate genes sequenced so far in the other six hemEC (e.g. 21A). However, overexpression of wild-type VEGFR2 or TEM8 normalizes the phenotype even in EC21A. This suggests that hemangioma formation in the six patients for which we have not yet found mutations may be associated with mutations in genes encoding other pathway components, upstream of NFAT, perhaps other cell surface or cytoplasmic proteins that interact with integrins, TEM8 or VEGFR2. Thus, identifying other components of the complex may provide good candidates for future mutation screens.</p>
      <p id="P27">In the mechanistic model proposed here for hemangioma endothelial dysfunction, both VEGFR2 and TEM8 mutations have dominant inhibitory effects on integrin-NFAT activation. However, the two mutations differ in their ability to induce the hemEC phenotype when the mutant proteins are stably expressed in control HDMEC. Overexpression of mutant TEM8 in HDMEC reduces active Î²1 integrin on the cell surface, decreases the association between NFAT and the VEGFR1 promoter, and decreases VEGFR1 expression. The similarity between the consequences of overexpressing mutant TEM8 (A326T) and variant 3 (lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) in HDMEC suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of TEM8 is required for its ability to positively control integrin-NFAT activation and VEGFR1 expression, and that many types of mutations, even in introns, in <italic>TEM8</italic> could have similar effects. Therefore, sequencing of the entire <italic>TEM8</italic> gene (including introns) in additional hemangioma DNA samples may be illuminating.</p>
      <p id="P28">Overexpression of the C482R mutant VEGFR2 in HDMEC decreases VEGFR1 expression and staining with the HUTS-21 antibody only slightly. However, overexpression of wild-type VEGFR2 in hemEC normalizes the amount of active integrin detected with the HUTS-21 antibody, increases the association between NFATc2 and the <italic>VEGFR1</italic> promoter, and increases VEGFR1 expression. This indicates that there is a critical difference between wild-type and C482R mutant VEGFR2 proteins in their ability to stimulate VEGFR1 expression. Further work will be needed to determine whether these different effects of the TEM8 and VEGFR2 mutations are caused by differences in the relative amounts of TEM8 and VEGFR2 proteins in HDMEC or reflect differences in the âstrengthâ of the mutations. It is also possible that polymorphisms in other genes may contribute to the pathogenetic process in hemEC from individuals who carry the relatively common C482R missense change in the extracellular domain of VEGFR2.</p>
      <p id="P29">Considering all these data together, we conclude that the TEM8 and VEGFR2 amino acid sequence changes represent risk factor mutations for infantile hemangioma. Both receptors are co-expressed with the endothelial marker CD31 in hemangioma tissue (not shown) and both sequence changes affect highly conserved amino acid residues. These heterozygous germline missense changes in <italic>VEGFR2</italic> and <italic>TEM8</italic> do not appear to cause significant systemic vascular abnormality in the individuals who carry them. In that sense, they are similar to germline mutations in other genes that cause localized vascular lesions. Venous or glomuvenous malformations are caused by a combination of germline and somatic mutations in <italic>TIE2</italic> or <italic>glomulin</italic>, respectively<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Since all the nine different hemEC we have analyzed in this study exhibit clonality<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, the germline mutations in hemEC2<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup>, hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup> and hemEC17B<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> must be associated with a secondary somatic event to trigger the expansion of endothelial cells within the lesions. To account for the difference in progression between hemangioma (which undergoes age-dependent involution) and venous or glomuvenous malformations (which do not) we speculate that this secondary lesion-triggering event in an individual carrying a germline risk mutation for hemangioma may be a physiological event (e.g. emboli of placental cells or perinatal hypoxia<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) rather than a somatic mutation.</p>
      <p id="P30">Several types of data support the view that the signaling phenotype of cultured hemEC is similar to that of endothelial cells within the tumors. First, <italic>VEGFR1/VEGFR2</italic> and <italic>COX-2/VEGFR2</italic> transcript ratios are as low in proliferating hemangioma as in cultured hemEC compared with control tissues and involuting hemangioma. Second, increased GLUT-1 and VEGF expression in hemEC is consistent with reports of increased GLUT-1 and VEGF in hemangioma tissue<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. Third, increased proliferation of hemEC <italic>in vitro</italic> matches increased proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Therefore, our data suggest that locally administered anti-VEGF therapy or agents targeting other components of the signaling pathway could be effective in treating rapidly growing hemangiomas.</p>

        <p>(<bold>f</bold>) Diagram summarizing pathways that are affected in hemangioma. In control endothelial cells, such as HDMEC (left), activation of NFAT and VEGFR1 (R1) expression is controlled by a functional interaction between integrin, the VEGFR2 extracellular domain and TEM8. This results in high levels of VEGFR1 (and COX-2, DSCR-1) and low levels of VEGF-dependent VEGFR2 signaling. In hemEC (right), repressed NFAT activation causes low expression of VEGFR1 (and COX-2, DSCR-1). This results in high level VEGF-mediated signaling through activation of VEGFR2-tyrosine kinase. Consequently, proliferation and migration are upregulated. The effects of mutations in TEM8 and VEGFR2 on VEGFR2 phosphorylation and downstream pathways are indirect and linked to downregulated activation of integrin-NFAT and low VEGFR1 expression. In hemEC4<sup>(TEM8)</sup>, mutant TEM8 has a dominant negative effect on the integrin-NFAT-VEGFR1 pathway. In patient 4 this provides a sufficient genetic explanation for the hemangioma signaling phenotype. The C482R mutation in hemEC2<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup>/17B<sup>(VEGFR2)</sup> represents a loss-of-function mutation in the context of VEGFR1 expression, but it does not appear to be sufficient to induce a hemEC-like phenotype when overexpressed in HDMEC. There are two possible reasons; one possibility is that viral expression of mutant VEGFR2 does not reach the required level (in hemEC2 and 17B the ratio between wild-type and mutant protein is 1:1, but this ratio may need to be even more in favor of the mutant in a cell that already expresses two wild-type alleles); a second possibility is that the VEGFR2 mutation is associated with an additional genetic or physiological change to generate the hemangioma cellular phenotype of repressed integrin-NFAT activity and low VEGFR1 expression. In hemEC from patients where we have not yet found mutations, we speculate that their increased Î²1 integrin/VEGFR2/TEM8 complex formation and reduced integrin/NFAT/VEGFR1 activity is associated with mutations in other, as yet unidentified, cell surface (stippled bars) or cytoplasmic (grey areas with arrows) components of the pathway.</p>
