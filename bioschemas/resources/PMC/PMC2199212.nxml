      <abstract>
        <p>We have previously shown that during early <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryogenesis PKC-3, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> atypical PKC (aPKC), plays critical roles in the establishment of cell polarity required for subsequent asymmetric cleavage by interacting with PAR-3 [Tabuse, Y., Y. Izumi, F. Piano, K.J. Kemphues, J. Miwa, and S. Ohno. 1998. <italic>Development (Camb.).</italic> 125:3607â3614]. Together with the fact that aPKC and a mammalian PAR-3 homologue, aPKC-specific interacting protein (ASIP), colocalize at the tight junctions of polarized epithelial cells (Izumi, Y., H. Hirose, Y. Tamai, S.-I. Hirai, Y. Nagashima, T. Fujimoto, Y. Tabuse, K.J. Kemphues, and S. Ohno. 1998. <italic>J. Cell Biol</italic>. 143:95â106), this suggests a ubiquitous role for aPKC in establishing cell polarity in multicellular organisms. Here, we show that the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of aPKC (aPKCkn) in MDCK II cells causes mislocalization of ASIP/PAR-3. Immunocytochemical analyses, as well as measurements of paracellular diffusion of ions or nonionic solutes, demonstrate that the biogenesis of the tight junction structure itself is severely affected in aPKCkn-expressing cells. Furthermore, these cells show increased interdomain diffusion of fluorescent lipid and disruption of the polarized distribution of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, suggesting that epithelial cell surface polarity is severely impaired in these cells. On the other hand, we also found that aPKC associates not only with ASIP/PAR-3, but also with a mammalian homologue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> PAR-6 (mPAR-6), and thereby mediates the formation of an aPKC-ASIP/PAR-3âPAR-6 ternary complex that localizes to the apical junctional region of MDCK cells. These results indicate that aPKC is involved in the evolutionarily conserved PAR protein complex, and plays critical roles in the development of the junctional structures and apico-basal polarization of mammalian epithelial cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein kinase C comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases with NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal autoregulatory regions containing unique cysteine-rich Zn-finger motifs (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="HugandSarre1993">Hug and Sarre 1993</xref>). Among them, atypical PKC (aPKC) represents a subgroup of this family comprising the Î»/Î¹ and Î¶ isoforms whose activities are affected by neither calcium nor diacylglycerol/phorbol esters. Several works including ours have shown that aPKCs are activated in vivo through a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1996">Akimoto et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="TokerandCantley1997">Toker and Cantley 1997</xref>), and are involved in several signal transduction pathways directing mitogen-stimulated cell growth (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Berraetal1993">Berra et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1996">Akimoto et al. 1996</xref>), insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kotanietal1998">Kotani et al. 1998</xref>), and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Diaz-Mecoetal1996">Diaz-Meco et al. 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, we identified a mammalian homologue of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> PAR-3, one of the six <italic>par</italic> gene products indispensable for the establishment of the cell polarity of the one-cell embryo (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kirbyetal1990">Kirby et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="GuoandKemphues1996">Guo and Kemphues 1996</xref>), as an aPKC-specific interacting protein (ASIP) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>). Then, we demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> aPKC, PKC3, also binds directly to PAR-3 and shows an asymmetric distribution to the anterior periphery in the one-cell embryo, as in the case of PAR-3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tabuseetal1998">Tabuse et al. 1998</xref>). The functional interaction between PKC-3 and PAR-3 was further demonstrated by showing that RNAi of PKC-3 results in the disruption of the asymmetric distribution of PAR-3, as well as defective phenotypes similar to those found in <italic>par-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tabuseetal1998">Tabuse et al. 1998</xref>). These results indicate an unexpected physiological function of aPKC: its requirement for establishing or maintaining the cell polarity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo. Very interestingly, our previous work also demonstrates that, in mammalian epithelial cells that exhibit well-developed apico-basal cell polarity, ASIP/PAR-3 concentrate at the tight junction (TJ) together with aPKC (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DrubinandNelson1996">Drubin and Nelson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>). Considering that TJ is one of the epithelia-specific junctional structures that is thought to be important for maintaining epithelial cell surface polarity, the result suggested a very intriguing possibility that the aPKC-PAR system plays a fundamental role in the establishment of cell polarity not only in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, but also in mammalian epithelial cells.</p>
      <p>In this work, we report the introduction of a dominant-negative mutant of aPKC (aPKCkn) into MDCK II cells using an adenovirus expression vector to directly examine the functional importance of aPKC in epithelial cell polarity. We present evidence that aPKCkn blocks the completion of tight junction formation after calcium switch or during normal cell growth. Impairment of cell surface polarity of aPKCkn-expressing cells is also demonstrated by increased interdomain diffusion of fluorescent membrane lipids and the disrupted asymmetric distribution of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. On the other hand, we also demonstrate that aPKC associates with not only ASIP/PAR-3, but also with a mammalian homologue of another par-gene product, PAR-6, which colocalizes and functions interdependently with PKC-3 and PAR-3 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wattsetal1996">Watts et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tabuseetal1998">Tabuse et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="HungandKemphues1999">Hung and Kemphues 1999</xref>). As expected, mammalian PAR-6 localizes to the apical junctional region together with aPKC and ASIP/PAR-3. These results suggest that aPKC is critically involved in the development of the epithelial junctional structures and controls the cell polarity of mammalian epithelial cells, probably by forming a ternary complex with ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6.</p>

        <title>cDNA Cloning of Human PAR-6</title>
        <p>A database search of human EST clones in GenBank identified a human EST clone (AA609625) encoding a peptide closely similar to a part of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PAR-6 protein. To obtain cDNA clone(s) covering the entire human PAR-6 protein coding region, we performed backscreening of a human kidney cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) using this EST clone as a probe, and identified five cDNA clones, each encoding human PAR-6. The longest clone, n32, carries a 1,269-pb insert containing a 1,041-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 346 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 37,388.32. Screening of a HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) with the same probe led to the identification of a different class of cDNA clones encoding a human PAR-6 isoform. The longest clone, 16-5-5, contains 1,162 bp and encodes a 276 amino acid residue, corresponding to a part of the protein (see Supplemental Fig. S1).</p>

        <p>Complementary DNAs encoding wild-type mouse aPKCÎ» and its kinase-deficient mutant (aPKCÎ»kn) were obtained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1994">Akimoto et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1996">Akimoto et al. 1996</xref>). Adenovirus vectors encoding these cDNAs were generated using a cosmid vector, pAxCAwt, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Miyakeetal1996">Miyake et al. 1996</xref>). The adenovirus vectors for the kinase-deficient mutant of mouse nPKCÎ´ (lysine 376 replaced by alanine; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hiraietal1994">Hirai et al. 1994</xref>) and mouse aPKCÎ¶ (lysine 281 replaced by tryptophan) were generous gifts from Dr.Oka (Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan); the vector for LacZ was obtained from the Riken Gene Bank (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Miyakeetal1996">Miyake et al. 1996</xref>). T7-tagged ASIP expression vectors were constructed on SRHis vector (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>); ASIPwt encodes full-length rat ASIP (amino acids 1â1337), while ASIP Î30 encodes an ASIP splicing isoform lacking amino acid residues 741â743 and 827â856. Flag-tagged human PAR-6 expression vectors were constructed on pME18S-flag vector; PAR-6wt encodes a full-length PAR-6 (amino acids 1â346), PAR-6 ÎaPKCBD lacks amino acids 1â125, corresponding to the aPKC-binding domain, and PAR-6 ÎCRIB/PDZ lacks amino acids 126â258, corresponding to CRIB and PDZ domain. aPKCÎ» expression vectors encoding wild type or a mutant lacking amino acids 1â47 (aPKCÎ» ÎN47) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1994">Akimoto et al. 1994</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cell Culture and Adenovirus Infection</title>
        <p>MDCK II cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin on 12-mm round coverslips or 12-mm diameter Transwellâ¢ filters (Corning Coaster Corp.) with a pore size of 0.4 Î¼m. For adenovirus infection, cells were seeded on 24-well plates (1.25 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) 1 d before infection, or on filter inserts (1.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) 2 d before infection. To enhance the efficiency of viral infection, cellâcell adhesion was disrupted by preincubating cells in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (LC) medium containing 5% FCS and 3 Î¼M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stuartetal1994">Stuart et al. 1994</xref>) for 2 h, and the cells were then incubated for 1 h with 150 Î¼l of the appropriate virus solution diluted to 3 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml in LC medium. When subjected to calcium switch (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="GumbinerandSimons1986">Gumbiner and Simons 1986</xref>), the cells were incubated in fresh LC medium for &gt;20 h, and then the medium was replaced with normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (NC) growth medium. At appropriate times after calcium switch, the cells were processed for immunofluorescent analysis. When skipping calcium switch, the cells were incubated in NC medium immediately after virus infection to allow the cells to complete TJ formation before the expression of ectopic proteins.</p>

        <title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
        <p>Cells grown on coverslips or filters were washed twice with PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.49 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5%(vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 10% calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. Only in the case of claudin-1 immunostaining, fixation and permeabilization procedures were performed simultaneously using PBS containing 0.3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100. Antibody incubations were performed at 37Â°C for 45 min in buffer containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 20, and 0.1% (wt/vol) BSA. The secondary antibodies used were: BODIPY, or Alexa488-conjugated goat antiârabbit IgG (Molecular Probes Inc.), Cy3-conjugated goat antiâmouse IgG, Cy3-conjugated goat antiârabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and FITC-conjugated goat antiâmouse IgG antibodies (EY Laboratories). To stain F-actin, rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes Inc.) was used in place of the secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and examined under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a confocal system (Î¼Radiance; Bio-Rad Laboratories). For immunohistochemistry, a piece of small intestine from a mouse (12-wk old) was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4Â°C for 30 min, rinsed with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl/PBS, treated with PBS containing 1.0 M sucrose at 4Â°C for 24 h, and embedded in Tissue Tek OTC compound. The frozen tissue was cut in a cryostat. The sections (â¼7 Î¼m) were mounted on glass slides and stained as described above.</p>

        <p>Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of MDCK II monolayers grown on filters was measured using an ERS electrical resistance system (Millipore) as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Baldaetal1996">Balda et al. 1996</xref>). TER values were obtained by subtracting the contribution of the filter and bathing solution and expressed in Ohm Ã cm<sup>2</sup>. Paracellular flux measurement was performed on confluent monolayers of adenovirally infected MDCK II cells that had been subjected to calcium switch 2 d before. A stock solution of FITC-conjugated dextrans 40K and 500K (40 and 500 kD, respectively; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Baldaetal1996">Balda et al. 1996</xref>). The assay was started by replacing the apical compartment medium with 200 Î¼l DMEM/FBS containing 0.5 mg/ml FITC-conjugated dextran, and the basal compartment medium with 600 Î¼l DMEM/FBS without tracer. The cells were incubated at 37Â°C for 3 h, and then the basal medium was collected and diffusible FITC-dextran was measured with a fluorometer (excitation, 492 nm; emission, 520 nm). The amount of dextran was calculated from a titration curve of known concentrations of the tracer.</p>

        <title>Functional Depletion of aPKC Induces the Mislocalization of ASIP/PAR-3 as Well as ZO-1</title>
        <p>It has been shown that a kinase-deficient mutant of aPKCÎ» (aPKCÎ»kn), in which a conserved lysine residue in the ATP-binding site is replaced by glutamate, exerts dominant-negative effects on aPKC-dependent TRE (TPA-response element) activation in HepG2 cells, as well as on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1996">Akimoto et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kotanietal1998">Kotani et al. 1998</xref>). As a first step to evaluate the role of aPKC in epithelial cell polarity, we overexpressed this aPKCÎ» mutant in MDCK II cells using an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer approach, and analyzed its effects on the junctional localization of ASIP/PAR-3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, a and c, adenoviral infection of confluent monolayers of MDCK II cells resulted in the heterogenous expression of aPKCÎ»kn and aPKCÎ»wt ranging from an extreme high level giving saturated immunofluorescent signals to the lowest level, with signals slightly higher than background. Infection efficiencies in the present conditions estimated from the immunostaining results of aPKCÎ»wt and aPKCÎ»kn were both â¼40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, a and c, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed an average fivefold overexpression of both proteins compared with endogenous aPKCÎ» (data not shown). Overexpressed aPKCÎ»kn as well as aPKCÎ»wt distributed diffusely in the cytosol and did not show dominant junctional localization as reported for the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DodaneandKachar1996">Dodane and Kachar 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>), suggesting that few membrane-anchoring sites for ectopic aPKC remain (note that the antiâaPKCÎ» antibody used here could not detect endogenous aPKCÎ» clearly; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> c, top left). This appears to be consistent with the fact that substantial amounts of endogenous aPKC also distribute in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>When aPKCÎ»kn was expressed in MDCK II cells maintained under normal calcium conditions, the junctional localization of ASIP/PAR-3 was not impaired even in cells showing extremely high levels of aPKCÎ»kn expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a, âCS). However, if cells expressing aPKCÎ»kn were subjected to calcium switch to induce a disruptionâregeneration process of cellâcell adhesion, then the junctional staining of ASIP/PAR-3 was significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a, +CS). Despite the apparently normal restoration of a confluent monolayer as indicated by phase contrast observations (data not shown), ASIP/PAR-3 did not develop a complete junctional distribution over the entire cell circumference, even 6 h after calcium switch (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> a), which is achieved &lt;2 h after calcium switch in control cells. This fragmentary staining of the cellâcell boundaries remains unchanged until 20 h after calcium switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a, +CS), suggesting that the junctional localization of ASIP/PAR-3 is significantly inhibited by aPKCÎ»kn. Interestingly, the junctional localization of ZO-1, a TJ marker, in cells was similarly disturbed in a calcium switch-dependent manner, suggesting that TJ formation itself is severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a, right). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref> summarizes the statistical results of ZO-1 mislocalization observed 20 h after calcium switch. While most (&gt;99%) of the cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying LacZ as well as aPKCÎ»wt display normal ZO-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> c, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>), &gt;60% infected with an aPKCÎ»kn-encoding adenovirus vector exhibit partial or complete mislocalization of ZO-1. The severity of ZO-1 mislocalization correlates well with the level of aPKCÎ»kn expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> b); for example, &gt;50% of cells with a high fluorescent signal (+++) exhibit a complete disappearance of ZO-1, whereas the rate is &lt;11% in cells with a low fluorescent signal (+). On the other hand, the data also indicate that &gt;40% of cells apparently negative for an aPKCÎ» fluorescent signal (â/+) also show fragmentary ZO-1 distribution. Considering the low sensitivity of the antiâaPKCÎ» antibody used, and the proportional correlation between fluorescent signal intensity and phenotype severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> b), we infer that the actual infection efficiency is higher than estimated and some cells negative for a fluorescent signal also express levels of aPKCÎ»kn that are undetectable but still sufficient to affect ZO-1 distribution.</p>
        <p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> a demonstrates that coinfection with increasing amounts of aPKCÎ»wt and aPKCÎ»kn gradually restores the network-like staining of ZO-1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> b shows that the same phenotypes were observed after the introduction of aPKCÎ¶kn, but not nPKCÎ´kn. Because of the significant sequence similarity between aPKCÎ» and aPKCÎ¶, we cannot exclude the possibility that aPKCÎ»kn exerts its effect not only on endogenous aPKCÎ», but also on aPKCÎ¶, and vice versa. In fact, we observed that coinfection with aPKCÎ¶wt can rescue the defective phenotype of TJ formation caused by aPKCÎ»kn (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the observed mislocalizations of ASIP/PAR-3 and ZO-1 are caused specifically by the dominant negative effects of the aPKC kinase-deficient mutants on endogenous aPKC (Î» and/or Î¶) activity.</p>
        <p>The calcium switch dependence of the effects of aPKCÎ»kn suggests that this dominant-negative mutant is effective only when the cells develop junctional structures to establish epithelial cell polarity. In fact, we further observed the similar effects of aPKCÎ»kn when cells form de novo cellâcell contacts and develop TJ under normal growth conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, where cells were sparsely reseeded immediately after viral infection and cultured for 40 h before immunofluorescent analysis, cells expressing LacZ or aPKCÎ»wt show a normal appearance while aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells exhibit a flattened shape with prominent lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> c) with many cellâcell boundaries negative for ASIP/PAR-3 and ZO-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, a and b). However, it should be noted that aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells still form islands and remain close to each other through cellâcell adhesions even in the absence of ASIP/PAR-3 or ZO-1 staining at the cellâcell boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> c). These results suggest that the effect of aPKCÎ»kn on TJ formation is not the result of the complete disruption of cellâcell adhesions.</p>

        <title>Aberrant Localization of TJ Components and F-actin Organization in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing MDCK II Cells</title>
        <p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> shows the results of a detailed immunofluorescent analysis of the confluent monolayer of aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells performed 6 h after calcium switch. Double staining for ZO-1 and ASIP/PAR-3 revealed that these peripheral TJ proteins with three PDZ domains colocalize completely, as indicated by the disrupted junctional staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> a). Further, the membrane accumulation of the major membrane proteins that comprise TJ strands, occludin and claudin-1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Furuseetal1993">Furuse et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Furuseetal1998b">Furuse et al. 1998b</xref>), is also inhibited. Since immature junctional structures that show positive staining for ZO-1 but not for occludin or claudin-1 are observed, the effects of aPKCÎ»kn overexpression on these membrane proteins seems to be more severe than the effects on ZO-1 or ASIP/PAR-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> a, arrowheads). Recent results (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gowetal1999">Gow et al. 1999</xref>) have shown that claudin-11âdeficient mice lack TJ strands in the myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes and Sertoli cells in which this claudin subtype is primarily expressed (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Moritaetal1999">Morita et al. 1999</xref>). Thus, the above results suggest that aPKC Î»kn-expressing cells show defects in the development of the TJ structure itself. The basolateral localization of E-cadherin appears to be less affected, but the fluorescence intensity is rather weaker at contact regions lacking ZO-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> b). Rhodamine-phalloidin staining revealed that aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells show defects in the formation of developed cortical F-actin bundles surrounding the epithelial cell circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> b). Instead, these cells show remarkable retention of the stress fiber-like structures of F-actin. Furthermore, some cells show characteristic large F-actin aggregates whose location corresponds completely to aberrant small ring structures containing all the TJ components examined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, a and b, arrows). These results indicate that aPKCÎ»kn interferes with the development of the epithelia-specific junctional structures such as belt-like adherent junction (AJ) and TJ, which is mediated by cooperative interactions between F-actin and junctional components. Since the aberrant small ring structures of TJ are observed only in cells showing low expression of aPKCÎ»kn (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>), these structures might be produced when the suppression of endogenous aPKC activity by aPKCÎ»kn is not complete.</p>
        <p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. d</xref>, show the results of Western blotting analysis to examine the amounts of several junctional proteins in adenovirally infected MDCK II cells harvested 6 h after calcium switch. Prolonged incubation (20 h) of aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells after calcium switch results in a decrease in the amounts of ASIP/PAR-3 and ZO-1, probably because they fail to be stabilized by being recruited into the junctional complexes (data not shown). However, at least in the early phase of cell polarization when aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells clearly exhibit defects in TJ formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> a), the amounts of the junctional proteins examined do not decrease substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. d</xref>). These results suggest that the effects of the overexpression of aPKCÎ»kn do not result from an enhanced degradation of junctional proteins.</p>

        <title>Disrupted TJ Barrier Functions in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing MDCKII Cells</title>
        <p>The defects in TJ formation in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells was further demonstrated functionally by measuring TER to passive ion flow across a cell monolayer grown on permeable support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> a). Consistent with the immunostaining results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a, none of the ectopically expressed proteins, including LacZ, nPKCÎ´kn, or aPKCÎ»wt, as well as aPKCÎ»kn, affected TER if the experiments were arranged so as to induce the expression of the ectopic proteins after the completion of TJ biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> a, top, 0â45 h). This also suggests that the overexpression of these proteins, especially aPKCÎ»kn, does not produce any artificial cytotoxic effects on TJ barrier function. On the other hand, if the cells were subsequently subjected to calcium switch (2-h incubation in LC medium followed by switching to NC medium), only cells expressing aPKCÎ»kn showed a large retardation in TER development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> a, top, 45â70 h). If the preincubation in low calcium medium was prolonged to 20 h to ensure the dissociation of cellâcell attachments before calcium switch, the effect of aPKCÎ»kn on TER development was more significant: similar to the immunostaining experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, the expression of ectopic proteins was induced in the cells cultured in LC medium, and calcium switch was applied 20 h after virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> a, bottom). In this case, TER development of aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells was substantially suppressed until 48 h after calcium switch compared with LacZ- or aPKCÎ»wt-expressing control cells, suggesting that the development of functional TJ is strongly suppressed in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells.</p>
        <p>The impairment of TJ barrier function in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells was also demonstrated by measuring the paracellular diffusion of a nonionic solute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> b). In these experiments, the cells were prepared as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, and the diffusion of FITC-dextran across MDCK II monolayers was measured 48 h after calcium switch to ensure the development of epithelial cell polarity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> b, cells expressing aPKCÎ»kn, but not LacZ or aPKCÎ»wt, still showed fivefold enhanced diffusion of FITC-conjugated dextran 40 K (average 40 kD) over a 3-h period at 37Â°C. On the other hand, the diffusion of dextran 500 (average 500 kD) showed only a 1.1-fold enhancement, confirming that the enhancement of dextran 40 diffusion is not due to a cytotoxic effect of aPKCÎ»kn expression. These results indicate that aPKCÎ» activity is required for the development of TJ, which is essential for the barrier function of epithelial cells.</p>

        <title>Disrupted Cell Surface Polarity in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing MDCK II Cells</title>
        <p>TJ have been suggested to contribute to the establishment of epithelial cell surface polarity by acting as fences for the diffusion of lipids in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane between the apical and basolateral membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanMeerandSimons1986">van Meer and Simons 1986</xref>). Therefore, the finding that functional depletion of aPKC blocks the development of the epithelia-specific junctional structures, including TJ, suggests the possibility that aPKCkn expression also results in the disruption of epithelial cell surface polarity. To confirm this possibility, we examined the two-dimensional diffusion of ectopically introduced fluorescent lipids in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells using confocal microscopy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> a, the apical membranes were labeled with BODIPY-sphingomyelin for 10 min at 4Â°C, and left for an additional 60 min on ice. Confocal microscopic analysis of the xâz sections of these cells demonstrated that only aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells show markedly enhanced labeling of the lateral membrane after a 60-min chase, suggesting a reduced diffusion fence between the apical and basolateral membranes.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that several membrane proteins, such as a basolateral membrane marker, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA), as well as an apical membrane marker, gp135, retain their polarized localizations even in the absence of TJ via their interaction with domain-specific membrane-skeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="OjakianandSchwimmer1988">Ojakian and Schwimmer 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="McNeilletal1990">McNeill et al. 1990</xref>). Therefore, to assess the possibility that the overexpression of aPKCÎ»kn affects epithelial cell surface polarity not only by inhibiting TJ biogenesis, but also by interfering with these additional mechanisms for cell polarization, we examined the distribution of endogenous NKA and gp135 in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells. NKA is restricted to the lateral membrane in control cells expressing LacZ, whereas its polarized localization in cells expressing aPKCÎ»wt is slightly disturbed to produce a leaky distribution in the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> b). Significantly, cells that express aPKCÎ»kn highly show an almost even distribution of NKA in both the apical and basolateral membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> b, arrowheads), suggesting defects in the machinery required for the maintenance of the polarized distribution of NKA. The apical localization of gp135 was also affected by aPKCÎ»kn overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> c): cells expressing aPKCÎ»kn tend to show a reduced level of gp135 on the apical membrane. Instead, increased cytosolic signals are often detected in these cells.</p>

        <title>aPKC and ASIP/PAR-3 Form a Protein Complex Containing a Mammalian Homologue of C. elegans PAR-6 in Polarized Epithelial Cells</title>
        <p>Together with the evolutionarily conserved interaction between aPKC and ASIP/PAR-3, the above finding that aPKC activity is required for the establishment of epithelial cell polarity strongly supports a notion that the cell polarization machinery composed of aPKC and PAR proteins found in <italic>C. elegans</italic> may also be conserved in mammalian epithelial cells. Therefore, we next determined to identify and characterize mammalian homologue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> PAR-6, which interdependently works with PKC-3 and PAR-3 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wattsetal1996">Watts et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tabuseetal1998">Tabuse et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="HungandKemphues1999">Hung and Kemphues 1999</xref>). Cloned human homologue of PAR-6 shows overall similarity with PAR-6 homologues in other species, sharing several stretches of conserved sequences (supplemental Fig. S1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> c): (a) a sequence at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region containing two highly conserved regions, CR 1 and CR2; (b) a sequence similar to the CRIB motif (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Burbeloetal1995">Burbelo et al. 1995</xref>); and (c) the single PDZ domain in the COOH-terminal half that has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="HungandKemphues1999">Hung and Kemphues 1999</xref>). On the other hand, the COOH-terminal region after the PDZ domain is rarely conserved. Northern analysis of human tissues revealed that PAR-6 is expressed in a variety of human tissues (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm the expression of PAR-6 in MDCK cells, we raised three kinds of antiâPAR-6 antibodies, GW2AP, GC2AP, and N12AP, which were raised against full length amino acids 126â346 and 1â125 of human PAR-6. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> a, immunoprecipitation analysis of MDCK cell lysate revealed the presence of a 43-kD protein reactive with GW2AP as well as N12AP, which is commonly immunoprecipitated with GW2AP and GC2AP. Taken together with the fact that this 43-kD protein comigrates with human PAR-6 (calculated to be 37.4 kD) overexpressed in COS1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> a), we concluded that this 43-kD band represents endogenous PAR-6 protein in epithelial MDCK cells.</p>
        <p>Importantly, Western blot analysis further revealed that aPCKÎ» as well as ASIP/PAR-3 are specifically coimmunoprecipitated with PAR-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> b), raising a possibility that PAR-6 interacts with aPKC-ASIP/PAR-3 complex. Consistently, yeast two-hybrid analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> c confirmed that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 125 amino acid residues of PAR-6 interact with aPKCÎ». Since this NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region includes two conserved regions, CR1 and CR2, we tried to narrow the regions required for their interaction further. However, neither amino acids 1â64, including CR1 but not CR2, nor 34â346, including CR2 but not CR1, interacts with aPKCÎ» (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> c), suggesting that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 125 amino acid sequence including CR1 and CR2 forms a structural domain (termed aPKCBD) required for proteinâprotein interaction. Another series of analyses also revealed that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residues 22â113 of aPKCÎ» are sufficient for the interaction with PAR-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> d). Again, NH<sub>2</sub>- or COOH-terminal deletion of this region results in the disappearance of the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> d), suggesting that this region, corresponding to the D1 region (diversed region 1) of aPKCÎ», forms another structural domain for proteinâprotein interaction.</p>

        <title>aPKC Mediates the Interaction between ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6 as a Linker</title>
        <p>Previously, we demonstrated that aPKCÎ» directly binds to ASIP/PAR-3 through its kinase domain. Therefore, the above results raise the possibility that aPKCÎ» binds both ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6 simultaneously and mediates the formation of an aPKC-ASIP/PAR-3âPAR-6 ternary complex. To examine this possibility, we next performed a series of immunoprecipitation experiments in COS1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> a, when Flag-tagged PAR-6 was overexpressed and immunoprecipitated with an antiâFlag antibody, coexpressed T7-tagged ASIP was coprecipitated together with endogenous aPKCÎ». Significantly, when T7-tagged ASIP Î30, which corresponds to an isoform lacking aPKC-binding region was coexpressed with Flag-tagged PAR-6 instead of wild-type ASIP, endogenous aPKCÎ» but not this ASIP isoform was coimmunoprecipitated with PAR-6, suggesting that ASIP indirectly associates with PAR-6 by way of aPKCÎ». In fact, a T7-tagged PAR-6 mutant lacking NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal aPKCÎ»-binding region (ÎaPKCBD) does not show interactions not only with endogenous aPKCÎ» but also with ASIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> b), although the other PAR-6 mutant (ÎCRIB/PDZ) lacking the CRIB and PDZ domains but retaining aPKCÎ»-binding region can interact with both proteins. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> c shows that overexpression of aPKCÎ» enhances the coprecipitation of T7-tagged ASIP with Flag-tagged PAR-6. On the other hand, overexpression of aPKCÎ» ÎN47 that cannot bind to PAR-6 does not show such enhancement, but rather suppresses the coprecipitation of ASIP/PAR-3 with PAR-6. This can be explained as a dominant negative effect of this aPKCÎ» mutant on ASIP, inhibiting the indirect association of ASIP with PAR-6 by way of endogenous aPKCÎ». Taken together, we conclude that aPKC serves as a linker molecule between PAR-6 and ASIP, and mediates the formation of a ternary protein complex composed of aPKCÎ», ASIP/PAR-3, and PAR-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> d).</p>

        <title>Colocalization of PAR-6 as Well as aPKCÎ» and ASIP/PAR-3 to the Epithelial Junctional Complex with ZO-1</title>
        <p>To evaluate the physiological significance of the physical interaction between aPKCÎ», ASIP/PAR-3, and PAR-6 in epithelial cells, we next examined the intracellular localization of PAR-6 in MDCK cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> a, the antiâPAR-6 antibody, GW2AP, clearly stains the cellâcell boundary of confluent MDCK II cells. Since the similar result was obtained with the other independent antibody, GC2AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> b), we concluded that these junctional stainings represent the genuine localization of endogenous PAR-6 in MDCK II cells. Closer inspection of the localization of endogenous PAR-6 by confocal z-sectioning revealed PAR-6 staining at the most apical end of the cellâcell contact region with ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> c). Since, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>), aPKCÎ» and ASIP/PAR-3 also localize to the corresponding region with ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> c), these results strongly suggest that PAR-6 colocalizes with aPKCÎ» and ASIP/PAR-3 to the apical junctional complex of epithelial cells. To clarify further the localization of PAR-6 in epithelial cells, we next stained mouse intestinal epithelia, a typical tissue containing polarized epithelial cells. Similar to aPKCÎ» and ASIP/PAR-3, PAR-6 also localizes to the most apical end of the junctional complex with ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> d). In addition, like ASIP/PAR-3, the junctional localization of PAR-6 is severely disturbed in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells, showing complete colocalization with ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> e). Taken together with the physical interactions among these three proteins, the above results provide evidence supporting the idea that PAR-6, aPKCÎ», and ASIP/PAR-3 asymmetrically localize in the apical junctional complex in polarized epithelial cells as a ternary protein complex.</p>

        <title>aPKC Kinase Activity Is Required for the Establishment of the Junctional Structures and Epithelial Cell Polarity</title>
        <p>Pharmacological studies using PKC activators or inhibitors have indicated the involvement of PKC in TJ biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Citi1992">Citi 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Baldaetal1993">Balda et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="StuartandNigam1995">Stuart and Nigam 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Denkeretal1996">Denker et al. 1996</xref>). However, one cell type expresses several PKC isotypes with differing sensitivities to activators or inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ogitaetal1991">Ogita et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mizunoetal1995">Mizuno et al. 1995</xref>). In fact, MDCK II cells express at least cPKCÎ±, nPKCÎµ, Î·, and aPKCÎ», Î¶ (Shimizu, M., unpublished results). Therefore, the results obtained so far using these agents should reflect the sum of their effects on several PKCs in MDCK cells, even if it is assumed that their targets are restricted to PKC.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we used dominant-negative mutants of aPKC to demonstrate that aPKCÎ» or Î¶ is required for the assembly of TJs. This conclusion is based on the following results. (a) Cells expressing dominantânegative point mutants of aPKCÎ» or Î¶ (aPKCkn), but not the wild types, show an inhibited junctional localization of ZO-1 even 20 h after calcium switch. (b) The effects are specific to dominantânegative mutants of aPKCs and are not observed when such mutants of nPKCÎ´ and cPKCÎ± (data not shown) are used. (c) The effects of aPKCÎ»kn are rescued by the cointroduction of aPKCÎ»wt in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the effects of aPKCÎ»kn are based on its dominant suppression of endogenous aPKC activity. (d) The junctional localizations of not only ZO-1, but all TJ components tested, are similarly affected by aPKCÎ»kn, indicating that the development of the TJ structure itself is blocked in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells. (e) Overexpression of aPKCÎ»kn impairs the restoration of the barrier function of MDCK cells after calcium switch, as measured by TER as well as by the paracellular diffusion of dextran. It should be noted that these effects of aPKCÎ»kn are observed only when the ectopic protein is present during the de novo formation of TJ structures. Generally, the dominantânegative effects of kinase-deficient point mutants are thought to arise from competition with the endogenous kinase for interaction with other molecules required for their proper function. The target molecules can be (a) specific substrates of the kinase, (b) activators, or (c) anchoring partners that determine where the kinase should be activated physiologically and efficiently. At this stage, we cannot conclude in which way the aPKCkn mutants we used work within the cells. However, the present results clearly indicate that regulated aPKC kinase activity is required during the dynamic reconstructing of the junctional structures and epithelial cell polarity.</p>
        <p>Together with previous pharmacological studies, the features of the effect of aPKCkn reported here agree with those shown for the effects of the PKC-specific inhibitors, H7 and calphostin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StuartandNigam1995">Stuart and Nigam 1995</xref>): both inhibit TJ assembly as monitored by ZO-1 distribution and TER development, but have lesser effect on the basolateral accumulation of E-cadherin in MDCK cells. Both specifically affect the formation but not the maintenance of TJ. These coincidences may indicate that the main targets of the PKC inhibitors so far examined are aPKCs. In fact, the inhibition constant of H7 and calphostin against aPKCÎ¶ measured in vitro (90 and 1 Î¼M for Îµ-peptide, respectively; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mizunoetal1995">Mizuno et al. 1995</xref>), are four- to fivefold higher than those for cPKCÎ±, and this may be why the effects of these inhibitors on ZO-1 distribution are rather weak compared with the effect of aPKCkn (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="StuartandNigam1995">Stuart and Nigam 1995</xref>, reported that 25 Î¼M H7, as well as 500 nM calphostin, in the medium retards, but does not completely block, the junctional ring formation of ZO-1). However, it should also be noted that aPKCs are atypical PKCs that are insensitive to diacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Akimotoetal1994">Akimoto et al. 1994</xref>). This means that our data do not explain the finding in a previous study that 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (a diacylglycerol analogue) induces TJ-like structures even in the absence of extracellular calcium without AJ formation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Baldaetal1993">Balda et al. 1993</xref>). One working hypothesis that can explain all the above results is that not only aPKC but also diacylglycerol-responsive PKC (conventional and/or novel PKC) plays a positive role in the regulation of TJ formation. We are now directing our efforts to validating this hypothesis.</p>

        <title>Molecular Mechanism by which aPKC Regulates the Junctional Structure Formation</title>
        <p>The molecular basis of the involvement of aPKC in TJ biogenesis is not yet clear. Considering the fact that endogenous aPKC as well as ASIP/PAR-3, its specific binding protein with three PDZ domains, localize at TJ in polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that aPKC is recruited into TJ by ASIP/PAR-3, and thereby exerts kinase activity to promote the development of the TJ structures. It may seem that this idea is inconsistent with the present observation that aPKCkn is distributed mainly in the cytosol and not at the cellâcell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> a); however, this may suggest that the mutant inhibits the translocation of endogenous aPKC to the cellâcell junctional area by competing for binding to ASIP/PAR-3 or other binding proteins in the cytosol. We do not have direct evidence suggesting that the phosphorylation by aPKC is required for the TJ targeting of ASIP/PAR-3, but it should be remembered that the polarized localizations of aPKC and PAR-3 are mutually dependent in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo.</p>
        <p>Of course, the possibility remains that the region where aPKC mainly functions is not the cellâcell junction, but the cytosol. In fact, substantial amounts of endogenous aPKC are detected in the cytosol, although some is concentrated at the tip of the lateral membrane of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DodaneandKachar1996">Dodane and Kachar 1996</xref>). In addition, upon disruption of cellâcell adhesions, aPKC as well as ASIP/PAR-3 localizing at cellâcell junctions redistribute to the cytosol, suggesting the dynamic nature of the aPKC-ASIP/PAR-3 complex (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>). In this respect, it is interesting that there are several reports suggesting that aPKCs are involved in the regulation of vesicle transport. For example, the dominantânegative mutant of aPKC specifically inhibits insulin-dependent Glut4 translocation to plasma membranes in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kotanietal1998">Kotani et al. 1998</xref>). In addition, aPKCs colocalize with p62/ZIP and Rab7 at vesicular-like structures in the cytosol of Hela cells, and its dominantânegative mutant severely impairs the endocytic membrane transport of the EGF receptor with no effect on the transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sanchezetal1998">Sanchez et al. 1998</xref>). Therefore, another interesting possibility is that aPKC regulates the polarized membrane targeting of proteins, including junctional proteins, in response to initial cellâcell adhesion. This may explain the present results in which the polarized localization of NKA and gp135, which can be maintained even in the absence of TJ, is disturbed in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing MDCK cells. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that the primary target of aPKC may not be TJ biogenesis itself, but upstream events triggered by initial cellâcell attachment. In fact, we observed that aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells also show decreased E-cadherin accumulation to cellâcell borders, and defects in the formation of developed F-actin peripheral bundles remaining stress fiber-like structures instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> b). Therefore, aPKC might regulate the reorganization of the submembranous and/or intracellular cytoskeleton, which is closely linked with the asymmetric development of epithelia-specific junctional structures including TJ, belt-like AJ, and desmosome. This idea may be consistent with the recent reports that aPKCÎ» and Î¶ participate in the Ras-mediated reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton in NIH3T3 cells, or that aPKCÎ» and Î¶ work downstream of Cdc42 to disrupt stress fibers in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Uberalletal1999">Uberall et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Coghlanetal2000">Coghlan et al. 2000</xref>). The defects in the mislocalization of NKA and gp135 in aPKCÎ»kn-expressing MDCK cells can also be explained by this idea. To address these issues, further studies are needed to identify the physiological substrates of this kinase, whose phosphorylated state and activity change dynamically during the process of epithelial cell polarization.</p>

        <title>aPKCâPAR System in Mammalian Epithelial Cells</title>
        <p>Here, we present data showing that the overexpression of a dominantânegative mutant of aPKC disturbs epithelial cell surface polarity along the apico-basal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results correspond well with our previous finding that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryo lacking aPKC (PKC-3) shows defects in the establishment of the anteriorâposterior polarity (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Izumietal1998">Izumi et al. 1998</xref>). Consistently, we further demonstrate here that a mammalian homologue of PAR-6 forms a ternary complex with aPKC and ASIP/PAR-3, and accumulates at the apical tip of epithelial cellâcell junctions. Moreover, as in the case of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo lacking PKC-3 expression, the junctional localizations of ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6 are disturbed by the overexpression of aPKCÎ»kn. Although we have not succeeded in directly demonstrating the involvement of ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6 in aPKC function in the present paper, the above coincidences increasingly support the hypothesis that the aPKC-PAR system acts as evolutionarily conserved cell polarization machinery not only in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo but also in mammalian epithelial cells. Importantly, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of aPKC was recently suggested to associate with Bazooka (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of PAR-3) and control the polarity of epithelia as well as neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wodarzetal2000">Wodarz et al. 2000</xref>). The present study provides additional insight into this machinery by indicating that aPKC activity is required for the development of the polarized junctional structures to which the aPKC/PAR-3/PAR-6 complex anchors. This might suggest that, in general, the establishment of the asymmetrical membranous/submembranous structures is a primary step for subsequent cell polarization. To fully understand the molecular basis of this evolutionarily conserved role of aPKC, mammalian epithelial cells provide an advantageous system for future biochemical analyses, offering a convenient method to reconstitute the cell polarization process in vitro.</p>

        <p>Overexpression of the kinase-deficient mutant of aPKCÎ» (aPKCkn) in confluent MDCK monolayers disrupts the junctional localization of ASIP and ZO-1 only when the cells are subjected to calcium switch. (a) Confluent MDCK cells seeded on cover slips were infected with adenovirus vector encoding aPKCÎ»kn. 20 h after viral infection, the cells were subjected to calcium switch (+CS) or left untreated (âCS) (see Materials and Methods). After another 20 h, the cells were doubly labeled with antiâaPKCÎ» and antiâASIP as indicated at the top (left and middle). Each photograph represents the projected view of optical sections (0.4 Î¼m) obtained from the apical to basal membrane using a laser scanning confocal microscope (unless otherwise noted, the following data were obtained in the same way). Note that fluorescent signals for endogenous aPKCÎ» are not observed in the photographs because the antiâaPKCÎ» antibody used (Î»2) is not sensitive enough to clearly detect the endogenous protein in MDCK II cells and because the exposure times were adjusted to cover the highly heterogenous level of aPKCÎ»kn expression. (Right) Independent specimens stained by the antiâZO-1 antibody. Bar, 25 Î¼m. (b) Correlation between the expression level of aPKCÎ»kn and the severity of ZO-1 mislocalization. Based on the fluorescent intensity of aPKCÎ», cells were categorized as showing undetectable (â/+), low (+), medium (++), or high (+++) expression, and the ZO-1 staining pattern of the corresponding cell was estimated as complete (white), partially disappeared (hatched), or completely disappeared (black). Original statistical data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>. (c) LacZ- or aPKCÎ»wt-expressing cells subjected to calcium switch were doubly stained as in a, with antiâaPKCÎ» and antiâZO-1 antibodies. Bar, 25 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>aPKCkn specifically disturbs the junctional localization of ZO-1 by its dominant negative effect on endogenous aPKC activity. (a) MDCK II cells coinfected with adenovirus vectors encoding aPKCÎ»wt and aPKCÎ»kn were subjected to calcium switch as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and, 20 h later, stained with antiâZO-1 antibody. Total multiplicity of infection was normalized to 120 by mixing with a LacZ-encoding virus vector. The mixed ratios of the each vector are as follows: aPKCÎ»kn:aPKCÎ»wt:LacZ = 2:0:2 (top), 2:1:1 (middle), and 2:2:0 (bottom). Note that increasing amounts of coexpressed aPKCÎ»wt increasingly rescue the phenotype caused by aPKCÎ»kn. (b) MDCK II cells overexpressing aPKCÎ¶wt, Î¶kn, or Î´kn were similarly prepared as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and, 20 h later, doubly stained with antiâPKC antibodies corresponding to each PKC subtype (left) and antiâZO-1 (right).

The total amount of protein in each lane was finely adjusted based on the quantitative results of Coomassie brilliant blue staining of the blot membrane (data not shown). Quantified results based on three independent experiments examining the amounts of the indicated proteins in MDCK cells expressing LacZ (white bar), aPKCÎ»wt (hatched bar), or aPKCÎ»kn (black bar) are presented in d.

        <p>Overexpression of aPKCÎ»kn inhibits the development of TER of MDCK II cells after calcium switch. (a) Confluent MDCK II cells grown on a filter were infected with adenovirus vectors, and TER was measured. (Top) The ectopically expressed proteins are as follows: none (X), LacZ (â¢), aPKCÎ»kn (â¡), aPKCÎ»wt (âµ), and nPKCÎ´kn (â). 2 d after cell seeding (1.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) when the TER values reached a plateau, the cells were processed for adenovirus infection (time 0, left) for 2 h in LC medium. Immediately after virus infection, the medium was changed to NC growth medium to allow the cells to complete junctional structure formation before the expression of ectopic proteins. After TER measurement for 45 h, the cells were subjected to calcium switch by changing the medium to LC for 2 h, and then back to NC. The values given represent mean values (1 Â± SD) of three parallel cultures. The background resistance obtained from empty filters was deducted. Note that only cells expressing aPKCÎ»kn show a retardation in TER development after calcium switch. (Bottom) MDCK II cells were infected with adenovirus vectors encoding LacZ (â¢), aPKCÎ»kn (â¡), or aPKCÎ»wt (âµ) as in a. In this case, the cells were kept in fresh LC medium to induce ectopic protein expression in the absence of cellâcell adhesion. 20 h after virus infection, the medium was changed to NC medium, and the development of TER was monitored for 48 h. Note that aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells show substantial suppression of TER development even 48 h after calcium switch. (b) Overexpression of aPKCÎ»kn increases the paracellular diffusion of FITC-dextran in a molecular mass-dependent manner. Paracellular diffusion of FITC-dextran 40K (left) and 500K (right) across adenovirus-infected MDCK II cells was evaluated. FITC-dextran was added to the medium on the apical side of cells subjected to calcium switch 2 d before. After 3 h incubation at 37Â°C, the fluorescence intensity of the medium in the basolateral side was measured with a fluorometer. Values given represent the mean values (Â±SD) of three parallel cultures.</p>

The distribution of the fluorescent lipid was then analyzed by taking z-sectional views using a confocal microscope. The upper and lower arrowheads indicate the positions of the apical and basal membranes, respectively. Bar, 25 Î¼m. (b and c) Effect of aPKCÎ»kn on the asymmetric distribution of epithelial polarity markers. Adenovirally infected MDCK II cells were doubly immunostained with antiâaPKCÎ» and antiâNa<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (b) or antiâgp135 antibodies (c) 20 h after calcium switch. Representative xz-sectional views obtained by confocal microscopic analysis are presented. Note that aPKCÎ»kn-expressing cells (arrowheads) exhibit disturbed localization of NKA as well as gp135, proteins that show polarized distributions in LacZ-expressing control cells. Bars, 25 Î¼m.</p>

        <p>Ternary complex formation of PAR-6, aPKCÎ», and ASIP/PAR-3. (aâc) COS cells were transfected with expression vectors as indicated (top). The cell lysates (Sup) were processed for immunoprecipitation (IP) with antiâFlag (a and c) or antiâT7 (b) monoclonal antibodies, and the coimmunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed using with antiâaPKCÎ» (Î¹), antiâT7, antiâFlag, or antiâASIP (C2-3AP) antibodies. (a) The Flag-PAR-6 immunoprecipitates contained T7-ASIPwt, but not T7-ASIP Î30 lacking the sequence critical for the interaction with aPKC. (b) ASIPwt was not contained in PAR-6 ÎaPKCBD immunoprecipitates but in PAR-6wt or ÎCRIB/PDZ immunoprecipitates. (c) Coimmunoprecipitation of T7-ASIP with Flag-PAR-6 was enhanced by the coexpression aPKCÎ»wt, but not aPKCÎ» ÎN47, which lacks the sequences in the PAR-6âbinding region. (d) Schematic diagram of the PAR-6âaPKC-ASIP/PAR-3 ternary complex. PAR-6 interacts with ASIP through aPKCÎ» as a linker.</p>

        <p>Identification of endogenous PAR-6 and its association with aPKCÎ» and ASIP in fully polarized epithelial cells. (a) Identification of endogenous PAR-6 protein in MDCK II cells. Semi-confluent MDCK cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 Î¼g of affinity-purified antiâPAR-6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (GW2AP, GC2AP) or control normal rabbit IgG. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using the antibodies indicated in parentheses (right). GW2AP and GC2AP specifically immunoprecipitate a 43-kD protein comigrating with PAR-6 expressed in COS cells, which was recognized by N12AP as well as GW2AP. (b) Ternary complex formation of PAR-6, aPKCÎ», and ASIP/PAR-3 in vivo. AntiâPAR-6 (GW2AP) immunoprecipitate (IP), prepared as in a, was analyzed using antiâaPKCÎ» monoclonal or antiâASIP polyclonal antibody. PAR-6 immunoprecipitates specifically contain endogenous aPKCÎ», full-length ASIP, and its splicing variant (bottom band). (c and d) Summary of the yeast two-hybrid assays to analyze the PAR-6âaPKCÎ» interaction. The interaction was examined by growth on culture plates lacking histidine. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region including CR1 and 2 of PAR-6 is sufficient for the interaction with aPKCÎ» (c), while NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residues 22â113 of aPKCÎ» are sufficient for the interaction with PAR-6 (d).</p>
