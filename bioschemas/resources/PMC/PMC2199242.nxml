      <abstract>
        <p>Integrins regulate cell adhesion and motility through tyrosine kinases, but initiation of this process is poorly understood. We find here that Src associates constitutively with integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 in platelets. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen caused a rapid increase in Î±IIbÎ²3-associated Src activity, and active Src localized to filopodia and cell edges. Csk, which negatively regulates Src by phosphorylating Tyr-529, was also constitutively associated with Î±IIbÎ²3. However, fibrinogen binding caused Csk to dissociate from Î±IIbÎ²3, concomitant with dephosphorylation of Src Tyr-529 and phosphorylation of Src activation loop Tyr-418. In contrast to the behavior of Src and Csk, Syk was associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 only after fibrinogen binding. Platelets multiply deficient in Src, Hck, Fgr, and Lyn, or normal platelets treated with Src kinase inhibitors failed to spread on fibrinogen. Inhibition of Src kinases blocked Syk activation and inhibited phosphorylation of Syk substrates (Vav1, Vav3, SLP-76) implicated in cytoskeletal regulation. Syk-deficient platelets exhibited Src activation upon adhesion to fibrinogen, but no spreading or phosphorylation of Vav1, Vav3, and SLP-76. These studies establish that platelet spreading on fibrinogen requires sequential activation of Src and Syk in proximity to Î±IIbÎ²3, thus providing a paradigm for initiation of integrin signaling to the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Outside-in signaling refers to the process whereby ligation of an integrin adhesion receptor by a cognate ligand stimulates inward signals that affect a variety of cellular responses, including cytoskeletal reorganization, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aplin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Geiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz, 2001</xref>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins is a major outside-in signaling event, implying that there are key relationships between integrins and specific protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. In this regard, Src family kinases have been shown to play a significant role in several phases of outside-in signaling in many cell types (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lowell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Schlaepfer and Hunter, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Suen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Timpson et al., 2001</xref>). A prominent example is in adherent fibroblasts, where Src forms a complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> and where downstream effectors of this signaling complex regulate cell growth, migration, and focal adhesion turnover (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guan, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Polte and Hanks, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Schlaepfer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Schaller et al., 1999</xref>). Since formation of the SrcâFAK complex occurs at actin-rich adhesion sites that assemble over minutes to hours, it is likely to be preceded by integrin-dependent signals that are required for actin polymerization and reorganization. However, the process by which integrins initiate outside-in signaling is poorly understood.</p>
      <p>Blood platelets are frequently used to study outside-in signaling because they represent a physiologically important cell, and the platelet-specific integrin, Î±IIbÎ²3, is required for hemostasis. Outside-in signaling in platelets is triggered when fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor binds to Î±IIbÎ²3, and it is dependent on close functional, if not physical, relationships between Î±IIbÎ²3 and the signaling machinery of the cell (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shattil et al., 1998</xref>). Signals transduced by Î±IIbÎ²3 regulate platelet filopodial extension, spreading, aggregation, and granule secretion (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shattil et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>). Since these responses involve polymerization and rearrangements of actin filaments (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fox, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hartwig et al., 1999</xref>), Î±IIbÎ²3 signals presumably regulate actin dynamics.</p>
      <p>Specific nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in Î±IIbÎ²3 outside-in signaling (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shattil et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>). For example, Syk becomes activated within seconds of fibrinogen binding to platelets, whereas FAK becomes activated later during platelet aggregation and spreading (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lipfert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1994</xref>). Syk activation does not require actin polymerization since it is unaffected by inhibitors such as cytochalasin D, whereas FAK activation requires actin polymerization (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lipfert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, activation of Syk, but not FAK, may be a key early event in outside-in signaling. This idea is supported by several recent observations. First, platelet adhesion to fibrinogen stimulates a direct interaction of Syk with the cytoplasmic tail of Î²3, correlating with Syk activation (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Woodside et al., 2001</xref>). Second, Syk heterologously expressed in CHO cells is activated in response to clustering of Î±IIbÎ²3 complexes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hato et al., 1998</xref>). Third, adhesion of platelets or Î±IIbÎ²3-CHO cells to fibrinogen induces Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins implicated in cytoskeletal regulation, including Vav1 and SLP-76 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cichowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Obergfell et al., 2001</xref>). The biological relevance of these interactions for outside-in signaling in platelets is suggested by studies of mice deficient in SLP-76, which exhibit a bleeding diathesis and, among other platelet abnormalities, defective spreading on fibrinogen (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clements et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to Syk and FAK, platelets contain several Src family members (Src, Fyn, Fgr, Hck, Lyn, Yes), with Src itself being the most abundant (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Golden et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Stenberg et al., 1997</xref>). Studies using chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation techniques have suggested that one or more Src kinases may be associated with Î±IIbÎ²3, either before or after thrombin-induced platelet activation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dorahy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kralisz and Cierniewski, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, Src becomes activated and partitions to the detergent-insoluble actin cytoskeleton in thrombin-aggregated platelets, suggesting that it is regulated by fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Horvath et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Brugge, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
      <p>Based on these considerations, we used biochemical and genetic approaches here to determine how outside-in signaling is initiated in platelets. The results establish that Src is constitutively associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 and that platelet adhesion to fibrinogen selectively activates this pool of Src, possibly by inducing the dissociation of an Src-regulatory kinase, Csk, from the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex. Furthermore, Src kinases are required for Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent activation of Syk, and both Src and Syk are required to initiate cytoskeletal events responsible for platelet spreading on fibrinogen.</p>

        <title>Interactions between Î±IIbÎ²3 and Src in platelets</title>
        <p>To begin to explore relationships between Î±IIbÎ²3 and Src in outside-in signaling, we asked whether Src is associated with Î±IIbÎ²3, either before or after platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, a response dependent on Î±IIbÎ²3. Human platelets were incubated for 45 min over a BSA matrix, to which they do not adhere, or a fibrinogen matrix, to which they adhere and gradually spread. Then platelets were solubilized in a buffer containing NP-40 detergent, the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to Î²3, and immunoprecipitates were probed on Western blots with an antibody to Src. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, Src was detected in Î²3 immunoprecipitates whether or not the platelets had become adherent to fibrinogen. The same results were obtained if A2A9, an Î±IIbÎ²3 complexâdependent antibody, was used to immunoprecipitate the integrin (unpublished data). A comparison of the Src that did and did not quantitatively coprecipitate with Î±IIbÎ²3 indicated that â¼3% of the Src solubilized from platelets was associated with Î±IIbÎ²3. Fyn and Yes, the only other Src family members tested, were also associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Note in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A that the amounts of Î²3 and Src were slightly less in Î²3 immunoprecipitates from adherent platelets compared with nonadherent ones. This was attributed to a minor redistribution of these proteins to the detergent-insoluble actin cytoskeleton because it was prevented by preincubation of platelets with 10 Î¼M cytochalasin D to inhibit actin polymerization (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A).</p>

        <p>Two other nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, Pyk2 and Btk, were not present in Î²3 immunoprecipitates, and FAK was present to a relatively minor degree despite being well represented in the detergent-soluble lysate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The specificity of the Src association with Î±IIbÎ²3 was supported further by the observation that Src could not be detected in immunoprecipitates of GP IbÎ±, another prominent platelet adhesion receptor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Csk, an Src-like tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the negative regulation of Src family members (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Latour and Veillette, 2001</xref>), was found to be associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 in suspended platelets but not adherent ones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). These results reveal a specific and constitutive interaction between Src and Î±IIbÎ²3 that is unaffected by platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, and an interaction between Csk and Î±IIbÎ²3 that is disrupted by adhesion.</p>
        <p>To determine whether platelet adhesion to fibrinogen affects the activation state of Src, Western blots of Î±IIbÎ²3 immunoprecipitates were probed with phospho-specific antibodies to Src tyrosine residues 418 and 529. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-418 within the kinase activation loop is a marker of Src activation. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Tyr-529 (the target residue of Csk) promotes intramolecular interactions of the Src COOH terminus with the SH2 domain, effectively inhibiting kinase activity (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation at Tyr-529 is a marker of Src suppression. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen for 45 min caused a simultaneous increase in the phosphorylation of Src Tyr-418 and a decrease in the phosphorylation Tyr-529 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). This effect was observed within 15 min, the earliest time point at which sufficient numbers of adherent platelets could be analyzed (unpublished data). Src activation in fibrinogen-adherent platelets was unaffected by 10 Î¼M cytochalasin D, implying that it did not require actin polymerization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was blocked by cytochalasin D, as reported previously (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lipfert et al., 1992</xref>). In contrast to these results for integrin-associated Src, the bulk of the Src in platelets that did not coprecipitate with Î±IIbÎ²3 failed to become activated during platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C).</p>
        <p>To analyze these results quantitatively, Src âactivityâ was expressed arbitrarily as the ratio of the phospho-specific Tyr-418 and Tyr-529 immunoblot signals after normalization for the amount of Src in the Î²3 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen caused a mean 35-fold increase in Src activity as assessed by this method (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.02). This effect was confirmed by direct measurements of Src kinase activity in Î²3 immunoprecipitates (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> F).</p>
        <p>In contrast to platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, binding of soluble fibrinogen to platelets requires prior activation of Î±IIbÎ²3. Therefore, to investigate whether soluble fibrinogen binding is sufficient to activate Src, platelets were incubated in the presence of 250 Î¼g/ml fibrinogen, and 0.5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> was added to directly activate Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bazzoni and Hemler, 1998</xref>). Fibrinogen binding caused both the dissociation of Csk from the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex and the increased phosphorylation of Src Tyr-418 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Fib + Mn<sup>2+</sup> lane). These responses were observed as early as 1 min, were stable for at least 20 min, and were blocked by 2 mM RGDS, which inhibits fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3. Interestingly, MnCl<sub>2</sub> or RGDS each induced a small amount Csk dissociation and Src Tyr-418 phosphorylation, suggesting that both integrin activation and ligation contribute to Src activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Together with the data for adherent platelets, these results establish that fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3 causes dissociation of Csk from the Î±IIbÎ²3 complex at the same time that the integrin-associated pool of Src becomes activated. These responses require neither actin polymerization nor tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK.</p>

        <p>The results presented so far are consistent with the idea that Src activation may occur in localized regions of the platelet where Î±IIbÎ²3 first comes in contact with fibrinogen. Therefore, the distribution of activated Src in fibrinogen-adherent platelets was determined by confocal microscopy using the antiâpTyr-418 antibody as a marker. Although this antibody may also react with the corresponding activation loop phosphotyrosine of other Src family members, it reacted on Western blots of platelet lysates with an apparent single band at â¼60 kD, consistent with Src (unpublished data). AntiâpTyr-418 antibody staining was confined to the filopodia and edges of spreading platelets and to a central region corresponding to the granulomere. In contrast, the distribution of âtotalâ Src determined with antibody 327 was more diffuse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, Src activation takes place in association with Î±IIbÎ²3 and at the periphery of spreading platelets.</p>

        <title>Role of Src family kinases in outside-in signaling through Î±IIbÎ²3</title>
        <p>To determine whether an Src kinase is required for Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent cytoskeletal changes, platelets were preincubated for 30 min with PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hanke et al., 1996</xref>), and then plated on fibrinogen. PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2, was used as a control. 5 Î¼M PP2 abolished adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Src Tyr-418 in Î²3 immunoprecipitates, but not phosphorylation of Tyr-529 or the association of Src with Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Control platelets adherent to fibrinogen underwent morphological changes ranging from filopodia protrusion to complete spreading, with F-actin and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins evident at the cell periphery. In contrast, platelets treated with 5 Î¼M PP2 generally showed fewer and smaller filopodia and spread very poorly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). The differences in spreading between PP2-treated and control platelets were significant as assessed by computerized image analysis of cell surface areas (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Although not shown, results identical to those with PP2 were obtained with 2 Î¼M SU6656, a pharmacologically distinct, selective inhibitor of Src family kinases (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blake et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the spreading defect of platelets treated with PP2 or SU6656 could be overcome if the cells were stimulated during adhesion with a combination of agonists to G proteinâcoupled receptors (1 mM PAR-4 receptorâactivating peptide, 50 Î¼M ADP, and 50 Î¼M epinephrine).</p>

        <p>To address the role of Src kinases without using chemical inhibitors, mouse bone marrow chimeras deficient in Src family members were generated. Murine platelets are smaller than their human counterparts and spread less well on fibrinogen (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, adherent wild-type platelets exhibited filopodial extensions, variable degrees of spreading, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The same was true for platelets lacking three Src kinases (Fgr, Hck, and Lyn). In sharp contrast, platelets deficient in Src as well as Fgr, Hck, and Lyn spread poorly on fibrinogen and exhibited minimal tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). Analysis of cell surface areas confirmed that the spreading defect of these latter platelets was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Thus, Src and possibly other Src family members are involved in Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent platelet spreading.</p>
        <p>To identify potential downstream effectors of Î±IIbÎ²3 and Src, the effect of PP2 or SU6656 on adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of several platelet proteins was examined. The results with PP2 are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and are identical to those obtained with SU6656. PP2, but not PP3, inhibited adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A), tyrosine phosphorylation of putative Syk substrates Vav1, Vav3, and SLP-76, and tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAP-130, an adaptor that binds to SLP-76 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Obergfell et al., 2001</xref>). On the other hand, PP2 had no effect on the adhesion-dependent association of Syk with Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). Thus, one or more Src family kinases appear to be required for Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent activation of Syk and for tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk substrates implicated in cytoskeletal regulation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Obergfell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Outside-in signaling through integrins mediates numerous anchorage-dependent cellular responses (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aplin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz, 2001</xref>). Components of the actin cytoskeleton are particularly important targets of integrin signals because they are often concentrated within integrin-based adhesion structures known as focal complexes and focal adhesions, and they participate in the regulation of cell shape and gene expression (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Schoenwaelder and Burridge, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Geiger et al., 2001</xref>). In adherent cells, an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins is one of the most prominent events within actin-rich filopodia, lamellipodia, and focal adhesions (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Geiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz, 2001</xref>). In fibroblasts, the cell types most commonly studied in this regard, Src and FAK, have been identified as a prominent signaling complex that functions downstream of integrins to regulate cell migration and focal adhesion turnover (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guan, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Polte and Hanks, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Schlaepfer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Schaller et al., 1999</xref>). In hematopoietic cells, including platelets, Syk has been identified as a third type of tyrosine kinase that is activated by integrins (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 1995</xref>). In fact, platelet adhesion to fibrinogen stimulates both the direct association of Syk with the cytoplasmic tail of Î²3 and Syk activation (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Woodside et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike activation of FAK, Syk activation in adherent platelets precedes actin polymerization, and Syk substrates, including Vav1 and SLP-76, have been implicated in cytoskeletal regulation (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Miranti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Obergfell et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, Syk may participate in the initiation of Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent actin polymerization and platelet spreading. Src is also activated during platelet aggregation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Brugge, 1993</xref>), but its precise role in outside-in signaling in platelets has not been established.</p>
      <p>Human- and gene-targeted mouse platelets were used here to define the relationships between Î±IIbÎ²3, Src, and Syk in outside-in signaling. The major new findings are: (a) Src and its regulatory kinase, Csk, are constitutively associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 in resting platelets. (b) Upon soluble fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3 or platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, Csk dissociates from Î±IIbÎ²3 and Src becomes activated, independent of actin polymerization. Activated Src localizes to the periphery of spreading platelets, including filopodia. (c) The activity of Src is required for Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and for platelet spreading on fibrinogen. (d) Syk is also required for platelet spreading but not for Src activation. Thus, outside-in signaling in platelets is initiated by the sequential activation of Src and Syk in proximity to Î±IIbÎ²3, providing a molecular basis for signal generation from Î±IIbÎ²3 to the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
      <p>Immunoprecipitation analysis of NP-40 detergent extracts revealed that Src and the related kinases, Fyn and Yes, were associated with Î±IIbÎ²3, both before and after platelet adhesion to fibrinogen. These interactions are specific because no association was observed between Î±IIbÎ²3 and two other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, Pyk2 and Btk. Furthermore, Src did not coprecipitate with GP IbÎ±, another abundant platelet membrane adhesion receptor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These results are consistent with a brief report that Src coprecipitates with Î±IIbÎ²3 from Triton X-100 lysates of resting platelets (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kralisz and Cierniewski, 1998</xref>). In another study, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dorahy et al. (1995)</xref> detected association of Src (and Lyn) with Î±IIbÎ²3, but only in the presence of a cell-permeable chemical cross-linker which simultaneously activated the platelets. Our ability to detect Src, Fyn, and Yes in Î±IIbÎ²3 immunoprecipitates without cross-linkers reflects differences in the conditions used for platelet preparation and analysis. Although we did not analyze Î±IIbÎ²3 immunoprecipitates for all Src family members expressed in platelets, these results indicate that Src associates with and is regulated by Î±IIbÎ²3, and this functional relationship may extend to some other Src family members.</p>
      <p>These studies do not resolve whether the association of Src with Î±IIbÎ²3 is direct or indirect. Several proteins are capable of binding directly to the cytoplasmic tails of Î±IIb or Î²3 in vitro, and one of these might serve to link Src to Î±IIbÎ²3 in platelets (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shattil et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2001</xref>). FAK and Syk warrant discussion in this regard. FAK can bind to peptides derived from integrin Î² tails (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Schaller et al., 1995</xref>), and we found it to be associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 in platelet lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, when FAK becomes auto-phosphorylated at Tyr-397 in adherent fibroblasts, it forms a bimolecular complex with Src (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guan, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Polte and Hanks, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Schaller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schaller, 2001</xref>). However, a FAKâSrc complex cannot mediate the interaction we observed between Î±IIbÎ²3 and Src in platelets because, in contrast to FAK activation, the Î±IIbÎ²3/Src association was neither adhesion-dependent nor inhibited by cytochalasin D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). Syk is also unlikely to serve as a necessary link between Src and Î±IIbÎ²3 because it coprecipitated with the integrin only after platelet adhesion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), even in Syk-null platelets (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Woodside et al., 2001</xref>). The precise mode of interaction between Î±IIbÎ²3 and Src remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>How does fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3 lead to activation of Src? Src is stabilized in an inactive conformation by intramolecular interactions of the SH2 domain with pTyr-529 and the SH3 domain with a polyproline helix in the SH2 kinase linker region (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2001</xref>). Tyr-529 is likely maintained in the phosphorylated state by Csk (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Latour and Veillette, 2001</xref>), a kinase that was associated with Î±IIbÎ²3 in nonadherent platelets. Fibrinogen interaction with platelets resulted in the dissociation of Csk (but not Src) from Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), suggesting that Src may become activated at integrin adhesion sites following its physical separation from Csk. This idea is consistent with the localization of activated Src to filopodia and edges of fibrinogen-adherent platelets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), and with the observation that only the integrin-associated pool of Src became activated in such platelets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In T lymphocytes, the proximity of Csk to Src kinases is influenced by specific transmembrane proteins, such as PAG/Cbp, which are enriched in lipid rafts and bind Csk when tyrosine-phosphorylated (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brdicka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kawabuchi et al., 2000</xref>). PAG/Cbp is also present in platelets (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2001</xref>), but additional studies will be required to determine if it is involved in regulating the association of Csk with Î±IIbÎ²3. Fibrinogen binding to platelets might also activate Src by influencing the localization or activity of a protein tyrosine phosphatase that can dephosphorylate Src Tyr-529. Three such phosphatases have been implicated in integrin signaling in other cell types, including receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase-Î±, PTP-1B, and SHP-2 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>). In theory, Src might also be subject to regulation in platelets by proteins within nascent adhesion sites that engage the Src SH2 or SH3 domains (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The results with PP2 and SU6656 strongly suggest that Î±IIbÎ²3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and platelet spreading on fibrinogen are controlled by an Src kinase. The defect in spreading of murine platelets lacking Src, Fgr, Hck, and Lyn confirms this assessment, and the normal spreading of platelets lacking Fgr, Hck, and Lyn suggests that Src itself plays a dominant role. However, the current studies do not exclude the involvement of other Src family members in specific phases of outside-in signaling.</p>
      <p>PP2 and SU6656 blocked adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the Rac exchange factors, Vav1 and Vav3, and the molecular adaptor, SLP-76, all of which have been implicated in cytoskeletal regulation downstream of integrins in hematopoietic cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cichowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Moores et al., 2000</xref>). Since these proteins are direct substrates of Syk, the results imply that Src kinases lie upstream of Syk in an Î±IIbÎ²3 pathway, possibly directly upstream. Although not studied, other substrates of Src kinases and Syk, such as cortactin and tubulin, might also couple Î±IIbÎ²3 to cytoskeletal events (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gallet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Faruki et al., 2000</xref>). Unlike Syk activation by immune response receptors that contain ITAM domains, Î±IIbÎ²3 activation of Syk is ITAM-independent (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Woodside et al., 2001</xref>). Based on the current results, we speculate that fibrinogen binding to platelets induces clustering of Î±IIbÎ²3 complexes, leading to activation of Src kinases, interaction of Syk with the cytoplasmic tail of Î²3, and activation of Syk by the Src kinases. Activation of additional Syk molecules might then proceed by autophosphorylation in trans.</p>

<sup>â</sup> mouse platelets have a very subtle defect in agonist-induced fibrinogen binding (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Law et al., 1999</xref>), and a profound defect in aggregation induced by collagen (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Watson and Gibbins, 1998</xref>). These abnormalities cannot explain the spreading defect we observed in fibrinogen-adherent <italic>syk</italic>

<sup>â</sup> platelets (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) because no agonists were added in this experiment, and agonists are not required for platelet attachment to immobilized fibrinogen via Î±IIbÎ²3 (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Savage et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Law et al., 1999</xref>). By the same token, neither Src nor Syk were required for agonist enhancement of platelet spreading on fibrinogen (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Like platelets, Syk-deficient neutrophils exhibit defective integrin-dependent responses, such as the respiratory burst (unpublished data).</p>
      <p>Although integrins and Src kinases are ubiquitous, Syk was thought until recently to be confined to hematopoietic cells. However, Syk is more widely distributed and may regulate the anchorage-dependent growth of epithelial and endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Coopman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Inatome et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Tsujimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, Syk can interact with integrin Î²1 and Î²2 tails as well as Î²3 (Woodside, D., and M. Ginsberg, personal communication), and our preliminary studies indicate that Src is associated with Î²1 integrins in platelets. Consequently, some of the functions attributable to Syk in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells may require coordinated interactions between integrins, Src, and Syk. Thus, the paradigm delineated here for initiation of outside-in Î±IIbÎ²3 signaling in platelets may be relevant to integrins in a variety of biological contexts.</p>

        <title>Interactions of platelets with fibrinogen</title>
        <p>Washed human platelets were obtained from fresh, anticoagulated whole blood and resuspended to 3 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml in a platelet incubation buffer (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Leng et al., 1998</xref>). To test the effects of soluble fibrinogen binding to Î±IIbÎ²3, platelets were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 250 Î¼g/ml fibrinogen in the presence or absence of 0.5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> (to activate integrins) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bazzoni and Hemler, 1998</xref>) and 2 mM RGDS (to block fibrinogen binding). Platelets were then sedimented at 180 g for 5 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and inhibitors (1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, 0.5 mM leupeptin, 0.25 mg/ml Pefabloc, 100 Î¼g/ml aprotinin). Lysates were routinely clarified by sedimentation at 10,000 rpm in a 4Â° microcentrifuge, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Identical results were obtained if lysates were clarified at 100,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. For studies of platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, 100 mm bacterial tissue culture plates were precoated with 5 mg/ml BSA or 100 Î¼g/ml fibrinogen (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Haimovich et al., 1993</xref>). After blocking with heat-denatured BSA, 4.5 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> platelets in 1.5 ml were added and incubated for the indicated periods of time at 37Â°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Nonadherent cells from the BSA plates were sedimented at 10,000 rpm for 3 s in a microcentrifuge and lysed immediately. Platelets adherent to fibrinogen were gently rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on the plates directly and processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.</p>
        <p>For studies of mouse platelets, anticoagulated mouse blood was obtained by cardiac puncture (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Judd et al., 2000</xref>). Platelet preparation and experimental procedures were similar to those with human platelets.</p>

Adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with primary and FITC- or Texas redâconjugated secondary antibodies as indicated. Rhodamine-phalloidin was used to stain F-actin. Single images were acquired with a Leica fluorescence microscope equipped with a laser scanning confocal system (MRC 1024; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop. Surface areas of at least 100 platelets per sample were measured using Image-Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.).
