        <p>Cep152 interacts with the cryptic Polo-box of Plk4 and is required for Plk4-induced centriole overduplication.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Both gain and loss of function studies have identified the Polo-like kinase Plk4/Sak as a crucial regulator of centriole biogenesis, but the mechanisms governing centrosome duplication are incompletely understood. In this study, we show that the pericentriolar material protein, Cep152, interacts with the distinctive cryptic Polo-box of Plk4 via its N-terminal domain and is required for Plk4-induced centriole overduplication. Reduction of endogenous Cep152 levels results in a failure in centriole duplication, loss of centrioles, and formation of monopolar mitotic spindles. Interfering with Cep152 function prevents recruitment of Plk4 to the centrosome and promotes loss of CPAP, a protein required for the control of centriole length in Plk4-regulated centriole biogenesis. Our results suggest that Cep152 recruits Plk4 and CPAP to the centrosome to ensure a faithful centrosome duplication process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The centrosome is the primary microtubule-organizing center of an animal cell that consists of two centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007</xref>). Centrosomes duplicate once per cell cycle, which involves the growing of procentrioles (daughter centrioles) orthogonally to each of the two parental centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nigg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strnad and GÃ¶nczy, 2008</xref>). In early mitosis, the two centrosomes separate and participate in mitotic spindle pole formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinchcliffe and Sluder, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, there is a correlation between excess centrosomes, aneuploidy, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nigg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>). Extra centrosomes generate chromosomal instability by exacerbating erroneous attachments of chromosomes to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>), which may contribute to cancer progression. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing centrosome duplication may provide insights into both normal cell behavior and tumorigenesis.</p>
      <p>Centriole formation is triggered by a conserved kinase, Plk4 (SAK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of Plk4 in human cells induces a cascade, including hsSas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>), CPAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), Cep135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohta et al., 2002</xref>), Î³-tubulin, and CP110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>) that are required at different stages of procentriole formation. Plk4 also induces de novo centriole formation and amplification of centrioles, leading to tumorigenesis in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basto et al., 2008</xref>). Plk4<sup>+/â</sup> mice develop spontaneous liver and lung tumors, suggesting that reduced Plk4 gene dosage increases the probability of mitotic errors and cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ko et al., 2005</xref>). Recent data suggest that restricting centriole duplication to once per cell cycle is regulated by the F-box protein Slimb, which mediates proteolytic degradation of SAK in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>). In human cells, an autoregulatory feedback loop places Plk4 stability under direct control of its own activity and may form an important mechanism to limit normal centriole duplication to once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holland et al., 2010</xref>). Although Plk4 function is crucial for the regulation of centriole formation, the underlying mechanisms remain scarce.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>To identify proteins that bind to Plk4, we prepared centrosome-enriched fractions from KE37 cells by sucrose gradients followed by biochemical pull-down assays with extracts derived from KI-extracted centrioles and recombinant double-tagged Plk4 (N-terminal zz tag and C-terminal His tag) as bait. Mass spectrometrical analysis of eluted binding partners identified Cep152, a so far poorly characterized protein. Cep152 is the human orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blachon et al., 2008</xref>) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Asterless protein, a centriolar component required for centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Varmark et al., 2007</xref>), and has been previously identified in a proteomic screen for centrosomal proteins in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>). To verify binding between Plk4 and Cep152, we first performed pull-down assays. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> shows an in vitro interaction between maltose-binding protein (MBP)âPlk4 and in vitroâtranslated [<sup>35</sup>S]Cep152. These results suggest that the binding of Plk4 to Cep152 is direct. To further characterize the interaction between both proteins, we have generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Cep152. Ab1140 was selected for Western blotting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201007107/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>), and Ab26 was selected for immunofluorescence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201007107/DC1">Fig. S3 D</ext-link>). Ab26 did not detect endogenous Cep152 in total cell extracts but recognizes overexpressed Cep152 (Fig. S1 B) and in centrosome-enriched fractions (Fig. S1 C). To analyze the interaction in vivo, we generated rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal Plk4 antibodies that detect endogenous Plk4 (Fig. S1 D) and asked whether complexes between Plk4 and Cep152 could be detected in vivo. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, endogenous Plk4 was present in Cep152 immunoprecipitates. In addition, interactions between ectopically produced Myc-Plk4 and GFP-Cep152 that were coexpressed in 293T cells could also be detected in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These results demonstrate that Plk4 and Cep152 stably associate, confirming our initial findings based on mass spectrometry. In contrast to other Polo-like kinase family members, the Polo-box (PB) domain of Plk4 exhibits only a single PB, and the structural basis for its interaction with its binding partners is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, Plk4 contains a cryptic PB that is required for its localization to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>). To study the interaction in more detail, we mapped the binding sites between Plk4 and Cep152. We found that a fragment comprising the cryptic PB of Plk4 (aa 581â879) is required for binding to Cep152, whereas an interaction with the PB itself could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These results indicate that the interaction mechanism of Plk4 with its binding partners is distinct from Plk1, which requires both PBs for phospho-dependent substrate targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elia et al., 2003b</xref>).</p>

      <p>To analyze the centrosomal localization of Cep152, we performed colocalization experiments with centrin-2, a centriolar marker, and found that the major fraction of Cep152 localized around the centriole, and only a minor part colocalized with centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Immunoelectron microscopy was used to obtain more definitive insights into the localization of Cep152. We observed that endogenous Cep152 localizes to the PCM cloud embedding the outer wall at the proximal ends of the centriole but that it was not found in the centriolar lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Moreover, endogenous Cep152 partially colocalized with Plk4. We detected a symmetrical localization of Plk4 to centrioles, whereas Cep152 staining was more asymmetrical, exhibiting a stronger signal around one of the two centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Upon analysis of Cep152 in an interphase stage and during different stages of mitosis, we found that Cep152 was always localized to centrosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201007107/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Analysis of the expression pattern of Cep152 in U2OS cells reveals that Cep152 protein levels are low in mitosis but gradually increase during late G1 until S/G2 (Fig. S2, B and C). Despite the lower expression of Cep152 during mitosis, the protein still localizes to the mitotic centrosome but to a lesser extent (Fig. S2 D).</p>

      <p>To determine whether centriole reduplication in S phaseâarrested U2OS cells required the presence of Cep152, the protein was down-regulated by specific siRNAs (O1 and O2). As Cdk2 activity is required for centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinchcliffe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lacey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meraldi et al., 1999</xref>), Cdk2 siRNAs were used as a positive control. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, ablation of Cep152 function interfered with centriole reduplication. Next, we analyzed whether down-regulation of Cep152 also plays a role in the unperturbed centrosome cycle in U2OS cells. Because a reduction in centriole numbers was expected to produce the most striking phenotypes during cell division, we focused our analysis on mitotic cells in the siRNA-treated populations. 72 h after Cep152 depletion, &gt;20â25% of the mitotic cells displayed monopolar spindles in comparison with 4% in control cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Cep152 contains eight predicted coiled-coil regions (Fig. S3 A). Mapping of the region in Cep152 that binds to Plk4 reveals that a fragment comprising the first three coiled-coil regions (aa 1â512) is sufficient for binding to Plk4 (Fig. S3 A). Interestingly, although Cep152 binds to Plk4 via its N-terminal region (fragment Cep152 1â512), the region that confers centrosomal localization of Cep152 is distinct and located at its C terminus (Fig. S3 B). We also found that overexpression of the Cep152 N-terminal fragment exhibits a dominant-negative effect and therefore interferes with centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that expression of the dominant-negative Cep152 1â512 fragment prevents Plk4 localization at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These data implicate that an interaction between these proteins might be essential for centrosomal recruitment of Plk4.</p>

      <p>To address whether Cep152 is required for Plk4-induced centrosome overduplication, we generated an HA-Plk4âoverexpressing HeLa cell line under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter. Plk4 was induced through addition of doxycycline, and this resulted in a multiplication of Î³-tubulinâpositive dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Simultaneous down-regulation of Cep152 by siRNAs clearly interfered with Plk4-induced centrosome reduplication by abrogating the reduplication phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The ability of Plk4 to induce the formation of multiple centrioles is regulated during the cell cycle. Cells that are synchronized and held at the G1/S transition respond to Plk4 induction by the formation of flower-like centriolar structures (Fig. S3 C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>). Down-regulation of Cep152 levels by siRNA leads to a reduction of flowers, as shown by centrin or CP110 stainings. This reveals that the formation of Plk4-induced flower-like structures is dependent on Cep152 (Fig. S3 C). Next, we asked whether the centrosomal localization of Plk4 may be dependent on Cep152 and vice versa. Using Plk4-specific antibodies, we found that Plk4 was still detectable at the centrosome during the gradual knockdown of Cep152 (Fig. S3 D). These data suggest that the maintenance of Plk4 at the centrosome is not dependent on functional Cep152. Plk4 siRNA expression shows that centrosomal binding of Cep152 was also independent of Plk4 (Fig. S3 D). To find out whether the recruitment of newly synthesized Plk4 to the centrosome was impaired by the absence of Cep152, we again made use of the Plk4-inducible HeLa cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) and found that the recruitment of newly synthesized Plk4 to the centrosome was severely impaired when Cep152 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), although overall levels of induced Plk4 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). To address the involvement of Cep152 in the dynamics of Plk4 recruitment to the centrosome, FRAP was performed with U2OS cells transiently expressing GFP-Plk4 for a short time. Cells were treated with GL2 or Cep152 siRNAs 60 h before the plasmid DNA transfections. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, for both GL2- and Cep152-siRNA treated cells, Plk4 recovery reached a plateau after â¼70 s with a total intensity of â¼20% of the prebleaching value. These data indicate the presence of rapidly exchanging (â¼20%) and static pools (â¼80%) of Plk4 on the centrosome. Interestingly, the rate of fluorescence recovery on the centrosome was partially impaired in cells down-regulated for Cep152. The mean <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of Cep152 siRNA-treated cells was calculated to be 17.4 s, whereas the mean <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for GL2-transfected cells was 11.2 s. This may imply that Plk4 exchanges between centrosomal and noncentrosomal pools with slower kinetics in the absence (or partial loss) of Cep152. Thus, Cep152 might function as a protein that recruits Plk4 to the centrosome, thus facilitating centrosome duplication.</p>

      <p>The canonical pathway of centriole biogenesis has been previously described in exquisite detail at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Strnad and GÃ¶nczy, 2008</xref>). Several human centrosomal proteins indispensable for Plk4-dependent procentriole formation have been identified and include hsSas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>), CPAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), CP110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>), and Cep135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohta et al., 2002</xref>). To identify the role of Cep152 in this pathway, Cep152 was down-regulated by siRNA, and the centrosomal localization of these proteins was analyzed. We find that the localization of hsSas6, CP110, or Cep135 is not impaired by Cep152 siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). However, we cannot rule out that hsSas6, CP110, or Cep135 stably associated with centrioles before Cep152 depletion, similar to our observation with Plk4 localization. Interestingly, we observed that the SAS-4ârelated protein CPAP, which is required for centrosome duplication and controls centriole length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), did not localize to centrioles upon Cep152 down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Therefore, the localization of Cep152 at the centrosome is crucial for centrosomal recruitment or maintenance of CPAP. To further confirm the link between Cep152 and CPAP, we analyzed the localization of these proteins within the flower-like structure upon overexpression of Plk4 in colocalizations with the centriolar marker centrin-2 and Plk4 itself. Intriguingly, Cep152 exhibited a similar localization that was described for CPAP, namely a staining around parental centrioles and in between the nascent procentrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Next, we asked whether Cep152 could interact with CPAP and found complexes between GFP-Cep152 and Flag-CPAP after coexpression in 293T cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Mapping of the region in Cep152 that binds to CPAP led to the finding that residues 513â1,074 of Cep152 are necessary for the interaction with CPAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Thus, Cep152 seems to form a scaffold with distinct regions for Plk4 and CPAP interactions and for centrosomal localization.</p>

      <p>In summary, our data identify the centriolar protein Cep152, a protein involved in centriole duplication, as a novel Plk4-binding protein and the first binding partner to interact with the cryptic PB of Plk4. Cep152 partially colocalizes with Plk4 around the centrioles and is required for Plk4-induced centriole overduplication. Therefore, Cep152 is a critical component of the Plk4-dependent centriole assembly pathway, as Plk4 cannot trigger centriole duplication in the absence of Cep152 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Cep152 localization to the centrosome is also crucial for recruitment of CPAP to the centrosome. It is conceivable that the interaction between Plk4 and Cep152 might facilitate the recruitment of other components, such as CPAP, to trigger centriole duplication. Interestingly, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al. (2010)</xref> suggests that CPAP might be a physiological substrate of Plk4. Together, Cep152 seems to regulate the recruitment of Plk4 to the centrosome and the maintenance of CPAP at this structure.</p>
      <p>The 3D structure of Plk4 suggests a binding mechanism different from Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leung et al., 2002</xref>). The Plk1 PB binds to target proteins after their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elia et al., 2003a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">b</xref>). However, the interaction of Plk4 and Cep152 occurs through its single cryptic PB in the absence of phosphorylation, although we currently cannot exclude that a phosphorylation event might regulate this interaction. In conclusion, our findings provide important mechanistic insights into the process of procentriole assembly, implicating Cep152 as a critical component in Plk4-induced procentriole formation.</p>

FRAP was performed on a spinning-disc confocal unit (PerkinElmer) fitted on an inverted microscope (TE2000; Nikon) using a 100Ã NA 1.0 oil objective. A square region of interest (ROI) of 80 Ã 80 pixels centered on unsplit centrosomes was bleached with 40 iterations and 100% laser power (488-nm argon laser). Two images were taken before bleaching with a 2-s interval. An image was taken every 1.5 s (488-nm argon laser at 4% power) after bleaching for the six initial recordings and then every 3 s over a 100â120-s period. For each time point, images of four z stacks of 0.5 Âµm optical section spacing were collected; the highest intensity recording of these four images was regarded as the in-focus intensity of the ROI. Centrosomes with excessive z-axis movements that get out of the focal range by the end of the recording time were excluded from the analysis. Fluorescence intensity of the photobleached ROI was determined using Volocity FRAP image acquisition software. For processing and correction of time-lapse data, a standard algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999</xref>) was used as follows: I<sub>c</sub> = scaling factor Ã ([I<sub>r</sub> â I<sub>b</sub>]/[I<sub>f</sub> â I<sub>b</sub>]), where I<sub>c</sub> is the corrected image, I<sub>r</sub> is the noncorrected raw object fluorescent intensity, I<sub>b</sub> is the background fluorescent intensity outside of the cells, I<sub>f</sub> is the bright reference of the fluorescent intensity of a cluster of cells, and the scaling factor is the brightest pixel value in the bright reference image (after subtraction of the I<sub>b</sub>).
