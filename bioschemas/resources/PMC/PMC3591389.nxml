      <abstract>
        <p>Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) catalyses the synthesis of cyclic GMP in response to nitric oxide. The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous Î± and Î² subunits, each of which is composed of multiple domains. We present here crystal structures of a heterodimer of the catalytic domains of the Î± and Î² subunits, as well as an inactive homodimer of Î² subunits. This first structure of a metazoan, heteromeric cyclase provides several observations. First, the structures resemble known structures of adenylate cyclases and other guanylate cyclases in overall fold and in the arrangement of conserved active-site residues, which are contributed by both subunits at the interface. Second, the subunit interaction surface is promiscuous, allowing both homodimeric and heteromeric association; the preference of the full-length enzyme for heterodimer formation must derive from the combined contribution of other interaction interfaces. Third, the heterodimeric structure is in an inactive conformation, but can be superposed onto an active conformation of adenylate cyclase by a structural transition involving a 26Â° rigid-body rotation of the Î± subunit. In the modelled active conformation, most active site residues in the subunit interface are precisely aligned with those of adenylate cyclase. Finally, the modelled active conformation also reveals a cavity related to the active site by pseudo-symmetry. The pseudosymmetric site lacks key active site residues, but may bind allosteric regulators in a manner analogous to the binding of forskolin to adenylate cyclase. This indicates the possibility of developing a new class of small-molecule modulators of guanylate cyclase activity targeting the catalytic domain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Soluble guanylate cyclases (sGC) (EC 4.6.1.2) are nitric oxide (NO) sensors which, when activated, catalyse the conversion of GTP to the second messenger cGMP. The downstream signals propagated through cGMP are varied and include peristalsis of the gut, vascular smooth muscle tone and blood pressure, aortic relaxation, brain development and platelet aggregation <xref rid="pone.0057644-Poulos1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. cGMP is also produced by particulate guanylate cyclases, which are transmembrane receptors responding to hormones other than NO.</p>
      <p>In mammals, four isoforms of sGC subunits have been identified so far: Î±1, Î±2, Ã1 and Ã2. <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> encodes the Ã1 subunit of sGC which can form heterodimers with either of the Î± subunits <xref rid="pone.0057644-Mergia1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. <italic>GUCY1A3</italic> encodes the Î±1 subunit (sGCÎ± and sGCÎ² denote the protein subunits of soluble guanylate cyclase encoded by the <italic>GUCY1A3</italic> and <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> genes; sGCÎ±cat and sGCÎ²cat denote the isolated catalytic domains. AC-C1 and AC-C2 are the two catalytic domains of mammalian adenylate cyclase, which are the equivalent of sGCÎ±cat and sGCÎ²cat, respectively). The predominant complex is the Î±1/Ã1 dimer, which is ubiquitously expressed, with highest levels of mRNA in brain, lung, heart, kidney, spleen and muscle <xref rid="pone.0057644-Russwurm1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Mergia2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The phenotype of <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> knockout mice confirms the central role of this gene in many physiological processes. Mice die 3â4 weeks after birth with pronounced elevation in arterial blood pressure and impaired NO-induced relaxation. Mice have severe gastrointestinal dysfunction with intestinal dysmotility. In addition knockout mice showed reduced nociceptive behavior in models of inflammatory or neuropathic pain <xref rid="pone.0057644-Friebe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Schmidtko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>GUCY1A3</italic> and <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> has also been reported in some glioma cell lines and is linked to neo-vascularisation in these tumors <xref rid="pone.0057644-Saino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is important to note, that although the active form of sGC in mammals is a heterodimer, in lower organisms (e.g. nematodes, algae, and insects) active homodimers, active heterodimers and even one case of an inactive heterodimer have been reported <xref rid="pone.0057644-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Fitzpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Morton2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Each sGC subunit is a multi-domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). An N-terminal haem-binding domain in sGCÎ² is termed H-NOX. The corresponding domain in the Î± subunit cannot bind haem and is denoted H-NOB. The H-NOX serves as a sensor of NO which binds to the prosthetic haem group, inducing a conformational change which propagates the signal and results in greatly increased cGMP production by sGC <xref rid="pone.0057644-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Ignarro1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. PAS-like domains in both subunits are thought to influence the preference of mammalian sGC for heterodimer formation <xref rid="pone.0057644-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Further downstream, a predicted coiled-coil bundle is followed by the C-terminal catalytic domains, where the GTP binding and conversion takes place.</p>

The native enzyme is a heterodimer of Î± and Î² subunits (encoded by GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3, respectively), with interaction interfaces spread across the PAS, CC and cyclase catalytic domains. The catalytic domains associate in a head to tail orientation; conserved residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis are distributed between the two subunits. B. A list of conserved active-site residues in guanylate cyclase (sGCÎ± and Î²) and in the chimeric adenylate cyclase (AC-V C1 domain and AC-II C2 domain).

      <p>sGC belongs to the class III purine nucleotidyl cyclase family, along with adenylate cyclases (AC), which perform an analogous function of converting ATP to the second messenger cAMP. Both AC and GC catalytic domains share a basic core of secondary structure elements that dimerise to form a wreath-like structure. The active sites of both adenylate and guanylate cyclases lie at the interface between the two homologous subunits or subdomains, and comprise residues from both subunits. In the homodimeric sGC of lower organisms, there could be in principle two symmetry-related active sites. However, in the active conformation, only one site is arranged to accommodate a substrate. In heteromeric cyclases such as human sGC and AC, the active site contains all the residues required for substrate recognition and catalysis. The pseudosymmetry-related cavity, which lacks key catalytic residues, has been suggested as a regulatory site <xref rid="pone.0057644-Yazawa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Lamothe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and is the site of action of the AC activator forskolin <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Whisnant1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Guanylate cyclase is a major drug target as it is the main receptor for vasodilating NO-releasing compounds, which have been used for over 100 years in the treatment of coronary heart disease and angina pectoris. There are two drugs currently in late drug development, Riociguat and Cinaciguat, both developed by Bayer. They are classified as sGC stimulators and activators, respectively, working by binding at the haem binding domain of the Ã subunit of sGC <xref rid="pone.0057644-Surmeli1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Mitrovic1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition to these two drugs and the large number of small molecule progenitors which led up to them over the course of several decades, only two chemically related sGC inhibitors are currently under investigation, namely ODQ <xref rid="pone.0057644-Garthwaite1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and NS-2028 <xref rid="pone.0057644-Morbidelli1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Olesen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These molecules are also thought to act by oxidation and desensitisation of the heam group to NO. A growing body of evidence has implicated sGC as a player in the angiogenesis pathway <xref rid="pone.0057644-Saino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Morbidelli1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Pyriochou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Kajiya1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Majumder1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, a popular pathway to drug in the inhibition of tumor vascularisation <xref rid="pone.0057644-Amini1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and to combat diabetic retinopathy <xref rid="pone.0057644-Crawford1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Jeganathan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. An as-yet unexploited avenue for pharmaceutical development would be targeting the catalytic domain for activation or inhibition. With this consideration, the atomic structure of sGC catalytic domain (sGCcat) molecule would therefore be extremely desirable with a view towards rational drug design.</p>
      <p>Despite a great deal of research on mammalian sGC over the past three decades, all structural analysis is derived from modeling based on structures of other nucleotidyl cyclases. Published structures of guanylate cyclases include homodimeric enzymes of the single-celled green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> with a primary sequence identity of 39% and 41% to the human Î± and Ã sGCcat, respectively; and the homodimeric sGCcat (which has concurrent AC activity) from the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis PCC6803</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0057644-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which is 22% identical to the human alpha and beta sGCcat. The only heterodimeric structures are of adenylate cyclases, all of which are a non-natural hybrid of domains from the AC2 and AC5 proteins (Protein Data Bank ID: 1CS4 <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 3C14 <xref rid="pone.0057644-Mou1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 2GVZ <xref rid="pone.0057644-Mou2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, 1AZS <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 1CJU <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We present here two structures of human sGC catalytic domains. The first is a homodimeric form of sGCÃcat. The second is a heterodimeric form of sGCÎ±cat and sGCÎ²cat. We discuss the catalytic properties of sGCcat and compare structures of ACcat and sGCcat to indicate probable mechanisms and domain motion during catalysis. Finally we discuss these structures in terms of further research and drug development opportunities.</p>

        <p>DNAs encoding human guanylate cyclase were designed and synthesized with a codon distribution optimized for expression in E. coli (Codon Devices). The catalytic domain of GUCY1A3 (aa 468â690) was inserted into vector pNH-TrxT (GenBank:GU269914) using ligation-independent cloning <xref rid="pone.0057644-Savitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>; this generates a fusion protein with an N-terminal his<sub>6</sub>-tagged thioredoxin gene followed by a TEV protease cleavage site. The catalytic domain of GUCY1B3 (aa 408â619) was cloned into vector pNIC-CTHF (GenBank: EF199844), which generates a fusion protein with a C-terminal TEV cleavage site followed by a his<sub>6</sub> and Flag tag.</p>
        <p>A construct of GUCY1B3 with the amino acid substitutions G476C, C541S was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The nucleotide sequences of the expression constructs of GUCY1A3, GUCY1B3, and the GUCY1B3- G476C/C541S mutant are deposited with GenBank accession numbers JX420281, JX420283, and JX420282, respectively.</p>

Bacterial host cells bearing either <italic>GUCY1A3</italic> or <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> were grown in Terrific Broth at 37Â°C to OD<sup>600</sup> of 1; expression of the chaperone proteins was then induced with 0.2% L-arabinose for 1 hour. The cultures were then transferred to 18Â°C, and after one hour IPTG was added to 0.5 mM. Growth was continued overnight.</p>
        <p>sGCÃ was purified as described <xref rid="pone.0057644-Savitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> by Ni-affinity purification followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column, which resulted in separation of most of the dimeric sGC protein from the co-expressed chaperones and other host proteins. Further purification was achieved by cleaving the tag with TEV protease; the protease and other impurities were removed by passing through Ni-IDA column (Generon). The protein was then concentrated to 12 mg/ml.</p>
        <p>For purification of heterodimers of sGCÎ± and mutant sGCÎ² <sup>G476C/C541S</sup>, the two proteins were expressed separately as described above. The cell pellets were combined and lysed together by sonication; all buffers were prepared without reducing agents. Following affinity purification on NiNTA, the eluted proteins were combined with TEV protease in a dialysis tubing (30 kDa cutoff) and dialyzed overnight against affinity buffer <xref rid="pone.0057644-Savitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The protease and other impurities were removed by passage through a Ni-IDA column; the sGC protein was then purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75) equilibrated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol. The heterodimers were diluted 15-fold with 25 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 5-ml Q XL column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated in buffer A (25 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mM NaCl), the protein was loaded at 4 ml/min, and eluted with a 200-ml gradient to buffer B (25 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1.0 M NaCl). A main peak eluting around 270 mM NaCl contained both subunits; a minor peak, containing only sGCÎ±, eluted at lower salt.</p>
        <p>Fractions containing the heterodimer were pooled, exchanged to 25 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, and concentrated to 16 mg/ml.</p>

        <p>The full-length guanylate cyclase (sGC) protein forms a heterodimer of the homologous Î±1 and Î²1 subunits, encoded by the <italic>GUCY1A3</italic> and <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> genes, respectively. The domain organization is depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g001">fig. 1A</xref>. Mutational and structural studies indicate that the subunits interact through several distinct interfaces, including the PAS and coiled-coil regions as well as the catalytic domains. In the current study we have expressed the catalytic domains, attempting to generate active heterodimers for crystallization. As reported by others, the isolated catalytic domains of the Î±1 and Ã1 subunits of human sGC associate predominantly as homodimers of either Î± or Ã subunits, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Neither homodimer has significant cyclase activity; however, when mixing the subunits there is an exchange with the heterodimeric form, as evidenced by the appearance of guanylate cyclase activity (ref. <xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057644-t002">table 2</xref>). The homodimer of catalytic domains of the Ã subunits crystallizes readily, but we have been unable to generate crystals of the heterodimer, possibly because of the co-existence of heterodimers and Î² homodimers. Based on the crystal structure of the Ã homodimer and modeling of an Î±/Ã dimer structure, we attempted to stabilize the heterodimeric form by engineering an S-S bond between the Î± and Ã subunits. This involved introducing a cysteine residue in position 476<sup>Ã</sup>, which was predicted to lie close to Cys595<sup>Î±</sup> in the Î± subunit (in the following text, residues in the Î± and Î² subunits are indicated by a superscript following the number). Cys541<sup>Ã</sup>, which is in the position homologous to Cys595<sup>Î±</sup>, was changed to Ser to prevent S-S bonds forming in the Ã homodimer. As a result of these changes, we have been able to purify the Î±/Î² heterodimer as the predominant form after mixing the separately-expressed subunits. However, as reported earlier for the full-length protein <xref rid="pone.0057644-Sunahara1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Friebe2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, the C541<sup>Î²</sup>S mutation is detrimental for activity.</p>

        <p>We describe here two crystal structures. The 1.63 Ã crystal structure of the sGCÎ²cat homodimer consists of residues 413â610 with some disorder at 440â441, where the structure was not modeled due to lack of electron density. The 2.08 Ã structure of the Î±1/Ã1 heterodimer consists of <italic>GUCY1A3</italic> residues 470â661 and <italic>GUCY1B3</italic> residues 413â608, with two engineered mutations in the Ã1 subunit, G476<sup>Ã</sup> C and C541<sup>Ã</sup> S.</p>
        <p>The homodimer and the heterodimer have a very similar fold and subunit interactions. The subunits come together to form a head-to-tail, wreath-like dimer, characteristic of adenylate cyclase <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and the other sGC <xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g002">figs. 2A, B</xref>). The structures of the Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g002">fig. 2C</xref>) and Ã subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g002">fig. 2D</xref>) are highly similar. The monomers consist of a seven-stranded, Ã-sheet core, surrounded by five alpha-helices, which were denoted as per the convention of adenylate and guanylate cyclase structures <xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The main structural elements are the same or very similar in length and organization, with only subtle but possibly very important differences (see below). In particular, the Î± subunit features an extended Î²4âÎ²5 hairpin which, in the heterodimer structure, points away from the Î² subunit; this is in contrast with other cyclase structures, in which the hairpin is involved in interdomain contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). PISA <xref rid="pone.0057644-Krissinel1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> analysis of the interfaces of both homo- and heteo-dimer crystal structures report complexation significance score (CSS), a measure of predicted physiological relevance, as 1.000, indicating that the interface should be physiologically relevant. The buried surface area of the homodimer is 1454 Ã<sup>2</sup> while that of the heterodimer is 1283 Ã<sup>2</sup>. Interestingly, the two cysteins (C476<sup>Î²</sup> and C595<sup>Î±</sup>) that were expected to form a disulfide bridge are not linked in the crystal structure, although they are positioned in a distance that could allow an S-S bond. Since the introduction of C476<sup>Î²</sup> resulted in the formation of stable heterodimers in solution, it is possible that an S-S bond may have broken during crystallization or data collection.</p>

        <title>Structural transitions</title>
        <p>It has been proposed that class III nucleotidyl cyclases undergo a substrate-induced structural transition into a catalytically active âclosedâ state <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Sinha2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Upon substrate binding the Î± subunit (or its equivalent C1 domain of adenylate cyclase) rotates and translocates around the centre of the heterodimer, causing helix Î±1of the Î± subunit to move towards helix Î±4 of the Ã subunit (C2 domain of AC), âclosingâ the structure and bringing the catalytic residues into the effective positions for nucleotide cyclization.</p>
        <p>The structure of the substrate-free sGC heterodimer presented here appears to be in an inactive open conformation, as is the chlamydomonas sGC structure <xref rid="pone.0057644-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Comparing the open conformation of the chlamydomonas structure with the closed conformation of the cyanobacteria homodimeric sGC shows a similar level of domain rotation 7â8Â° <xref rid="pone.0057644-Winger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, aligning the subunits of the human sGC with the active adenylate cyclase structure requires a significantly larger rotation of approximately 26Â°, indicating that the conformational changes are more pronounced for human sGC.</p>
        <p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows details of the presumed transition between the crystal structure and the modeled active conformation. The 26Â° rigid-body rotation of the Î± subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) involves movements of up to 10 Ã in the positions of individual residues. For example, helix Î±1 (sGCÎ±) shifts 7 Ã in the direction of its N-terminal, towards helix Î±4 of sGCÃ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Another specific shift is a movement of the Ã2âÃ3 loop of sGCÎ±, which contains the catalytic residue D530; This side chain retracts towards the position of the corresponding residue (D440) of AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

        <p>As discussed above, the crystal structure of the Î±/Î² heterodimer is in a conformation that is likely to be inactive. To analyze the locations of the active-site residues in a subunit arrangement that is more similar to the active conformation of adenylate cyclases, the sGC Î± and Î² subunits were separately superposed onto the C1 and C2 domains of an adenylate cyclase structure in the ATP-bound conformation (PDB ID:1CJK) <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tesmer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Six of the eight residues are highly conserved between various AC and sGC variants.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> presents the location of the conserved residues in the aligned structures of AC and the rearranged sGC, surrounding the ATP and metal ions from the AC structure. Aspartates in positions 1 and 3 (residues D486 and D530 of the sGCÎ± subunit) are essential for metal coordination. The electron density at D486 is best interpreted as a superposition of different rotamers of the side chain in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057644.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), indicating an inherent flexibility at this site, which probably becomes ordered upon metal-binding.</p>
        <p>Residues in positions 4, 7 and 8 (R574 of sGCÎ±, R552 and K593 of sGCÃ, respectively) are expected to stabilize the Î³-phosphate of the substrate. R552<sup>sGCÃ</sup> co-localizes with the equivalent residue in the AC structure (R1029), while the side chain of R574 (Î±) is pointing away from the proposed binding site. A loop (Î²5âÎ²6) of the beta subunit is shifted inwards in sGCÎ² compared to the AC-C2 domain; consequently, residue K593<sup>sGCÎ²</sup> does not overlap with the corresponding K1065 of AC. This loop may change position upon binding of nucleotide or upon physiological activation of the cyclase; alternatively, the altered position may enable a different interactions with the triphosphate moiety. Residue N548 of sGCÃ overlaps with the equivalent residue N1025 in AC (position 6), which binds the ribose moiety.</p>
        <p>Positions 2 and 5 differ between AC and sGC proteins, and underlie the preference for adenosine and guanosine nucleotides, respectively. E473<sup>sGCÃ</sup> and C541<sup>sGCÃ</sup> are required for binding to the guanine of GTP, presumably with the cysteine forming a hydrogen bond to the O6 of guanine with the glutamate accepting hydrogen bonds from the N1 and N2 of guanine <xref rid="pone.0057644-Hurley1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In AC, the corresponding residues are K938 (C2) and D1018 (C2), respectively, and it has been shown that mutating the GC residues to these AC residues switches the selectivity of the nucleotide to ATP, effectively turning a GC in to an AC <xref rid="pone.0057644-Sunahara1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057644-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The C541<sup>Î²</sup>S mutation, which we introduced to obtain stable Î±/Î² heterodimers, has been shown to severely diminish GC activity <xref rid="pone.0057644-Friebe2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. This is despite the conservative nature of the substitution and the fact that serine occupies this position in the catalytic domain of the particulate guanylate cyclase in the protozoa Paramecium <xref rid="pone.0057644-Linder1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. It has previously been suggested that the issue with this substitution is a steric one, rather than one involving hydrogen bonding to the ligand <xref rid="pone.0057644-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Comparison of the Î² subunit structures in the homodimer (which does not contain the substitution) and heterodimer shows an almost identical position of both the backbone and side-chain orientation of C541Î² and S541Î².</p>
        <p>As discussed above, the dimeric nature of cyclases creates a cavity, which is pseudo-symmetrically related to the active site. In adenylate cyclase, this site can be partially occupied by the activator forskolin, which stabilizes an active conformation of the enzyme. The forskolin-binding cavity of AC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>. In the crystal structure of the sGC heterodimer, the analogous cavity is collapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, in the modeled active conformation of sGC, where each subunit is separately aligned with the corresponding domain of AC, a cavity is created (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057644-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Although it does not fit into the cavity, the model illustrates that is a clear possibility of controlling the conformation (and hence the activity) of sGC through allosteric binding of small molecules.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This work presents the first structures of a metazoan, heteromeric guanylate cyclase. These structures can best be interpreted by comparing with known structures of adenylate cyclases and of guanylate cyclases of lower organisms.</p>
      <p>The full-length human sGC occurs as a heterodimer of Î± and Ã subunits. Truncated proteins containing only the catalytic domains associate predominantly as inactive Î±<sub>2</sub> and Ã<sub>2</sub> homodimers. We show here that the structures of the Î²<sub>2</sub> homodimer and the Î±Î² heterodimer are remarkably similar, utilizing the same interaction surface. In fact, the buried surface area in the Î²<sub>2</sub> dimer is larger than that of the Î±Î² dimer. This raises the question of the determinants of heterodimerisation. In our experiments, the formation of stable heterodimers was driven by engineered mutations in the beta subunit; in the full-length native protein, heterodimerisation is likely to be driven by other domains of the protein.</p>
      <p>A region immediately upstream of the catalytic domain has been shown to play a role in dimer formation, and was predicted to form an Î±-helical coiled-coil (this region, denoted as CC, includes residues 406â469 of sGCÎ± and 346â409 of sGCÎ²). A crystal structure of the CC region of sGCÎ² shows an association of 4 Î±-helices, representing two anti-parallel coiled-coils <xref rid="pone.0057644-Ma2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The authors argue that this arrangement is unlikely to exist within a full-length dimer, as the distance between the C-termini of the helicase (â¼60 Ã) is incompatible with the predicted distance between the N-termini of the catalytic domains (â¼30 Ã). Based on the sequence considerations, the authors suggest that the CC regions in an Î±Î² dimer may preferentially be oriented in parallel, which would bring the C-termini of the helices to a distance which is compatible with the N-termini of the catalytic domains. The structures presented here are compatible with their proposal, showing that the distance between the N-termini of the catalytic domains is in fact &lt;25 Ã (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057644.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). It may be that the preference for heterodimers of full-length sGC is driven by of the beta CC regions forming antiparallel homodimers, which prevents the catalytic subunits from associating tightly, while the parallel association of the Î± and Î² CC regions promotes the direct association of the catalytic domains. Even if true, this is unlikely to be the whole story, as the N-terminal PAS and HNOB domains have important roles in dimerization.</p>
      <p>Comparison of the structures presented here of the Ã homodimer and the aÃ heterodimer with structures of nucleotide-bound adenylate cyclase clearly demonstrate why the homodimers are inactive: the key residues involved in nucleotide and metal-binding are distributed between the two subunits, and the full binding site cannot be reconstituted in any of the homodimers. The heterodimer structure contains all the conserved residues that were shown to be part of the active sites of other adenylate and guanylate cyclases. The subunit association seen in the crystal structure is in a conformation that is likely to be inactive. We can model an active conformation by aligning separately the Î± and Î² subunits with the C1 and C2 domains of adenylate cyclase in an ATP-bound conformation; this involves a 26Â° rigid-body rotation and translation of the Î± subunit. Similar reorientation of the subunits have been seen when comparing âopenâ and âclosedâ conformations of other AC and GC enzymes, although the magnitude of rotation us usually only â¼7Â°. It is possible that the crystals structure and the modeled active structure of sGC represent a conformational switch that occurs in the full-length enzyme, possibly induced by substrate binding and/or by interaction with the regulatory haem-binding domain. It is also possible that the conformational space is restricted by the coiled-coil structures upstream of the catalytic domains, which could create a constraint on the distance between the N-termini of the catalytic domains.</p>
      <p>Three interesting observations emerge from this study and from structural work on other nucleotide cyclases. First, there is a remarkable conservation of a rather rigid structural framework that places the highly conserved active-site residues in overlapping locations within each subunit. However, there is considerable scope for changes in the relative orientation of the subunits, which provides a conformational switch that can be utilized for allosteric regulation.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we have shown that the subunits of sGC can associate promiscuously as (inactive) homodimers or as (active) heterodimers using the same interaction surface. The preference for heterodimeric association must be involve other domains of the protein, but may also be promoted by binding of substrate or of other ligands. Further mutational and functional studies of the full-length protein may help to map regulatory interactions onto the structure, and help to understand the mechanisms involved.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, the conformational change to the active state of sGC may be linked to the opening of a cavity in the region opposite the active site. It is possible that such a cavity may provide a binding site for small-molecule regulators of sGC activity. The crystal structures provide a framework for rational design of compounds targeting both the GTP-binding site and this potential allosteric site.</p>

Given these distances, it is unlikely that the CC helicase in the heterodimer are in an antiparallel orientation <xref rid="pone.0057644-Ma2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Furthermore, the rigid coiled-coil domain is likely to affect the relative orientation, and hence the activity state, of the catalytic domains.</p>
