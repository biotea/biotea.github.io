      <abstract>
        <p>The AKT/PKB kinase is a key signaling component of one of the most frequently activated pathways in cancer and is a major target of cancer drug development. Most studies have focused on its activation by Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) mediated Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) activation or loss of Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN). We have uncovered that growth factors binding to RTKs lead to activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1 (also known as ACK or TNK2), which directly phosphorylates AKT at an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine 176 in the kinase domain. Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT localizes to the plasma membrane and promotes Thr308/Ser473-phosphorylation leading to AKT activation. Mice expressing activated Ack1 specifically in the prostate exhibit AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and develop murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPINs). Further, expression levels of Tyr176-phosphorylated-AKT and Tyr284-phosphorylated-Ack1 were positively correlated with the severity of disease progression, and inversely correlated with the survival of breast cancer patients. Thus, RTK/Ack1/AKT pathway provides a novel target for drug discovery.</p>

Phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 and Ser473 leads to its kinase activation <xref rid="pone.0009646-Alessi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Upon activation, AKT phosphorylates its substrates to transduce survival signals <xref rid="pone.0009646-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Vivanco1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Greer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. During AKT activation, the first step is the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) by PI3K. PDK1 and AKT bind the phospholipid PIP3 via their PH domains and are recruited to the plasma membrane. While RTK/PI3K mediated recruitment of AKT to the plasma membrane is a well characterized mechanism, mounting evidence indicate that AKT activation can occur in a PI3K-independent fashion <xref rid="pone.0009646-Carpten1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-StemkeHale1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Hennessy1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Gami1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. About a third of the breast and prostate tumors and majority of the pancreatic tumors that exhibit AKT activation, retain normal PTEN and PI3K activity <xref rid="pone.0009646-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0009646-Bose1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Panigrahi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, normal PTEN expression was also seen in breast, ovarian and prostate tumors that exhibit activated AKT <xref rid="pone.0009646-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. While RTKs are suggested to be involved <xref rid="pone.0009646-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the molecular mechanisms regulating RTK mediated AKT activation in cancers with normal PTEN and PI3K activity is poorly understood <xref rid="pone.0009646-Tibes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Further, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> activating mutation has recently been shown to be neither necessary nor sufficient for full AKT activation in situ <xref rid="pone.0009646-Vasudevan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, collectively these data suggest the existence of additional pathways that regulate AKT activation in response to growth factors.</p>
      <p>Ack1, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase has emerged as a critical early transducer of variety of extracellular growth factor stimuli including heregulin, insulin, EGF and PDGF signaling <xref rid="pone.0009646-Manser1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Galisteo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Ack1 is ubiquitously expressed and primarily phosphorylated at Tyr284 leading to its kinase activation <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our earlier studies demonstrated that Ack1 regulates prostate cancer progression to androgen independence by positively regulating androgen receptor (AR) and negatively regulating the tumor suppressor, Wwox <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Ack1 gene is also shown to be amplified in primary lung, ovarian and prostate tumors which correlated with poor prognosis <xref rid="pone.0009646-vanderHorst1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In this report, we have identified a novel mechanism of Ack1 mediated AKT activation wherein phosphorylation of Tyrosine 176 in the AKT kinase domain results in its translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent kinase activation.</p>

        <title>Ack1 Phosphorylates AKT at Evolutionary Conserved Tyr176 Resulting in AKT Activation</title>
        <p>We observed that EGF treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in rapid Tyr-phosphorylation of Ack1 as well as Akt1 at 5 and 10 mins respectively, suggesting that these two Tyr-phosphorylation events could be linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1A</bold>
</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we examined whether Ack1 could bind and Tyr-phosphorylate AKT following RTK activation. Co-immunoprecipitation of lysates derived from Akt1, Akt2, and Akt1&amp; 2 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF1KO, MEF2KO, and MEF1&amp;2KO, respectively, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s001">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>) that were treated with EGF, either with or without pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, revealed that endogenous Akt1 (AKT here onwards) and Ack1 formed a stable complex which was not abrogated by LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1B</bold>
</xref>). The bottom panel shows that upon LY294002 addition there was substantial decrease in AKT Ser473-phosphorylation, suggesting that LY294002 is functional. Akt2 interacted weakly with Ack1, while Akt3 present at low levels in the MEF1&amp;2KO cells was not detectable in the complex.</p>

MEF1&amp;2KO cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged AKT deletions and activated Ack1 or caAck. Immunoprecipitation using HA antibodies followed by immunoblotting with pTyr antibodies revealed Tyr-phosphorylation of full-length AKT and AKT lacking carboxy terminus (ÎCT-AKT), however, AKT deletion construct lacking the PH domain (ÎPH-AKT) exhibited significant decrease in Tyr-phosphorylation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s004">Fig. S4C</xref></bold>, top panel). The decreased phosphorylation of AKT deletion construct lacking PH domain could be due to poor binding with activated Ack1. To assess this interaction in further detail, co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. It revealed that in contrast to AKT or ÎCT-AKT, ÎPH-AKT weakly binds Ack1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s004">Fig. S4D</xref></bold>, top panel). We have demonstrated that Tyr176 residue in AKT kinase domain is necessary for Ack1/AKT interaction, thus, collectively it indicates that the Ack1 need both the PH domain and tyrosine176 in AKT kinase domain for complex formation.</p>
        <p>To identify the region in Ack1 that recognize AKT, MEF1&amp;2KO cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Ack1 deletions (shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s004">Fig. S4A</xref></bold>) and HA-tagged AKT.

Recently, four point mutations in Ack1, i.e. R34L, R99Q, E346K, M409I have been identified in the COSMIC database. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated HA-tagged point mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s005">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>). We tested these mutants and observed that E346K mutant undergoes autoactivation and causes AKT Tyr/Ser/Thr-phosphorylation in serum starved cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s005">Fig. S5B</xref></bold> and <bold>C</bold>). Earlier we and others have characterized a point mutant (L487F mutation) that leads to constitutive activation of Ack1, also called caAck <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Kiyono1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Both caAck(L487F mutant) and E346K autoactivating mutant of Ack1 exhibited Tyr284-phosphorylation in the activation loop (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s005">Fig. S5D</xref></bold>). We also measured the intrinsic kinase activity of the Y176F mutant and the wildtype AKT in the absence and presence of activated Ack1. The wildtype AKT displays significant increase in the kinase activity as compared to the Y176F mutant when coexpressed with either one of the Ack1 constructs, E346K and caAck (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s005">Fig. S5E</xref></bold> and <bold>F</bold>). These results demonstrate that the somatic autoactivating mutations in Ack1 are sufficient to activate AKT. Taken together with the earlier evidence indicating direct Ack1-AKT interaction, it opens an intriguing possibility of RTK/PI3K-independent AKT activation in tumors that is mediated by (auto) activated Ack1.</p>

        <p>We generated a transgenic mouse model in which Myc-tagged activated Ack1 was expressed under the control of modified Probasin (PB) promoter, ARR2PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g005">

<bold>Fig. 5F, JâL</bold>

</xref>). The acini were lined by a rim of basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g005">
<bold>Fig. 5F</bold>
</xref>). The areas of mPINs were easily identifiable and were characterized by prostatic acini containing intraluminal papillary structures lined by atypical cells with elongated nuclei exhibiting prominent nucleoli. Focally, the papillae merged into each other within the acini generating a cribiform pattern of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g005">

We previously demonstrated that Ack1 regulates phosphorylation of androgen receptor <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan2" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>26</bold>]</xref> and tumor suppressor Wwox <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in human prostate tumors. Neoplasia observed in PB-Ack1 mice could be due to the combined effect of Ack1 mediated AKT, AR and Wwox Tyr-phosphorylations. AR and Wwox Tyr-phosphorylations appear to be involved in late stage progression of prostate cancer to androgen-independence <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Ack1 mediated AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and activation may be more proximal stage initiating processes in neoplastic progression that mimic or serve as an alternative to those of PTEN loss which has been prominently emphasized in other mouse models of prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0009646-BlancoAparicio1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>

        <title>pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT Expressions Correlate with Breast Cancer Progression</title>
        <p>To examine the role of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT in breast tumor progression, we performed an extensive tissue microarray analysis (TMA) of clinically annotated breast (nâ=â476) tumor samples. Tyr284 is the primary autophosphorylation site in Ack1, hence, phospho-Ack1(Tyr284) antibodies were used to assess Ack1 activation <xref rid="pone.0009646-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

A significant increase in expression of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT was seen when breast cancers from progressive stages were examined, i.e. normal to hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and lymph node metastatic (LNMM) stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g006">

In contrast to pTyr284-Ack1, the total Ack1 levels remained unchanged between normal and tumor samples (compare <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s010">Fig. S10D</xref></bold> and <bold>E</bold> with <bold>F</bold> and <bold>G</bold>).

When using Tukey-Kramer method to examine all pairwise differences between different stages, the expression levels of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT in LNMM were significantly higher than those of all the earlier tumor stages; the expression levels were significantly lower in the normal samples when compared to those of all the later stages except for hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0009646-t002">

      <p>Our study indicates that cells employ multiple and possibly mutually exclusive mechanisms to activate AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g007">
<bold>Fig. 7</bold>
</xref>). The reasons why RTKs would employ two distinct modes of AKT activation are not entirely clear. However, a fraction of AKT appears to utilize this alternative mode of activation in normal and prominently in cancerous cells. Our studies showed that even in the presence of PI3K inhibitor, ligand bound HER2/ErbB-2 or EGFR activated Ack1 which in turn Tyr-phosphorylated and activated AKT. AKT is frequently activated in pancreatic cancer which has been shown to be highly correlated to HER-2/<italic>neu</italic> overexpression <xref rid="pone.0009646-Schlieman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, many of the pancreatic cell lines and tumors expressing activated AKT had retained wild-type PTEN <xref rid="pone.0009646-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Sakurada1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We noticed that PanIN, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and breast tumors of MMTV-<italic>neu</italic> mice exhibit significantly higher levels of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT (unpublished data). Taken collectively, our data may explain AKT activation in those tumors that display amplification/activation of RTKs but have normal PI3K/PTEN levels. We propose that other tumors that possess somatic autoactivating mutations or amplification in non-receptor tyrosine kinases could use similar mechanisms for AKT activation <xref rid="pone.0009646-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Our data demonstrates an alternate pathway of AKT activation wherein RTKs facilitate Ack1 phosphorylation at Tyr284 leading to its kinase activation. Ack1 could also be activated in some tumors by autoactivating somatic mutations, e.g. E346K. Activated Ack1 phosphorylates AKT at Tyr176 resulting in its binding to the anionic plasma membrane phospholipid PA. pTyr176-AKT localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is targeted by PDK1 and PDK2 (mTORC2 complex) for Thr308/Ser473 phosphorylations, respectively, leading to optimal AKT kinase activation. Activated AKT translocates to the nucleus, phosphorylates FoxO transcription factors to downregulate expression of FoxO target genes.</p>

      <p>Are there conditions when Tyr176 modification is not needed for AKT activation? Some of the conditions when Tyr176 phosphorylation of AKT is not required for AKT activation could be; 1) Presence of constitutively active <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations, observed in colorectal, glioblastomas, gastric breast and lung cancers <xref rid="pone.0009646-Samuels1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. 2) Loss of tumor suppressor PTEN resulting in increased levels of cellular PIP3, occur commonly in prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, and glioblastoma, among others <xref rid="pone.0009646-Vivanco1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. 3) A rare somatic activating mutation, E17K in the pH domain which facilitates AKT recruitment to the membrane in PIP3-independent manner <xref rid="pone.0009646-Carpten1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have used the term AKT âtranslocationâ to indicate emergence of (cytosolic) AKT in the plasma membrane in response to growth factors. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g002">
<bold>Fig. 2B and 2C</bold>
</xref>) demonstrate that AKT in the plasma membrane is phosphorylated at Tyr 176 and mutation of this site in AKT abrogates appearance of AKT in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g002">
<bold>Fig. 2D</bold>
</xref>). Based on the evidence, our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g007">

</xref>) suggests that as Ack1 signaling pathway is initiated at the plasma membrane by RTKs. Ack1 associates with growth factor-bound RTKs (via Mig6 homology domain in Ack1 carboxy terminal proline rich region) and is activated <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Mahajan2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Ack1 is constitutively bound to AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1B</bold> and <bold>G</bold>
</xref>); Activated Ack1 directly phosphorylates AKT at Tyr176, thus facilitating accumulation of Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT at the plasma membrane. Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT preferentially binds PA, a plasma membrane phospholipid as opposed to unphosphorylated AKT (refer to <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s008">Fig. S8</xref></bold> for details). PH domain in AKT is a lipid binding domain and thus might be involved in the membrane binding of Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT. Collectively, our data suggests that Ack1 mediated AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation is driving this translocation process. Thus, although AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and its migration to the plasma membrane is PIP3 independent, the recruitment of Tyr176 AKT in the plasma membrane may require a functional PH domain.</p>
      <p>In contrast to AKT, pTyr176-AKT specifically binds the plasma membrane anionic phospholipid, PA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s008">Fig. S8</xref></bold>). Tyr176-phosphorylation could induce conformational changes in the AKT PH domain to enable binding to PA. The PH domain of Son of sevenless (SOS) and PX domains of p47<sup>phox</sup> have previously been shown to possess a phosphoinositide-binding pocket and a second anion binding pocket which enables them to interact with PA facilitating plasma membrane recruitment <xref rid="pone.0009646-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Karathanassis1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We speculate that AKT too might possess a masked anion binding pocket, and Tyr-phosphorylation induced conformational changes could unmask this pocket allowing it to bind PA.</p>
      <p>In endogenous systems Ack1 associates with AKT2 albeit weakly as compared to AKT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009646-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1B</bold>
</xref>). AKT isoforms are differentially distributed among different cellular compartments <xref rid="pone.0009646-Santi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> with majority of AKT1 in the cytosol, and AKT2 in the mitochondria. Additionally AKT2 protein appears to be not as abundant as AKT1 in MCF-7 and MEFs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009646.s001">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>). Thus, weak interaction with AKT2 could be a combined outcome of differential cellular distribution and lower protein levels. However, our unpublised data demonstrates significant tyrosine phosphorylation of AKT2 upon coexpression of Ack1 and AKT2 in HEK293T cells, suggesting that both AKT1 and 2 are Ack1 substrates.</p>
      <p>This study demonstrates that Tyr176-phosphorylation is sufficient for AKT membrane localization followed by PDK1/PDK2 mediated activation, defining the upstream Ack1 kinase activity as âPDK3â. We do not rule out the possibility that other tyrosine kinases may be able to target AKT for Tyr176-phosphorylation. Ack1 knockout mice are not currently available. However, when they are developed, they would allow us to investigate whether AKT can be phosphorylated at Tyr176 by other receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases in response to growth factors. Multiple non-receptor tyrosine kinases were earlier shown to increase AKT activity <xref rid="pone.0009646-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009646-Conus1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, however, precise mechanism of AKT activation by any of the Tyr-modifications is not clear, nor is their role in initiation or progression of cancer. To our knowledge, this report provides the first demonstration for a role of Tyr-phosphorylated AKT in its compartmentalization, which allowed us to delineate its critical role in AKT kinase activation, its potential to initiate neoplasia in mouse prostates and promote disease progression in human breast cancers. Large numbers of tumors are reliant upon AKT activation for survival and growth making it an attractive target for molecular therapeutics <xref rid="pone.0009646-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The assay that was used during development of AKT inhibitors was primarily based on AKT Ser473-phosphorylation. Our data indicates that a new class of AKT inhibitors can be identified based on AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation. These novel inhibitors that block AKT membrane localization and activation could have major implications in cancer, diabetes and obesity research.</p>

Following immunoprecipitation with HA-beads (E6779, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), purified AKT was subjected to SDS PAGE electrophoresis and the gel was stained Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R250(BioRad). A prominent band of â¼59 kDa was excised, washed once with water and twice with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% aqueous methanol. Proteins were reduced and alkylated with 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 20 mM iodoacetamide (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA), respectively. Samples were digested overnight with modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), Glu-C (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), or chymotrypsin (Roche, Switzerland).

In brief, two antigen-affinity columns were used to purify the phospho-specific antibodies. The first column was the non-phosphopeptide affinity column. Antibodies recognizing the non-phospho residues of the peptide bound to the column and were eluted as pan-specific antibodies. The flow-through fraction was collected and then applied to the second column, the phospho-peptide column.

        <title>Tissue Microarray (TMA) Analysis</title>
        <p>For assessment of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT expression in breast cancer, immunohistochemistry was carried out on two high-density TMAs (nâ=â476 cores) containing samples of normal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), lymph node macro metastasis (LNMM). Four Âµm sections were cut with Leica microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc, Bannockburn, IL) and transferred to adhesive-coated slides. The tissue array slides (4 slides including 2 test duplicate slides, and positive and negative controls) were stained for pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT using respective rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The slides were dewaxed by heating at 55 Celsius for 30 min and by three washes, 5 min each, with xylene. Tissues were rehydrated by series of 5 min washes in 100%, 95%, and 80% ethanol and distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the samples at 95Â° Celsius for 30 min in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0). After blocking with universal blocking serum (DAKO Diagnostic, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for 30 min, the samples were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal pTyr284-Ack1 antibody (1â¶300 dilution; Milipore) and rabbit polyclonal phospho-AKT antibody (1â¶25 dilution) at 4Â° Celsius overnight. The sections were incubated with biotin-labeled secondary and streptavidin-peroxidase for 30 min each (DAKO Diagnostic). The samples were developed with 3,3â²-diaminobenzidine substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Following standard procedures the slides were dehydrated and sealed with cover slips. Negative controls were included by omitting pTyr284-Ack1/pTyr176-AKT antibody during primary antibody incubation. The phospho-AKT/Ack1 antibodies were extensively validated for immunohistochemistry studies. MCF7 cells treated with heregulin and RWPE cells treated with EGF ligand (or no ligand) were fixed, paraffin imbedded, sectioned and used for antibody validation. Further, MEF1&amp;2KO cells transfected with activated Ack1 and AKT were also used to validate antibodies. The pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT staining in paraffin embedded tissues were examined in a blinded fashion by two independent pathologists (A.L. and D.C.). If needed, a consensus score was reached for each specimen. The positive reactions were scored into four grades according to the intensity of staining: 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+. The percentages of pTyr176-AKT positive cells were also scored into four categories: 0 (0%), 1+ (1â33), 2+ (34â66), 3+ (more than 66%). The product of the intensity and percentage scores was used as a final staining score.</p>

        <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
        <p>The Mantel-Haenszel <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0009646.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> test was performed to examine if there is an increasing trend for pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT with respect to different progression stages of breast or pancreatic cancer. The ordinal intensity levels of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 were pooled into 6 levels (as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and above) to accommodate the rare observations in the highest intensity level in most stages. Analysis of variance was performed to examine whether the expression levels of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT differ among different tumor stages. Boxplots were used to summarize the intensity distribution at each progression stage. Furthermore, Tukey-Kramer method was performed to examine between which pairs of stages the expression levels are different. This post-hoc procedure adjusts for all pairwise comparisons and simultaneous inference. When more than one sample was obtained from a patient, the intensity of the most progressed stage was used for the analysis. Correlation between pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT was explored using Spearman ranked correlation analysis. The association of the expression levels of pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT and the overall survival of patients were assessed using the KaplanâMeier method. For breast cancer data, there were 144 individuals with available pTyr284-Ack1 staining and survival information while there were 140 individuals with available pTyr176-AKT staining and survival information. For pancreatic cancer data, there were 83 individuals with available pTyr284-Ack1 staining and survival information while there were 76 individuals with available pTyr176-AKT staining and survival information. Statistical differences between the groups were determined using log-rank test.</p>

          <p>Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT sample also contains Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylated AKT. (A) Activated Ack1 (caAck) and HA-tagged AKT were coexpressed in HEK293T cells followed by IP with HA-beads. IP AKT was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gel was stained Coomassie. A prominent band of â¼59 kDa corresponding to AKT is seen which was excised and subjected to mass spectrometry as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> section. The upper â¼113 kDa band corresponds to caAck1 that bound to AKT. (B) Purified AKT peptide preparation that lead to the identification of pTyr176-AKT was assessed for other phosphorylation events. A peptide was detected at 21.12 mins in the total ion chromatogram with mass-to-charge ratio 918.43, which represents an error of 1.0 ppm (C). (D) The tandem mass spectrum matched the sequence, FGLCKEGIKDGATMKpTFC indicating that Thr308 in AKT was phosphorylated; the detection of the phosphothreonine y3 is consistent with this localization. (E) Another peptide was detected at 23.72 mins in the total ion chromatogram with mass-to-charge ratio 944.93, which represents an error of 0.99 ppm (F). (G) The tandem mass spectrum matched the sequence, ERRPHFPQFpSYSASGTA indicating that Ser473 in AKT was phosphorylated; the detection of b8, b9, y7 and y8 is consistent with this localization.</p>

          <p>AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation affects the loop harboring Ser473. (A) Residues Tyr176 and Ser473 are located in regions with increased conformational flexibility. The backbone of AKT1 is color-traced according to crystallographic B-factors from blue (20 Angstrom, less flexible) to red (76 Angstrom, highly flexible). (B) B-factor plot of all C-alpha atoms. The average main chain B-factor is 36 Angstrom (dashed horizontal line). (C) AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation induces substantial conformational changes of residues in its vicinity. Electrostatic interactions could be established with Arg174 and/or Lys214 while electrostatic repulsion and/or steric hindrance (due to the bulky phosphate group) may affect Glu169 and Tyr215. This could lead to a shift of the beta-strand flanking the c-terminal portion of the loop harboring Ser473, in turn causing structural alterations of this residue.</p>
