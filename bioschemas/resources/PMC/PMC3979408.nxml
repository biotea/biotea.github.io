        <p>Glucocorticoids (GC) regulate cell fate and immune function. We identified the metastasis-promoting methyltransferase, metastasis-related methyltransferase 1 (WBSCR22/Merm1) as a novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulator relevant to human disease. Merm1 binds the GR co-activator GRIP1 but not GR. Loss of Merm1 impaired both GR transactivation and transrepression by reducing GR recruitment to its binding sites. This was accompanied by loss of GR-dependent H3K4Me3 at a well characterized promoter. Inflammation promotes GC resistance, in part through the actions of TNFÎ± and IFNÎ³. These cytokines suppressed Merm1 protein expression by driving ubiquitination of two conserved lysine residues. Restoration of Merm1 expression rescued GR transactivation. Cytokine suppression of Merm1 and of GR function was also seen in human lung explants. In addition, striking loss of Merm1 protein was observed in both inflammatory and neoplastic human lung pathologies. In conclusion, Merm1 is a novel regulator of chromatin structure affecting GR recruitment and function, contributing to loss of GC sensitivity in inflammation, with suppressed expression in pulmonary disease.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucocorticoids (GC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref> exert diverse effects on multiple cell types and tissues, affecting energy metabolism, cell fate, and differentiated function. Variation in GC sensitivity is evident in several disease states, with resistance occurring in chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through mechanisms that remain undefined but are thought to result from cytokine action (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">â</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In addition, human small cell lung cancer is characterized by GC resistance, which prevents GC induction of cell death both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The diverse actions of GC are mediated through the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR is a nuclear hormone receptor that acts as a ligand-inducible transcription factor interacting with chromatin to regulate gene transcription (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">â</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Selection of GR binding sites is dependent on cell type-specific chromatin structure, which regulates accessibility to target DNA, giving rise to cell type-specific GR cistromes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">â</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of transcription by GR is mediated by co-modulator proteins, some of which regulate post-translational modification of histone proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> p160, CARM1, CBP) and some that do not (<italic>e.g.</italic> SWI/SNF) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Changes in post-translational modifications on core histone tails, particularly acetylation and methylation, critically affect chromatin structure and gene expression. Much attention has been given to histone acetylation, a transient mark that renders nucleosomal DNA more accessible to protein binding (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, histone methylation is also important. In the context of GR-regulated gene transcription the histone arginine methyltransferase CARM1 plays a prominent role (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Histone acetylation regulates the charge on the histone tail and relaxes the association with DNA, thereby âopeningâ chromatin to transcription factor binding. In contrast, histone methylation has no effect on charge but likely serves as a protein recognition surface (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Histone methylation involves three groups of protein complexes: âwriters,â or histone methyltransferases, âerasers,â or histone demethylases, and âreaders,â or proteins recruited to the methylated histones. Three families of enzymes result in histone methylation. The SET domain, and DOT1-like proteins both methylate lysine, and the protein arginine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase (PRMT) family methylate arginine residues (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Recent evidence points toward coordinated modification of multiple histone residues at a given locus, an effect regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), such as <italic>hotair</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>We have identified the WBSCR22/metastasis-related methyltransferase 1 (<italic>Merm1</italic>) gene as an important regulator of GR binding and function and a mediator of cytokine-induced glucocorticoid resistance. <italic>Merm1/wbscr22</italic> is one of 26â28 genes deleted from 7q11.23 in Williams-Beuren syndrome, a developmental disorder with multisystem manifestations, including glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Merm1 is highly conserved through evolution from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to humans. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the Merm1 ortholog in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is embryonic lethal (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Based on the Hidden Markov Model of sequence and three-dimensional structural analysis, Merm1 has been categorized into the seven-Î²-strand family of methyltransferases, which includes the arginine methyltransferase family (including CARM1, PRMT1) and the non-SET domain lysine methyltransferases (including DOT1L) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Although there is strong evidence implicating the arginine methyltransferases, and the SET domain methyltransferases in regulating access of nuclear receptors to target sites and also in mediating their effects on gene expression, little is known of how the non-SET domain lysine methyltransferases regulate nuclear receptor function (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, recent studies have shown that H3K79 methylation, which is catalyzed by the non-SET methyltransferase DOT1L, is regulated by cell cycle progression (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>More recently Merm1 was identified in a genetic screen for genes promoting cancer metastases by inhibiting Zac1-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This action required methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) at the Zac1 locus, thereby rendering a transcriptionally repressive chromatin environment. However, Merm1 did not methylate H3K9 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Here we show that Merm1 regulates GR binding to its response elements and mediates subsequent H3K4Me3 generation, a mark found on active promoters. Interactome analysis reveals Merm1 binding with histone-associated proteins and protein kinases, intimating a pivotal role for the protein in signal/response coupling in chromatin modeling. Moreover, Merm1 expression was repressed by a combined TNFÎ±/IFNÎ³ proinflammatory environment through an ubiquitination -dependent mechanism, resulting in impaired GR function. Importantly, high level Merm1 expression was found in the bronchial epithelium but was significantly impaired in a broad range of pulmonary inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>TAT3-Luciferase (Luc), which contains three copies of the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) from the tyrosine aminotransferase plasmid, was a kind gift from Professor Keith Yamamoto (University of California, San Francisco).

This offers advantages over antibody purification protocols by minimizing off-target protein capture. All analyses were controlled using the Halo-tag alone to permit subtraction of proteins recognizing the epitope tag.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of the Merm1 interactome.</bold>
<italic>A</italic>, the Halo-tag is a 34-kDa protein tag from dehalogenase (<italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp.) which binds to its ligand covalently. Halo-Merm1 is captured with the Halo-link resin. Merm1 is cleaved from the Halo ligand (leaving the Halo-tag on the resin) complex using a TEV protease, which targets a protein sequence at the linker as indicated. Eluted proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry.

We were also unable to detect direct histone methyltransferase activity and postulated a requirement for additional, unknown cellular components for Merm1 catalytic action (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We did not detect an interaction between GR and Merm1, which may reflect the sensitivity limits of our proteomics technology but may also result from low level GR expression in HEK293T. Therefore, we sought evidence of interaction using immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>). As demonstrated above, A549 cells express endogenous GR and Merm1 and, moreover, possess the machinery to permit Merm1 co-activation of the GR. Immunoprecipitation of GR from vehicle and GC-treated A549 cells was successful, and although Merm1 was seen in the input cell lysate no detectable band was seen in the GR immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>). This provides additional evidence that Merm1 does not physically bind to GR, but in a further attempt to detect interaction we used a Halo-GR fusion protein as bait. A549 cells were transfected with a Halo-GR expression vector, and Halo complexes were purified as above. Both endogenous GR and Halo-GR were detectable in the input samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>F</italic>, <italic>input lanes</italic>).

A strong candidate is the GR co-activator and scaffold protein GRIP1/SRC2. Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitation-immunoblot studies in A549 cells with GRIP1. We were able to enrich GRIP1 in cell lysates under vehicle and GC-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>G</italic>) and were also able to detect a weak interaction with Merm1 as detected by blotting the immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>G</italic>).</p><p>Among the interacting partners we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>H</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M113.540906/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M113.540906/DC1">supplemental data</ext-link>) were proteins with a functional role for Merm1 in driving histone modification and ribosome biogenesis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), including the histone-binding protein RBBP7, which binds H3K4 in a methylation-dependent manner (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and RUVBL1 and -2, which are both components of the NuA4 and INO80 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>H</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M113.540906/DC1">supplemental Table 1</ext-link>). Merm1 was also found with ubiquitin protein ligases, and in addition, ubiquitin was found in the protein complex, suggesting a potential mechanism for regulating Merm1 protein levels by ubiquitinylation and degradation by the 26 S proteasome.

In addition, it has been recognized that the actions of the GR to regulate target gene transcription are, in part, mediated by directed chromatin remodeling, with resulting changes in the access to, and binding of other transcription factors (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">â</xref><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Most recently it has become clear that GR and other transcription factors may associate with their binding sites in a highly dynamic state (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">â</xref><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Therefore, much interest has been directed at understanding how GR access to target sites in the genome is regulated and the mechanisms underlying subsequent GR-directed chromatin remodeling. We have now identified a novel regulator of this process, Merm1, that affects both GR access to target sites and also mediates GR-regulated histone modification. As we find that Merm1 protein is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by proinflammatory cytokine signaling, these discoveries link inflammation with gating of GR access to the genome and tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoid.</p><p>We initially identified Merm1 in a co-activator screen (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The co-activation effect was found to be dependent on both the SAM and methyltransferase domains, although previous studies had identified Merm1 as mediating induction of the repressive chromatin mark H3K9me. Further evidence for a role of Merm1 in transcriptional regulation is provided by a recent proteomic analysis of steroid receptor transcription factor complexes in which Merm1 protein was identified (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>Merm1 gene expression was near ubiquitous in human tissues but with particularly high levels in bronchial epithelium, prompting examination of Merm1 in lung pathologies. We also studied Merm1 expression in immune cell types in response to activation, as these are prominent targets for GC therapy. We found induction of Merm1 gene expression in both B and CD8+ T lymphocytes, again supporting a role for Merm1 in inflammatory signaling.</p><p>As Merm1 is a candidate putative histone methyltransferase (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we anticipated a role in chromatin modification but initially used an unbiased proteomic approach to gain insights into function and regulation. These studies revealed that Merm1 was a likely target for ubiquitinylation, Merm1 bound chromatin component proteins, and Merm1 did not bind directly to GR. However, Merm1 did co-immunoprecipitate with GRIP1, a chromatin-modifying enzyme, and GR co-modulator protein (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Merm1 also bound a number of enzymes, including histone acetyltransferases, associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, and the histone-binding protein RBBP7, which interacts with histone H3 in an H3K4me3-dependent manner (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Merm1 modulated GR regulation of a number of endogenous target genes, both positively and negatively. The well characterized GR target gene GILZ was analyzed further. GILZ is a potent anti-inflammatory mediator, and its induction by GR plays an important role in the anti-inflammatory repertoire activated by glucocorticoid treatment (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). GR binding to the two well defined GREs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) was demonstrated along with Merm1.</p><p>Loss of Merm1 had a dramatic effect on recruitment of GR to the two GREs, but there was little impact on histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). Therefore, we examined candidate histone methylation changes. H3K4me3 is a reliable mark for active promoters, and we revealed a striking induction at the two GILZ GREs in response to ligand activation of the GR. In contrast, we also saw a marked decrease in the H3K79me2 mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>E</italic>). H3K79me2 is only known to be catalyzed by DOT1L and is best-characterized as an elongation chromatin mark associated with transcriptionally active chromatin (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated at a pan-genomic level asynchronous histone modifications accompanying gene transcription, and so this may be an example of actively remodeling chromatin driven by binding of the GR (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p><p>Merm1 knockdown dramatically reduced basal H3K79me2, especially at GL-3, but had minimal effects on basal H3K4me3. However, knockdown of Merm1 effectively abolished the GR induction of the H3K4me3 signal. Taken together this suggests that Merm1 is required for the maintenance of open chromatin at the GILZ locus to facilitate GR loading on the response elements. The increase in H3K4 trimethylation with reduction in H3K79 dimethylation in response to GR activation by ligand suggests coordinated histone modification whereby one change influences another. Loss of Merm1 prevents both changes, suggesting several possibilities. It may be that loss of the H3K79me2 mark inhibited GR recruitment and thereby acquisition of the H3K4me3 mark either catalyzed directly by Merm1 or the activating MLL complex recruited to the GR (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Alternatively, the driving event may be the gain of methylation marks on H3K4 as a result of GR activation of Merm1 and that this mark serves to recruit histone methyltransferases targeting H3K79. However, it is clear that loss of Merm1 acts to regulate GR recruitment, and the chromatin mark observed most clearly under basal conditions is the loss of H3K79me2. For this reason it seems more likely that Merm1 is required for maintenance of H3K79me2.</p><p>There are many examples of collaborative and antagonistic relationships between different histone marks. For example CARM1 and PRMT1 act to enhance histone arginine methylation in response to estrogen receptor activation, and a further enzyme, PADI4, also a target of estrogen receptor, reverses the change by converting methylated arginine to citrulline (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Also, dimethylation of H3R2 is prevented by H3K4me3 and vice versa (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>We identified in a model of acquired GC resistance (combined IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) that Merm1 protein expression was significantly reduced in a ubiquitination-dependent manner both in cell lines and human lung explants. In both cases loss of Merm1 was accompanied by loss of GR recruitment to GREs.</p><p>Our data suggested that Merm1 may be particularly important in the regulation of normal lung epithelial function. Therefore, we profiled Merm1 protein expression in a human lung tissue array and found a marked loss both in inflammatory and neoplastic disease. As pulmonary neoplasia frequently develops on a tissue background of chronic inflammation, it is perhaps no surprise to find a similar pattern of Merm1 expression in both disease processes. Of course, the earlier discovery of Merm1 as a regulator of distant metastases is also relevant in the context of pulmonary neoplasia (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear receptors are proposed to be pioneer factors capable of inducing open chromatin to permit binding of secondary regulatory factors (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">â</xref><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, more recently genome-wide analysis suggests that the majority of GR binding occurs to constitutively accessible sites (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Our data identify Merm1 as a novel chromatin-modifying enzyme implicated not only in regulating GR access to target sites but also in mediating GR chromatin remodeling activity. We show also that Merm1 is negatively regulated by proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in impaired GC target gene regulation. We propose, therefore, that inflammation re-programs chromatin, in part through suppression of Merm1, affecting GR access to target genes and limiting subsequent chromatin remodeling activity. The Merm1-dependent GR cistrome is likely to be important in understanding how best to target pulmonary inflammation. Targeting Merm1 expression or function may be a viable strategy for potentiating glucocorticoid related anti-inflammatory action in human pulmonary inflammatory disease or may inform the design of novel GR ligands capable of re-directing GR in a Merm1-deficient cellular environment.</p></sec>
