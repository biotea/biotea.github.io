      <abstract>
        <p>The flow of genetic information from DNA to protein requires polymerase-II-transcribed RNA characterized by the presence of a 5â²-cap. The cap-binding complex (CBC), consisting of the nuclear cap-binding protein (NCBP) 2 and its adaptor NCBP1, is believed to bind all capped RNA and to be necessary for its processing and intracellular localization. Here we show that NCBP1, but not NCBP2, is required for cell viability and poly(A) RNA export. We identify C17orf85 (here named NCBP3) as a cap-binding protein that together with NCBP1 forms an alternative CBC in higher eukaryotes. NCBP3 binds mRNA, associates with components of the mRNA processing machinery and contributes to poly(A) RNA export. Loss of NCBP3 can be compensated by NCBP2 under steady-state conditions. However, NCBP3 becomes pivotal under stress conditions, such as virus infection. We propose the existence of an alternative CBC involving NCBP1 and NCBP3 that plays a key role in mRNA biogenesis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Expression of all germline-encoded genetic information in eukaryotes requires RNA transcription through polymerase complexes and subsequent RNA processing, export and translation. Polymerase II transcripts, such as messenger (mRNA), antisense (asRNA), long intergenic non-coding (lincRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) are marked by an N7-methylated guanine (m<sup>7</sup>G) âcap structure' that is co-transcriptionally attached to the 5â²-end of the RNA and serves as a signal for engaging proteins required for downstream processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Consistent with this notion, splicing and export of snRNA and mRNA can be inhibited by exogenously providing cap analogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The RNA cap structure is bound by the highly conserved nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), a central factor, known to orchestrate most downstream RNA biogenesis processes such as pre-mRNA splicing, 3â²-end processing, nonsense-mediated decay, nuclearâcytoplasmic transport and recruitment of translation factors in the cytoplasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The CBC consists of a heterodimer formed by nuclear cap-binding protein 2 (NCBP2, also known as CBP20), which directly associates with the RNA cap, and NCBP1 (also known as CBP80), which stabilizes NCBP2 and serves as an adaptor for other RNA processing factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The central role of the CBC is demonstrated by short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of NCBP1, which results in deregulated expression of several hundred genes, a reduction in the cell proliferation rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and reduction of co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. NCBP1 directly binds the mRNA export factor ALYREF, and âCBC competition experiments' using excess of capped RNA led to the conclusion that NCBP1 is involved in mRNA and U snRNA export from the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, despite the apparent requirement of NCBP1 for export of capped RNA, antibody-mediated inhibition of NCBP2 <italic>in vivo</italic> only impairs export of U snRNA, but not mRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition to these data, several genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)-based screens in human cells that allow assessment of loss-of-function phenotypes in an unbiased manner found that depletion of NCBP1 negatively affects cell growth and viability, whereas depletion of NCBP2 showed only weak phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Collectively, these data suggest that the two CBC subunits only in part share the same biological function. Thus, we questioned whether an additional protein exists that has partially redundant activity to NCBP2 and associates with NCBP1 to form an alternative CBC.</p>
    <p>Here, we identify the largely uncharacterized protein C17orf85 (NCBP3) as a novel genuine cap-binding protein that directly interacts with NCBP1 and binds cellular mRNA. Similar to NCBP2, NCBP3 is non-essential under steady-state conditions. However, simultaneous depletion of NCBP2 and -3 mimics the phenotype of NCBP1 knockdown. Notably, NCBP3 becomes pivotal under cellular stress conditions, such as virus infections. We propose the existence of a canonical and an alternative CBC that is fundamental for mRNA biogenesis of higher eukaryotes.</p>

        <title>Loss of NCBP1 and NCBP2 leads to different phenotypes</title>
        <p>To study the individual requirement of CBC components NCBP1 and NCBP2 for cell viability, we evaluated cell growth after their transient siRNA-mediated depletion in HeLa cells. As expected, depletion of NCBP1 or the Nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1, also known as TAP) severely affected cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Surprisingly, after selective depletion of NCBP2, we did not observe a similar effect on cell viability. Likewise, depletion of NCBP2 did not affect intracellular distribution of poly-adenylated (poly(A)) mRNA, as tested by RNA fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (RNA-FISH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, loss of NCBP1 resulted in accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nucleus, confirming a critical role of NCBP1 in mRNA export<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Since NCBP1 cannot directly associate with capped RNA, we hypothesized on the existence of a protein with a redundant function to NCBP2, that is, a protein with the ability to bridge the association between capped RNA and NCBP1. Contribution of NCBP1 to additional protein complexes is supported by protein expression data based on quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) that suggest about three times higher abundance of NCBP1 as compared with NCBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of C17orf85 as cap-binding protein NCBP3</title>
        <p>A protein with redundant function to NCBP2 should have the ability to associate with the RNA cap structure and to bind to NCBP1 to engage factors required for RNA biogenesis. To identify potential candidate proteins, we performed affinity purification followed by liquid chromatography tandem MS (APâLCâMS/MS) using lysates from human and mouse cell lines and capped and non-capped RNA as baits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Capped RNA reliably enriched proteins known to associate directly with the RNA cap structure, among them the CBC (consisting of NCBP1 and -2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, the genuine cap-binding protein EIF4E<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and the antiviral protein IFIT1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) from human THP-1 and RAW 264.7 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Among the proteins identified in human and murine cell lysates was only one protein, C17orf85 (also known as ELG), for which we could not explain its association with RNA in a cap-dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. C17orf85 is a highly conserved protein, and orthologues can be found in the fungal and metazoan kingdoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>), suggesting evolutionary conservation for more than one billion years. However, based on currently available whole-genome sequencing data, it seems to have been lost at least by some <italic>Muscomorpha</italic> and <italic>Saccharomycetaceae</italic>, which include <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, respectively. Recent data on distribution of proteins in human tissues suggest that C17orf85 is expressed in all tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Consistent with a potential redundant role to NCBP2, endogenous and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged C17orf85 showed predominantly nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Subcellular fractionation confirmed the nuclear localization, but also identified a cytoplasmic proportion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), a phenotype often found for proteins involved in RNA export<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Here, we name C17orf85 NCBP3 for nuclear cap-binding protein 3.</p>
        <p>To confirm cap-dependent binding of NCBP3, we used capped and non-capped RNA as bait for AP, followed by western blotting. NCBP3 precipitated with capped RNA in human THP-1 and murine RAW 264.7 cells comparably well as the cap-binding protein EIF4E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The canonical CBC has been mainly studied in human HeLa cells. We therefore confirmed the presence and binding of NCBP3 to capped RNA in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In line with specific affinity for the cap structure, NCBP3 was precipitated from cell lysates using N7-methylated guanosine-5â²-triphosphate (m<sup>7</sup>GTP)-coupled beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). m<sup>7</sup>GTP also precipitated the CBC component NCBP1 but not poly-A-binding protein 1 (PABP1), confirming specificity of this assay.</p>
        <p>To functionally assess the potential contribution of NCBP3 to compensate for loss of NCBP2, we employed siRNA-based knockdown and tested for cell growth in HeLa cells. Depletion of either NCBP2 or NCBP3 alone did not considerably affect cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>) despite efficient and specific knockdown as tested by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)âPCR, western blotting and quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). Although we cannot rule out that residual amounts of the proteins are sufficient for biological activity, simultaneous depletion of NCBP2 and NCBP3 with comparable efficiency markedly reduced cell growth and mimicked loss of NCBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). An analogous experiment in murine NIH3T3 cells confirmed that depletion of both, Ncbp2 and Ncbp3 also inhibited cell growth in mouse cells, whereas individual knockdown of the two proteins did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>). In summary, these experiments suggest that loss of NCBP2 and NCBP3 is synthetically lethal, and highlight NCBP3 as a prime candidate for formation of an alternative CBC in mammalian cells.</p>

        <title>Mechanism of cap-RNA binding by NCBP3</title>
        <p>NCBP1 lacks a canonical RNA or cap recognition domain. Hence, binding to capped RNA is mediated by its partner NCBP2. As suggested above, in an alternative scenario, cap binding could also be mediated by NCBP3. Indeed, homology-based structure prediction of NCBP3 suggested the presence of a canonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) fold (Î²1âÎ±1âÎ²2âÎ²3âÎ±2âÎ²4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> in the N-terminal region of the protein (residues 126â187) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The C-terminal part of NCBP3 is unstructured, and a homology search did not reveal the presence of any other predicted domains. Two nuclear localization signals explain the predominant nuclear staining in confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Comparative modelling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> using HHpred resulted in a structural model for the core RRM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) based on the RRM of poly(A)-specific ribonuclease PARN, a protein known to bind the cap analogue m<sup>7</sup>GpppG. The RRM of NCBP3 shares high sequence homology (identity of 21.4% for residues 121â191) and critical residues with the RRM of PARN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aâc</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> as well as with the RRM of NCBP2, although with lower sequence identity (16.4%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). To study whether NCBP3 has the ability to directly bind capped RNA, we generated recombinant NCBP3 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Both, the full-length protein and an N-terminal cleavage fragment of NCBP3 precipitated with RNA in a cap-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The hallmark of the cap structure is a methyl group at the N7 position of the guanosine, and genuine cap-binding proteins such as EIF4E have the ability to distinguish between N7-methylated and unmethylated GTP. Consistent with this notion, recombinant NCBP3 selectively bound m<sup>7</sup>GTP but not GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). A highly purified N-terminal fragment (position 1â282 amino acids) consisting of the core RRM was sufficient for selective binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Microscale thermophoresis (MST)-based affinity measurements showed that the RRM-containing fragment has an affinity to cap-RNA in the low micromolar range (15.8Â±0.84âÎ¼M), which is comparable to the affinity of PARN to m<sup>7</sup>GpppG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p>
        <p>In case of PARN, a conserved WXDD motif located in loop Î²2âÎ²3 is involved in m<sup>7</sup>GpppG binding. N7-methylated GTP is bound to a surface pocket on the C-terminal RRM of PARN mainly through Ï-interaction with tryptophan W468 and polar interactions with two aspartic acids, D471 and D470 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). According to the predicted model, NCBP3 has a similar motif (WLDD) forming a negatively charged groove (D157, D158) with an aromatic platform for Ï-interaction (W155; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). To test whether NCBP3 uses these residues for cap-RNA binding, we generated point mutants in this putative RNA-binding motif. Whereas a single D134A mutation in close vicinity of the RNA-binding groove only marginally affected cap binding, mutation of the NCBP3 WLDD motif to ALAA resulted in loss of binding to capped RNA and m<sup>7</sup>GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). To ensure that the introduced mutations did not influence the overall integrity and folding of the recombinant proteins, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to analyse the secondary structure content. Both samples showed comparable CD spectra, irrespective of the introduced modification, suggesting that both proteins adopt a similar fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). This shows that NCBP3 binds to the cap structure through a canonical binding mechanism using a core RRM and the conserved WLDD motif.</p>

Most importantly, the CBC component NCBP1 was found to interact with NCBP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Besides NCBP1, NCBP3 prominently interacted with components of the TRanscription EXport (TREX) complex (for example, THOC1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, DDX39B) that function in mRNA export from the nucleus. NCBP3 further associated with proteins belonging to the exon junction complex (EJC) (MAGOHB, SAP18, EIF4A3, PNN and ACIN1), which are deposited on spliced mRNAs and are involved in mRNA stability. Although NCBP2 precipitates also contained components of the TREX complex and EJC, their enrichment was not statistically significant as compared with control APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). However, NCBP2 precipitates showed high enrichment for the phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (PHAX) known for its function in U snRNA nuclear export<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex (consisting of NELFA, NELFB, NELFCD and NELFE), which participates in 3â²-end processing of histone mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).

        <title>An alternative CBC</title>
        <p>The association of NCBP3 to NCBP1 suggested formation of an alternative CBC. To formally test whether NCBP3 and NCBP1 directly bind to each other, we co-expressed both proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and performed co-precipitation experiments. In line with our hypothesis, NCBP1 co-precipitated with NCBP3 but not with a negative control, endorsing a direct interaction between NCBP3 and NCBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and suggesting the formation of an alternative CBC that is reminiscent of the canonical CBC consisting of NCBP1 and -2. This result further suggested that NCBP2 and NCBP3 have the ability to individually bridge the association of NCBP1 to capped RNA. To test this in a mammalian system, we depleted NCBP2, NCBP3 or both proteins in HeLa cells and precipitated NCBP1 using m<sup>7</sup>GTP beads. Consistent with the presence of two CBCs, NCBP1 could be recovered from m<sup>7</sup>GTP beads in the absence of either NCBP2 or NCBP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). However, in the absence of NCBP2 and -3, NCBP1 binding to m<sup>7</sup>GTP beads was markedly impaired, indicating that in mammalian cells NCBP1 requires either NCBP2 or NCBP3 for cap-RNA association. This effect was specific for NCBP1, since the cap-binding protein EIF4E precipitated with m<sup>7</sup>GTP beads with similar efficiency in all cases.</p>
        <p>Binding of NCBP2 to NCBP1 requires residues located in the RRM. Sequence alignments of the NCBP2 and NCBP3 RRM domains showed that the residues critical for NCBP1 binding in NCBP2 are not conserved in NCBP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Consistent with this finding, yeast two-hybrid data indicated that NCBP3 binds NCBP1 through its unstructured C-terminal region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. These findings provide evidence that NCBP2 and NCBP3 use different domains to bridge the association of NCBP1 to capped RNA.</p>

        <title>Specificity of RNA types bound by NCBP2 and NCBP3</title>
        <p>Collectively, our data show that NCBP3 has affinity for the RNA cap structure and bridges NCBP1 binding to m<sup>7</sup>GTP in an NCBP2-independent manner. The binding of different RNA processing proteins highlights the possibility that distinct types of RNA associate with either NCBP2 or NCBP3. To test this, we precipitated GFP-tagged NCBP3, NCBP2 or control and sequenced bound RNA by deep sequencing (RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing, RIP-Seq). In agreement with the ability of NCBP3 and NCBP2 to associate with the cap structure, both proteins enriched for capped RNAs as compared with control precipitates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). Plotting the individual RNAs enriched by NCBP2 and NCBP3 and colour coding for the respective RNA species revealed an RNA-binding pattern for both proteins: NCBP2 precipitates showed particularly high enrichment for snRNA, lincRNA and asRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Among individual mRNAs, histone mRNAs were mainly apparent in NCBP2 precipitates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). In contrast, NCBP3 associated with mRNA, but did not bind snRNA, and comparably less asRNA and lincRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The majority of mRNAs bound both NCBP2 and -3 with only a limited number of mRNAs showing more than twofold enrichment in either NCBP3 versus NCBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, orange) or NCBP2 versus NCBP3 precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, green). We validated the differences in binding to mRNA and snRNA using qRTâPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). NCBP2 bound mRNAs (MYC, SLC43A3) and snRNAs (U1, U4), whereas NCBP3 selectively bound mRNAs (MYC, SLC43A3) but did not enrich for snRNAs. Collectively, this suggested that snRNA, lincRNA and asRNA preferentially bind NCBP2, while mRNAs can be bound by either NCBP2 or -3. The RIP-Seq data were in strong agreement with the proteinâprotein interaction data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) that showed selective binding of PHAX (transporting snRNA) and NELF (3â²-end processing of replication-dependent histone mRNAs) to NCBP2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p>

        <title>NCBP2 and -3 individually contribute to mRNA export</title>
        <p>Our data suggested that both, NCBP2 and -3 have the ability to bind mRNA and to recruit proteins involved in RNA processing. We therefore tested whether both proteins individually contribute to nuclearâcytoplasmic transport of mRNA. In RNA-FISH experiments, depletion of either NCBP2 or -3 did not considerably change poly(A) RNA distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Remarkably, simultaneous depletion of NCBP2 and -3 trapped poly(A) RNA in the nucleus. We quantified the ratio between the nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA signal and found similar ratios for co-depletion of NCBP2 and -3 as compared with depletion of NCBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). To assess whether this is a direct effect of individual NCBP depletion or an indirect effect on expression of mRNA processing factors, we performed quantitative proteomics of siRNA-treated cells, which allows simultaneous quantification of over 5,000 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). As expected, NCBP1 was required for stability of NCBP2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>); however, we could not observe an influence on NCBP1 and -2 levels after NCBP3 knockdown and vice versa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). The abundance of mRNA processing factors such as EJC, TREX and NELF components remained similarly unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), collectively emphasizing a direct effect of NCBP depletion on poly(A) RNA export. Our data thus indicate that mRNA can be exported through the activity of either the canonical CBC consisting of NCBP1/-2 or the alternative CBC formed by NCBP1/-3. Furthermore, these data suggest that both CBCs can have functionally redundant activities under steady-state conditions.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The canonical CBC consisting of NCBP1 and -2 is considered to be one of the most fundamental parts of the biogenesis machinery of all capped RNAs. This notion is based on the involvement of the CBC in pre-mRNA splicing, 3â²-end processing, intranuclear transport, nuclearâcytoplasmic transport of RNA and nonsense-mediated decay and translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Exogenously added cap analogues impair RNA metabolism, underlining the major importance of the cap structure in this process. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody-mediated inhibition of NCBP2 only affected nuclear export of U snRNAs but not general export of mRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Using AP with synthetic capped RNA and unbiased proteinâprotein interaction studies, we identified the largely uncharacterized protein NCBP3 as a novel genuine cap-binding protein that links NCBP1 to capped RNA, and propose that NCBP1/-3 forms an alternative CBC that is involved in mRNA biogenesis.</p>
      <p>Structure-guided binding studies using recombinant NCBP3 clearly established direct cap-binding through a canonical RRM bearing a WLDD motif at the centre of the RNA-binding grove. This motif is also conserved in the canonical cap-RNA-binding protein PARN and mediates affinity to cap-RNA in the low micromolar range. In addition, NCBP3 directly binds NCBP1 when co-expressed in bacteria and thus allows formation of a protein complex with affinity to capped RNA. A direct interaction between NCBP1 and -3 is further suggested from large-scale yeast two-hybrid interaction data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Notably, NCBP2 and -3 were the only two proteins in this screen showing interaction with NCBP1 when being used either as bait or as prey. However, NCBP2 and -3 do not show an apparent homology that would suggest a shared binding mechanism to NCBP1. Both, NCBP2 and -3 have the ability to independently serve as adaptor proteins linking the RNA cap to NCBP1, and only loss of both proteins in HeLa cells reduced NCBP1 association with m<sup>7</sup>GTP. Co-depletion of NCBP2 and -3 is synthetically lethal in human und murine fibroblasts, suggesting redundancy between both proteins. This redundancy can be explained by RIP-seq experiments, showing that NCBP2 and -3 share affinity for the majority of mRNA. In addition to mRNA binding, NCBP2 but not NCBP3 has the ability to bind snRNA. Consistent with the selective affinity for snRNA, only NCBP2 binds the snRNA transport protein PHAX. Our results consolidate reports that are incompatible with the current model of a single CBC for RNA export: while inhibition of NCBP2 selectively impairs U snRNA nuclearâcytoplasmic export, but not of mRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, NCBP1 is strictly required as an adaptor for mRNA export<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is commonly accepted that EJC components, the TREX complex, PHAX and the NELF complex are recruited to RNAs by virtue of the CBC. We here show that EJC and TREX precipitate superior with NCBP3 as compared with NCBP2, whereas PHAX and the NELF complex are exclusively enriched in NCBP2 precipitates. It is tempting to speculate that binding of either NCBP2 or -3 induces a conformational change of NCBP1 that in turn allows differential binding of adaptor proteins. Structural analysis of NCBP1 in the context of NCBP2 and -3 bound to capped RNA, as well as binding assays with purified proteins will be necessary to study this in detail.</p>
      <p>Given the association with proteins of the EJC and TREX complex, NCBP3 may play a primary role in biogenesis of spliced mRNA. Such a role is supported by genetic correlation: although NCBP3 is remarkably conserved during evolution from fungi to humans, we could not find homologues for NCBP3 in <italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae</italic>. Notably, in <italic>S. cervisiae</italic> only 3% of genes contain introns and only six genes contain two introns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In contrast, the closely related <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> expresses an NCBP3 homologue and codes for introns in 43% of its genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Loss of NCBP3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> may therefore be a result of evolutionary adaptation.</p>
      <p>The canonical CBC (consisting of NCBP1/-2) guides mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Similarly, NCBP3 localizes to the nucleus and partially to the cytoplasm, suggesting that the alternative CBC drives mRNA export to the cytoplasm. RNA bound to the canonical CBC or EIF4E is sensitive to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Likewise, NCBP1/-3 associated with exported mRNA may be a target of NMD, particularly since the EJC, which co-purified with NCBP3, is known to promote NMD.</p>
      <p>Given that RNA metabolism is of central importance for all physiological and pathophysiological processes, we envisage a central role of the alternative CBC in various diseases, as known for many proteins involved in RNA splicing, 3â²-end processing and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. A reason for metazoans to evolve an alternative CBC could be the availability of an additional control mechanism to respond to environmental cues and thus allow the cell to respond swiftly to appropriate changes in gene expression. This may be particularly important under environmental stress, such as occurring during virus infection. Loss of NCBP3 increased growth of viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. The exact mechanisms in antiviral defence and the likely involvement in other diseases will be the focus of further studies. Our data show that RNA processing conveys additional complexity that may allow regulatory possibilities for both, cell intrinsic modulation as well as therapeutic intervention.</p>

        <p>To detect and quantify RNA-binding proteins and proteins bound to GFP-tagged baits by AP and MS, samples were prepared as described above. After the final three washes in TAP buffer, samples were, in addition, washed twice with TAP buffer lacking Nonidet-P40 to remove residual detergent. Three independent APs were performed for each bait. Sample preparations and LCâMS/MS analysis was performed as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Briefly, samples were sequentially digested with LysC (Wako Chemicals USA) and trypsin (Promega), acidified with 0.1% TFA, desalted with C18 stage tips and analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to MS either on Orbitrap XL or Q Exactive instruments (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For analysis of interaction proteomics data, MS raw files were processed with MaxQuant software versions 1.4.1.8 and 1.4.2.3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) using the built-in Andromeda engine to search against human and mouse proteomes (UniprotKB, release 2012_06) containing forward and reverse sequences.

Only proteins identified on the basis of at least two peptides and a minimum of three quantification events in at least one experimental group were considered. LFQ protein intensity values were log-transformed and missing values filled by imputation. Specific enrichment was determined by multiple equal variance <italic>t</italic>-tests with permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) statistics, performing 250 permutations. FDR thresholds and <italic>S</italic><sub>0</sub> parameters were empirically set to separate background from specifically enriched proteins.</p>
        <p>For total proteome analysis, HeLa cells were electroporated twice with siScrambled or siRNAs against NCBP1, NCBP2, NCBP3 or NCBP2 and NCBP3 and lysed 5 days after knockdown. Three knockdowns were performed in parallel. Cells were pulsed with SILAC Arg10- and Lys8-containing medium for the last 6âh (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (50âmM Tris pH 7.5, 4% SDS (v/v)), boiled for 5âmin at 95âÂ°C and sonicated. Fifty-microgram aliquots were reduced with 10âmM dithiothreitol, alkylated with 55âmM iodoacetamide and precipitated with 80% acetone (v/v) at â20âÂ°C overnight. Pellets were dissolved in 6âM ureaâ2âM thiourea, digested with LysC and trypsin and desalted peptides analysed by LCâMS/MS on a Q Exactive instrument. Raw MS data were processed with MaxQuant 1.5.1.6 using the LFQ and iBAQ algorithms and the Match Between Runs option only considering light labelled amino acids. LFQ intensities were log-transformed and left non-imputed.</p>
