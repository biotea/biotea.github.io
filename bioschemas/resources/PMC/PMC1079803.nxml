          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The small GTPase rab1a and its isoform rab1b are essential regulating components in the vesicle transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Rab1 is thought to act as a molecular switch and can change between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. To elucidate the function of rab1, several approaches have been established to isolate effector proteins, which interact with the activated conformation of rab1. To date p115, GM130, golgin-84 and MICAL have been identified as direct interacting partners. Together with rab1, these molecules are components of a protein complex, which mediates and regulates intracellular vesicle transport.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Here, we report the characterization of Iporin, which is similar to KIAA0375 as a novel rab1-interacting protein. It was initially identified by yeast two-hybrid screening experiments with the active mutant of rab1b (rab1b Q67R) as bait. Iporin contains a SH3 domain and two polyproline stretches, which are known to play a role in protein/protein interactions. In addition, Iporin encloses a RUN domain, which seems to be a major part of the <underline>r</underline>ab<underline>1</underline><underline>b</underline>inding domain (R1BD). Iporin is ubiquitously expressed and immunofluorescence staining displays a cytosolic punctual distribution. Interestingly, we also show that Iporin interacts with another rab1 interacting partner, the GM130 protein.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Our results demonstrate that Iporin is a potential new interacting partner of rab1. Iporin is different from already identified rab1 interacting proteins concerning protein structure and cellular localization. We conclude that Iporin might function as a link between the targeting of ER derived vesicles, triggered by the rab1 GTPase and a signaling pathway regulated by molecules containing SH3 and/or poly-proline regions. The characterization of this novel intermolecular relation could help to elucidate how vesicles find their way from ER to the Golgi apparatus.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The rab/Ypt proteins represent a large family of small GTPases involved in several transport steps of the cellular trafficking pathway. At present 11 members have been identified in yeast and more than 60 human rab proteins are supposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Small GTPases are known to function as molecular switches and can cycle between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the active conformation, the rab GTPases are localized on membranes, where they recruit specific effector molecules to mediate vesicle attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The subsequent fusion step is initiated, when the membranes are forced into close proximity by the interaction of SNARES (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) presented on both membranes in concert with SM proteins (Sec1/Munc18-like proteins), thought to act as controlling elements in SNARE interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>The two isoforms of the small GTPase rab1 (rab1a/b) are localized on ER-Golgi membranes and regulate the exocytotic transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the function of rab1 is still not fully understood, several lines of evidence describe rab1 and its yeast homolog Ypt1p GTPase as a major component in a protein complex responsible for directing vesicular traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the past, several approaches have been established to identify effector molecules that bind specifically to the active GTP-bound form of rab1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. At present, four specific effector proteins and several additional putative effector molecules are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The first characterized rab1 interacting protein was p115, which also binds to the Golgi-associated proteins GM130 and Giantin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. p115 is the mammalian homologue of the yeast protein Uso1p, which was found to be an essential component necessary for the tethering of ER-derived COP II vesicles to the Golgi compartment, a process that depends on Ypt1p, but is independent of SNARE proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, p115 plays a key role in coordinating sequential tethering and docking of COPI vesicles to Golgi membranes. Thus, it is thought to function as a linker protein between Giantin and GM130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Second, the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130 was identified as a direct rab1 effector, which also binds to a complex containing GRASP65, a lipid-anchored GM130-binding protein, that regulates Golgi stack reformation following mitosis, as well as so far uncharacterized proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A third interacting molecule of activated rab1, golgin-84, is supposed to act as a novel mitotic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Overexpression or depletion of golgin-84 results in fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon and the protein is thought to be required for the incorporation of membranes into the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Golgin-84 is a type II C-terminally anchored cis-Golgi protein with an extensive cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain, which shows structural and sequence similarity to Giantin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, golgin-84 does not appear to physically interact with other cis-Golgi matrix proteins such as GM130, p115 or GRASP65 and therefore it is likely, that additional potential golgin84-binding molecules exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recently, we identified MICAL as a fourth rab1 interacting partner and suggested a link between the Golgi apparatus associated rab1 and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we describe Iporin as a novel interacting molecule for the active GTP-bound conformation of rab1. Iporin (<underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>o</underline>f <underline>r</underline>ab1) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen with rab1b Q67R as bait and sequence analyses revealed, that the encoded protein is similar to the C-terminal half of the KIAA0375 polypeptide. The rab1b-Iporin interaction is nucleotide-dependent and rab1-specific. Interestingly, the rab1 binding motif of Iporin was mapped to a region containing a RUN domain, a protein motif, which is known to be involved in the function of small GTPases. Furthermore we examined the intracellular localization and tissue-specific expression of Iporin and give insight into its domain structure. Interestingly our results also showed an interaction with the rab1 effector GM130 via its coiled-coil region 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p>

        <title>Identification of a novel rab1 interacting protein</title>
        <p>With the rab1b Q67R mutant as bait and a human placenta cDNA library as prey we performed yeast two-hybrid screening assays to identify novel interacting partners for the active GTP-bound conformation of the small GTPase rab1b. One of the isolated clones could be identified as the human Golgi matrix protein GM130 and a second clone encoded for a fragment of MICAL1b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Another interesting clone was K17, which displayed a strong and specific interaction with rab1b Q67R in the yeast two-hybrid system (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that K17 represents the cDNA sequence encoding the C-terminus of KIAA0375 (GenBank Accession number: AB002373.2). We named the identified protein Iporin (for <underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>o</underline>f <underline>r</underline>ab1) and the deleted K17 clone Iporin ÎN847. Since the rab1 effector GM130 has been shown to interact with various rab proteins (rab1, rab2, rab33b), we wanted to investigate the rab1 specificity of the Iporin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, we used an assortment of rab cDNA molecules as bait constructs in yeast co-transformation assays (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Iporin ÎN847 (K17) induced strong growth and Î²-galactosidase activity only, when co-transformed with the permanent active mutants of rab1b (rab1bQ67R/L) and rab1a (rab1a Q70L).</p>

        <p>Interestingly, an interaction between Iporin ÎN847 and the wild type as well as the permanently active mutant of the yeast counterpart of mammalian rab1, Ypt1p, was observed pointing to a conserved interaction of these two molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The empty pAS2-1 vector, the wildtypes of the rab1 isoforms (rab1a/b), permanently inactive mutants of the rab1a/b (rab1a S25N, rab1b S22N) and Ypt1p (Ypt1 S22N) proteins were not able to significantly activate reporter gene expression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There were also no interactions of IporinÎN847 with the small GTPases rab6 and rab2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These results indicate, that the interaction with Iporin ÎN847 is rab1-specific and requires the GTP-bound, active conformation of rab1.</p>

        <title>Mapping the Iporin binding site of rab1b</title>
        <p>Next, we wanted to analyze, which structural elements of rab1b are necessary or sufficient for the interaction with Iporin. Since we already demonstrated that the hypervariable regions of rab1 are necessary for an interaction with GM130, we created rab1b mutants as well as rab1/rab6 chimeras (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The mutants and the chimeras enabled us to restrict specific regions for the interaction to the C- or N-terminal half of rab1. Co-transformation experiments in yeast revealed that only the rab1b deletion mutant rab1b Q67R ÎC197 lacking the prenylation site of rab1b showed a strong interaction with Iporin ÎN847, suggesting that the prenylation site is not necessary for the interaction with Iporin ÎN847 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The deletion mutants rab1b Q67R ÎN9, rab1b Q67R ÎC163 and rab1b Q67R ÎC163-196 failed to interact with Iporin ÎN847 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These mutants were constructed based on the model previously proposed by Bourne <italic>et al</italic>. and Valencia <italic>et al</italic>.. G1-G3 and PM1-PM3 are conserved regions in all members of the ras superfamily of GTPases, that are involved in guanine (G) and phosphate/Mg<sup>2+ </sup>(PM) binding, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. According to the proposed model suggested by Seabra and coworkers, which defined rab conserved sequences as rab family motifs (RabF1-5) and other regions as subfamily motifs (RabSF1-4), the generated mutants lack the RabSF1 or RabSF4 region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Co-transformation with the two rab1/rab6 chimeras displayed an interaction between the C1- and C2-rab1b Q67R-rab6a chimera and Iporin/Iporin ÎN847, but not between the rab6a Q72L-rab1b chimera and Iporin ÎN847 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Full-length cloning and characterization of Iporin</title>
        <p>Sequence analysis of the clone K17 cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 669 amino acids, which was identical to the C-terminal half of the protein encoded by the KIAA0375 cDNA (aa 848â1516). To obtain the full-length Iporin sequence, we used the KIAA0375 cDNA for the amplification of the sequence encoding the missing N-terminal fragment by PCR.</p>
        <p>Information about the genomic structure of Iporin protein was obtained from the human genome database. The Iporin gene consists of ~14 kb of genomic sequence and contains eleven exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p13.1) and comprises 4548 bp of coding DNA. Deduced from the cDNA sequence, Iporin comprises 1516 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 161.195 kDa and an acidic pI of 6.17. Further structure analysis revealed functional domains and motifs in the Iporin sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Iporin contains some low complexity regions, which include polyproline (pP) and polyglutamic acid (pE) stretches. The first polyproline stretch is localized between aa 429 and aa 442 with the sequence PPPGPGPDPGPSQP and a second region between aa 1311 and aa 1319 with the sequence PPQAPPP. Proline-rich stretches are known to interact with SH3 or WW domains and could mediate further protein/protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The polyglutamic acid stretch, spanning aa 1236 â 1252 with the sequence EGGEEEEEEEETEEVAE is flanked by the two proline-rich regions. This motif is highly negatively charged and may play a role in stabilizing the protein or function as further interaction domain.</p>

        <p>Using the Motif Scan Software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.org"/> we also detected a RUN (<underline>R</underline>PIP8, <underline>U</underline>NC-14 and <underline>N</underline>ESCA) domain in the Iporin sequence (aa 1031â1175; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This domain was shown to be involved in the function of small GTPases and can also be found in proteins which play a role in proliferation, differentiation and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The RUN domain is organized in six conserved blocks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; A-F), which are predicted to constitute the "core" of a globular structure. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> shows an alignment of different RUN domains containing proteins related to small GTPases like RPIP8, Rabip4, Rufy1, NESCA or Iporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. RUN domain containing proteins enclose hydrophobic amino acids in conserved positions as shown by shaded or boxed regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The secondary structure of the RUN domain core was predicted to consist of predominantly Î±-helices and the conserved three dimensional structure is probably of importance. However, the exact function of this motif is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p>
        <p>Interestingly, NESCA (<underline>n</underline>ew molecule containing <underline>S</underline>H3 at the carboxy-terminus) and Iporin share 42% of sequence homology and contain both a SH3 domain at the C-terminus. The function of NESCA is not known, but it is thought to be involved in signal transduction pathways and was recently described as a signaling adaptor which shuttles from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We used NESCA as a prey for yeast two-hybrid assays to investigate, whether NESCA might be a further interacting partner of the small GTPase rab1. However, we were not able to show an interaction between NESCA and rab1 (data not shown).</p>
        <p>BLAST searches revealed a mouse homolog of Iporin, EST clone AI840675, which shows 84% similarity to the human protein. This clone encodes 736 amino acids, which are homologous to Iporin aa 723 to 1455. The truncated mouse Iporin protein contains only a RUN domain and we suppose that it might function in a different, but related manner, to human Iporin. The C-terminus of Iporin contains a SH3 domain (aa 1447â1500), which is found in a variety of proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This domain is known to interact with polyproline domains in target molecules and is involved in transmembrane signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. To identify the interacting motif of the SH3 domain of Iporin we performed a phage displayed analysis. For this purpose we screened a fUSE5/15-mer M13 phage displayed random peptide library using purified GST-Iporin SH3 (Iporin ÎN1430) as a target. Sequencing of the cDNA from phages with a high and specific affinity towards GST-Iporin SH3 identified a new consensus motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This motif contains two prolines followed by an aliphatic amino acid (A, I, L, V), two further amino acids and a conserved methionine (PPÎ¨X<sub>2</sub>M).</p>

        <title>Mapping the rab1 binding domain of Iporin</title>
        <p>To investigate, which part of the Iporin sequence acts as a rab1 binding domain (R1BD), we generated several deletion mutants of Iporin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and tested them in yeast two-hybrid assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As expected, the N-terminus of the protein (Iporin ÎC853), which is not present in the original prey clone as well as the SH3 domain (Iporin ÎN1430) are not necessary for the interaction with rab1b and failed to activate the reporter genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Only the RUN domain-containing mutants (Iporin ÎN847, ÎN847ÎC1450, ÎN847ÎC1239, ÎN991ÎC1177, ÎN991ÎC1239 and ÎN991ÎC1450) showed growth and Î²-galactosidase activity on selection plates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Interestingly, the interaction of rab1b with the shortest RUN domain containing mutants (ÎN991ÎC1177, ÎN991ÎC1239, respectively) was weaker compared to fragments containing longer flanking sequences, which could result from protein misfolding.</p>

Our data demonstrate that full-length HA-Iporin and HA-Iporin ÎN847 seem to associate with cellular membranes or insoluble parts of cells, because major part of the proteins was detected in the P100 fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Ab</xref>). Interestingly, the HA-Iporin ÎC853 mutant, which lacks the C-terminus was highly enriched in the cytosolic fraction, indicating that parts of the C-terminus play an important role in the cellular localization of Iporin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Ab</xref>). To address the question, whether the overexpression of permanently active rab1b influences the cellular distribution of Iporin, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with vectors encoding for HA-tagged rab1b Q67L and performed further fractionations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Ac</xref>). The comparison between non-transfected and transfected HeLa cells showed, that the overexpression of HA-rab1b Q67L had no remarkable effect on the distribution of Iporin. GM130, p115 and Calnexin were used as control proteins and showed as well no significant changes.</p>
        <p>Hence our Aip519 polyclonal antibody was inapplicable for immunohistochemistry we transiently transfected HeLa cells with HA tagged Iporin and used the anti HA-antibody 16b12 for staining. The immunofluorescence shows a cytosolic pattern of HA-Iporin, enriched in small, brighter spots. However, most of the cells showed a faint perinuclear enriched fluorescence where usually the Golgi/ER structures are localized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Iporin interacts with the Golgi matrix protein GM130</title>
        <p>Surprisingly, yeast two hybrid co-transformation experiments showed an additional interaction between the two rab1 binding proteins Iporin and GM130. Mapping of the binding site of GM130 revealed, that the coiled-coil domain 6 is responsible for the interaction with Iporin, whereas GM130 coiled-coil domain 3 mediates the interaction with rab1b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To confirm the yeast data, we performed <italic>in vitro </italic>binding assays. Recombinant GST-Iporin ÎN847ÎC1239 as well as GST-Iporin ÎN1430 proteins were coupled to glutathione Sepharose beads and then incubated with HeLa SS6 cell extracts, which expressed the GM130 protein in considerable amounts. After washing steps, the bound proteins were separated by SDS-page and analyzed by Western blotting analysis using GM130 antibodies. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, only GST-Iporin ÎN847ÎC1239 is able to bind to endogenous GM130, whereas the GST-IporinÎN1430 was unable to interact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
      <p>The cellular function of the small GTPase rab1 is not fully understood, thus the identification of novel rab1 interacting molecules may help to elucidate its role in vesicular transport. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we were able to isolate Iporin as a new protein, which specifically interacts with the activated, GTP-bound conformation of rab1. Interestingly, Iporin also showed an interaction with the rab1 homolog from yeast Ypt1p, indicating that formation of this protein/protein complex is conserved during evolution.</p>
      <p>Northern blot analysis of Iporin mRNA revealed an ubiquitous expression pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Highest amounts of Iporin mRNA were observed in brain and testis, suggesting that Iporin might have a distinctive role in these tissues. Neurogenesis as well as spermatogenesis are processes that result in the production of highly polarized cells and we speculate that Iporin might act as a regulator in these cellular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>Applying a set of deletion mutants and chimeras of rab1, we demonstrated that the Iporin binding domain is localized within the N-terminal half of rab1 and that the rab1 N-terminal hypervariable region is essential for the interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast to PRA1, another known rab1 effector protein, our results show that the prenylation site of the rab1 GTPase is not necessary for the binding to Iporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. A well characterized interaction between a rab GTPase and an effector molecule is the rab3a/rabphillin-3a interacting complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The specific interaction of rab3a with rabphillin-3a is mediated through a rab3a "pocket" contributed by three rab complementary-determining regions (RabCDR), which are localized at the N- and C-terminus. The RabCDRs are proposed to form regions of variable sequences among the rab family within a structural conserved framework and act as a structural element for protein/protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This model was supported by the work of Seabra and co-workers. They defined a model of conserved regions within the rab family (RabF) and regions only conserved among the rab isoforms (RabSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Projected on a three dimensional model of rab3a, the previously described RabCDR regions are represented by the RabSF1, 3 and 4 regions. They form one interaction surface and the RabSF2 region forms another surface, almost on the opposite side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The data presented here about the interaction of the rab1b Q67R deletion mutants and the permanently active rab1b/rab6a chimeras with Iporin and Iporin Î847, respectively, revealed that the N-terminal half of rab1b, including RabSF1 and RabSF2, is essential for the interaction with Iporin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The C-terminal elements, comprising RabSF3 and RabSF4, do not play a role in the formation of the complex and may be necessary for structural reasons only. Surprisingly, this is in contrast to the results received from the rab3a/rabphillin-3a complex. Our data suggest that Iporin is able to interact with parts of both interaction surfaces. Thus, these results support the theory of a multi-protein interaction interface, where molecules can interact with different parts of both surfaces.</p>
      <p>To date, four proteins (p115, GM130, golgin-84 and MICAL) have been identified which interact specifically with the activated conformation of rab1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. GM130 is a cis-Golgi-localized coiled-coil protein, targeted to membranes via the peripheral membrane protein GRASP65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Additionally, GM130 interacts with activated rab1, rab2, rab33b, the vesicle tethering-protein p115 and as we recently observed with Iporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. p115 has been identified to play a pivotal role in docking of COPI vesicles to the Golgi membranes by recruiting GM130 and Giantin in a long tethering complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Giantin is a transmembrane protein, located on COPI vesicles and shares similarities with the recently identified golgin-84 and CASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It is worth to note, that rab1 was also shown to recruit p115 during budding to the ER-compartment to program COPII vesicles for fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another aspect, which has been discussed to be required for tethering events at the ER-Golgi stage are large multisubunit complexes like TRAPPI (transport protein particle). TRAPPI has been identified in yeast to function as tethering factor with GEF activity (guanosine exchange factor) for Ypt1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The importance of this complex for mammalian transport steps between ER and Golgi remains to be clarified, but the increasing number of rab1 interacting molecules raises the theory of a huge protein complex with rab1 in a central position. Another possibility might be that activated rab1 only mediate interactions between other proteins, e.g. Iporin and GM130, in a time or place dependent manner.</p>
      <p>Iporin displays some features that are quite different from the known rab1 interacting molecules. First GM130 as well as golgin-84 contain coiled-coil regions that are essential structural elements for the interaction with rab1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, the rab1b binding domain of p115 has not been characterized so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Iporin contains no coiled-coil regions, but interacts via a RUN domain with rab1 (see below). Second the known rab1 effector proteins are membrane-associated proteins, which are involved in tethering processes between donor and acceptor membranes at ER-Golgi compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Iporin displays a distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Abâc, 5B</xref>), which is also different from known proteins belonging to the tethering complex at Golgi membranes. Similar to MICAL, the localization of Iporin is not restricted to the ER-Golgi compartment leading to the conclusion that, in contrast to GM130 or GRASP65, Iporin is not a member of the Golgi matrix protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The cytosol/membrane fractionation of HeLa cell extracts revealed a mainly membranous association (P100) of transiently transfected and endogenous Iporin, which is an evidence for a high and stable membranous association through its function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Abâc</xref>). At this step, Iporin might recruit further proteins to form a complex needed for a regulative purpose.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the deletion mutants Iporin ÎN847 and Iporin ÎC853 show a different distribution in the S100 fraction. Iporin ÎC853 exhibits a cytosolic accumulation, which is a hint for a much weaker accessibility to membranes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Ab</xref>). This accumulation seems to be due to the missing carboxyterminal part of the protein and not the result of overexpression effects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Ab</xref>). To test the influence of overexpressed permanently active rab1b, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with HA-tagged rab1bQ67L and compared transfected to non-transfected cells. The obtained data showed no significant effect on Iporin membrane association (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5Ac</xref>). One could argue that the membrane association is not necessarily coupled to the interaction with rab1. Like GM130, which is linked via the GRASP65 protein to membranes, another protein, not yet identified, might be responsible for the attachment of Iporin to membranes. In addition, the overexpression of HA-rab1bQ67L had also no effect on the GM130 distribution, which interaction with rab1 is well characterized. Another reason could be, that for the interaction with rab1 only a limited amount of Iporin is sufficient and that the HA-rab1b Q67L compete with the GTP-bound endogenous rab1b.</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, Iporin contains a RUN and a SH3 domain as well as proline- and glutamic acid-rich regions. These motifs have been described to function as targets for protein/protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The RUN domain was previously shown to be part of the rap2 binding region and is supposed to mediate the interaction between the small GTPase rap2 and the effector protein RPIP8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In contrast, the RUN domain of Rabip4, an effector protein of the small GTPase rab4, has no influence on the interaction, but was supposed to be responsible for an association with a filamentous network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We were able to map the rab1 interacting domain to a RUN domain-containing region and we suggest a rab1-specific interacting function for the RUN domain of Iporin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Using the phage display method we identified PPÎ¨X<sub>2</sub>M as a new SH3 binding motif, which is different from the originally known PXXP motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The Iporin SH3 domain together with the polyproline regions may act as regulative targets for not yet identified interacting proteins. Such a link was recently described for the small GTPase rab5. RN-tre, a rab5-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) interacts with Grb2. This association is mediated via the SH3 domains of Grb2 and the proline-rich regions of RN-tre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our recent discovery of an additional not yet identified interaction partner of Iporin, the GM130, is a very interesting piece of the "Golgi puzzle" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As has been shown in this and previous manuscripts, both proteins, the Iporin and GM130 interact with rab1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As mentioned above, GM130 is important for vesicle docking processes at the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, where it interacts with p115. GM130 itself is recruited to ER-derived vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters by the rab1 GTPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. One could speculate, that Iporin, while interacting with rab1b, specifies the recruitment of the incoming vesicle to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi by displaying a high affinity to GM130 by finally binding to this protein. The presented data showed that the binding site of Iporin is different from other GM130 interacting proteins. p115 binds to the N-terminus, rab1b to the coiled-coiled region 3 and GRASP65 to the C-terminus of GM130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Iporin binds to the coiled-coiled region 6 which means that they could bind in several ways e.g. at the same time, one after another, two at the same time, etc.</p>
      <p>The multi-domain structure of Iporin and the cellular distribution suggest that this protein might act as an adapter or scaffold protein, which links GTPases to certain intracellular signal transduction pathways. Noteworthy, Iporin displays several features different from known rab1 effector proteins. Our data about the Iporin-rab1-GM130 association demonstrate once more, that the increasing number of protein/protein interactions at different stages of ER to Golgi transport implies a more complex regulated network as originally thought.</p>
