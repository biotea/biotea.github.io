      <abstract>
        <p>p53 is a major cellular tumor suppressor that in addition to its nuclear, transcription-dependent activity is also known to function extranuclearly. Cellular stressors such as reactive oxygen species can promote translocation of p53 into mitochondria where it acts to protect mitochondrial genome or trigger cell death via transcription-independent manner. Here we report that the mammalian homologue of yeast mitochondrial Afg1 ATPase (LACE1) promotes translocation of p53 into mitochondria. We further show that LACE1 exhibits significant pro-apoptotic activity, which is dependent on p53, and that the protein is required for normal mitochondrial respiratory function. LACE1 physically interacts with p53 and is necessary for mitomycin c-induced translocation of p53 into mitochondria. Conversely, increased expression of LACE1 partitions p53 to mitochondria, causes reduction in nuclear p53 content and induces apoptosis. Thus, LACE1 mediates mitochondrial translocation of p53 and its transcription-independent apoptosis.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Tumor suppressor p53 represents a central molecule of a complex cellular stress signaling pathway [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When activated, p53 mediates a wide range of cellular outcomes that might include cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and programmed cell death [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Under normal conditions, p53 is maintained at low levels by continuous ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Upon stimulation by various stress signals, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and activated oncogenes, p53 is stabilized and accumulates in the cell inducing cell cycle arrest and/or triggers programmed cell death [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. p53 can mediate apoptosis in a transcription-dependent and transcription-independent manner [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within the nucleus, p53 induces transcription-dependent apoptosis by the transactivation of numerous target genes including NOXA, BAX and PUMA. In contrast to well-studied transcription-dependent signaling, the transcription-independent apoptotic pathway of p53 has only recently been discovered [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mitochondrial association and translocation of p53 and molecular interactions between p53 and Bcl-2 family proteins in the mitochondria are known to play an essential role in this process [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although primarily known for its fundamental role in maintenance of nuclear genome, p53 also functions in maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), interacting with mitochondrial genome, polymerase-Î³ and mitochondrial transcription factor A [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite recent advances in characterization of the various cellular roles played by p53, important mechanisms that allow partitioning of its subcellular activity are only poorly understood.</p>
      <p>LACE1 is a mammalian homologue of yeast Afg1 (ATPase family gene 1) mitochondrial ATPase, a member of SEC18-NSF, PAS1, CDC48-VCP, TBP family of ATPases [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is an evolutionary well conserved protein that contains an ATP/GTP binding P-loop (Walker A motif) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Investigation of mouse tissues showed that LACE1 expression is markedly upregulated in heart, kidney and lactating vs. inactive breast tissues [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. LACE1 gene region was found to be downregulated in natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and an association between bipolar disorder and two SNPs in LACE1 was found [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here we have examined cellular function of LACE1 protein and found that it interacts with p53 tumor suppressor and mediates its mitochondrial translocation and apoptosis.</p>

        <title>LACE1 is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein</title>
        <p>The yeast LACE1 homologue (Afg1) was shown to be an inner mitochondrial membrane protein [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. By performing subcellular fractionation with subsequent immunoblot detection using anti-LACE1 antibody (Abcam), we found that the endogenous processed LACE1 (~50 kDa) is highly enriched in mitochondrial fractions of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Immunodetection of mtHSP70 and Î²-actin was used to control for mitochondrial fractionation efficiency. To find out whether overexpression of wild-type LACE1-FLAG (NM_145315) leads to correct mitochondrial targeting of the fusion protein, we have transiently transfected wild-type HEK293 cells with a C-FLAG-fusion human LACE1 ORF construct (OriGene Technologies). The cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and used to prepare mitochondrial fractions. Subjecting mitochondrial fractions to either sonic treatment or alkaline carbonate extraction with subsequent ultracentrifugation and immunoblotting [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] we found that the majority of LACE1-FLAG protein remained in mitochondrial pellet fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). CLPP immunoblotting was used as an example of soluble mitochondrial matrix protein, whereas PNPase immunoblotting was used as an example of membrane-associated intermembrane space protein. Taken together, these results indicate that LACE1 is mitochondrial integral membrane protein.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of LACE1 by shRNA leads to reduced PARP cleavage and to diminished activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain</title>
        <p>To enable analysis of cellular role of LACE1, we constructed five different HEK293 cell lines stably expressing miR-30-based short hairpin RNAs (shRNAmirs) targeting the human LACE1 transcript (NM_145315). Control cell line was prepared by transfecting HEK293 cells with commercially available scrambled (non-silencing) shRNAmir-containing expression vector RHS436 (Open Biosystems). Western blot analysis with previously validated antibody against LACE1 showed that two of the produced knockdown (KD) cell lines, denoted LACE1sh4 (V3LHS_344953; Open Biosystem) and LACE1sh5 (V3LHS_344954; Open Biosystems), exhibited LACE1 protein levels of less than 10% of control values, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Mitochondria play a central role in programmed cell death by regulating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether loss of LACE1 might have an impact on the rate of programmed cell death. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was assessed as an indicator of ongoing apoptosis [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Initially, PARP cleavage under constitutive conditions was assessed. Whole cell lysates were prepared from control and LACE1 KD cells and western blotted with antibody to cleaved PARP. Markedly attenuated levels of cleaved PARP were found in LACE1 KD cells when compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This result suggests that LACE1 might be involved in regulation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway.</p>
        <p>To assess the effects of LACE1 knockdown on cell viability, we examined the growth rate of LACE1 KD cells over a time course of 7 days. We found only moderate growth impairment associated with the loss of LACE1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Mitochondria are at the center of cellular bioenergetics harboring the energy-converting respiratory chain. Therefore, we next assessed the functional state of mitochondrial respiration in LACE1 KD cells by measuring the oxygen consumption of digitonin-permeabilized cells with the OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k device (OROBOROS INSTRUMENTS Corp, Innsbruck, Austria). We found significantly diminished activity of respiratory chain complex IV in LACE1 KD cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). However, the activity of complexes II and III was also significantly reduced. In contrast, the activity of respiratory complex I appeared unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). To find out whether the respiratory deficiency was due to diminished amount of selected respiratory complexes in LACE1 KD cells, we performed blue-native PAGE immunoblotting analysis of mitochondria isolated from LACE1 KD cells. Isolated mitochondria were solubilized with 1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, resolved on 5-15% blue-native PAGE gels and immunoblotted with antibodies to Cox1, Ndufb6, Core 2 and SDHA. The immunoblots revealed mostly unaffected levels of respiratory chain complexes in LACE1 KD mitochondria, with only moderate increase of complex I and slight reduction of complex III (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Loss of LACE1 leads to increased apoptotic resistance whereas its overexpression results in increased apoptotic sensitivity</title>
        <p>Since LACE1 KD cells showed substantially diminished constitutive PARP cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), we next assessed staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in these cells. Both control and LACE1 KD cells were treated with 0-h, 3-h and 6-h exposures to staurosporine (2 Î¼M) and used either for preparation of whole cell lysates or for direct immunofluorescence staining. Whole cell lysates were subsequently processed for western blotting with antibody to cleaved PARP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). For immunofluorescence, the cells were stained with antibody to cytochrome c and with DAPI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Consistently, western blotting of staurosporine treated cells showed reduced levels of cleaved PARP and cytochrome c-immunofluorescence microscopy revealed significantly milder apoptotic changes in STS-treated LACE1 KD cells, compared to identically treated controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, 2D</xref>). To confirm the cytochrome c immunofluorescence results, staurosporine treated cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation and the resulting cytoplasmic fractions were immunoblotted with antibody to cytochrome c. Western blotting detection of alfa-tubulin was used to control for equal cytoplasmic protein loading. The western blots revealed higher cytoplasmic cytochrome c content in control cells, when compared to identically treated LACE1 KD cells, confirming the immunofluorescence results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p>

            <p><bold>A.</bold> Overexpression of LACE1-FLAG in both wild-type HEK293 cells and LACE1 KD cells results in increased PARP cleavage. Wild-type HEK293 cells and LACE1 KD cells were transfected with LACE1-FLAG expression vector or with the empty vector. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed with western blotting using antibody to cleaved PARP. Antibody to Î± -tubulin was used to monitor equal protein loading. <bold>B.</bold> LACE1 KD cells exhibit increased resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis but respond normally to TNFalpha-treatment. Control and LACE1 KD cells were treated with staurosporine (STS; 2 Î¼M) or TNFalpha (10 ng/ml) and IFN-gamma (80 ng/ml) for 0, 3 and 6 hours. Whole cell lysates were prepared from treated cells and used for immunoblotting with antibody to cleaved PARP. Antibody to Î±-tubulin was used to control for equal protein loading. <bold>C.</bold> Cells were treated with staurosporine (STS; 2 Î¼M) for 0, 3 and 6 hours and then harvested and used for subcellular fractionation using dounce homogenization and differential centrifugation. The resulting cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE western blotting with antibody to cytochrome c. Western blotting of alpha-tubulin was used as loading control. <bold>D.</bold> Cells grown on coverslips were treated with staurosporine (STS; 2 Î¼M) for 0, 3 and 6 hours and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked by 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and primary detection was performed with anti-cytochrome c antibody. After secondary fluorescent detection, cells were analyzed at 24Â°C using a Nikon Diaphot 200 inverted microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 60Ã, numerical aperture 0.95, oil objective. The images were acquired with an Olympus DP50 CCD camera and Viewfinder Lite 1.0 software. Bar, 10 Î¼M. <bold>E.</bold> Whereas knockdown of LACE1 leads to moderate upregulation of <italic>PUMA</italic> and <italic>BAX</italic> mRNAs, overexpression of LACE1-FLAG results in their significant downregulation. Relative mRNA quantification was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Data were collected in duplicate in two separate runs using a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1), TUBA1A (tubulin, alpha 1a) and TBP (TATA boxâbinding protein) were used as reference genes.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To investigate whether stimulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway will affect the control and LACE1 KD cells differently, we used treatment with TNFalpha and IFN-gamma. The ongoing apoptosis was followed by western blotting detection of PARP cleavage. We found similar accumulation of cleaved PARP in both control and LACE1 KD cells after 3, 6 and 12 hours of TNFalpha and IFN-gamma treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test whether reintroduction of LACE1 into LACE1 KD background will lead to restoration of apoptotic sensitivity, we have transfected LACE1 KD cells with the LACE1-FLAG expression construct and with the empty expression vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The apoptosis was assessed by western blotting detection of cleaved PARP. The blots revealed complete restoration of PARP cleavage in LACE1 KD cells upon introduction of LACE1 but not of the empty expression vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). To substantiate the apparent pro-apoptotic activity of LACE1, wild-type HEK293 cells were transfected with the LACE1 construct or with the empty vector. Consistently, expression of LACE1 in wild-type HEK293 cells resulted in markedly increased PARP cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The higher levels of cleaved PARP in wild-type HEK293 cells, when compared to LACE1 KD cells transfected with the identical LACE1-FLAG construct can be attributed to partial RNAi clearance of LACE1-FLAG expression in LACE1 KD background.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>p53 is a major cellular tumor suppressor protein that besides its well characterized nuclear-based transcription-dependent function has the ability to translocate to mitochondria and trigger here cell death via transcription-independent manner. In the present study, we have shown an important role in subcellular partitioning of p53 and transcription-independent p53 apoptotic signaling for LACE1 protein, a putative mitochondrial ATPase. We show here that LACE1 exhibits significant pro-apoptotic activity in human HEK293 cells and normal human dermal fibroblasts and that it is required for normal function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We further demonstrate that LACE1 physically interacts with p53 and is required for mitochondrial translocation of p53 protein. We show that the LACE1-induced mitochondrial accumulation of p53 is associated with concomitant reduction in p53 nuclear content and activity. Using siRNA knockdown of p53 in normal human dermal fibroblasts we show that the LACE1-mediated apoptosis is dependent on p53.</p>
      <p>Amongst the most obvious features of LACE1 knockdown cells is the increased resistance to apoptosis and diminished activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Since overexpression of LACE1 in both LACE1 knockdown cells as well as wild-type HEK293 cells led not only to suppression of the apoptotic defect but to major apoptotic phenotype point to significant pro-apoptotic character of human LACE1. Importantly, the LACE1-mediated apoptosis is shown to depend on p53 in normal human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, although increasingly resistant to intrinsic apoptosis, the LACE1 KD cells are fully susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death. The mitochondrial rhomboid protease PARL functions anti-apoptotic in mammalian cells by controlling cristae remodeling and cytochrome c release [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hence, the markedly increased levels of PARL in LACE1 knockdown cells are consistent with their increased apoptotic resistance. Conversely, the intermembrane space serine protease Omi/HTRA2 shows significant pro-apoptotic activity, mainly through degradation of IAP (inhibitors of apoptosis) proteins [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the downregulation of Omi/HTRA2 along with concomitant upregulation of PARL is also consistent with the increased apoptotic resistance of LACE1 deficient cells.</p>
      <p>The tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated upon various stress stimuli to either support cell survival or promote apoptosis. Besides its well established nuclear, transcription-dependent function, p53 was shown to act also extranuclearly. Indeed, in response to acute cellular stress or even acute exercise, p53 can rapidly translocate into mitochondria and activate here apoptosis via fast, transcription-independent manner [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Several lines of experimental evidence support the direct involvement of LACE1 in mitochondrial partition of p53 protein. First, overexpression of LACE1 leads to dramatic increase in mitochondria-associated p53 and to concomitant reduction in nuclear p53 content accompanied by reduced expression of p53 transcription target genes BAX and PUMA. Second, the DNA damage agent mitomycin c fails to induce mitochondrial translocation and concomitant nuclear reduction of p53 in LACE1 knockdown cells. Finally, LACE1-FLAG protein expressed in LACE1 knockdown cells physically interacts with p53. The role of LACE1 in mitochondrial partition of p53 is consistent with both the significant pro-apoptotic character of LACE1 protein and with the previously reported tumor-suppressor properties of LACE1 gene region [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The unaffected levels of SCO2 in LACE1 overexpressing cells further confirm the extranuclear, transcription-independent character of LACE1-induced p53 upregulation. Besides its function in complex IV assembly, the SCO2 metallochaperone was identified as a p53 transcription target gene required for shift of cellular metabolism from glycolysis to increased OXPHOS utilization [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. On the other hand, positive genetic interaction between the mitochondrial metallopeptidase OMA1 and p53 was observed in OVCA cells, which is consistent with LACE1-induced OMA1 upregulation seen in our HEK293 knockdown model [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides its specific role in mitochondrial homeostasis and apoptosis, the subcellular partitioning of p53 into mitochondria has the potential to substantially affect its nuclear activity [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Indeed, the pattern of nuclear distribution of p53 protein is substantially affected in LACE1 KD cells. On the other hand, expression of p53 transcription target genes BAX and PUMA was found significantly diminished in LACE1 overexpressing cells. Several mechanisms have been proposed to drive the mitochondrial translocation of p53 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly to our report, one of them utilizing the mitochondrial disulfide relay protein CHCHD4 was shown to be connected to mitochondrial respiratory capacity [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The yeast homologue of human LACE1 (Afg1) was shown to be required for normal activity of respiratory complexes III and IV [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar to the yeast Afg1 deletion strain, the rather moderate respiratory defect of human LACE1 knockdown cells suggests possible redundant character of LACE1 role in respiratory chain maintenance. Given that ATP- or ADP-binding state may change biochemical property of LACE1, it is interesting to speculate that LACE1-p53 interaction could serve as an immediate apoptotic response to altered mitochondrial ATP levels. Further work is required to address the effects of LACE1-mediated subcellular p53 partitioning towards cell metabolism and proliferation.</p>

        <p>The cells were washed with PBS, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in the cell lysis buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5% Nonidet-40 and 0.5 mM PMSF] along with the protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and allowed to swell on ice for 15-20 min. The cells were then vortexed to disrupt cell membranes and then centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g at 4Â°C for 10 min. The pelleted nuclei were washed with the cell lysis buffer and resuspended in the nuclear extraction buffer [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF] with protease inhibitor cocktail and incubated in ice for 30 min. The nuclear extract was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g for 15 min at 4Â°C.</p>

        <title>High-resolution respirometry</title>
        <p>The oxygen consumption of digitonin-permeabilized cells was measured at 37Â°C using an OROBOROS Oxygraph-2k (OROBOROS INSTRUMENTS Corp, Innsbruck, Austria) in 2ml chamber with KCl-based medium containing 80mM KCl, 10mM Tris, 3mM MgCl2, 1mM EDTA, 5mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). The measurements were carried out after permeabilization of cells (manual titration) by approx. 4.1 Î¼M digitonin, protein load per chamber ranging between 0.5 â 0.9 mg, with final concentrations of substrates and inhibitors as follows: 10mM glutamate, 2.5mM malate (CI-ADP), 1mM ADP (CI/+ADP), 10mM succinate (CII), 4mM ascorbate and 0.4mM TMPD (N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine) (CIV), 0.5Î¼M rotenone, 1Î¼M antimycine A. To control for intactness of mitochondrial membranes, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (2.5Î¼M) was added after succinate. Respiration was uncoupled by 200 nM FCCP titration steps, maximum 1.5 Î¼M (CIVu), and finally inhibited by the addition of sodium azide (10 mM).</p>
