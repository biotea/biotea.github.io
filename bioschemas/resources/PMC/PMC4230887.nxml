      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">The mechanisms by which physical forces regulate endothelial cells to determine the complexities of vascular structure and function are enigmatic<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Studies of sensory neurons have suggested Piezo proteins as subunits of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cationic channels for detection of noxious mechanical impact<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Here we show Piezo1 (FAM38A) channels as sensors of frictional force (shear stress) and determinants of vascular structure in both development and adult physiology. Global or endothelial-specific disruption of mouse <italic>Piezo1</italic> profoundly disturbed the developing vasculature and was embryonic lethal within days of the heart beating. Haploinsufficiency was not lethal but endothelial abnormality was detected in mature vessels. Importance of Piezo1 channels as sensors of blood flow was shown by Piezo1 dependence of shear stress-evoked ionic current and calcium influx in endothelial cells and the ability of exogenous Piezo1 to confer sensitivity to shear stress on otherwise resistant cells. Downstream of this calcium influx was protease activity and spatial organization of endothelial cells to the polarity of the applied force. The data suggest Piezo1 channels as pivotal integrators in vascular biology.</p>

    <p id="P3">Messenger RNA encoding Piezo1 was readily detected in mouse aorta and a variety of human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). To gain insight into its significance we first investigated cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Depletion of Piezo1 by either of two short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) strongly suppressed migration of these cells towards vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2a-e</xref>), a key stimulant of angiogenesis in vivo<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. There was similar inhibitory effect of a spider toxin blocker of Piezo1 channels, GsMTx4<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and a non-specific small-molecule blocker, ruthenium red<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2f</xref>). Consistent with a relationship to endothelial cell migration, HUVEC tube formations <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> were suppressed by Piezo1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2g-j</xref>). We therefore generated mice with disrupted endogenous <italic>Piezo1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a, b</xref>). <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/â progeny appeared normal but <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â was embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). Of 49 <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â embryos the longest survival time was E16.5 and most were only E9.5-11.5, which is a critical time for vascular development<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. At E10.5, growth retardation was commonly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). At E9.5, embryos were often normal in size but yolk sac vasculature was less prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). While endothelial cells were present in yolk sacs of <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/+ and <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â embryos the structures were different, with greater disorganization and fewer defined large vessels in <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). Similar observations were made at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). The data suggest Piezo1 as a protein of critical importance in the control of vascular architecture and embryonic development.</p>
    <p id="P4">Vascular phenotype in mice with global disruption of <italic>Piezo1</italic> could arise indirectly because of requirement for Piezo1 in non-endothelial cells. Therefore we generated endothelial-specific disruption of <italic>Piezo1</italic> using cre recombinase expressed under the <italic>Tie2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d-f</xref>). This disruption of <italic>Piezo1</italic> also caused retardation of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>) and prevented development of normal yolk sac vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e, f</xref>) without stopping the heart beat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S2</xref>). The data suggest requirement specifically for endothelial Piezo1.</p>
    <p id="P5">We considered if a mechanical stimulus relevant to endothelial biology impacts on Piezo1 channels and speculated about shear stress, a frictional force arising from fluid flow. The force is sensed by endothelial cells to enable vascular development and maintain an efficient and healthy vasculature<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Seminal studies have revealed multiple participating proteins and suggested sensing via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cation channel<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> but the nature of the sensor itself and the molecular basis of the channel have remained controversial and elusive<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">Piezo1 depletion and GsMTx4 were found to suppress shear stress-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a-f</xref>). Hepatic endothelial cells from patients undergoing surgical liver resection were also investigated and had similar dependency on Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4g</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â embryonic endothelial cells had less shear stress-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4h, i</xref>). Furthermore, ionic current reversibly induced by shear stress had a current-voltage relationship (I-V) that was linear and reversed near 0 mV, as expected for Piezo1 channels<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and Piezo1 depletion suppressed the current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b-d</xref>). In cell-attached membrane patches, negative pressure used to deliver physical force evoked unitary single channel events within less than 1 s. The unitary conductance of these channels was 25.2Â±1.7 pS, consistent with Piezo1 channels<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and Piezo1 depletion depleted the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). The data suggest importance of Piezo1 channels in shear stress-sensing and the associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry of endothelial cells.</p>
    <p id="P7">To investigate if Piezo1 is sufficient for detecting shear stress we took advantage of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells which lack endogenous Piezo1<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These cells had little or no shear stress response unless exogenous wild-type (WT) human Piezo1 was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>). A natural Piezo1 mutant M2225R<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which exhibits a slower response to stretch in cell-attached patches<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> poorly reconstituted shear stress-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref>). The data suggest that Piezo1 is sufficient to confer shear stress-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p>
    <p id="P8">To shed light on the functional significance of shear stress-activated Piezo1 channels we first tracked the sub cellular localization of Piezo1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). In static conditions it was broadly distributed but in response to shear stress there was accumulation at the leading apical lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Such apical processes<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> are characteristic of early-stage alignment of endothelial cells in the direction of shear stress, a process occurring physiologically in blood vessels<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We therefore measured alignment of HUVECs and found it to be suppressed by Piezo1 depletion or GsMTx4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6c-e</xref>). Endothelial cells isolated from <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â embryos also showed less alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a, b</xref>). To investigate alignment in the adult animal we took advantage of haploinsufficiency in <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/â mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). Imaging of CD31-positive cells in arteries of these mice at 6-8 weeks revealed striking difference in the organization of the endothelial cells: a cobblestone-like appearance in <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/â and linear appearance in the direction of flow in <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/+ litter-mate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d, e</xref>). The data suggest Piezo1 channels as shear stress sensors that promote endothelial cell organization and alignment in the direction of flow.</p>
    <p id="P9">We next sought insight into downstream mechanisms. Account was taken of the fact that Piezo1 channel activity was stimulated by shear stress but also important for endothelial cell migration in the absence of shear stress. In nine membrane-patch recordings we had observed occasional 25-pS channel openings in the absence of mechanical strain, consistent with low-frequency Piezo1 channel activity without exogenous force. Therefore unbiased insight into downstream pathways was sought through titanium dioxide-trapping coupled with mass spectrometry to identify regulated proteins affected by Piezo1 depletion in static and shear stress conditions. Linked to Piezo1 under both conditions was endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), a protein with major roles in vascular biology<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Follow-up experiments confirmed reduction in total eNOS but more strikingly revealed abolition of VEGF-evoked phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 1177, a key enhancer of eNOS activity<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, in static HUVECs depleted of Piezo1 and <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/â aorta in the absence of flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7a-e</xref>). Consistent with functional relevance of coupling to eNOS, endothelial cell migration was similarly suppressed by Piezo1 depletion, eNOS depletion, and NOS inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figures 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">7f, g</xref>). The data suggest that in the absence of shear stress Piezo1 activity drives endothelial cell migration through eNOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7h</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Nitric oxide and eNOS played no role in endothelial cell alignment to shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>) but <italic>in silico</italic> pathway analysis of proteomic data from endothelial cells under shear stress highlighted clusters of proteins from actin cytoskeleton (14 proteins, <italic>P</italic>=0.018) and focal adhesions (16 proteins, <italic>P</italic>=0.002). Relevance of these proteins was also indicated by denser actin structure in Piezo1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>) and accumulation of Piezo1-GFP at the leading apical lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>) where focal adhesion turn-over becomes important as the endothelial cell adjusts to achieve alignment<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, detailed inspection of HUVEC and embryo proteomic data showed significant effects on calpain-2 and many of its known substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) which are important in the structure of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We hypothesized, therefore, that a calpain-2 system is co-regulated with Piezo1 because it is integrated as a downstream mechanism. The hypothesis is consistent with calpain-2 as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteolytic enzyme, previous association of calpain with Piezo1<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and suggested roles of calpains in focal adhesion turn-over<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and endothelial cell alignment to shear stress<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, disruption of a critical regulatory protein of calpain-2 (calpain small subunit 1) disturbs vascular development in the yolk sac at E10.5<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Consistent with this calpain hypothesis, calpain activity was significantly less in <italic>Piezo1</italic>â/â compared with <italic>Piezo1</italic>+/+ embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>), increase in calpain activity in response to shear stress was abolished by GsMTx4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>), and Piezo1-GFP localized to dissolving focal adhesions at the trailing edge of the cell as shear stress was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). Importance of Piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-entry and downstream Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation of calpain-2 was further indicated by sensitivity of alignment to the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and presence of calpain inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). Inhibitors of two other Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated mechanisms, calcineurin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). The data suggest importance of calpain activation in coupling shear stress-enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Piezo1 channels to endothelial cell organization and alignment via proteolytic cleavage of actin cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>).</p>

(on the right). Prior to collection of cell lysates, HUVECs were treated with 30 ng.mL<sup>â1</sup> VEGF (+) or no VEGF (-) for 10 min. The lysate was probed with anti-Piezo1 antibody, antibody to phosphorylated S1177 in eNOS, anti-Î²-actin antibody, and antibody to total eNOS protein. Positions of the expected proteins are indicated by the text on the right. The non-specific band at 250 kDa in the anti-Piezo1 blot is highlighted with *, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 2a, b</xref>. <bold>b</bold>, Quantitative data for the down-regulation of total eNOS after transfection of HUVECs with P1.si.1 (n=6). <bold>c</bold>, Fold-change in S1177 eNOS phosphorylation (p-eNOS) evoked by VEGF (30 ng.mL<sup>â1</sup>) in HUVECs transfected with control siRNA (sc.si). or Piezo1 siRNA (P1.si.1) (n=3 each). The grey dashed line highlights 1-fold (i.e. no change). <bold>d</bold>, Western blot for VEGF (30 ng.mL<sup>â1</sup>) evoked S1177 eNOS phosphorylation (arrow) in aorta. Aorta was dissected from Piezo1+/+ or Piezo1+/â litter-mates and allowed to equilibrate at 37 <sup>o</sup>C in culture medium without shear stress for 3 h. Aorta was then exposed to VEGF (30 ng.mL<sup>â1</sup>) (+VEGF) or not (-VEGF) for 10 min, after which lysates were generated. Proteins were probed with antibody to phosphorylation at S1177 in eNOS. The band labeled with ** was not included in the analysis. The blot was also probed with anti-Î²-actin antibody to test for equal protein loading. <bold>e</bold>, Mean data for the type of experiment exemplified in (<bold>d</bold>) (n=5 for each genotype) and presented as in (<bold>c</bold>). <bold>f</bold>, Western blotting for HUVEC lysates after transfection with control siRNA (sc.si.) or eNOS siRNAs.
