      <abstract>
        <p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediated immune response is crucial for combating pathogens and must be tightly controlled. Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are a family of proteins that is involved in a variety of biological and physiological processes. Some members of the TRIM family are important in the regulation of innate immunity. Although it has been shown that TRIM38 negatively regulates innate immunity, the mechanisms by which it does so have not been fully addressed. In this study, we demonstrated that TRIM38 negatively regulates Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated type I interferon signaling by targeting TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-Î² (TRIF). We found that overexpression of TRIM38 inhibits TLR3-mediated type I interferon signaling, whereas knockdown of TRIM38 has the reverse effects. We further showed that TRIM38 targets TRIF, a critical adaptor protein downstream of TLR3. TRIF is co-immunoprecipitated with TRIM38, and domain mapping experiments show that PRYSPRY of TRIM38 interacts with the N-terminus of TRIF. Overexpression of TRIM38 decreased expression of overexpressed and endogenous TRIF. This effect could be inhibited by MG132 treatment. Furthermore, the RING/B-box domain of TRIM38 is critical for K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRIF. Collectively, our results suggest that TRIM38 may act as a novel negative regulator for TLR3-mediated type I interferon signaling by targeting TRIF for degradation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The innate immune response against invading pathogens relies on sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) <xref rid="pone.0046825-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kingeter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Eisenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Elinav1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nucleic acids of pathogens are the major ligands of these receptors. Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is recognized by endosome TLR3 or by cytoplasmic sensors such as retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) <xref rid="pone.0046825-Koyama1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-McCartney1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Each PRR recruits downstream adaptor protein that determines the type of response by activating distinct transcription factors, which eventually induce type I interferons (IFNs) and cytokines <xref rid="pone.0046825-Werts1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-ONeill1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) interacts with RIG-I/MDA5 and mediates innate immune response by inducing the production of type I IFNs <xref rid="pone.0046825-Eisenacher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kawai2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Toll/interleulin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-Î² (TRIF) is the single adaptor molecule of TLR3. TRIF mediates activation of transcription factor IFN regulatory factor (IRF3), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1), leading to the induction of IFNs, cytokines, and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) <xref rid="pone.0046825-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Upon stimulation of TLR3, TRIF transiently couples with TLR3 and then dissociates from the receptor to recruit the downstream kinase complex via TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), leading to the production of type I IFNs <xref rid="pone.0046825-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Additionally, TRIF recruits receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and TRAF6 to induce NF-ÎºB activation <xref rid="pone.0046825-ONeill1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Meylan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>

      <p>The innate immune response is essential for controlling microbial infection. However, over-activation of the innate immune response may lead to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases <xref rid="pone.0046825-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kalliolias1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Therefore, signal transduction in the immune response must be under tight regulation to maintain immune balance. Multiple mechanisms that limit the immune response have been identified, such as degradation, phosphorylation or sequestration of signaling molecules <xref rid="pone.0046825-Komuro1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Many negative regulators reportedly exert their functions by targeting signaling molecules for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0046825-Bhoj1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For example, RING-finger protein 5 (RNF5), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes degradation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also named MITA) <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhong2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; Cbl-b negatively regulates TLR signaling through mediating degradation of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and TRIF <xref rid="pone.0046825-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins are characterized by the tripartite motif. The TRIM motif comprises a RING domain, a B-box domain and a coiled-coil region <xref rid="pone.0046825-Napolitano1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. More than 70 members of the TRIM family, which may be involved in a variety of biological and physiological processes, have been identified in humans. As the RING domain can mediate ubiquitin conjugation, many TRIM proteins have been identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases <xref rid="pone.0046825-Napolitano1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Napolitano2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Particularly, TRIM5Î±, TRIM21, and TRIM22 act as E3 ubiquitin ligases to affect viral replication directly <xref rid="pone.0046825-Eldin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Mallery1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In addition, PRYSPRY domain, a typical C-terminal domain of TRIM, mediates protein-protein interaction and plays a critical role in TRIM functions <xref rid="pone.0046825-Woo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Recent research suggests that some TRIM proteins are involved in innate immune response <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kawai3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, it is not clear if additional TRIMs regulate this process.</p>

          <p>(A) TRIM38 protein level in 293/TLR3 cell line stably expressing TRIM38-specific or non-targeting shRNA. 293/TLR3 cells were transfected with TRIM38-specific shRNA or non-targeting shRNA (NT) followed by puromycin selection and cloning. Screened cell populations were analyzed by immunoblot with an antibody specific for TRIM38. (B) Effects of TRIM38 knockdown on poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² activation. TRIM38 knockdown or control 293/TLR3 cells were transfected with IFN-Î²-luc plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were left untreated or stimulated with 100 Âµg/ml of poly(I:C) for 4 h before luciferase analysis was performed. (C) Effects of TRIM38 knockdown on poly(I:C)-induced IRF3 phosphorylation. TRIM38 knockdown or control 293/TLR3 cells were incubated with 100 Âµg/ml of poly(I:C) for 4 h before the immunoblot analysis was performed. (D, E) Effects of TRIM38 knockdown on poly(I:C)-induced transcription of IFN-Î² and ISG56 genes. Indicated cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) for 4 h, then total RNA was extracted for real-time PCR analysis. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.</p>

      <p>TRIM38 is reported to negatively regulate innate immunity <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TRIM38 negatively regulate innate immunity are not fully understood. In this report, we demonstrate that TRIM38 negatively regulates TLR3-mediated type I interferon signaling by targeting TRIF for degradation. Overexpression or knockdown of TRIM38 could inhibit or promote TLR3-mediated type I interferon signaling respectively. Mechanistically, TRIM38 is shown to interact with TRIF and mediate TRIF degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Further, we suggest that the RING/B-box domain of TRIM38 is critical for K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRIF. Our findings may provide new insights in the mechanisms for anti-viral innate immune responses that are fine tuned by TRIM family proteins.</p>

        <title>Overexpression of TRIM38 Inhibits TLR3-mediated IFN-Î² Signaling</title>
        <p>Recently, TRIM38 was shown to negatively regulate TLR-mediated NF-ÎºB activation <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, its role in the TLR-medaited pathway has not been fully elucidated. To determine if TRIM38 is involved in the TLR3-medaited pathway, we measured the mRNA and protein expression of TRIM38 in HeLa cells exposed to poly(I:C), a synthetic TLR3 agonist. Expression of TRIM38 mRNA and protein were induced at different time points after exposure of cells to poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that TRIM38 may be involved in TLR3-mediated signaling. We next investigated the effects of TRIM38 overexpression on TLR3-mediated activation of IFN-Î². 293T/TLR3 cells, which stably express TLR3 <xref rid="pone.0046825-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, were transfected with an IFN-Î² promoter-driven luciferase reporter (IFN-Î²-luc) plasmid and different amounts of a TRIM38 plasmid. After 24 h, cells were incubated with poly(I:C) for 4 h, and then luciferase activities were measured. In parallel, expression of TRIM38 was verified by immunoblot analyses. Overexpression of TRIM38 inhibited poly(I:C)-induced activation of the IFN-Î² promoter in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046825.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We also assessed the phosphorylation of IRF3, a hallmark of IRF3 activation that is required for IFN-Î² signaling. Overexpression of TRIM38 inhibited poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, we examined if overexpression of TRIM38 alters poly(I:C)-induced mRNA expression of IFN-Î² and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consistently, quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that overexpression of TRIM38 attenuated poly(I:C)-induced mRNA expression of IFN-Î² and ISG56 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g001">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that TRIM38 negatively regulates TLR3-mediated IFN-Î² signaling.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of TRIM38 Potentiates TLR3-mediated IFN-Î² Activation</title>
        <p>To confirm the role of TRIM38 in TLR3-mediated signaling, we investigated whether knockdown of endogenous TRIM38 affects TLR3-mediated IFN-Î² activation. To achieve constant knockdown of TRIM38, we generated the 293/TLR3 cell line that stably expresses TRIM38-specific or non-targeting shRNA. Cells transfected with the TRIM38-specific shRNA plasmid showed â¼70% reduction of TRIM38 expression than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We used reporter assays to determine IFN-Î² activation in these cell lines. Knockdown of TRIM38 potentiated poly(I:C)-induced activation of IFN-Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). We then analyzed the activation of IRF3 in both TRIM38 knockdown and control cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that poly(I:C)-induced IRF3 phosphorylation was significantly higher in TRIM38 knockdown cells than that in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that TRIM38 inhibits TLR3-mediated IRF3 activation. Furthermore, we used quantitative real-time PCR to assess expression of IFN-Î² and ISG56 genes in the TRIM38 knockdown cells. Exposure to poly(I:C) led to a 2â3 fold increase in IFN-Î² and ISG56 mRNA expression 4 h post-infection in the TRIM38 knockdown cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g002">Fig. 2D and E</xref>).

        <p>To investigate the potential target of TRIM38 in TLR3-mediated IFN-Î² signaling, we first determined the inhibitory effect of TRIM38 on IFN-Î² activation induced by various signaling molecules in TLR3 pathway. We transfected 293T cells with plasmids encoding TRIF, TBK1, or IKKi, together with increasing amounts of TRIM38 plasmid and an IFN-Î²-luc plasmid.

Furthermore, we determined whether TRIM38 inhibits TRIF-induced IRF3 phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis shows that TRIM38 inhibited TRIF-triggered IRF3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating that TRIF might be a target for TRIM38.</p>

        <title>TRIM38 Interacts with TRIF</title>
        <p>To further investigate the underlying mechanism of TRIM38 in poly(I:C)-induced IFN-Î² activation, we examined the interaction between TRIM38 and TRIF, TBK1 or IKKi. Results of immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that TRIM38 interacts with TRIF, but not with TBK1 or IKKi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

The N-terminus of TRIF interacts with TRIM38, whereas TIR region and the C-terminus of TRIF do not interact with TRIM38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Moreover, TRIF interacts with the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM38, and deletion of PRYSPRY domain disrupts TRIF-TRIM38 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). The results suggested that N-terminus of TRIF and PRYSPRY domain of TRIM38 are the critical regions that mediate TRIM38-TRIF interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p>

        <title>TRIM38 Promotes TRIF Degradation through Proteasome Pathway</title>
        <p>Notably, the protein levels of TRIF decreased when TRIF was co-expressed with TRIM38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Based on this observation, we speculated that TRIM38 might inhibit TRIF gene expression and/or promote TRIF degradation. To test this, we first examined whether TRIF mRNA expression was affected by TRIM38 overexpression. HeLa cells were transfected with increasing amounts of TRIM38 plasmid, with approximately 70% transfection efficiency (data not shown). At 48 h post transfection, total RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was performed. The amount of TRIF mRNA remained constant when TRIM38 was increasingly overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).This indicates that TRIM38 may not downregulate TRIF at the transcription level.</p>
        <p>We next investigated the effect of TRIM38 overexpression on TRIF protein level. HeLa cells were transfected with control or TRIF plasmid, together with increasing amounts of TRIM38 plasmid. At 48 h post transfection, cells were lysed and the expression of TRIF protein was examined using immunoblot assays. The protein levels of overexpressed TRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) and endogenous TRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) decreased in the presence of overexpressed TRIM38. In contrast, overexpression of TRIM38 did not affect the level of TRAF3, another critical signaling protein downstream of TRIF. Furthermore, we found that the protein level of endogenous TRIF decreased slightly upon poly(I:C) stimulation at various time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046825.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that TRIM38 could specifically target TRIF for protein degradation.</p>
        <p>Cellular caspases can cleave TRIF <xref rid="pone.0046825-Rebsamen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. To test whether TRIM38 mediates TRIF degradation through caspase cleavage, we examined if the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocks TRIM38-mediated degradation of TRIF. The decrease of TRIF protein was not inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), indicating that caspases may be not involved in this process. To confirm this, we analyzed a TRIF mutant carrying D281E and D289E substitutions, which is resistant to caspase cleavage <xref rid="pone.0046825-Rebsamen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Similar to wild-type TRIF, cleavage-resistant TRIF decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon TRIM38 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating that caspases do not contribute to TRIM38-mediated degradation of TRIF. Next, we used specific inhibitors of the proteasome or lysosome pathway to determine which degradation machinery could be associated with TRIM38-mediated degradation of TRIF. We found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not the lysosome inhibitor NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, blocks TRIM38-mediated degradation of TRIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>), indicating that TRIM38 mediates TRIF degradation through the proteasome pathway rather than the lysosome pathway.</p>

        <p>Considering that TRIM38 may act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase <xref rid="pone.0046825-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and that K48-linked ubiquitin chains target proteins for degradation by the proteasome pathway <xref rid="pone.0046825-Thrower1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, we examined if TRIM38 could promote K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRIF. We transfected 293T cells with control or TRIM38-Myc plasmid, together with HA-Ub and Flag-TRIF plasmids. We then immunoprecipitated TRIF using anti-Flag antibody and examined the conjugation of ubiquitin using an antibody specific for K48-linked polyubiquitin. The K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRIF was significantly induced by TRIM38 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, when TRIF was co-expressed with a TRIM38 mutant lacking the RING/B-box domain, a critical region for catalyzing ubiquitination, TRIF was not significantly ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). These results indicate that TRIM38 might mediate K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRIF through the RING/B-box domain. Furthermore, we tested the effects of RING/B-box-deleted TRIM38 on TRIF degradation and TRIF-induced activation of IFN-Î². The RING/B-box deletion mutant of TRIM38 did not mediate TRIF degradation or inhibit TRIF-induced activation of IFN-Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046825-g006">Fig. 6B and C</xref>), suggesting that RING/B-box domain is critical for TRIF degradation mediated by TRIM38.

Furthermore, our findings suggest that TRIM38 targets TRIF and promotes degradation of TRIF through K48-linked polyubiquitination. Therefore, we postulate that TRIM38 limits the excessive production of type I IFNs in response to viral infection by mediating degradation of TRIF.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitination plays an essential role in the regulation of innate immunity. The TRIM family is one of the largest families of RING-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases, and growing evidence suggests that many TRIM proteins play an important role in the regulation of innate immunity <xref rid="pone.0046825-Kawai3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For example, TRIM25 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I and triggers antiviral signaling <xref rid="pone.0046825-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. TRIM21 negatively regulates production of type I IFN-Î² by mediating proteasomal degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 <xref rid="pone.0046825-Higgs1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Higgs2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. TRIM27 (RFP) negatively regulates antiviral and inflammatory responses by targeting IKKs <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zha1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. TRIM56 facilitates dsDNA-triggered signaling by targeting STING for K63-linked polyubiquitination <xref rid="pone.0046825-Tsuchida1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. More recently, it was reported that TRIM38 negatively regulates TLR-induced activition of NF-ÎºB. That report suggests that TRIM38 targets TRAF6 and promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 for degradation, thus limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Here, we show that TRIM38 targets TRIF for degradation, implying a novel mechanism by which TRIM38 negatively regulates the innate immune response mediated by TLR3.</p>
      <p>TRIF is the critical adaptor of the TLR3-mediated immune response, coupling TLR3 and downstream signaling molecules to trigger production of type I IFNs <xref rid="pone.0046825-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Seya1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. As TRIF plays a central role in TLR3-mediated signaling, it has been suggested that TRIF is a regulatory target for both the virus and host. On the one hand, viruses target TRIF for degradation to support their sufficient replication. For example, hepatitis C virus protease NS3-4A <xref rid="pone.0046825-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and coxsackievirus B/enterovirus 71 3C<sup>pro</sup> protease target TRIF for cleavage <xref rid="pone.0046825-Lei1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046825-Mukherjee1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. On the other hand, TRIF is tightly regulated by host factors to prevent excessive immune response. For example, SARM negatively regulates TRIF-dependent TLRs signaling <xref rid="pone.0046825-Carty1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, and Integrin CD11b negatively regulates TLR-induced inflammatory responses by targeting MyD88 and TRIF for degradation <xref rid="pone.0046825-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Here, we showed that TRIM38 interacts with TRIF through the PRYSPRY domain, and promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRIF through the RING/B-box domain. We speculate a model that upon stimulation of TLR3, the protein level of TRIM38 is induced, which subsequently associates with and mediates the degradation of TRIF, thus fine-tuning both inflammation and innate immune response to pathogens.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it seems that PRYSPRY domain play an important role in innate immune regulation. The rhesus monkey TRIM5Î± blocks HIV-1 infection by recognizing HIV-1 core via PRYSPRY domain <xref rid="pone.0046825-Stremlau1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and the SPRY domain of TRIM25 mediates its association with RIG-I <xref rid="pone.0046825-Gack1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Because many TRIM family proteins exert their functions by catalyzing ubiquitination, we propose that the PRYSPRY domain of TRIMs provides a critical protein interaction interface and facilitate the association between TRIMs and substrates, thus the RING domain of TRIMs can mediate ubiquitination of the associated substrates. Further investigations will provide insights into the functional significance of the PRYSPRY domain of TRIMs.</p>
      <p>While our manuscript was in preparation, we noticed that a study of TRIM38 was published online <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Both this study and ours indicate that TRIM38 exterts its functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Zhao et al. show that TRIM38 targets NAP1 to negatively regulate TLR3/4- and RIG-I- mediated production of IFN-Î² <xref rid="pone.0046825-Zhao2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. NAP1 is thought to bridge the interaction between TRIF and TBK1 <xref rid="pone.0046825-Sasai1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Interestingly, our results indicate that TRIM38 targets TRIF. It is possible that TRIM38 may target multiple signaling molecules to control TLR3-mediated signaling. Overall, our findings show how TRIF is regulated by TRIM38 and provide new insight into the mechanism by which the TLR-mediated immune response is regulated over the course of viral infection.</p>
