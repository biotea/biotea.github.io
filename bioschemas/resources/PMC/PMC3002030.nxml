        <p>Changes in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B expression affect duration and amplitude of EphA3 phosphorylation and cell surface concentration.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Eph receptors orchestrate cell positioning during normal and oncogenic development. Their function is spatially and temporally controlled by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear and the identity of most regulatory PTPs are unknown. We demonstrate here that PTP1B governs signaling and biological activity of EphA3. Changes in PTP1B expression significantly affect duration and amplitude of EphA3 phosphorylation and biological function, whereas confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) reveals direct interactions between PTP1B and EphA3 before ligand-stimulated receptor internalization and, subsequently, on endosomes. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type (w/t) PTP1B and the [D-A] substrateâtrapping mutant decelerate ephrin-induced EphA3 trafficking in a dose-dependent manner, which reveals its role in controlling EphA3 cell surface concentration. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in areas of Eph/ephrin-mediated cellâcell contacts, the EphA3âPTP1B interaction can occur directly at the plasma membrane. Our studies for the first time provide molecular, mechanistic, and functional insights into the role of PTP1B controlling Eph/ephrin-facilitated cellular interactions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Eph RTKs) and cognate cell surface ephrin ligands orchestrate patterns of cellular organization by arranging cellâcell contacts through control of adhesive and contractile cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lackmann and Boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). They assemble multivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himanen et al., 2001</xref>) signaling clusters, which initiate Eph receptor forward signaling via conserved juxtamembrane and activation loop phosphotyrosines (PYs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2001</xref>), and reverse signaling by clustered ephrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasquale, 2008</xref>). The overall signal strength largely determines if cells respond to ephrin contact by repulsion or by adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmberg and FrisÃ©n, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wimmer-Kleikamp et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to other RTKs, specific protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are thought to control Eph activation and shape cellular responses ensuing from contacts between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lackmann and Boyd, 2008</xref>). Consistent with this notion, PTPRO controls EphA4 phosphorylation in retinal ganglion cells and modulates their sensitivity to ephrin contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shintani et al., 2006</xref>), and EphB2 activation is controlled by the leukocyte common antigen-related tyrosine phosphatase receptor (LAR-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poliakov et al., 2008</xref>), whereas elevated PTP activity in EphA3-overexpressing leukemia cells shifts the response to ephrinA5 from cellâcell repulsion to adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wimmer-Kleikamp et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, insulin secretion from pancreatic Î² cell granules, triggered by glucose-induced elevation of PTP activity, attenuates EphA5 forward and promotes ephrinA reverse signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konstantinova et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>PTP1B is a prototypic nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase, with established roles as a negative regulator of several RTKs, including the receptors for insulin, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourdeau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tonks, 2006</xref>), and as a positive modulator of integrin and cadherin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sallee et al., 2006</xref>). Within cells, PTP1B is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frangioni et al., 1992</xref>) so that its interaction with transmembrane or membrane-proximal substrates, as well as the timing and site of their dephosphorylation, poses a conceptual dilemma. Recent findings provide strong evidence for dynamic, spatially and temporally controlled interactions between PTP1B and its transmembrane or membrane-associated substrates, whereby dephosphorylation by PTP1B occurs when endocytosed RTKs transit past the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haj et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boute et al., 2003</xref>). Other studies, however, suggest that PTP1B contacts transmembrane receptors and cellâmatrix adhesion sites directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">HernÃ¡ndez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderie et al., 2007</xref>), and a recent study suggested the existence of microtubule-dependent positioning of ER-bound PTP1B to the periphery of growth cones that is stabilized by cellâcell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuentes and Arregui, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>We now demonstrate that rapid recruitment of PTP1B to the cell surface controls activity, trafficking, and function of EphA3 in cell contact with ephrinA5-expressing cells. We show that EphA3 phosphorylation and endocytosis is tightly controlled by PTP1B in normal and cancer cell lines, consequently regulating downstream cell morphological responses. Our study provides the first comprehensive evidence for a central role of PTP1B in controlling Eph receptor function by modulating the amplitude and biological consequences of Eph/ephrin signaling.</p>

        <title>PTP1B negatively regulates ephrinA5-induced EphA3 phosphorylation</title>
        <p>We reported previously that EphA3 kinase activity and biological functions are tightly controlled by tyrosine phosphatase activity, although PTPs implicated in Eph signaling, including low molecular weight PTP (LMW-PTP) and Src homology 2 domain-containing PTP 2 (SHP2), appeared not to affect EphA3 phosphorylation directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wimmer-Kleikamp et al., 2008</xref>). However, biotin-iodoacetamide labeling of reactive oxygen-sensitive cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2000</xref>) in whole cell lysates from ephrinA5-stimulated cells identified a M<sub>r</sub> 45â50-kD protein as a potential PTP that is transiently inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tonks, 2005</xref>) during EphA3 signaling (unpublished data). A matching molecular weight and circumstantial evidence suggesting that the EphA3 activation loop tyrosine was a potential substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mertins et al., 2008</xref>) prompted us to explore PTP1B for its potential role in controlling EphA3 signaling.</p>
        <p>We first tested the impact of PTP1B overexpression on EphA3 activation in EphA3-positive HEK293T (EphA3/HEK293T) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and in 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells with high endogenous EphA3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In both cell lines, expression of wild-type (w/t) PTP1B significantly reduced ephrinA5-induced EphA3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, AâC</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005035/DC1">Fig. S1 B</ext-link>), whereas overexpression of the catalytically impaired substrate trapping mutant PTP1B-[D-A] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flint et al., 1997</xref>) enhanced the duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) of EphA3 phosphorylation in stimulated and nonstimulated cells. By comparison, overexpression of T cell PTP (TC-PTP), a phosphatase with high structural and functional homology to PTP1B, had only a moderate effect on EphA3 phosphorylation in stimulated 22Rv1 cells (Fig. S1, A and B). Similarly, LMW-PTP and SHP2, which had been implicated in Eph signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parri et al., 2005</xref>), did not affect ephrin-induced EphA3 phosphorylation in EphA3/HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p>

            <p><bold>PTP1B controls ephrin-induced phosphorylation of EphA3.</bold> (A) Î±-EphA3 immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates from GFP-PTP1B, GFP-PTP1B-[D-A], or control vector-transfected EphA3/HEK293T cells, treated with ephrinA5-Fc, were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies as indicated. The ratio of phosphorylated EphA3/total EphA3 (<italic>n</italic> = 3) was estimated (densitometry); mean Â± SE are shown (error bars). (B) Î±-EphA3 immunoprecipitates and cell lysates of PTP1B, PTP1B-[D-A], or control vector (pMT2)-transfected 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells, with or without 10 min of ephrinA5 stimulation, were immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. Molecular mass standards are indicated next to the gel blots in kilodaltons. (C) EphrinA5-induced EphA3 phosphorylation in Î±-EphA3 immunoprecipitates from EphA3/HEK293T cells transfected with EGFP (control) vector, GFP-PTP1B, GFP-LMW-PTP, or GFP-SHP2, was quantified by densitometry analysis of Western blots (<italic>n</italic> = 3); mean PY-EphA3 levels, normalized to the EGFP-transfected control, Â±SE are shown (error bars; ***, P &lt; 0.001). (D) EphrinA5-induced EphA3 phosphorylation was monitored in PTP1B w/t and in control vector-transfected COS7 cells by confocal FLIM using YFP-EphA3 as fluorescence donor and Cy3.5-labeled PY72 as an acceptor. The YFP fluorescence lifetime maps are illustrated together with confocal micrographs revealing YFP-EphA3, PY, and PTP1B, the latter detected with labeled Î±-PY (<sup>Cy3.5</sup>PY72) and Î±-PTP1B (<sup>Cy5</sup>FG6) antibodies. Endogenous PTP1B (top) is shown at a higher display setting compared with recombinant w/t PTP1B (bottom). (E) The relative fraction (Î±) of membrane-proximal activated EphA3 receptors in PTP1B-overexpressing and control cells was calculated pixel-by-pixel from the ratio of the amplitude of the short lifetime component and the sum of the two amplitudes (<italic>n</italic> = 40 cells); mean Â± SE are shown (error bars; **, P &lt; 0.005). (F) The correlation between EphA3-YFP lifetimes (averaged across the whole cell) and the PTP1B expression level (determined from the fluorescence intensity of Cy5-Î±-PTP1B staining) is illustrated, where increased lifetime indicates decreased EphA3 phosphorylation. Each data point represents measurements from an individual cell.</p>

        <p>We next examined PTP1B-controlled EphA3 phosphorylation in whole cells using confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to map the energy transfer between YFP-tagged EphA3 as the fluorescence energy donor and Cy3.5-tagged anti-PY (Î±-PY) antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reynolds et al., 2003</xref>) as the fluorescence acceptor. As anticipated, ephrinA5 stimulation yielded notable FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) at the plasma membrane (PM) and in membrane-proximal vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). PY-EphA3 was also present in perinuclear compartments of stimulated and nonstimulated cells (Fig. S1 C), which likely reflects cytosolic accumulation of activated receptors present because of transient overexpression. Transfection with w/t PTP1B markedly reduced FRET (i.e., increased the YFP fluorescence lifetime) in all cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1 D), which indicates a consistent reduction in levels of ephrinA5-activated EphA3 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). A positive correlation between increasing PTP1B expression (measured as Cy5-Î±-PTP1B intensity) and increasing YFP fluorescence lifetimes (which is indicative of reduced FRET; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) implies that FRET is a genuine measure of PTP1B-catalyzed EphA3 dephosphorylation, which we observed consistently across whole cells or within relevant PM compartments (Fig. S1 D).</p>
        <p>We further assessed if PTP1B counteracts EphA3 signaling by silencing PTP1B expression in EphA3/HEK293T and in 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells using small-hairpin RNA (shRNA). In clones from both cell lines, notably reduced PTP1B expression coincided with elevated ephrinA5-induced EphA3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Although basal EphA3 phosphorylation was only moderately elevated in EphA3/HEK293T cells, we noted a prominent increase in duration and amplitude of phosphorylation in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Likewise, in PTP1B<sup>â/â</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) engineered to stably express EphA3, ephrin-induced EphA3 phosphorylation was notably enhanced and prolonged compared with their PTP1B-reconstituted counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). EphA3-transfected w/t MEFs with comparable levels of endogenous PTP1B responded to ephrinA5 stimulation with markedly increased phosphorylation, whereas transient EphA3 expression in PTP1B<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs, in addition, triggered EphA3 hyperphosphorylation even without ephrinA5 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This deregulated EphA3 activation likely reflects an acute lack of PTP control over EphA3 phosphorylation in transiently transfected cells, which lack compensatory mechanisms that would be active in stably transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p>

            <p><bold>Abrogated PTP1B expression causes enhanced and prolonged EphA3 activation.</bold> (A and B) EphA3/HEK293Ts (A) and 22Rv1 cells (B), stably transfected with PTP1B-shRNAâ or nontarget control vectorâcontaining lentiviral transduction particles, were subjected to ephrinA5 stimulation. Î±-EphA3 immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were examined by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Densitometry quantifies EphA3 phosphorylation relative to total EphA3 expression. Data are representative of at least five (A) and three (B) independent experiments, respectively. (C) The time course of ephrinA5-induced EphA3 phosphorylation in PTP1B-reconstituted or parental PTP1B<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs, both stably transfected with EphA3, was assessed by immunoblotting of anti-EphA3 immunoprecipitates using antibodies against EphA3, PY, and PTP1B, as indicated.

        <title>Association of PTP1B-[D-A] with EphA3 relies on intact tyrosine phosphorylation sites</title>
        <p>Our findings prompted us to study the interaction between YFP-EphA3 and dHcRed-PTP1B-[D-A] and map the subcellular location of PTP1B recruitment in intact cells using confocal FLIM. FRET-induced low YFP-EphA3 donor lifetimes in intracellular and in some PM-proximal compartments of nonstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, middle, yellow-orange) imply that EphA3 interacts directly with PTP1B-[D-A], even in the absence of ephrin. Stimulation with ephrinA5 resulted in a dramatic increase in PM-proximal FRET, particularly in areas of cellâcell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom), which confirmed prominent PTP1B-[D-A] recruitment to ligand-activated EphA3. Also, live-cell FLIM during ephrinA5-triggered EphA3 activation revealed a gradual decrease in YFP lifetimes (increased FRET) over 30 min, which confirmed the continued recruitment of PTP1B-[D-A] over and above the basal association observed in nonstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005035/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Interestingly, we also detected FRET in cells expressing dHcRed-PTP1B-[D-A] and GFP-tagged EphB2, which suggests that PTP1B may also control phosphorylation of EphB receptors, whereas a [C-S] substrateâtrapping mutant of LMW-PTP used in a control experiment appeared not to associate with EphA3 directly (Fig. S2 B).</p>

        <p>To assess the protein domains and/or interaction motifs responsible for the interaction between EphA3 and PTP1B-[D-A], we performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis of various mutant EphA3 proteins: mutants lacking the essential juxtamembrane and activation loop tyrosines (3Y-F), the cytoplasmic domain (Î570), or kinase domain (Î621) showed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation and marginal ([3YF] mutant) or no capacity to associate with PTP1B-[D-A] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In agreement, we did not observe FRET in PTP1B<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs coexpressing GFP-EphA3-[3Y-F] and dHcRed-PTP1B-[D-A] (Fig. S2 C), which together suggest that the presence of the EphA3 consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2001</xref>) is a prerequisite for the PTP1B-[D-A]/EphA3 association. Although truncation of the PDZ binding motif (ÎK997) did not affect phosphorylation or PTP1B-[D-A] association, by comparison both were reduced in the EphA3 sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain truncation mutant (ÎK880; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which is in line with a potential role of the SAM domain in stabilizing EphA3 signaling complexes during activation and downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stapleton et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>PTP1B directly interacts with activated EphA3 at contacts to ephrinA5-expressing cells</title>
        <p>Considering that physiological Eph-ephrin signaling is only triggered at sites of contact between Eph and ephrin-expressing cells, the question arises if the ER-resident PTP1B can contact EphA3 that is already at the cell surface. To address this notion, we cotransfected dHcRed-PTP1B-[D-A] and YFP-EphA3 into COS7 cells and analyzed their interaction with ephrinA5-expressing HEK293T cells. FLIM revealed, in addition to obvious pools of the colocalized proteins in the cytosol, conspicuous clusters of EphA3-associated PTP1B-[D-A] clearly marking PM interfaces with ephrinA5-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, yellow arrows). Using Cy3.5-labeled Î±-PY antibody as a fluorescence acceptor, FLIM suggested that these prominent sites of EphA3/PTP1B-[D-A] association corresponded with sites of marked EphA3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Of note, although FRET was not apparent in cells expressing w/t dHcRed-PTP1B as a fluorescence acceptor, their contacts with ephrinA5 cells were still lined with pronounced EphA3 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, bottom, open arrows). Together, these findings suggest that PTP1B is indeed recruited to ephrinA5âEphA3 complexes, which tether interacting cells; however, this analysis does not discern if the contact between PTP1B-[D-A] and activated EphA3 occurs at the PM or on PM-proximal, early endosomal vesicles.</p>

        <p>To address this question, we imaged PTP1B-[D-A] substrate trapping in COS 7 cells coexpressing EphA3 that is tagged on its N terminus with a biotin acceptor peptide (AP<sub>N</sub>), and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> biotin ligase (BirA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howarth and Ting, 2008</xref>). EphA3 in these AP<sub>N</sub>-EphA3/BirA COS 7 cells is constitutively biotinylated so that streptavidin (SA) conjugated to beads can be used as surface-tethered agonist that clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janes et al., 2009</xref>) and activates the biotinylated AP<sub>N</sub>-EphA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), but cannot be shed by EphA3-associated ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janes et al., 2005</xref>). This trapping of activated EphA3 at the cell surface effectively prevents ephrin-induced endocytosis and allows monitoring proteinâprotein interactions that normally may occur shortly before or during EphA3 internalization. Staining of intact (nonpermeabilized) cells with Î±-EphA3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and their analysis by confocal microscopy revealed coinciding EphA3 and GFP-PTP1B-[D-A]âassociated fluorescence accumulating around many of the SA beads, a pattern that was absent in control cells not expressing biotin ligase (âBirA) and thus lacking the capacity to tether SA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). By comparison, incubation of AP<sub>N</sub>-EphA3/HEK293T cells with Alexa Fluor 594âephrinA5âFcâcoated beads yielded notable, but considerably weaker GFP-PTP1Bâassociated fluorescence that is directly associated with the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), which confirmed that rapid and continuous ephrin cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janes et al., 2005</xref>) and endocytosis of activated EphA3 (as indicated by fluorescent cytosolic vesicles) prevents its accumulation on the beads. Collectively, these data unambiguously demonstrate the capacity of PTP1B to associate with activated EphA3 at regions of the cell surface that are in contact with a (cell) surface-bound agonist.</p>

        <p>We next tested if modulating PTP1B expression by cDNA transfection or stable shRNA-mediated silencing would impact on cell biological responses to EphA3 signaling. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrenson et al., 2002</xref>), stimulation of EphA3/HEK293T cells with preclustered ephrinA5-Fc caused pronounced contraction of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, EGFP ctrl), which is considered to be the prerequisite for cellâcell repulsion. Estimation of the cellular footprint from the actin-associated fluorescence before and after ephrinA5 treatment revealed that PTP1B overexpression significantly attenuates cytoskeletal contraction in ephrinA5-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, AâC</xref>, PTP1B w/t). Notably, cells with high exogenous PTP1B remained stretched out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, closed arrowheads), whereas neighboring cells with low/undetectable GFP-PTP1B were contracted.

To avoid uncontrolled effects due to overexpression of exogenous proteins, we selected for this assay cell lines with endogenous Eph and ephrin expression. To this end, we analyzed co-cultures of U251 glioblastoma cells and HEK293 cells with demonstrable endogenous expression of Eph and ephrin, as shown by binding of ephrinA5-Fc and EphA3-Fc, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>), and of PTP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). As expected, fluorescent-labeled HEK293 cells were segregated into distinct, partially interconnected cell clusters that are bordered by U251 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>, ctrl). Treatment with PTP1B inhibitor tightened these clusters, as indicated by reduced dispersion of fluorescence intensity peaks in corresponding 2D and 3D contour maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>, bottom; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201005035/DC1">Fig. S3, A and B</ext-link>), a significantly higher fluorescence intensity per area of cell cluster footprints, and reduced contacts (decreased branching) between cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>).

In contrast, treatment with an EphA3 kinase inhibitor significantly increased the intermingling and cell dispersion between the two cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref> and Fig. S3), as judged from decreased overall fluorescence intensity per area and an increased branching ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

As expected, preclustered ephrinA5-Fcâinduced EphA3 internalization caused a notable decrease in Alexa Fluor 594âmonoSA fluorescence, providing a measure for the change in cell surface EphA3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, â). Overexpression of either w/t PTP1B or PTP1B-[D-A] in these cells dose-dependently decreased this change, and thus the amount of internalizing EphA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Likewise, overexpression of w/t PTP1B also decreased the trafficking of endogenous EphA3 in 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells. In this case, the exogenous PTP1B-[D-A] inhibited ephrin-induced EphA3 endocytosis completely so that the EphA3 cell surface levels were increased after ephrinA5 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). In control experiments, cell surface levels of the constitutively recycling Transferrin transmembrane receptor were not influenced by exogenous PTP1B expression (Fig. S4 E), which argues against a global effect of PTP1B on receptor recycling. In agreement with confocal microscopic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>), these experiments suggest that both EphA3 dephosphorylation by elevated w/t PTP1B, as well as binding of the PTP1B-[D-A]âtrapping mutant likely blocking access to EphA3-phospho-tyrosines, markedly attenuate ephrinA5-induced EphA3 trafficking.</p>

Not surprisingly, a critical role of PTPs in controlling initiation and transduction of the underlying signals has been anticipated, but the spatial and temporal aspects of their recruitment into Eph signaling clusters have remained largely unexplored.</p>
      <p>We now demonstrate that PTP1B, a ubiquitous ER-resident phosphatase controlling the signaling of several growth factor receptors and cell adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourdeau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burridge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sallee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tonks, 2006</xref>), negatively regulates agonist-induced EphA3 phosphorylation. Unlike other RTKs, Ephs are activated in vivo only by surface-tethered ephrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lackmann and Boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasquale, 2008</xref>), whereby, as we demonstrate here, PTP1B already interacts with activated cell-surface EphA3 before endocytosis, providing an example for a mechanism that allows the ER-tethered phosphatase to access its RTK substrates at sites of cellâcell contact (unpublished data). PTP1B activity has direct consequences on EphA3 receptor trafficking and downstream biological responses: PTP1B overexpression reduces EphA3 activation at the cell surface and in cytosolic compartments, thereby decreasing ephrinA5-induced cell contraction, whereas PTP1B silencing enhances EphA3 activation and ephrin-induced cell contraction. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of EphA3 kinase activation/signaling attenuates formation of boundaries with ephrin-expressing cells, whereas inhibition of PTP1B activity and PTP1B silencing increases cellâcell repulsion and boundary formation.</p>
      <p>Eph receptors are activated in vivo within signaling clusters at the PM interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wimmer-Kleikamp et al., 2004</xref>) between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells, and phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine, releasing the kinase from the Eph juxtamembrane segment, is required for full kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiesner et al., 2006</xref>). This conformational change relieves a steric hindrance, leading to functional association of the ADAM10 metalloprotease. This then facilitates ephrin shedding and endocytosis to proceed, which indicates that control of kinase activity, ephrin shedding, and endocytosis are linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janes et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with this notion, our findings here reveal that overexpression of PTP1B results in EphA3 dephosphorylation and dose-dependent reduction in trafficking of cell surface EphA3, which suggests direct control of phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis.</p>
      <p>Notionally, it is also possible that the observed effect of PTP1B overexpression on cell surface EphA3 trafficking is caused by very rapid receptor recycling, as suggested for other transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>); thus, PTP1B inhibition was shown to extend the presence of phosphorylated insulin receptor in the endocytic recycling compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cromlish et al., 2006</xref>). To date, the kinetics and mechanics of Eph endocytosis have remained largely unexplored, and a potential effect of PTP1B overexpression on EphA3 recycling clearly warrants further analysis. Nevertheless, the finding that phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine (EphA3-Y779), a recently identified PTP1B substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mertins et al., 2008</xref>), is essential for ligand-induced endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janes et al., 2009</xref>), together with our observation that PTP1B can interact with activated EphA3 at the PM, would suggest that elevated phosphatase levels and lack of EphA3 phosphorylation affect ephrin-induced endocytosis directly. Overexpression of PTP1B-[D-A] has a very similar effect to w/t PTP1B and at high concentrations inhibits EphA3 internalization completely, though we argue for a different mechanism: its effective binding to phosphorylated EphA3 competitively blocks access to the phosphorylated activation loop tyrosine that is required for endocytosis.</p>
      <p>The interaction with EphA3 and apparent phosphatase activity of PTP1B at sites of cellâcell contact and on endosomal vesicles raises important questions about the control of PTP1B activity in different cellular compartments. It is likely that, similar to other RTKs, EphA3 activation triggers ROS production and local inhibition of PTP activity, which is gradually reversed once the endosomes have traveled into the cytosol. In the case of EGF and insulin receptors, where dephosphorylation by PTP1B occurs en route past the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haj et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boute et al., 2003</xref>), an increase in PTP1B activity toward the nucleus explains why RTK phosphorylation declines with increasing PM distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yudushkin et al., 2007</xref>) and why extended residence at the cell surface prolongs EGF receptor phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Offterdinger et al., 2004</xref>). For EphA3, our current evidence suggests that signal termination on endocytic vesicles is also facilitated through dephosphorylation by PTP1B.</p>
      <p>ER-bound PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frangioni et al., 1992</xref>) is thought to interact with transmembrane receptors mainly in the cytosol proximal to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haj et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boute et al., 2003</xref>) or after proteolytic release of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frangioni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortesio et al., 2008</xref>), although it was reported recently that PTP1B can contact some transmembrane receptors and cellâmatrix adhesion sites directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">HernÃ¡ndez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderie et al., 2007</xref>). In the case of EphA3, an RTK which generally requires contact with an ephrin-expressing cell for activation, cell surface interactions with PTP1B occur prominently at sites of cellâcell contact. However, stimulation with soluble ephrinA5 also enhanced EphA3/PTP1B interactions elsewhere on the cell surface and in endocytic vesicles, presumably because this nonphysiological activation triggers more immediate endocytosis. In line with this argument, global phospho-proteomic analysis of Eph/ephrin signaling networks revealed significant qualitative and quantitative differences when cells were stimulated with soluble, preclustered ephrins or by ephrinâcell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">JÃ¸rgensen et al., 2009</xref>). It is likely that assembly of signaling clusters with interacting cell-bound ephrins results in a local accumulation of EphA3 that promotes interaction with PTP1B already at the cell surface. Indeed, our in vitro model of this scenario, where tethered SA activates biotinylated EphA3 but cannot be cleaved and thus prevents EphA3 from leaving the cell surface, confirms this notion. In this case, distinct PTP1B-[D-A] recruitment to biotinylated EphA3 is focused to the surface of SA-conjugated beads, which indicates that the PTP1B/EphA3 interaction occurs before endocytosis. Thus, in agreement with its role in controlling EphA3 activation, trafficking, and signaling, we demonstrate that ER-bound PTP1B-[D-A] can target phosphorylated cell surface EphA3 in areas of cellâcell contact before endocytosis, thereby directing the overall outcome of Eph/ephrin-facilitated cellâcell interactions.</p>
      <p>Both EphA3 and PTP1B have documented roles in tumor development: PTP1B is implicated in growth and progression of solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lessard et al., 2010</xref>), whereas unscheduled expression of Ephs and ephrins correlates with tumor progression in a range of highly invasive and metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janes et al., 2008</xref>) where EphA3 was identified as one of the genes most frequently mutated in colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">SjÃ¶blom et al., 2006</xref>) and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2008</xref>). In view of our findings here, the balance between Eph kinase and counteracting PTP1B activity is likely to be a critical regulatory mechanism for EphA3-mediated cell positioning during tumor development and progression. In line with emerging evidence for a role of PTP1B in cell spreading, migration, and cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arregui et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortesio et al., 2008</xref>), we propose that, similar to PTPRO in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shintani et al., 2006</xref>), PTP1B acts as cell-autonomous control of Eph/ephrin-facilitated cell positioning by modulating the balance between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Ephs during embryonic as well as oncogenic development. In support of the underlying notion that PTP1B may also regulate activity of other Ephs, our FRET analysis also suggested a direct interaction of the PTP1B substrate-trapping mutant with activated EphB2.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study provides detailed molecular and mechanistic insights into phosphatase-controlled Eph receptor activation, trafficking, and cellular responses. We demonstrate for the first time that PTP1B is a principal regulator of EphA3 activity and function, and controls the steady-state concentration of cell surface EphA3. In view of emerging evidence for crosstalk between Ephs and other RTKs and adhesion receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lackmann and Boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasquale, 2008</xref>), our finding that ER-tethered PTP1B interacts with activated EphA3 at the cell surface may suggest that activated Ephs are among the PTP1B substrates that polarize the ER toward the PM and provide PTP1B access to areas of cellâcell contacts (unpublished data). Importantly, we confirm that the crucial Eph-mediated switch between cellâcell repulsion and adhesion is controlled by the activity of Eph-specific PTPs such as PTP1B. Further elucidation of the mechanisms that shift the balance between dominating PTP and dominating Eph activity will impact significantly on our understanding of Eph function in normal and oncogenic development.</p>
