        <p>PDGFRÎ± signals from cilia to control development and tumorigenesis.

      <abstract>
        <p>Primary cilia have pivotal roles as organizers of many different signaling pathways, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRÎ±) signaling, which, when aberrantly regulated, is associated with developmental disorders, tumorigenesis, and cancer. PDGFRÎ± is up-regulated during ciliogenesis, and ciliary localization of the receptor is required for its appropriate ligand-mediated activation by PDGF-AA. However, the mechanisms regulating sorting of PDGFRÎ± and feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling at the cilium are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that intraflagellar transport protein 20 (IFT20) interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b and is required for Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and internalization of PDGFRÎ± for feedback inhibition of receptor signaling. In wild-type cells treated with PDGF-AA, c-Cbl becomes enriched in the cilium, and the receptor is subsequently ubiquitinated and internalized. In contrast, in IFT20-depleted cells, PDGFRÎ± localizes aberrantly to the plasma membrane and is overactivated after ligand stimulation because of destabilization and degradation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± (PDGFRÎ±) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that controls a series of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation, in turn affecting development and tissue homeostasis of several organs. Consequently, aberrant PDGFRÎ± signaling contributes to the pathophysiology of various diseases and developmental disorders, such as fibrotic diseases, tumorigenesis, and cancer (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Olson and Soriano, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Demoulin and Montano-Almendras, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Heldin and Lennartsson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Demoulin and Essaghir, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Velghe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Farahani and Xaymardan, 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>PDGFRÎ± localizes to, and is activated at, the primary cilium in a variety of cell types (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al., 2017</xref>). In fibroblasts, ciliary PDGFRÎ± signaling involves the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 at the ciliary base to control directional cell migration (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al., 2013</xref>). PDGFRÎ± is up-regulated during concomitant growth arrest and formation of the primary cilium, and up-regulation and activation of the receptor by PDGF-AA are blocked in cycling cells and in growth-arrested mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins IFT88 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>) or IFT172 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Umberger and Caspary, 2015</xref>), which are part of the IFT-B subcomplex required for ciliogenesis (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). These findings indicate that the basal pool of PDGFRÎ± in cycling cells is not accessible at the plasma membrane for ligand-mediated receptor activation but needs to be localized to the cilium for normal signal transduction. However, the mechanisms by which PDGFRÎ± localizes to the primary cilium and how the level of PDGFRÎ± signaling at the cilium is properly balanced by feedback inhibition after ligand-induced activation of the receptor are unknown.</p>
      <p>To study the mechanisms that regulate sorting and feedback inhibition of ciliary PDGFRÎ± signaling, we investigated the role of IFT20, which is part of the ciliary IFT-B subcomplex (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, IFT20 localizes to the Golgi compartment to promote vesicular transport of selected transmembrane proteins, including polycystin-2 and opsin, to the primary cilium (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Follit et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Keady et al., 2011</xref>). IFT20 has also been assigned extraciliary functions, such as organization of the polarized trafficking of T cell receptors (TCRs) to the immune synapse (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Finetti et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Vivar et al., 2016</xref>) and trafficking procollagen from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi in osteoblasts (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Noda et al., 2016</xref>). To study the function of IFT20 in regulating PDGFRÎ± signaling, we generated an NIH3T3-based cell line that allows conditional silencing of IFT20 by doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of a shRNA targeting mouse IFT20 (NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic>). Using this approach, in which the expression of IFT20 can be down-regulated in a controlled manner, we identified IFT20 as a novel regulator of ciliary signaling, which interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b that mediate ubiquitination and internalization of PDGFRÎ± for feedback inhibition of receptor signaling. IFT20 exerts its effect through the stabilization of the Cbl proteins, which, in the absence of IFT20, undergo autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, leading to aberrant PDGFRÎ± signaling.</p>

        <title>Conditional silencing of IFT20 leads to defects in feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of IFT20 in regulating PDGFRÎ± signaling, we first depleted IFT20 by Dox treatment of NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>), which led to undetectable levels of IFT20 protein after 3 d of treatment, as assessed by Western blot (WB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>) and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>). Dox-mediated IFT20 knockdown significantly decreased the frequency of ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, e and f</xref>), as expected (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Follit et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Keady et al., 2011</xref>), whereas untreated NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells displayed normal ciliation frequencies (â¼60%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 f</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>) and showed WT localization of IFT20 at the cilium and at the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, câe</xref>). The Golgi complex was not grossly disturbed in NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells treated with Dox, as revealed by staining for giantin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>). To monitor how IFT20 affects the strength and kinetics in feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling, we next subjected growth-arrested NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells to PDGF-AA stimulation for an expanded interval (0â240 min). Interestingly, IFT20-depleted cells displayed a dramatically amplified and prolonged phosphorylation of PDGFRÎ±, AKT, and ERK1/2 as compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, g and h</xref>), suggesting that feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling is impaired in those cells. Importantly, Dox treatment itself did not elicit changes in PDGFRÎ± signaling in WT NIH3T3 cells (Fig. S1, a and b), and we furthermore found that stable expression of a GFP-tagged IFT20 allele, resistant to the IFT20 shRNA (NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic><sup>-Res</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, i and j</xref>), rescued the ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 j</xref>) and PDGFRÎ± signaling defects in Dox-treated NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, k and l</xref>), substantiating the conjecture that IFT20 is required for proper feedback inhibition of signaling. Our results also showed that up-regulation of PDGFRÎ± expression during growth arrest (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>) is not affected by IFT20 depletion (Fig. S1 c). This is in sharp contrast to the reduced PDGFRÎ± levels observed in cells lacking IFT88 (Fig. S1 d; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, IFT20 is essential for proper feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling but is not essential for up-regulation and activation of the receptor during growth arrest.</p>

Biotin-labeled proteins were enriched by pull-down with streptavidin beads, followed by WB analysis with an antibody against PDGFRÎ±. In the absence of the ligand, the level of biotinylated receptor at the cell surface and in internalized vesicles was similar in NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells with or without Dox treatment.

        <title>Silencing of IFT20 promotes autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cbl proteins</title>
        <p>Overactivation of PDGFRÎ± and markedly reduced PDGFRÎ± polyubiquitination and internalization upon ligand stimulation in IFT20-deficient cells point to a crucial function of IFT20 in establishing a competent E3-ubiquitin ligase-dependent, negative feedback mechanism in PDGFRÎ± signaling. Because PDGF receptors are bona fide substrates of two proximal RING finger E3-ubiquitin ligase paralogs, designated as c-Cbl and Cbl-b (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bonita et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Miyake et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mohapatra et al., 2013</xref>), we asked whether the activity or expression of these Cbl proteins was affected in IFT20-depleted cells. First, we found that Cbl-b protein levels are up-regulated upon serum starvationâinduced ciliogenesis in NIH3T3 and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) 1 cells, whereas the level of c-Cbl was unaffected by serum depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>), suggesting that Cbl-b may carry out specific functions associated with growth arrest or ciliary signaling events or both. Time-course experiments in NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells revealed that c-Cbl and Cbl-b levels declined concomitant with the reduction in IFT20 levels. The levels of c-Cbl and Cbl-b were significantly reduced after 2 d of Dox treatment and were barely detectable after 6 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). Likewise, reduced levels of c-Cbl were also detected in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 239T cells transfected with shRNA against IFT20 (Fig. S2 b). In contrast, protein levels of those ubiquitin ligases were largely unaffected in WT NIH3T3 cells subjected to siRNA-mediated depletion of IFT88 (Fig. S2 c) as well as in knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking IFT172 or the kinesin II motor subunit Kif3a (Fig. S2 d), both required for formation of primary cilia (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Taschner and Lorentzen, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the effect of IFT20 depletion on Cbl protein stability seems not to be solely a consequence of ciliary loss. Further, the reduction in c-Cbl and Cbl-b levels in Dox-treated NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells was a specific consequence of the IFT20 depletion because Cbl protein levels could be significantly restored in Dox-treated NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic><sup>-Res</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 i</xref>), and no decrease in their levels could be observed in Dox-treated WT NIH3T3 cells (Fig. S2 e). Moreover, NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells that had been serum starved before IFT20 depletion showed a similar reduction in c-Cbl levels after 6 d of Dox treatment (Fig. S2, f and g), indicating that the observed decline in c-Cbl protein levels was not secondary to cell cycle defects. In addition, knockdown of c-Cbl by siRNA in WT NIH3T3 and RPE-1 cells reduced IFT20 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>), without decreasing the level of <italic>Ift20</italic> mRNA (Fig. S2 h), supporting the conclusion of a functional and biochemical interdependence between IFT20 and c-Cbl on the protein level.</p>

        <p>Assessment of mRNA levels by quantitative, real-time PCR revealed no significant difference between <italic>c-Cbl</italic> and <italic>Cbl-b</italic> mRNA levels from untreated versus Dox-treated (for 6 d) NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref>), highlighting that reduced amounts of Cbl proteins in IFT20-depleted cells manifest at a posttranscriptional level. Because c-Cbl can modulate its own turnover by a negative feedback mechanism that involves autoubiquitination (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2006</xref>), we studied whether cellular loss of IFT20 triggers autoubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of c-Cbl. Blocking proteasomal degradation by the addition of MG-132 substantially restored the amount of c-Cbl in Dox-treated NIH3T3<sup>shIFT20</sup> cells, whereas lysosomal inhibition by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl showed no obvious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref>). Supportively, IFT20 depletion caused excessive c-Cbl polyubiquitination, evident by the increase in low-mobility ubiquitin species in c-Cbl immunoprecipitates, which was paralleled by a concomitant reduction in c-Cbl protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 f</xref>). To investigate whether c-Cbl degradation was a result of autoubiquitination, we generated two NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cell lines that stably expressed human FLAGâtagged WT c-Cbl (NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic><sup>,FLAGâc-Cbl-WT</sup>) or RING-finger mutant c-Cbl (NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20,</sup></italic><sup>FLAGâc-Cbl,*RING</sup>). When IFT20 was depleted, FLAG-tagged, WT c-Cbl was depleted to an extent similar to the corresponding, endogenous c-Cbl protein, whereas the stability of RING-mutated c-Cbl remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 g</xref>), demonstrating that the process leading to c-Cbl degradation requires its innate enzyme activity. Further, because the ability of Cbl proteins to form dimers is crucial to establish a negative-feedback response to activated PDGFRÎ± signaling (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kozlov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Peschard et al., 2007</xref>), we evaluated whether c-Cbl could dimerize in the absence of IFT20. Therefore, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged RING-mutant c-Cbl (GFP-c-Cbl<sup>*RING</sup>) in NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20,</sup></italic><sup>FLAGâc-Cbl*RING</sup> cells and monitored the amount of GFP-tagged c-Cbl<sup>*RING</sup> in FLAG immunoprecipitates under untreated and Dox-treated conditions. Thereby, a change in the amount of GFP-tagged c-Cbl<sup>*RING</sup> could be assessed, independent of autoubiquitination and degradation of the protein. We found that c-Cbl homodimers were unstable in IFT20-deficient cells, which was evident by the reduction in coprecipitated, GFP-tagged c-Cbl<sup>*RING</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 h</xref>), indicating that IFT20 is also required to promote formation of stable c-Cbl dimers.</p>
        <p>To confirm those findings, we tested whether defects in the feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling in IFT20-depleted cells could be phenocopied by depletion of Cbl proteins. We performed siRNA knockdown experiments in WT NIH3T3 cells and examined activation of PDGFRÎ± and AKT upon PDGF-AA stimulation in serum-starved cells. Interestingly, a significant increase and prolongation of PDGFRÎ± signaling was only detected in cells depleted for both c-Cbl and Cbl-b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, i and j</xref>), which is consistent with our findings in IFT20-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, gâi</xref>). To our knowledge, this result demonstrates for the first time that removal of both Cbl ubiquitin ligases is required for efficient down-regulation of PDGFRÎ± signaling.</p>

        <title>IFT20 interacts with Cbl proteins, and c-Cbl is targeted to the cilium upon PDGF-AA stimulation</title>
        <p>Because IFT20 is required for stability and function of c-Cbl and Cbl-b, we then asked whether those proteins interact physically with IFT20. We initially evaluated such an interaction with a FLAGâIFT20 IP assay in HEK293T-cell extracts and mass spectrometric analysis of coprecipitated immunocomplexes. We found c-Cbl to coprecipitate with FLAGâIFT20 (Fig. S3 a and Table S1), and that interaction was confirmed by IP of FLAG-tagged c-Cbl (FLAGâc-Cbl<sup>WT</sup>) when GFP-tagged IFT20 was coprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Supportively, IP of endogenous proteins demonstrated binding of c-Cbl to IFT20 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, b and c</xref>), suggesting that those proteins interact physically. Because heterodimerization of c-Cbl and Cbl-b relies on their C-terminal ubiquitin-associated/leucine zipper domains (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rorsman et al., 2016</xref>), we further asked whether Cbl-b might participate in an IFT20âc-Cbl complex. Initially, we found that Cbl-b was immunoprecipitated with FLAGâc-Cbl<sup>WT</sup> as well as with a defective form of ubiquitin ligase carrying the mutation p.C381A in the RING-finger domain of c-Cbl (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Waterman et al., 1999</xref>; FLAGâc-Cbl<sup>*RING</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 d</xref>), indicating that the interaction between c-Cbl and Cbl-b was independent of ubiquitin ligase activity. Indeed, reciprocal IFT20 pulldown of cell extracts from FLAGâc-Cbl expressing cells coprecipitated both endogenous Cbl-b and FLAGâc-Cbl. Interestingly, although the protein levels of IFT20 in those cells remained unchanged, IFT20 appeared to bind more avidly to RING-mutated FLAGâc-Cbl and Cbl-b than it did with WT FLAGâc-Cbl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 e</xref>). Despite those findings, size-exclusion chromatography of extracts from HEK293T cells revealed only a minor overlap between the elution profile of IFT20 and those of c-Cbl and Cbl-b (Fig. S3 b), suggesting that only a fraction of the cellular IFT20 was complexed with the Cbl proteins. This is not surprising given that IFT20 is an integral component of the IFT-B subcomplex (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Taschner et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that only a portion of cellular IFT20 interacts physically with both c-Cbl and Cbl-b and that the interaction between IFT20 and Cbl-b may, in part, be mediated through binding to c-Cbl, although that conjecture requires further examination.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether a link exists between IFT20 interaction and the function of Cbl proteins in the primary cilium, we monitored the localization of c-Cbl in the presence and in the absence of PDGF-AA in ciliated WT NIH3T3 and inner medullary collecting duct 3 (IMCD3) cells by IFM analysis. Initially, GFP-tagged c-Cbl was shown to localize predominantly at the base and the proximal part of the primary cilium as well as in the Golgi complex in unstimulated NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, fâi</xref>). After 10 min of PDGF-AA stimulation, endogenous c-Cbl was enriched in the primary cilium, whereas Golgi localization was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, jâl</xref>). Based on those observations, we suggest that the Golgi complex and the ciliary-base region are potential compartments for interaction between IFT20 and Cbl proteins and that the Cbl proteins are recruited to the cilium to initiate feedback inhibition of activated PDGFRÎ±.</p>

        <p>Because PDGFRÎ± is labeled at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>) and is capable of being activated by PDGF-AA in IFT20-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, g and h</xref>), we inferred that the receptor under those circumstances was aberrantly localized to the cell surface outside the primary cilium.

In growth-arrested, untreated cells, the GFP-tagged receptor localized to the primary cilium, in the Golgi, and at the perinuclear region surrounding the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, a and c</xref>), as previously described for RPE-1 cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, GFPâPDGFRÎ± localization was more dispersed throughout the cytosol in IFT20-deficient cells, with part of the receptor population localizing at the plasma membrane and often to patches at that site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, a and e</xref>). Similar results were obtained for endogenous PDGFRÎ± in NIH3T3<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>IFT20</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 d</xref>), whereas in WT NIH3T3 cells treated with Dox, the receptor was undetectable at the plasma membrane (Fig. S3 c). Quantification of GFPâPDGFRÎ± fluorescence intensity, in a 5-Âµm region spanning from the cell surface into the cell, revealed significantly more of the receptor close to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, e and f</xref>). Similarly, GFP-tagged PDGFRÎ± was also enriched at the lamellipodium of migrating cells deficient for IFT20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 g</xref>), indicating that localization of the receptor to the plasma membrane in the absence of IFT20 is linked to cell polarity.

Under those conditions, GFP-tagged PDGFRÎ± was similarly localized toward the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 h</xref>) and prominently confined in puncta along extensive cellular protrusions (Fig. S3 d). These results underscore the functional relationship between IFT20 and Cbl proteins in receptor sorting and modulation of PDGFRÎ± signaling.</p>

In the presence of IFT20 (left), PDGFRÎ± is activated with proper feedback inhibition at the primary cilium, but in IFT20-depleted cells with defective ciliogenesis (right), PDGFRÎ± mislocalizes to the plasma membrane from where the receptor is overactivated because of autoubiquitination-induced degradation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b.</p>

        <p>Our results support the conclusion that defects in IFT proteins and ciliary trafficking affect PDGFRÎ± signaling by different mechanisms. In contrast to IFT20 depletion, fibroblasts lacking IFT88 and IFT172 have reduced PDGFRÎ± expression, and the receptor cannot be activated by stimulation with PDGF-AA (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Umberger and Caspary, 2015</xref>). There are several possibilities to explain those differences. Based on our findings, one model would be that IFT20 in collaboration with c-Cbl and Cbl-b ensures targeting of PDGFRÎ± from the Golgi complex to the cilium and, at the same time, impedes localization in the plasma membrane. Whether trafficking from the Golgi complex to the cilium follows a direct pathway or is regulated via recycling endosomes from the plasma membrane, as shown for polycystin-2 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Monis et al., 2017</xref>), remains unknown. Upon PDGF-AA binding to the receptor, Cbl proteins accumulate in the primary cilium to coordinate the processes of receptor ubiquitination and internalization for balanced feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 i</xref>). However, further investigations are required to understand whether that accumulation is caused by changes in the rate of ciliary entry or the rate of ciliary exit of the proteins and whether ciliary accumulation is regulated by interaction with IFT20 or by other proteins in the cilium proper. In particular, IFT20 appears to be especially important for complex integrity because depletion of IFT20, but not IFT88 or IFT172, results in degradation of both Cbl proteins, whereas depletion of one of the Cbl proteins alone seems to have little effect on the stability of the other paralog. In support of that understanding, only codepletion of c-Cbl and Cbl-b caused overactivation of PDGFRÎ± signaling and receptor localization to the plasma membrane, thus phenocopying IFT20 knockdown and underscoring the importance of IFT20 for maintenance of the stability and function of Cbl proteins. Interestingly, fibroblasts deficient in the IFT-A subcomplex protein IFT122, which display swollen or bulgy cilia because of defective, retrograde IFT (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ocbina et al., 2011</xref>), show normal levels of PDGFRÎ±, which can be activated by short term stimulation with PDGF-AA (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Umberger and Caspary, 2015</xref>), indicating that the receptor in those cells is targeted to the cilium for activation. However, because IFT122 has been shown to regulate the balanced output of cellular signaling through the coordinated trafficking of signaling constituents out of the cilium, such as in Hedgehog signaling (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2011</xref>), we surmise that feedback inhibition PDGFRÎ± signaling in IFT122-deficient fibroblasts could be affected in IFT122-deficient cells, although that is speculative at this point.</p>
        <p>Finally, it will be important to investigate whether the interaction between IFT20 and Cbl proteins also occurs in cell types other than fibroblasts and whether such interplay is disrupted in disease. IFT20 governs clustering of a functional TCR/CD3 complex containing LAT at the immune synapse in T cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Finetti et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Vivar et al., 2016</xref>), and Cbl proteins also have important roles in TCR turnover, and mutations in c-Cbl cause leukemia and autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liyasova et al., 2015</xref>). In a recent study, osteoblasts derived from IFT20 knockout mice embryos were shown to display mildly reduced AKT phosphorylation in response to short term stimulation with PDGF-AA (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Noda et al., 2016</xref>). Although that study did not address the role of IFT20 in modulation of feedback inhibition of PDGFRÎ± signaling during long-term stimulation with PDGF-AA, there might be cell typeâspecific differences or adaptations because of the long-lasting lack of IFT20 and Cbl proteins in mutant osteoblasts. Thus, investigating Cbl proteins in that context would be very informative toward elucidating how cells compensate to survive those deleterious effects and become tumorigenic. Indeed, aberrant PDGFRÎ± signaling has been linked to a broad range of human pathologies, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andrae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Corless et al., 2011</xref>) and glioblastoma (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Heldin and Lennartsson, 2013</xref>), and defects in Cbl proteins account for the pathogenesis of leukemia and autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liyasova et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, defects in the function of primary cilia have been associated with tumorigenesis and cancer (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Seeger-Nukpezah et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
