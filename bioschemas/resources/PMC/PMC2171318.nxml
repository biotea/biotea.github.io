      <abstract>
        <p>For epithelia to function as barriers, the intercellular space must be sealed. Sealing two adjacent cells at bicellular tight junctions (bTJs) is well described with the discovery of the claudins. Yet, there are still barrier weak points at tricellular contacts, where three cells join together. In this study, we identify tricellulin, the first integral membrane protein that is concentrated at the vertically oriented TJ strands of tricellular contacts. When tricellulin expression was suppressed with RNA interference, the epithelial barrier was compromised, and tricellular contacts and bTJs were disorganized. These findings indicate the critical function of tricellulin for formation of the epithelial barrier.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tight junctions (TJs) prevent the leakage of solutes through the paracellular pathway of epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Matter and Balda, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Schneeberger and Lynch, 2004</xref>) and are indispensable in establishing the various compositionally distinct fluid compartments within the body of multicellular organisms. Ultrathin section electron microscopy demonstrates that TJs consist of discrete sites of apparent fusion involving the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of adjacent cells (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Farquhar and Palade, 1963</xref>). On freeze-fracture electron microscopy, TJs appear as a set of continuous, anastomosing intramembranous particle strands (TJ strands; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin et al., 1969</xref>). Each TJ strand associates laterally with another TJ strand in the apposing membranes of adjacent cells to form âpairedâ TJ strands, where the intercellular space is largely obliterated (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>To be more exact, these TJs should be called bicellular TJs (bTJs) between two adjacent cells. At tricellular contacts, where there are three epithelial cells, TJs have been thought to be structurally specialized and are referred to as tricellular TJs (tTJs). The ultrastructure of tTJs has been examined in detail by freeze-fracture replica electron microscopy (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Friend and Gilula, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wade and Karnovsky, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 1985</xref>). As schematically drawn in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the bTJs are discontinuous at tricellular contacts. As bTJs approach a tricellular contact region, their network extends basolaterally. The central area of these vertically oriented tTJs is composed of three pairs of TJ strands called central sealing elements (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin, 1973</xref>), which appear as vertical extensions of the most apical paired strands of the bTJs. At the corner of tricellular contacts, two vertical strands of central sealing elements are associated tightly and laterally within individual plasma membranes, resulting in the formation of a central tube that could be a weak point for the epithelial barrier. From the viewpoint of the epithelial barrier, these two TJ types, bTJs and tTJs, should be considered separately, although the distinction has been largely ignored.</p>

      <p>The first constituent of bTJ strands to be identified was occludin (â¼60 kD; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Furuse et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ando-Akatsuka et al., 1996</xref>), which consists of four transmembrane domains (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita and Furuse, 1999</xref>) and was initially thought to be a major constituent of bTJ strands. However, gene knockout analyses revealed that bTJ strands can be formed and function as barriers in the absence of occludin (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Saitou et al., 1998</xref>). Using occludin as a probe, a large family of claudins (â¼23 kD) with 24 family members was subsequently identified as a major constituent of bTJ strands (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Furuse et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita and Furuse, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>). Claudins also bear four transmembrane domains but do not show any sequence similarity to occludin. Interestingly, when expressed in mouse L fibroblasts, each of the different claudin species polymerized within the plasma membrane to reconstitute paired strands at cellâcell contact regions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Furuse et al., 1998b</xref>). Claudins and occludin are also found at tTJs, but, to date, no proteins have been identified to be specifically concentrated at tTJs.</p>
      <p>TJs completely disappear during epithelialâmesenchymal transition, a process by which epithelial cells lose their polarity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hay, 1995</xref>). Recently, Snail, a transcription repressor, was shown to play a central role in epithelialâmesenchymal transition (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Nieto, 2002</xref>). In cultured mouse Eph4 epithelial cells expressing Snail (Eph4-mSnail cells), the transcription of claudins and occludin were completely repressed (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ikenouchi et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the expression of as yet unidentified bTJ- and tTJ-related integral membrane proteins, if any, might also be suppressed by Snail. We then screened high density oligonucleotide microarrays representing â¼24,000 mouse genes for transcripts, whose levels were undetectable in Eph4-mSnail cells compared with parental Eph4 cells (unpublished data), and identified several tetraspan proteins as targets of Snail in addition to claudins and occludin. Interestingly, one of them was uniquely concentrated at tricellular contacts in epithelial cellular sheets, and we named this protein tricellulin. In this study, we show the unique tricellular localization of this protein both at immunofluorescence and electron microscopic levels and clarify its important function in the epithelial barrier through RNA interference (RNAi) analyses.</p>

        <title>Structure and expression of tricellulin</title>
        <p>Full-length cDNA encoding tricellulin was isolated from a mouse kidney cDNA library and has an ORF encoding a 555âamino acid polypeptide (63.6 kD) with four predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1</ext-link>). Immunofluorescence staining of cultured cells suggested that both the NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini of tricellulin were located in the cytoplasm, as depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A. Interestingly, the COOH-terminal sequence (â¼130 amino acids) was conserved between tricellulin and occludin; in occludin, this region was reported to be remarkably conserved among various vertebrate species (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ando-Akatsuka et al., 1996</xref>) and to contain a domain responsible for its association with ZO-1, a major TJ plaque protein (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Furuse et al., 1994</xref>). Northern analysis showed that tricellulin mRNA was expressed in large amounts in epithelium-derived tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). When the whole cell lysate of mouse epithelial cell lines (Eph4, CSG1, and MTD1A) was resolved by electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-tricellulin pAb, tricellulin migrated as multiple bands in the <italic>Mr</italic> range of 66â72 kD, and the band of the lowest <italic>Mr</italic> was predominant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). On alkaline phosphatase treatment of the lysate of Eph4 cells, these multiple bands converged into the lowest <italic>Mr</italic> band, suggesting that, similar to occludin (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Sakakibara et al., 1997</xref>), tricellulin is phosphorylated within cells. Furthermore, it was confirmed also at the protein level that the expression of tricellulin was repressed completely by Snail.</p>

<bold>Structure and expression of mouse tricellulin.</bold> (A) Membrane folding models for mouse tricellulin and occludin. Tricellulin and occludin share two structural characteristics in addition to bearing four transmembrane domains: (1) The first extracellular loop has a high content of tyrosine and glycine residues (Fig. S1 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1</ext-link>). (2) The COOH-terminal (C) â¼130 amino acids are 32% identical (boxed in red; Fig. S1 C). It should be noted that tricellulin bears a longer NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal (N) cytoplasmic domain (187 amino acids) as compared with occludin (61 amino acids). (B) Northern blotting. Both tricellulin (Tric) and occludin (Occ) are expressed in large amounts in epithelium-derived tissues. rRNA, ribosomal RNA. (C) Immunoblotting of cultured mouse epithelial cells. The total lysate of Eph4 cells exogenously expressing mouse Snail (Eph4-mSnail; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ikenouchi et al., 2003</xref>), Eph4 cells, CSG1 cells, and MTD1A cells were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-tricellulin pAb. Tricellulin was detected as multiple bands in Eph4, CSG1, and MTD1A cells, but after alkaline phosphatase treatment, there was only a single, smaller <italic>Mr</italic> band (Eph4 + AP). In Eph4-mSnail cells, tricellulin is undetectable.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>As it has been believed that there is no structurally related protein to occludin, it was an unexpected finding that tricellulin has some structural similarities to occludin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A and Fig. S1). The genes encoding these two proteins are located in tandem on mouse chromosome 13 and human chromosome 5, suggesting that they may have been duplicated during phylogenic evolution.</p>

        <title>Tricellular localization of tricellulin</title>
        <p>We then examined the subcellular distribution of tricellulin: immunofluorescently stained frozen sections of epithelial cellular sheets such as the small intestine, stomach, and kidney, doubly with anti-tricellulin pAb and anti-occludin mAb, showed a unique staining pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A) predominantly localized to the tricellular contacts. There are also weaker signals at bTJs between two adjacent cells, especially in the small intestine. When the confluent cellular sheets of the mouse epithelial cell line Eph4 were double stained with anti-tricellulin pAb and anti-occludin mAb, tricellulin was again characteristically concentrated at each tricellular contact as dots where three occludin-positive lines converged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). In vertical confocal microscopic images generated at the tricellular contacts, tricellulin-positive structures appear as vertically oriented short rods, whereas occludin was concentrated as dots only in the most apical region of these rods. A similar tricellular contactâspecific concentration of tricellulin was observed in other epithelial cell lines such as mouse MTD1A cells, CSG1 cells, and dog MDCK II cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). To confirm the specificity of the unique staining pattern with anti-tricellulin pAb, we then performed transfection experiments. When HA-tagged tricellulin was exogenously expressed in Eph4 cells followed by double staining with anti-HA pAb and anti-occludin mAb, HA-tagged tricellulin was predominantly recruited to the tricellular contacts, although it was also recruited in small amounts to bTJs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B).</p>

        <p>However, the possibility cannot be completely excluded that the tricellular localization of tricellulin is an artifact of image acquisition (e.g., gain settings and antibody affinities). We examined the tricellulin and occludin staining patterns at Eph4 cells with a diluted series of respective antibodies (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1</ext-link>). With the diluted antibodies, the tricellular contacts were clearly and specifically marked by anti-tricellulin pAb, whereas occludin did not show any tricellular concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the tricellular localization of tricellulin truly reflects a unique TJ domain.</p>
        <p>The ultrastructure of tTJs is summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (see Introduction). We then examined in which portions of these specialized tTJ structures tricellulin is localized using Eph4 cells by immunofreeze-fracture replica electron microscopy (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>). Interestingly, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, the central sealing elements were specifically labeled. Taking the intrinsic resolution of immunogold labeling (20â25 nm) into consideration, most of the immunogold particles appear to label the central sealing elements themselves (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>). This labeling pattern was highly consistent with the tricellulin ârodsâ revealed by confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B).</p>
        <p>As discussed above, tricellulin and occludin may have been duplicated during phylogenic evolution, but judging from their subcellular localization, they may now have largely nonredundant functions. However, as their distributions in epithelial cells overlapped to some extent, the possibility cannot be excluded that these two related proteins interact with each other in some way to determine and/or modify the structure and functions of TJs. Thus, it is possible that the identification of tricellulin may provide clues as to the function of occludin.</p>

        <title>Tricellulin constitutes a novel barrier at tricellular contacts</title>
        <p>What happens to the paracellular barrier when the expression of tricellulin is suppressed in epithelial cells? Two independent Eph4 cell clones with suppressed tricellulin expression (KD-1 and KD-2) were established by stably expressing two distinct short interfering RNAs (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brummelkamp et al., 2002</xref>). In both clones, tricellulin protein expression was suppressed by &gt;95% as determined by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A), and immunofluorescence microscopy did not detect any tricellulin signals at tricellular contacts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Under confluent conditions, KD-1 and KD-2 cells showed a typical cobblestone-like appearance, and there was no significant difference discerned between parental wild-type Eph4 and KD-1/2 cells with regard to the size/shape of individual cells and the distribution of cadherins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). However, when KD-1 and KD-2 cells were stained with anti-occludin mAb (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C) or antiâclaudin-3 pAb (not depicted), tTJs as well as bTJs showed remarkable structural changes in that both ends of occludin-positive bTJs became thickened into a teardrop shape. At the tricellular contacts, three or more teardrop-shaped ends coalesced, but in most contacts, there remained gaps between these ends. These findings indicated that for a cellular sheet of KD-1/2 cells, the continuity of the TJ network was not maintained in the absence of tricellulin. Furthermore, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, in KD-1/2 cells, bTJs themselves appeared to be poorly developed and appeared to be thinner and discontinuous as compared with those in wild-type Eph4 cells. These findings were confirmed by freeze-fracture replica electron microscopy (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200510043/DC1</ext-link>). The epithelial barrier function was then compared between wild-type Eph4 and KD-1/2 cells by measuring transepithelial electric resistance (TER; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D) and the flux of membrane-impermeable paracellular tracers (FITCâdextran, 4 and 250 kD; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E). Clearly, when tricellulin was significantly reduced by RNAi, the epithelial barrier was compromised. The TER value did not increase under confluent conditions. Moreover, when challenged with 4 and 250 kD tracers, the paracellular barrier was severely affected in a size-selective manner. These findings have clearly demonstrated that the tricellular contacts play a crucial role in the epithelial barrier and that tricellulin is directly involved in this novel epithelial barrier mechanism.</p>

        <p>The organization of TJs at tricellular contacts has long attracted the interest of cell biologists (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Friend and Gilula, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Wade and Karnovsky, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 1985</xref>), as TJs were shown to exhibit a very peculiar structure at each tricellular contact point. However, lack of information concerning the tTJ-specific integral membrane proteins has hampered more direct assessment of the function of tTJs at the molecular level. In the structure depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, in the center of tTJs, there is a central tube created by the three paired strands and the three adjoining plasma membranes. Therefore, it is important to know how the leakage of solutes through this tube is prevented and/or regulated. To minimize the diameter of this tube, within individual plasma membranes, two vertical strands of central sealing elements must be laterally associated in a very tight manner. Taking the tricellular contactâspecific localization in wild-type Eph4 cells and the disorganization of tTJs in tricellulin knockdown cells into consideration, tricellulin appears to be directly involved in the lateral association of central sealing elements to make TJs functionally continuous at the tricellular contacts and also in the establishment of a barrier at tricellular contacts.</p>
        <p>At present, however, it is difficult to attribute the dysfunction of the epithelial barrier induced by suppressing tricellulin expression to the disorganization of only tTJs; immunofluorescence microscopy and freeze-fracture replica electron microscopy showed that tricellulin suppression appeared to affect the organization of not only tTJs but also bTJs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Fig. S3). Thus, this dysfunction induced by tricellulin deficiency of the epithelial barrier could not be simply explained by the leakage of solutes through the tricellular corner. It is still premature to further discuss the mechanism for the down-regulation of TER and paracellular tracer transport in KD-1/2 cells. Further detailed analyses are required to answer this issue in the future.</p>

        <title>Concluding remarks</title>
        <p>Tricellulin is the first protein found to be concentrated at tricellular contacts in vertebrates, but in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, gliotactin, a single membrane-spanning protein, was identified at tricellular contacts (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al., 2003</xref>), although these two proteins do not show any sequence similarity. Gliotactin was shown to be involved not only in plugging the tricellular tube but also in establishing the overall organization of bicellular septate junctions (SJs; invertebrate counterparts of TJs). Interestingly, as mentioned above, in tricellulin knockdown cells, the organization of bTJs also appeared to be affected. Thus, it is possible that normal organization of tTJs/SJs is required for the organization and/or stabilization of bTJs/SJs in general.</p>
        <p>The identification of tricellulin and its functional analysis are important first steps in expanding the study of the epithelial barrier in vertebrates. Furthermore, tricellulin may represent a novel target for small molecules that modify epithelial tricellular contact points to permit the passage of therapeutic substances to barrier-protected tissues.</p>

        <p>Rabbit antiâmouse tricellulin (N450) was raised against a GST fusion protein with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cytoplasmic domain in rabbits. Rat antiâmouse tricellulin mAbs (N54 and C96) specific for their NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains, respectively, were generated. Wistar rats were immunized with GST fusion proteins with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 150âamino acid or COOH-terminal juxtamembranous 130âamino acid domain, and lymphocytes were fused with P3 myeloma cells to obtain hybridoma cells. All antibodies gave the same results in Western blotting and immunolabeling, but, as one pAb raised against the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cytoplasmic domain (N450) showed the highest titer among them, we used this pAb in our study.</p>

        <p>Clone AA759737 was identified as a putative target of Snail in a microarray analysis (probe set ID 106661; MG-U74BV2; Affymetrix, Inc.). A similarity search against the target sequence of clone AA759737 using the Basic Local Alignment Tool programs in the Genome Bioinfomatics (University of California, Santa Cruz) identified the mouse EST clone BC003296 (referred to as <italic>Marveld2</italic>). As this EST clone contained only the 3â² noncoding and 3â² region of the ORF, cDNA encoding the whole ORF was amplified by PCR from a mouse kidney cDNA library (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ikenouchi et al., 2003</xref>), and the amplified cDNA was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). To ensure no sequence errors occurred during PCR, the nucleic acid sequence was determined from three independently amplified fragments. The sequence data of cDNA encoding full-length tricellurin/<italic>Marveld2</italic> are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB219935">AB219935</ext-link>.</p>

        <title>Immunolabeling</title>
        <p>For immunofluorescence microscopy, cultured cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and washed with PBS. For immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen sections of tissues, dissected samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and â¼7-Î¼mâthick sections were cut in a cryostat, mounted on coverslips, air dried, and fixed in 95% ethanol at 4Â°C for 30 min followed by 100% acetone at room temperature for 1 min. Samples were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ikenouchi et al., 2003</xref>). After being washed with PBS, samples were embedded in 95% glycerol/PBS containing 0.1% p-phenylendiamine and 1% n-propyl gallate and were observed with a fluorescence photomicroscope (Axiophot; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) and a plan Apochromat 63Ã NA 1.40 oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with appropriate combinations of filters and mirrors. Photographs were recorded with a cooled CCD camera (model ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) controlled by a Power Macintosh G5 and the software package IPLab V3.9.3 (Scanalytics). Observations were usually at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Immunoreplica electron microscopy was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>). Eph4 cells were fixed with 1% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 5 min at room temperature, washed three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, immersed in 30% glycerol in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 3 h, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were fractured at â100Â°C and platinum shadowed unidirectionally at an angle of 45Â° in Balzers Freeze Etching System (BAF060; Bal-tec). Samples were immersed and stirred in lysis buffer containing 2.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 0.6 M sucrose, pH 8.2, for 12 h at room temperature, and then replicas floating off the samples were washed with PBS containing 5% BSA. These replicas were processed for immunolabeling with anti-tricellulin pAb as previously described (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>).</p>

        <p>Aliquots of 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated on Transwell filters 12 mm in diameter (six filters for each cell line), and the culture medium was changed every day.

The TER values were calculated by subtracting the background TER of blank filters and by multiplying by the surface area of the filter.</p>
        <p>For paracellular tracer flux assay, after the TER was measured at day 6, 4- or 250-kD FITCâdextran was added to the medium in the apical compartment at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. After a 2-h incubation, an aliquot (100 Î¼l) of medium was collected from the basal compartment. The paracellular tracer flux was determined as the amount of FITCâdextran in this aliquot of medium, which was measured with a fluorometer.</p>
