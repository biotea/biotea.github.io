      <abstract>
        <p>MilesâCarpenter syndrome (MCS) was described in 1991 as an XLID syndrome with fingertip arches and contractures and mapped to proximal Xq. Patients had microcephaly, short stature, mild spasticity, thoracic scoliosis, hyperextendable MCP joints, rocker-bottom feet, hyperextended elbows and knees. A mutation, p.L66H, in <italic>ZC4H2</italic>, was identified in a XLID re-sequencing project. Additional screening of linked families and next generation sequencing of XLID families identified three <italic>ZC4H2</italic> mutations: p.R18K, p.R213W and p.V75in15aa. The families shared some relevant clinical features. <italic>In silico</italic> modeling of the mutant proteins indicated all alterations would destabilize the protein. Knockout mutations in <italic>zc4h2</italic> were created in zebrafish and homozygous mutant larvae exhibited abnormal swimming, increased twitching, defective eye movement and pectoral fin contractures. Because several of the behavioral defects were consistent with hyperactivity, we examined the underlying neuronal defects and found that sensory neurons and motoneurons appeared normal. However, we observed a striking reduction in GABAergic interneurons. Analysis of cell-type-specific markers showed a specific loss of V2 interneurons in the brain and spinal cord, likely arising from mis-specification of neural progenitors. Injected human wt <italic>ZC4H2</italic> rescued the mutant phenotype. Mutant zebrafish injected with human p.L66H or p.R213W mRNA failed to be rescued, while the p.R18K mRNA was able to rescue the interneuron defect. Our findings clearly support <italic>ZC4H2</italic> as a novel XLID gene with a required function in interneuron development. Loss of function of <italic>ZC4H2</italic> thus likely results in altered connectivity of many brain and spinal circuits.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MilesâCarpenter syndrome (MCS) is an X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndrome first described in 1991 (<xref rid="DDV208C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The syndrome was characterized by males having short stature, microcephaly, exotropia, long hands, digit contractions, rocker-bottom feet and spasticity along with severe intellectual disability. A distinguishing feature was the presence of an excess of arch fingerprints or a low total ridge count. Additionally, it was one of the few XLID syndromes in which the carrier females have some somatic features, as well as mild cognitive impairment.</p><p>X-linked intellectual disability conditions account for about two out of 1000 males with intellectual disability (ID) and are quite heterogeneous. An estimated 150â200 genes are presumed to be responsible for XLID of which only about 100 have been identified. Indeed 30 XLID syndromes and 50 mapped families with non-syndromal XLID are without a known causative gene mutation (<uri xlink:href="http://www.ggc.org/research/molecular-studies/xlid.html">http://www.ggc.org/research/molecular-studies/xlid.html</uri>). In order to address this gap, a large collaborative resequencing project of 718 X genes in 208 XLID probands, (IGOLD, International Genetics of Learning Disability), was undertaken using Sanger sequencing to identify novel XLID genes (<xref rid="DDV208C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Besides identifying nine XLID genes, it generated over 500 non-recurrent missense mutations. As a partial follow-up of this project, 15 probands were sequenced for the same 718 genes using next generation sequencing. Novel, non-recurrent missense mutations were then pursued further. One such missense mutation, p.L66H, was identified in <italic>ZC4H2</italic>, a zinc finger gene for which very little information was available. Therefore, additional testing of families was undertaken. Screening of families linked to Xq11 and next generation X-exome sequencing of small XLID families identified two additional <italic>ZC4H2</italic> mutations, a missense mutation, p.R213W, and an in-frame insertion of 15 amino acids, p.V75in15aa. Independently, a third <italic>ZC4H2</italic> missense mutation, p.R18K, was identified in a family with XLID using whole exome sequencing (WES). Biophysical <italic>in silico</italic> modeling indicated all three missense mutations were destabilizing. Functional studies, using two KO zebrafish mutants created using the TALEN methodology, allowed us to determine that ZC4H2 is important for the specification and generation of a subset of central nervous system (CNS) interneurons. In addition, rescue experiments indicated that the L66H and R213W mutations result in loss of protein function. Further studies of <italic>ZC4H2</italic> will provide a better appreciation for the important role this gene plays in brain development and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutations in <italic>ZC4H2</italic></title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Family K8070</title><p>Next generation resequencing of 718 genes located on the X-chromosome identified a mutation, c.197T &gt; A; p.L66H, in a male from K8070 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV208F1">1</xref>). This family was previously published as having MCS, an XLID condition with severe ID, macrocephaly, contractures and exotropia (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV208TB1">1</xref>) (<xref rid="DDV208C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The syndrome was mapped to a broad region of the X, spanning from Xp11.4 to Xq22.2. The location of <italic>ZC4H2</italic> in Xq11.2 was consistent with this localization and segregation of the c.197T &gt; A mutation was found in K8070 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV208F1">1</xref>A). The c.197T &gt; A mutation was not listed in dbSNP nor in the 1000 Genome database. Additionally, a separate analysis of 1302 normal X chromosomes failed to detect the change, further substantiating c.197T &gt; A was not a rare polymorphism. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the mutation was likely pathogenic (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV208TB2">2</xref>). The L66 residue was also observed to be highly conserved down to <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>.

The expression of two different <italic>ZC4H2</italic> transcripts, ENST00000374839 (224 amino acids) and ENST00000337990 (201 amino acids), was examined because, although, the R18H mutation does exist in the primary transcript of 224 amino acids, it was not present in the shorter form of 201 amino acids (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv208/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A</ext-link>).

The long form is apparently not present in the liver. Since both transcripts were present in fetal brain, we examined the level of expression in different regions of human brain using a Rapid Scan Human Brain Panel (Origene).

The short form, missing exon 1 and the R18 residue, was highly expressed in all regions of the brain and the spinal cord. The long form was weakly expressed in all regions with perhaps higher expression in the hypothalamus, pons and medulla. It was not observed in the spinal cord sample. These observations might explain the mildness of the phenotype observed in the family with the R18H mutation relative to the other families, such as the lack of hypotonia, seizures and hyperreflexia in the affected males (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV208TB1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>In silico</italic> modeling of <italic>ZC4H2</italic> mutations</title><p>Although the bioinformatic analyses indicated all four <italic>ZC4H2</italic> mutations were likely pathogenic (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV208TB2">2</xref>), we undertook <italic>in silico</italic> analyses to predict the effect the three missense mutations had on the stability of the ZC4H2 protein.

A visual inspection of these models revealed that R18 forms two hydrogen bonds with the glutamic acid at position 106 (E106) in the model2 Amber WT structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv208/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A</ext-link>), and three hydrogen bonds with E106 in model2 Charmm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv208/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B</ext-link>).

Instead R18 is completely exposed to the water phase, which would allow it to form favorable hydrogen bonds with water. The folding free energy (ÎÎG) of model2 Amber and Charmm were both predicted to be destabilizing; however, the ÎÎG of model3 Amber was predicted to be stabilizing. The overall averaged ÎÎG is destabilizing but with a large deviation. The results of the energy calculations and the potential loss of favorable hydrogen bonds when R18 is mutated to K18 lead to our prediction that this mutation will be destabilizing and therefore potentially disease-causing. This prediction is consistent with third party predictors and online webservers FoldX, Eris, PoPMuSiC, I-Mutant 2.0 and PolyPhen-2, all of which predicted destabilization of the gene due to the mutation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv208/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>L66H mutation</title><p>For the L66H mutation, our criteria allowed for only one model to be included in the analysis: model5 Charmmforce field.

This is an ambiguous alteration to predict, since it involves a titratable residue, the His residue, whose standard pKa is 6.5. No attempt was made to calculate the apparent pKa of H66 in the models because none of the existing predictors allows for protonation state adjustment. In our modeling, the H66 was kept fully ionized. The prediction of the average ÎÎG is destabilizing but no deviation can be given since only one model was used.

Instead, we observed a clear loss of multiple markers of the V2a and V2b interneuron lineages in the hindbrain and spinal cord, as well as loss of GABAergic neurons in the midbrain tegmentum. In addition, we observed accompanying ectopic glycinergic neurons in the ventral spinal cord, consistent with a defect in neuronal fate specification. Analysis of neural progenitor markers strongly suggested that the loss of V2 interneurons results from mis-specification of adjacent spinal cord progenitor domains. Intriguingly, the neuronal subtypes that are specifically affected in mutant larvae provide a potential physiological basis for the behavioral phenotypes observed in both zebrafish and humans. While we cannot rule out an additional role for ZC4H2 in excitatory synaptic function as previously reported (<xref rid="DDV208C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), these findings were based on overexpression studies of GFP-tagged protein and may not reflect an endogenous role.

Additionally, it is quite possible <italic>ZC4H2</italic> has more than one function as it contains both a zinc-finger domain and a coiled-coil domain. These possible explanations for the clinical variability are evident in that males in family K8615 whose mutation, R213W, affects nuclear localization of the proteins, do not exhibit the narrow shoulders, kyphosis nor degree of distal contractures observed in the other families and males in family K9333 whose mutation, R18K, would not be present in the short form of <italic>ZC4H2</italic> do not present with spasticity, drooling and hypotonia.</p><p>In summary, our work provides a novel mechanistic model for the etiology of MCS and other XLID entities with mutations in <italic>ZC4H2</italic>. The expression of <italic>ZC4H2</italic> in the developing CNS, as well as the neuroanatomical defects in zebrafish mutants, suggest a required function in neural tube progenitor specification that ultimately affects interneuron fate and connectivity throughout the brain and spinal cord. Because loss of GABAergic neurons is the most prominent phenotype arising from this mis-specification, <italic>ZC4H2</italic> loss of function may therefore result in hyperexcitability of multiple brain and spinal circuits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Clinical reports</title><p>Fourteen males were affected in the four kindreds (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV208TB1">1</xref>). The 14 prominent findings, i.e. those occurring in over 50% of males, included intellectual disability, motor and speech delay, short stature, microcephaly, distal muscle weakness, foot abnormalities (rocker-bottom, pes planus, club foot), knee and/or elbow contractures, narrow shoulders and upper torso, ptosis and/or exotropia, long philtrum, highly arched palate, spinal curvature (kyphosis, scoliosis, lordosis), hypotonia and/or drooling and spasticity.

Growth was typically normal but with head circumference and stature in the lower centiles: only one carrier female had short stature (&lt;3rd centile) and only one had microcephaly (&lt;3rd centile). Although IQ measurements were not available, most carrier females (seven out of 11) were considered to have low or borderline cognitive function. None had hypotonia, drooling or spasticity. Six females had elbow or knee contractures, two had seizures, three had camptodactyly and two had narrow shoulders/thorax. Craniofacial features were not distinctive although several carrier females in K8070 had ptosis, long philtrum, high-arched palate and broad alveolar ridges and all except 1 (five out of six) had exotropia.

Additionally, variants shared with 162 male samples (unaffected controls) from the 1000 Genomes project were removed.
