        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Defects in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are associated with the genome instability syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA). Here we report that cells with mutations in RFWD3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with and ubiquitylates replication protein A (RPA), show profound defects in ICL repair. An amino acid substitution in the WD40 repeats of RFWD3 (I639K) found in a new FA subtype abolishes interaction of RFWD3 with RPA, thereby preventing RFWD3 recruitment to sites of ICL-induced replication fork stalling. Moreover, single point mutations in the RPA32 subunit of RPA that abolish interaction with RFWD3 also inhibit ICL repair, demonstrating that RPA-mediated RFWD3 recruitment to stalled replication forks is important for ICL repair. We also report that unloading of RPA from sites of ICL induction is perturbed in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-deficient cells. These data reveal important roles for RFWD3 localization in protecting genome stability and preserving human health.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) form when bifunctional agents covalently link the two strands in the DNA double helix. Although ICLs can be repaired in a replication-independent manner, the dominant mode of ICL repair is thought to occur in S phase, when replisomes collide with these lesions (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Akkari etÂ al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Taniguchi etÂ al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>). ICL repair is a complex process requiring cooperation between several distinct DNA repair pathways (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kim and DâAndrea, 2012</xref>). The importance of efficient ICL repair is underscored by the finding that mutations in ICL repair are associated with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare recessive disorder typified by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure, andÂ increased incidence of cancers (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Auerbach, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kim and DâAndrea, 2012</xref>). Twenty-one FA genes have been reported to date, and studying the products of these genes (the FANC proteins) has provided important insights into ICL repair.</p>
      <p>The central components of the FA pathway, FANCD2 and its paralog FANCI, together form the âIDâ complex (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Higuera etÂ al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Smogorzewska etÂ al., 2007</xref>). These proteins are mono-ubiquitylated at Lys561 and Lys523, respectively, both in S phase and in response to ICLs (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Higuera etÂ al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Taniguchi etÂ al., 2002</xref>). These reactions are catalyzed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FANCL, a subunit of the FA core complex, in concert with the E2-conjugating enzyme FANCT and the FA-associated proteins FAAP100 and FAAP24 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ciccia etÂ al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Collis etÂ al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ling etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Mono-ubiquitylation of FANCD2 is necessary for ICL repair (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kim and DâAndrea, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Knipscheer etÂ al., 2009</xref>); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The FAN1 nuclease is recruited to stalled replisomes by ubiquitin-FANCD2, but this interaction is dispensable for ICL repair and is instead required for the protection of stalled forks in a general sense (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lachaud etÂ al., 2016a</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lachaud etÂ al., 2016b</xref>). FANCD2 ubiquitylation is known to promote lesion âunhooking,â involving nucleolytic incisions on either side of the ICL (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>) that appear to require the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Knipscheer etÂ al., 2009</xref>). After unhooking, the resulting gap is thought to be filled in by translesion synthesis. The unhooked lesion can subsequently be removed by excision repair, and the double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the unhooking step are ultimately repaired by homologous recombination (HR) (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, it was reported that the RING finger-type E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 affects HR at stalled replication forks (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">EliaÂ etÂ al., 2015</xref>). RFWD3 was already known to interact with the RPA32 subunit of the replication protein A (RPA) complex, a heterotrimeric complex essential for multiple aspects of DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Translocation of RFWD3 to sites of replication fork stalling appears to require interaction with RPA (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Chen, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu etÂ al., 2011</xref>). More recently, it was shown that RFWD3 promotes RPA ubiquitylation inÂ vivo inÂ response to agents that cause fork stalling, such as hydroxyurea (HU), which depletes deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). AllÂ three RPA subunitsâRPA70, RPA32, and RPA14âappear to be ubiquitylated by RFWD3, but the functional effect of RFWD3-mediated ubiquitylation on RPA is not yet clear. Cells depleted of RFWD3 show defects in restart of forks stalled after exposure of cells to HU and also show defects in HR at a protein-DNA roadblock that causes fork stalling (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elia etÂ al., 2015</xref>). However, it remains to be seen whether RPA ubiquitylation is relevant to the fork-protective functions of RFWD3 or, indeed, whether the E3 activity of RFWD3 is required. Attenuation of the RPA-RFWD3 interaction through deletion of a small region in the C terminus of RPA32 not only abolishes RPA ubiquitylation but also reduces the efficiency of HR at a protein-DNA roadblock. However, mutating the ubiquitylated residues K37 and K38 in RPA32 inhibited RPA32 ubiquitylation without affecting HR (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elia etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is not yet clear whether RPA ubiquitylation is relevant for DNA repair or whether, instead, RPA simply recruits RFWD3 to stalled forks, where it ubiquitylates other substrates to control genome stability.</p>
      <p>Here we show that interfering with RFWD3 function causes key hallmarks of defective ICL repair. An <italic>RFWD3</italic> mutation found in a new FA subtype inhibits ICL repair by abolishing the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA. Moreover, RFWD3 controls RPA dynamics, and point mutations in RPA that abolish its interaction with RFWD3 attenuate ICL repair. These data reveal that the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA is vital for ICL repair and for preserving human health.</p>

        <title>Generating <italic>RFWD3</italic>-Deficient Human Cells</title>
        <p>Recently, mutations in the gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 were found in a new FA subtype, suggesting a role for RFWD3 in ICL repair (D.S., unpublished data). To test this possibility, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to disrupt the <italic>RFWD3</italic> gene in HeLa cells. Although we succeeded in knocking out other genes, including <italic>ERCC1</italic> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>A), we failed to obtain clones that completely lacked RFWD3 protein even after using a range of guide RNAs (gRNAs). Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells (data not shown), suggesting that RFWD3 might be essential for cell viability. However, analysis of genomic DNA from a range of HeLa cell clones obtained using a gRNA targeting exon 4 revealed a high frequency of homozygous alterations at the <italic>RFWD3</italic> locus (data not shown). We reasoned that these clones might harbor hypomorphic <italic>RFWD3</italic> mutations that could affect DNA repair. We therefore screened clones for the ability to survive exposure to a single dose of the ICL-inducing drug mitomycin-C (MMC) using the low-sensitivity, high-throughput MTS assay. As shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>B, several clones obtained after targeting <italic>RFWD3</italic> exon 4 showed reduced ability to survive MMC exposure compared with control HeLa cells. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from clone 7, for example, revealed compound heterozygosity at the <italic>RFWD3</italic> locus. One allele harbors a deletion of 13 bases within exon 4 and an insertion of four random bases within the gRNA-binding sequence, which together resulted in replacement of amino acids 254â258 (IDGGK) in the linker domain with two random amino acids (NW), after which the RFWD3 sequence is normal right to the end of the reading frameÂ (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>CâS2E). The second allele harbors a deletion in exon 4, which changes the frame and introduces a premature stop codon, thereby truncating the protein from Glu240, with theÂ introduction of six extra amino acids (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>FâS2H). Western blotting of cell extracts of clone 7 revealed an RFWD3 species of similar molecular weight as wild-type (WT) RFWD3 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S2</xref>A), which we presume to be the product of the first allele mentioned above (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref>CâS2E). We refer to the <italic>RFWD3</italic>-hypomorphic HeLa cells as <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells hereafter.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title><italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> Cells Show Hallmarks of Defective ICL Repair</title>
        <p>To more accurately measure the sensitivity of <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells to DNA crosslinking agents, we decided to carry out clonogenic survival assays. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A, <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells are profoundly hypersensitive to agents that induce ICLs, such as MMC and cisplatin. The extreme sensitivity of <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells to these crosslinking agents is comparable with HeLa cells lacking <italic>ERCC1</italic>, a gene that encodes a subunit of the FA protein complex ERCC1-XPF (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bogliolo etÂ al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S3</xref>A). In contrast, <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells show no hypersensitivity to HU, which stalls replication forks by depleting dNTPs, and are only weakly sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR), which induces single- and double-strand breaks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). The narrow spectrum of genotoxins (ICL-inducing agents) to which <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells show sensitivity argues strongly that ICL repair is a major function of RFWD3. We therefore tested <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells for other hallmarks of defective ICL repair. Exposure to a low dose of MMC caused a high proportion of <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells, but not control cells, to accumulate in G<sub>2</sub> phase. This pronounced G<sub>2</sub> arrest is a hallmark of FA cells, and, indeed, the strength of G<sub>2</sub> arrest seen in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells is similar to that in <italic>ERCC1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B). We also noticed that <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells showed an increased incidence of spontaneous chromosome abnormalities, defined by chromatid breaks and radial chromosome structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C). The frequency of abnormalities increased after exposure to MMC to a level higher than observed in control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C). Again, the increased frequency of chromosome abnormalities in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells was comparable with <italic>ERCC1</italic><sup>â/â</sup> cells.<fig id="fig1"><label>FigureÂ 1</label><caption><p><italic>RFWD3</italic>-Deficient Cells Show Hallmarks of Defective ICL Repair</p><p>(A) Clonogenic survival analysis of control and <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> HeLa cells exposed to the indicated genotoxins.

        <title>The FA-Derived I639K Mutation Abolishes RFWD3 Interaction with RPA</title>
        <p>As mentioned above, a new FA subtype has recently been identified that is associated with mutations in <italic>RFWD3,</italic> termed hereafter FA-RFWD3 (D.S., unpublished data). So far, only one patient has been identified, showing compound heterozygosity at the <italic>RFWD3</italic> locus (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S4</xref>). In one allele, a frameshift results in the introduction of a premature stop codon, which should truncate the protein product at amino acid Leu69. In contrast, the second allele harbors a single point mutation, I639K, located within the WD40 domain at the C terminus of RFWD3 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S4</xref>). It is likely that the RFWD3-I639K point mutant is the only form of RFWD3 expressed in FA-RFWD3 cells. In light of this, we wanted to investigate the effect of this mutation on the ICL repair functions of RFWD3. We reasoned that the I639K mutation may disrupt the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA, and we set out to test this possibility. RPA was detected in anti-GFP immunoprecipitates from cells stably expressing GFP-tagged RFWD3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A), although the signal was weak and varied widely between experiments. We found that introducing a C315A mutation in the active site of RFWD3, which renders the recombinant protein inactive inÂ vitro (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S5</xref>), stabilized RFWD3, resulting in increased expression, and made the interaction with RPA easier to detect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Exposure of cells to MMC resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the amount of RPA in RFWD3 precipitates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B); we observed a similar increase in several independent experiments, but the fold increase varied between experiments for reasons that are unclear (data not shown). Remarkably, introducing the FA-associated I639K mutation completely abolished the co-immunoprecipitation of RPA with GFP-RFWD3 C315A without affecting RFWD3 C315A expression levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B).<fig id="fig2"><label>FigureÂ 2</label><caption><p>The FA-Derived RFWD3 I639K Mutant Cannot Interact with RPA</p><p>(A) U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-RFWD3 (WT or a catalytically inactive C315A mutant) or GFP only were exposed to HU (2Â mM) or MMC (50Â ng/mL) for 16Â hr and then lysed.

The table predicts six WD40 repeats (WD 1â6). For each repeat, the sequence of the four anti-parallel Î² strands typical of WD40 repeats is given, as well as the sequence of loops connecting these Î² strands. In red are shown predicted surface hotspots that, in other WD40 domain proteins, mediate key protein-protein interactions.</p><p>(D) Same as (B), except that U2OS cells expressing GFP-RFWD3 C315A or GFP-RFWD3 C315A bearing mutations in the predicted WD40 hotspots described in (C) were treated with a single dose of MMC for 16Â hr before analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p>
        <p>Ile639 is located within the WD40 domain of RFWD3, toward the C terminus (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S4</xref>). WD40 domains are known to be involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and are generally composed of six to eight structurally conserved WD40 repeats. Each of these repeats contains four anti-parallel Î² strands that fold into a conserved Î²-propeller structure, exposing three types of surfaceâtop, bottom, and side (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Stirnimann etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Certain âhotspotâ residues on these surfaces engage in protein-protein interactions that play important roles in various cellular functions (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wu etÂ al., 2003</xref>). Recently, a database of WD40 proteins was reported (WDSPdb) that uses an algorithm to identify WD40 repeats in query proteins, predict secondary structure, and pinpoint surface hotspot residues (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wang etÂ al., 2015b</xref>). This algorithm revealed six WD40 repeats in RFWD3 and predicted six top-face hotspots likely to engage in protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, this list included I639, located in the fourth WD40 repeat (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). We therefore decided to test whether, like I639, mutation of the other predicted hotspots also affected the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D, mutation of W543, but not Q499 or L518, to alanine completely abolished the interaction of GFP-tagged RFWD3 with RPA. These data show that the FA-associated I639K mutation prevents the binding of RFWD3 to RPA and that the surface-exposed residue W543 is also critical for this interaction.</p>

        <title>The I639K Mutation Abolishes RFWD3 Recruitment toÂ DNA Damage Sites</title>
        <p>Because interaction with RPA has been implicated in the recruitment of RFWD3 to sites of HU-induced fork stalling (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Chen, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu etÂ al., 2011</xref>), we reasoned that the FA-associated I639K mutation might have an effect on RFWD3 localization to ICLs. To investigate this possibility, we utilized ultraviolet (UV) laser-activated psoralen conjugates to generate ICLs along a track in the nucleus and then visualized recruitment ofÂ GFP-tagged RFWD3 to these tracks by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A, RFWD3 with a GFP tag at the N terminus, but not GFP alone, translocates to tracks of laser micro-irradiation and co-localizes with the phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX (Î³-H2AX). The intensity of the stripes formed by the C315A catalytically inactive RFWD3 mutant was noticeably higher than that of WT RFWD3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). Live imaging analysis revealed that GFP-RFWD3 is recruited to ICLs within 5Â min of ICL induction, reaching maximum intensity at around 20Â min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). By 80Â min, the GFP-RFWD3 stripe had almost disappeared. The C315A mutant was recruited with comparable kinetics, although, again, the stripe intensity was higher than that of the WT. Intriguingly, however, the C315A mutant persisted at sites of ICL induction and appeared to continue to increase in intensity even at the 80-min time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). These data suggest that RFWD3 activity is necessary for its own removal from DNA damage sites but not for its recruitment. Strikingly, introducing the I639K mutation prevented localization of GFP-RFWD3 C315A to tracks of ICL induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). To confirm these results, we also examined RFWD3 localization to sub-nuclear foci induced by exposure to MMC. As shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S6</xref>, GFP-RFWD3 C315A forms subnuclear foci in response to MMC treatment, and these foci co-localize with RPA. However, the I639K mutation completely abolishes formation of MMC-induced RFWD3 foci (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D).<fig id="fig3"><label>FigureÂ 3</label><caption><p>The RFWD3 I639K Mutant Is Not Recruited to DNA Damage Sites</p><p>(A) U2OS cells stably expressing GFP, GFP-RFWD3, GFP-RFWD3 C315A, or GFP-RFWD3 C315A I639K were incubated with trimethyl-psoralen and subjected to sub-nuclear micro-irradiation using a 355-nm UV laser.

As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E, mutating Q499 or L518, which did not affect interaction of RFWD3 with RPA, had little effect on recruitment of GFP-RFWD3 to sites of ICL induction. However, mutating W543, which prevents interaction with RPA, abolishes recruitment of GFP-RFWD3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E), similar to the I639K mutation. Therefore, only WD40 mutations that abolish RPA binding prevent recruitment of RFWD3 to sites of ICL induction.</p>

        <title>The I639K Mutation Abolishes ATR-Catalyzed RFWD3 Phosphorylation</title>
        <p>It has been reported previously that RFWD3 is phosphorylated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated-related (ATR) kinases following ionizing radiation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fu etÂ al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Matsuoka etÂ al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mu etÂ al., 2007</xref>). An antibody against BRCA1 phospho-S1457 was reported to recognize phospho-RFWD3 after IR (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fu etÂ al., 2010</xref>), and we found that GFP-RFWD3, but not GFP, cross-reacts with these antibodies after exposure of cells to MMC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). The residues flanking S46 and S63 of RFWD3 resemble those around BRCA1 S1457 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fu etÂ al., 2010</xref>), and, accordingly, mutating both of these residues together completely abolished the cross-reactivity of GFP-RFWD3 with the BRCA1 phospho-S1457 antibody after MMC treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Phosphatase treatment of GFP-RFWD3 immunoprecipitates also abolished cross-reactivity with BRCA1 phospho-S1457 antibodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). Furthermore, pre-incubation of cells with the specific ATR inhibitor ETP-46464 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Toledo etÂ al., 2011</xref>), but not the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hickson etÂ al., 2004</xref>), blocked RFWD3 phosphorylation after MMC, suggesting that this phosphorylation is predominantly mediated by the ATR kinase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and 4E, MMC-induced RFWD3 phosphorylation is both dose and time dependent. RFWD3 phosphorylation is not observed until around 6Â hr after exposure of cells to MMC, with the phospho-specific signal increasing up to 24Â hr. This lag in RFWD3 phosphorylation suggests that entryÂ to S-phase is required, which is consistent with the requirement for ATR.

        <title>Altered RPA Dynamics at ICLs in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-Defective Cells</title>
        <p>We next set out to test the effect of RFWD3 on RPA dynamics at sites of ICL induction. To this end, the proportion of cells with more than five RPA32 foci after exposure of cells to a transient pulse of MMC was quantitated. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A, the proportion of control cells with more than five RPA32 foci rose to reach a maximum of around 40% after 12â24Â hr, declining to near-basal levels by 48Â hr.

        <p>During HR, RPA should be displaced from single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to allow formation of the RAD51 nucleofilament, and we wondered whether the persistence of RPA at sites of ICL induction in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-defective cells might prevent the loading of RAD51. We investigated this possibility by analyzing the appearance and disappearance of RAD51 foci from sites of ICL induction in the same manner as described above for RPA32. In control cells, RAD51 loaded onto sites of ICL induction, as assessed by quantitating the proportion of cells with more than five foci, reaching a maximum and plateauing by 24Â hr (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B). By 72Â hr, the foci had declined substantially. Intriguingly, RAD51 appeared to load normally in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells, and, if anything, a slightly higher proportion of <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells had more than five RAD51 foci compared with control cells. In both cell lines, RAD51 foci had declined in number by 72Â hr, although the proportion of <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells with RAD51 foci was still notably higher than WT. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B andÂ <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>B). It is interesting to note that at the 48Â hr post-recovery time point, <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells had close to normal levels of RAD51 foci despite failure of RPA to dissociate.</p>
        <p>We next employed high-resolution microscopy to investigate the co-localization of RPA and RAD51 at times during recovery when RPA foci were found to persist in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells. Twenty-four hours after recovery from a pulse of MMC, around 20% of RAD51 foci in both <italic>RFWD3</italic>-deficient and control cells also contained RPA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C, top). Broadly speaking, two notable patterns of RAD51 and RPA localization were evident. The first pattern involved RAD51 and RPA occupying opposite ends of the same subnuclear focus, with co-localization (defined by signal overlap) restricted to a central zone. The second pattern involved RPA staining along the whole focus, with RAD51 co-localization occurring in a central zone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C, bottom). At the 24-hr recovery time point, <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells were indistinguishable from control cells in the distribution of the two broad patterns of localization of RPA and RAD51. By the 48-hr recovery time point, almost all RPA foci had disappeared from control cells, and, consequently, the RAD51 foci did not contain RPA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C, top). However, in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells where RPA foci persisted, around 30% of RAD51 foci still contained RPA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C). The patterns of RAD51 and RPA localization under these conditions were indistinguishable from control cells at the earlier time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C, bottom).</p>
        <p>To validate these results, we also applied inÂ situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) technology. In this experiment, the RAD51 and RPA primary antibodies are conjugated with two different oligonucleotides. When in close proximity, ligation of the oligonucleotide moieties becomes possible, creating a DNA sequence that can be PCR-amplified. In the presence of fluorescent dNTPs, a fluorescent signal is generated. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>D and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>C, a small number of distinct foci could be seen in both control and <italic>RFWD3</italic>-deficient cells after 24Â hr of recovery from an MMC pulse. The number of foci visible in control cells significantly decreased after 48Â hr of recovery; however, the number of PLA foci in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-deficient cells remained notably higher.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data show that RPA persists in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-defective cells, resulting in the presence of RPA in a subset of RAD51 foci at time points where RPA foci have disappeared from control cells. One possible consequence of the presence of RPA in RAD51 foci is inhibition of strand invasion and HR. InÂ support of this idea, we observe that <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells are hypersensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E), which is a hallmark of defective HR (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lord and Ashworth, 2016</xref>). This observation is consistent with the previous demonstration of a major defect in HR at a protein-DNA roadblock when cells are depleted of RFWD3 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elia etÂ al., 2015</xref>).</p>

        <title>RPA32 Mutations that Abolish Interaction with RFWD3 Attenuate ICL Repair</title>
        <p>Given that RFWD3 affects RPA dynamics at sites of ICL induction and that the FA-associated I639K mutation in RFWD3 abolishes interaction with RPA, we wished to further investigate whether the RPA-RFWD3 interaction is relevant for ICL repair. To this end, we sought to test the effect of mutations in RPA that abolish interaction with RFWD3. It was reported previously that deleting amino acids 243â262 of RPA32 abolishes both the interaction with RFWD3 and RPA ubiquitylation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elia etÂ al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Chen, 2011</xref>); however, we sought to make more subtle changes that would disrupt the interaction with RFWD3. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A, we identified a number of conserved residues in this region of RPA32, and we tested the effect of mutating four of these residues on the interaction with RFWD3. We found that, although mutating residue G253 to alanine had little effect on the ability of FLAG-tagged RPA32 to interact with endogenous RFWD3, mutating F248, E252, or H254 abolished the interaction of the two proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B). Importantly, the F248, E252, and H254 mutations did not affect the interaction of RPA32 with RPA70 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B).<fig id="fig6"><label>FigureÂ 6</label><caption><p>RFWD3 Interaction-Defective RPA Mutants Attenuate ICL Repair</p><p>(A) Alignment of the C-terminal region of RPA32 orthologs from the indicated species.

        <p>We next tested the effect of replacing endogenous RPA32 with the mutants that abolish interaction with RFWD3 on ICL repair. To this end, U2OS cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged RPA32 (WT or mutants) were transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the 3â² UTR of the <italic>RPA32</italic> gene (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">FigureÂ S7</xref>D). The RPA32 siRNA only gave partial depletion of RPA32, which was expected given that complete knockdown of RPA32 is incompatible with cell viability. Strikingly, cells in which RPA32 was replaced by the F248A, E252A, or H254A mutants, which cannot interact with RFWD3, were hypersensitive to MMC, whereas the G253A mutant that can interact with RFWD3 did not render cells any more sensitive to MMC than the WT RPA32 control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C). Another hallmark of defective ICL repair is the accumulation of cells in G<sub>2</sub> phase after MMC exposure. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D, control U2OS cells depleted of RPA32 showed a pronounced accumulation in G<sub>2</sub> phase even without MMC treatment, and this is increased further in response to low doses of MMC. Expression of FLAG-RPA32 (WT) reversed the G<sub>2</sub> accumulation caused by RPA32 depletion (both with and without exposure of cells to MMC). Interestingly, cells in which endogenous RPA32 was replaced by the F248A, E252A, or H254A mutants, which cannot interact with RFWD3, showed pronounced accumulation in G<sub>2</sub> only after MMC exposure, indicative of defective ICL repair (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). Furthermore, replacing endogenous RPA32 with the G253A mutant, which interacts normally with RFWD3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B), did not cause accumulation of cells in G<sub>2</sub> after MMC treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). These data demonstrate that the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA is required for the optimal repair of ICLs.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we present evidence that RFWD3 plays an important role in the repair of ICLs. Genome-edited, <italic>RFWD3</italic>-hypomorphic (<italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup>) cells show all of the classic hallmarks of defective ICL repairâhypersensitivity to MMC, pronounced G<sub>2</sub> arrest, and chromosome breakage after MMC exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>). Consistent with this, RFWD3 was one of many factors identified recently in a screen for proteins recruited to chromatin during ICL repair in cell-free <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">RÃ¤schle etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, we were unable to isolate <italic>RFWD3</italic> knockout clones that were completely devoid of RFWD3 protein despite using a range of <italic>RFWD3</italic>-specific gRNAs in multiple cell lines under conditions used to knock out a number of other genes. This suggests that <italic>RFWD3</italic> may be an essential gene, in agreement with the recent identification of <italic>RFWD3</italic> in genome-wide screens for essential genes in KBM7 and HAP1 cells (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wang etÂ al., 2015a</xref>). It is unlikely that the essential role of RFWD3 is ICL repair, however, because most FA gene knockouts are viable. On the other hand, several genes controlling HR are essential, including <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic>. Like <italic>RFWD3</italic>, these genes mediate HR not only during ICL repair but also in response to other DNA lesions and other modes of fork stalling (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deans and West, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the essential function of RFWD3 reflects a critical role in HR at stalled forks. However, the FA-associated I639K mutation completely abolishes interaction with RPA, and yet the patient cells are viable. So if promoting HR is the essential function of RFWD3, then substrates other than RPA must be involved. Further work involving conditional <italic>RFWD3</italic> inactivation and the identification of the full gamut of RFWD3 substrates will be necessary to answer these questions.</p>
      <p>We found that the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA appears to be critically important not only for recruitment of RFWD3 to sites of ICL induction but also for ICL repair. We were able to showÂ that replacing endogenous RPA32 with mutants that inhibitÂ the interaction with RFWD3 causes defective ICL repair, whereas a nearby mutation (G253A) that does not affect RFWD3 interaction has no effect on ICL repair (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>). Furthermore, mutating predicted surface hotspots in the RFWD3 WD40 repeats that abolish interaction with RPA also abolishes recruitment to ICLs, whereas WD40 domain mutations that do not affect RPA interaction have no effect on RFWD3 recruitment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Importantly, the FA-associated I639K mutation completely blocked both RPA binding and RFWD3 recruitment to ICLs induced by psoralen/UV or MMC. Therefore, loss of interaction of RFWD3 with RPA at stalled replisomes is the most likely explanation for the ICL repair defect seen in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-deficient cells and is likely to explain, at least partly, why the I639K mutation causes FA.</p>
      <p>We consistently observed that the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA is stimulated by exposure of cells to ICL-inducing drugs. This makes sense from the point of view that RFWD3 is recruited to replication forks only when they stall. However, the mechanismÂ whereby ICL-inducing drugs stimulate the RFWD3-RPA interaction is not clear. RFWD3 is known to be phosphorylated in response to fork stalling, but we found that the ATR inhibitor ETP-46464, which prevents RFWD3 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>), has no effect on the inducible interaction of RFWD3 with RPA and does not affect RFWD3 recruitment to DNA damage sitesÂ (data not shown). Therefore, more work is required to determine how ICL-inducing agents promote the interaction of RFWD3 with RPA.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear whether ubiquitylation of RPA is required for the fork protectionÂ and/or ICL repair roles of RFWD3. AnÂ RPA32 mutant (K37R K38R) that showsÂ a major reduction in ubiquitylation induced by HU was shown to be proficient for HR and resolution of Î³H2AX foci, arguing that RPA32 might not be a substrate of RFWD3 relevant for ICL repair (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elia etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Although it is possible that it is the ubiquitylation of the other subunits of RPA that is important, currently there is no supporting evidence for this hypothesis. Indeed, it could be argued that RPA simply recruits RFWD3 to stalled forks, where it then ubiquitylates other substrates to promote HR and genome stability. However, one argument in favor of RPA ubiquitylation promoting ICL repair comes from our observation that RPA dynamics at sites of ICL-induced fork stalling are perturbed in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>). It is perhaps difficult to explain this defect without invoking RFWD3 catalytic activity, and, on this basis, we speculate that RPA ubiquitylation facilitates the unloading of RPA from resected DNA ends during HR. It is not yet clear how RFWD3-catalyzed ubiquitylation might facilitate RPA dissociation. It may be that RFWD3 increases the turnover of RPA to promote dissociation from broken replication forks, and, in this light, it is worth noting that inactivating RFWD3 catalytic activity boosts the levels of this protein, suggesting that it might control its own turnover (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). It is also possible that RPA ubiquitylation enhances its interaction with one or more proteins that facilitate its extraction from ssDNA, such as the p97 segregase. Testing these possibilities will be an interesting line of future investigation.</p>
      <p>Even if RPA ubiquitylation by RFWD3 is required for RPA unloading from ICL-induced foci, it does not necessarily follow that the persistence of RPA seen in <italic>RFWD3</italic><sup>Î/Î</sup> cells is sufficient toÂ derail the HR process, especially because RAD51 appears to load normally in these cells. In other words, altered RPA dynamics may not be the cause of the HR defects noted in <italic>RFWD3</italic>-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Elia etÂ al., 2015</xref>). However, it is possible that the presence of RPA in RAD51 foci impedes the formation of the RAD51 nucleofilament, thereby inhibiting strand invasion and HR. It therefore seems reasonable to speculate that a failure in HRâcaused perhaps by loss of RPA ubiquitylationâis responsible for both the defect in ICL repair and the FA disease phenotype seen in the context of RFWD3 mutations. This is particularly relevant given that mutations in key HR factors such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been found to cause major defects in ICL repair as well as FA (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deans and West, 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Over the past decade it has become clear that the replacement of RPA with RAD51 on resected forks is a complex transaction requiring a range of proteins, including the mediator proteins RAD51BâRAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Krejci etÂ al., 2012</xref>). The BRCA2 tumor suppressor is also involved in this process, promoting the assembly of a RAD51 nucleofilament on ssDNA both in the context of ICL repair as well as the repair of DSBs in general (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Krejci etÂ al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liu etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, other proteins, such as the MMS22L-TONSL complex, have been implicated in replacing RPA with RAD51, at least in the context of replication-associated DSBs (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Duro etÂ al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">OâDonnell etÂ al., 2010</xref>). Determining exactly how the removal of RPA is coordinated with RAD51 loading and nucleofilament formation will be a major challenge for the future, as will determining the precise role of RFWD3 in this surprisingly complex process.</p>

          <title>Genome editing</title>
          <p>Genome editing was carried out as described previously (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Munoz etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, Cas9 expression in HeLa FRT cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Cas9 was induced by addition of tetracycline (1Â Î¼g/ml) and after a further 16h cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing a guide (g)RNA targeting either exon 4 of <italic>RFWD3</italic> (GAAGTTACATGTATCGATGGAGG) or exon 2 of <italic>ERCC1</italic> (GATACCCCTCGACGAGGATGAGG). Cells were then selected with puromycin (3Â Î¼g/ml) for 24h, before single cell cloning. Individual clones were grown up, and screened for knockout by western blot and PCR followed by restriction enzyme digest with ClaI (RFWD3) or Taq1 (ERCC1).</p>

          <p>RT-PCR was carried out as previously described (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lachaud etÂ al., 2016a</xref>). Briefly, total mRNA was extracted from cells using a QIAGEN RNeasy kit and RT-PCR carried out using a Clontech RT-PCR kit. Oligos were designed to amplify sequences between exons 3 (TGAGAGCACCATTGGATGC) and 5 (ACAGCGTAATGCTGAGAGCC) of the RFWD3 mRNA. Sequencing was carried out by the DNA sequencing team at the University of Dundee.</p>

        <sec id="sec4.4.4">
          <title>MTS assay</title>
          <p>Cells were diluted to 2x10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml and 100Â Î¼L of cell suspension was seeded per well in a 96 well plate. After 24h, cells were treated with MMC (100Â ng/ml) and incubated for a further 48h. Finally, 20Â Î¼L MTS reagent was added per well, and absorbance at 490nm was read. For each cell line, the viability of untreated cells was taken to represent a cell viability of 100%.</p>

          <title>Clonogenic survival assay</title>
          <p>For HeLa cells, 750 cells were seeded per 10cm dish and allowed to adhere for 4-6h. For U2OS, 1000 cells were seeded per 10cm dish and allowed to adhere for the same time. Cells were then treated with the relevant genotoxin for 16h (for MMC, cisplatin and HU), at which point cells were washed free of drugs. In the case of IR, no media change was required. Likewise, no media change was carried out for olaparib as chronic treatment is required. Cells were then incubated for 1 â 2Â weeks until visible colonies had formed. Colonies were washed with 1x PBS followed by methanol, then stained with crystal violet, washed with water and counted.</p>

          <p>Chromosome abnormalities were measured as previously described (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Castor etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, cells were seeded at low confluency in 10cm dishes, and allowed to adhere before being treated with 2ng/ml MMC. After 24Â hr, cells were treated with 0.1Â Î¼g/ml colcemid (Sigma) for 2Â hr. Samples were then harvested, washed with PBS, and incubated with 75mM KCl for 20Â min at 37Â°C. Samples were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and dropped on slides to generate metaphase spreads. Chromosomes were stained with Giemsa (VWR) and abnormalities were counted using a 100x objective on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope.</p>
