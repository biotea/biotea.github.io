          <p>Chromosomal aberrations of <italic>BCL11A </italic>at 2p16.1 have been reported in a variety of B-cell malignancies and its deficiency in mice leads to a profound block in B-cell development.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of <italic>BCL11A </italic>produces multiple isoforms sharing a common N-terminus. The most abundant isoform we have identified in human lymphoid samples is <italic>BCL11A-XL</italic>, the longest transcript produced at this locus, and here we report the conservation of this major isoform and its functional characterization. We show that BCL11A-XL is a DNA-sequence-specific transcriptional repressor that associates with itself and with other BCL11A isoforms, as well as with the BCL6 proto-oncogene. Western blot data for BCL11A-XL expression coupled with data previously published for BCL6 indicates that these genes are expressed abundantly in germinal-center-derived B cells but that expression is extinguished upon terminal differentiation to the plasma cell stage. Although BCL11A-XL/BCL6 interaction can modulate BCL6 DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, their heteromeric association does not alter the homomeric transcriptional properties of either on model reporter activity. BCL11A-XL partitions into the nuclear matrix and colocalizes with BCL6 in nuclear paraspeckles.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>We propose that the conserved N-terminus of BCL11A defines a superfamily of C2HC zinc-finger transcription factors involved in hematopoietic malignancies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Malignancies of mature B lymphocytes are characterized by chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (<italic>IGH</italic>) locus on chromosome 14q32.3, resulting in the deregulated expression of the translocated proto-oncogene. Although t(2;14)(p16.1;q32.3) is a rare event in B cell malignancies, gains and amplifications of 2p16.1 (previously mapped as 2p13) have been reported in approximately 20%â50% among subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in 50% of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Previously we identified a KrÃ¼ppel zinc finger-encoding gene, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (<italic>BCL11A</italic>) and showed it to be disrupted and deregulated in four aggressive cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with t(2;14)(p16.1;q32.3) that lacked mutations within their expressed variable (V<sub>H</sub>) region genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The mouse orthologue, <italic>Evi9</italic>, was identified as a proto-oncogene by virtue of nearby recurrent retroviral insertions that correlated with the development of myeloid leukemias or B-cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Alternative pre-mRNA splicing of human <italic>BCL11A </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) leads to a minimum of four transcripts predicted to yield protein isoforms designated as eXtra-Long (XL; 5.9 kb/125 kD), Long (L; 3.8 kb/100 kD), Short (S, 2.4 kb/35 kD) and eXtra-Short (XS, 1.5 kb/25 kD). Exons 1 and 2 are common to all isoforms, whereas XL, L and S each utilize at least a portion of exon 4, leading to a variable number of C2H2 zinc fingers appended to the invariant C2HC zinc finger at the N-terminus. <italic>BCL11A-XL </italic>RNA is expressed at high levels in normal as well as malignant lymphoid tissues, including germinal center (GC) B cells, B-CLL, follicular lymphoma (FL), and DLBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, aside from its predominant expression within the B-cell compartment, high levels of <italic>BCL11A-XL </italic>RNA also accumulate in both fetal and adult brain, and in the plasmacytoid dendritic cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p>

          <p><bold>Human BCL11A locus and predicted protein isoforms</bold>. Alternative splicing within the <italic>BCL11A </italic>locus (Entrez Gene ID 53335) leads to the creation of four major protein isoforms: eXtra Long (XL; accession AJ404611), Long (L; accession AJ404612), Short (S; accession AJ404613), and eXtra Short (XS; accession AY692278). Exons 1 and 2 are common to all four isoforms, which encode a superfamily repression domain and also an unusual C2HC zinc finger likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions (see Discussion). Unlike the XS isoform, XL, L and S all employ at least a portion of Exon 4 (which encodes all six KrÃ¼ppel-type C2H2 zinc fingers). Also shown are the chromosomal breakpoints [3], 1.5 kb upstream of Exon 1, that first were described in pediatric B-CLL patients AS and LH who bore the reciprocal translocation t(2;14) (p16.1;q32.3).</p>

      <p>Although less thoroughly studied, <italic>Bcl11a/Evi9 </italic>transcript expression in the mouse mirrors that seen in the human, with highest accumulation in brain and B lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. B-cell development in Evi9 null mice generated by conventional targeted disruption is blocked at the earliest progenitor B-cell stage, underscoring the essential nature of this locus in the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The mouse equivalent of the human <italic>BCL11A-L </italic>isoform has been shown to interact and colocalize with BCL6, another KrÃ¼ppel zinc-finger proto-oncogene expressed highly in the germinal center and frequently deregulated by translocations in FL and DLBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, no functional consequences of BCL11A-BCL6 colocalization have been reported. Putative transactivation and dimerization regions as well as a potential preferred DNA binding site have been published for the murine L form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>The mouse <italic>Evi9 </italic>locus is organized quite similarly, and the genes are extraordinarily conserved at nucleotide (94%) and amino acid (95%) levels, placing <italic>BCL11A/Evi9 </italic>within a small subset of "ultra-conserved" genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Nonetheless, a murine counterpart of the XL isoform has not been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here, we document the conservation of <italic>BCL11A-XL </italic>in mouse (and chicken) and we report the first functional analysis of the human BCL11A family, with emphasis on the highly expressed XL isoform. This isoform, as with all known BCL11A isoforms, has an N-terminus that encodes a distinctive 12-amino-acid peptide as well as an atypical C2HC zinc finger; these two protein motifs are stringently conserved among a variety of hematopoietic transcription factors and allow the definition of a new superfamily.</p>

        <title>BCL11A-XL protein accumulates highly within the nuclear matrix of germinal-center lymphomas and B-cell lines and is evolutionarily conserved</title>
        <p>Previous studies have documented elevated RNA levels of <italic>BCL11A </italic>in GC-derived lymphomas such as B-CLL, FL, and Burkitt's lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Conversely, post-GC lymphomas, regardless of the cytogenetic status of 2p16.1, express significantly lower RNA levels of <italic>BCL11A </italic>isoforms (unpublished observations). We tested whether this differential pattern of RNA expression of BCL11A extends to the protein level. We generated the BCL11A/123 monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] specific to the region containing zinc fingers 4â6 which is fully retained in BCL11A-XL, partially shared by BCL11A-L, but excluded by alternative splicing in BCL11A-S and BCL11A-XS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>
        <p>BCL11A/123 detects endogenous expression of BCL11A-XL in human B-cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) previously documented to express high levels of <italic>BCL11A </italic>RNA transcripts. Its size (~125 kD) is indistinguishable from that observed in vitro or when transfected (see below). As a trend, XL protein expression prevailed among pre-GC and GC-derived B-lymphoid cell lines, but was low to negative in cell lines representative of late-GC or post-GC stages of B-cell development. Among the post-GC lines, the majority of multiple myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) samples were negative for BCL11A-XL. Lastly, BCL11A was not expressed in the majority of myeloid and T-cell leukemias.</p>

Western blotting using BCL11A/123 to detect BCL11A-XL in a panel of malignant lymphoid cell lines. Cell types, indicated at the top with individual representatives (lane numbers) are arrayed from left to right according to B-cell development status.

Expression is highest in samples representative of earlier stages of B-cell differentiation (e.g., CLL, FL). Expression is low to negative in cell lines representative of later (post-germinal-center) stages of differentiation (e.g., MM and HL). The filter was stripped and re-probed (bottom panel) with anti-Î²-actin as a loading control.</p>

        <p>We fractionated lysates prepared from the Granta-452 and Namalwa lymphoid-derived cell lines expressing high levels of BCL11A-XL into cytoplasm (C), nucleoplasm (NP), chromatin (CH), and nuclear matrix (NM). Western blotting studies of lymphoid cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) demonstrate that the XL isoform is sequestered mostly into the NM fraction. The L form can localize additionally into the CH. Endogenous BCL11A expression in HEK293 cells is moderate compared to B-lymphoid cell lines and shows a similar enrichment of XL in the NM fraction, although when transfected, ectopic BCL11A-XL in HEK293 localizes to the NP fraction as well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We further observed that BCL6 fractionated primarily into the NM regardless of whether endogenously or exogenously expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Curiously, although absent in the electronic databases and undocumented in the literature, we easily detected BCL11A-XL in tissues and cell lines derived from mouse and chicken (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p>

        <title>BCL11A-XL interacts with BCL6, with itself, and with the other BCL11A isoforms</title>
        <p>Previous studies showed that the mouse <italic>Evi9a </italic>L-form colocalized and associated with BCL6 when ectopically over-expressed in non-B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To test this for the human isoforms, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using proteins generated <italic>in vitro </italic>and in transient co-transfections of COS-7 or HEK293 cells. As expected, human BCL11A-L interacted with BCL6 in both assays. No interaction between BCL11A-S and BCL6 was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). XL interacted strongly with BCL6 under these artificial conditions, but importantly, the endogenous complex could also be immunoprecipitated from a B-cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A similar series of immunoprecipitations revealed the surprising result that all three isoforms can interact with each other or with themselves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These data indicate that interaction faces essential for homomeric interactions (the exons common to all isoforms) differ from those essential for heteromeric association with BCL6 (the exons not shared with the S isoform). Further, they raise the possibility that the relative ratios of BCL6 and the BCL11A isoforms may determine their DNA binding or transcriptional regulatory properties.</p>

        <title>BCL11A-XL and BCL6 interactions affect respective DNA binding activities in vitro but have little effect on respective transcriptional repression activities in vivo</title>
        <p>Initially we tested whether N-terminal Gal4-DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD) fusions of XL and the other BCL11A isoforms could modulate transcriptional activity of a firefly reporter bearing 4x-Gal4 DNA binding sites. Results of co-transfections in HEK293 cells (BCL11A-positive; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and in the murine B-cell lines BCL1 (BCL11A-positive, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and M12.4 (BCL11A-negative, data not shown) are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. All fusion BCL11A constructs significantly repressed transcription 5â10 fold in both cell types. Unexpectedly, the predominantly cytoplasmic S isoform consistently showed higher levels of repression than XL or L. Most of BCL11A-S was artificially driven into the nucleus by the strong nuclear localization sequence (NLS) present on the Gal4DBD (data not shown). No significant alteration of BCL11A activity was observed in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), although consistent with previous findings, BCL6 repression was released up to 7-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results indicate that homomeric BCL6 and BCL11A execute trans-repression by different mechanisms.</p>

        <p>Although BCL11A-XL and L interact with each other and with BCL6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), we observed no effect of BCL6 on BCL11A repression in co-transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Similarly, we observed no synergistic or even additive effects when various BCL11A isoforms were co-transfected (data not shown). Since BCL6 has been shown to repress by binding to a specific consensus motif within target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we employed a luciferase reporter in which the minimal SV40 promoter is appended upstream with 5Ã-BCL6 binding sites in tandem. Neither BCL11A-XL nor the other isoforms significantly affected BCL6-mediated repression in HEK293 cells (data not shown). When these experiments were performed in DT40 chicken-derived pre-B cells, a modest yet consistent de-repression was reciprocally observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The specificity of this effect might be questioned by the fact that the non-BCL6-interacting S isoform de-repressed to an equivalent extent. However, since all BCL11A isoforms interact with each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), the relatively high endogenous levels of XL in DT40 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) might drive an S-XL heterodimer into the nucleus (re-addressed below and in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) where, as shown by the GAL4-fusion data of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, its repression activity is strong.</p>

Although the CASTing probe produced significant non-specific binding, BCL11A-XL-transfected HEK293 cell extracts bind dose dependently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, lanes 3â4), whereas parent cell or BCL6-transfected extract (shown to be competent for binding its own site, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) do not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, lanes 1â2). EMSAs using four repeats of this consensus as probe in transfected DT40 cell extracts showed specific binding for XL as judged by antibody super-shifts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, lanes 16â17). Furthermore, binding of BCL11A-XL was significantly enhanced as levels of BCL6-containing DT40 nuclear extract were increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, lanes 10â12).

        <p>Collectively these data allow us to conclude that the human BCL11A isoforms are capable of repressing transcription when tethered to an artificial promoter in a TSA-independent manner when ectopically and transiently over-expressed. Furthermore, BCL11A-XL appears to be capable of site-specific DNA binding. Reciprocal effects of BCL6 or BCL11A on their respective transcriptional repressive activities were modest at best, even though either protein could modulate the specific binding of the other in vitro.</p>

        <title>BCL11A-XL and BCL6 segregate within nuclear paraspeckles</title>
        <p>Murine Evi9a/Bcl11a-L and BCL6 were previously reported to colocalize within an uncharacterized "nuclear dot" subdomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We observed BCL11A-XL to localize exclusively within nuclear dots, and colocalized with the major fraction of BCL6 found inside the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The dot pattern for BCL11A-XL was not the result of ectopic overexpression as it was also observed in BCL11A/123 stains of endogenous XL-expressing B cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, and data not shown). BCL11A-L, which showed fewer nuclear dots and more diffuse nuclear staining than BCL11A-XL, also appeared to colocalize with BCL6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, right panel), even though at least a significant portion of L partitioned to a different (chromatin) nuclear sub-fraction biochemically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We further determined that neither the BCL11A-L nor XL-containing nuclear dots were PML or Sp100 subnuclear domains (data not shown). Although co-staining GFP-BCL11A-XL transfected cells with an antibody against SC35, a prototypic speckles marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], revealed a similar but non-overlapping pattern for the two proteins, GFP-BCL11A-XL appeared instead to surround the speckles and the nucleolus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). We also observed in other experiments that some cells could randomly display curiously large aggregates, or caps, of BCL11A-XL around the nucleolus (data not shown); further experimentation revealed that intentional blocking of transcription with chemical inhibitors could significantly increase this perinucleolar accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Both of these properties â adjacency to speckles and peirnucleolar relocalization â are reminiscent of the paraspeckle nuclear subdomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, our results show clear co-localization of BCL11A-XL with two "paraspeckle-specific" (PSP) proteins, PSP1 and nonO/p54nrb, demonstrating BCL11A-XL as a resident of the paraspeckle subnuclear body. In further support of this model, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments document protein-protein interaction (possibly indirect) between nonO and BCL11A-XL (data not shown).</p>
        <p>BCL11A-XL and BCL6 are in the nuclear matrix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting the possibility of cross-talk between it and the paraspeckle. Treatment of GFP-BCL11A-XL expressing cells with RNase (alone or combined with Actinomycin D) showed no significant effects on subcellular partitioning (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Treatment with DNase, however, led to a more diffuse perinuclear pattern, and when transcription was blocked, paraspeckles were completely disrupted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>).</p>

        <p>BCL11A-S shows predominantly cytoplasmic localization, although small amounts of protein appear to localize diffusely within the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). When we co-transfected GFP-BCL11A-S with GAL4-fusions of XL or L, we observed essentially quantitative translocation of S into paraspeckles, apparently indistinguishable from those of XL or L alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Nuclear localization of the XL/S or L/S heteromeric complexes was dominant, in that cytoplasmic relocalization of XL or L by S was never observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and data not shown). These data indicate that the relative ratios of S to XL may determine the subcellular localization of the S form, which when delivered to the nucleus is the most potent repressor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have studied expression and functional features of the human BCL11A family with an emphasis on the heretofore uncharacterized XL isoform. Why XL expression has eluded detection in other species is unclear, as our data indicate that it also is a major protein isoform in mouse and chicken. Possible contributing factors might include the significant toxicity/apoptosis associated with XL over-expression (data not shown) or the general difficulties in cloning full-length mRNAs of this length (~5.9 kb), although this transcript was indeed detected but not described in a previous publication by another research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We established the expression pattern of XL and showed that it, along with S and L isoforms, can repress transcription. BCL11A-XL can bind consensus DNA target sites specifically. Finally, we showed that XL localizes to paraspeckle nuclear bodies involved in RNA metabolism, can interact with the BCL6 proto-oncogene, and can transport repression-competent, cytoplasmic BCL11A-S to the nucleus.</p>

        <title>BCL11A is expressed from the earliest B-cell progenitors through the GC stage, but is extinguished in terminally differentiated plasma cells</title>
        <p>Previous studies in human or mouse were restricted to the RNA level. The transcription profile is highly similar in both species, with expression primarily in the immune and central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The fact that development of Bcl11a-deficient B cells was blocked at the earliest progenitor B-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] indicates that its expression initiates in a stem cell compartment. Microarray experiments have indicated high expression of BCL11A transcripts in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p>
        <p>At the protein level, one notable difference between human and mouse appears to be the absence of BCL11A in the majority of human myeloid cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) even though Bcl11a was initially described in myeloid leukemias arisen in the mouse BXH2 recombinant inbred strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. With few exceptions, BCL11A-XL protein is expressed in pre-GC and GC-derived B lymphoid cell lines, but is low to negative in cell lines representative of late-GC or post-GC stages of B cell development. The GC-derived Burkitt lymphomas are phenotypically diverse and the expression of BCL11A-XL does not correlate with the presence or absence of Epstein-Barr virus; however, as a trend, those Burkitt's which display a type III viral latency (a lymphoblastoid phenotype) tend to be negative for BCL11A-XL. This trend is supported indirectly by the observation that type III lines tend conversely to be positive for the putative repressor of BCL11A, namely, Blimp-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Among the post-GC lines, the majority of multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's lymphoma samples were negative for BCL11A-XL protein. This agrees well with published microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The probes used in microarray experiments further indicate that all BCL11A transcripts are coordinately down-regulated in these post-GC cell lines.</p>
        <p>Our related studies using BCL11A/123 for immunostaining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] indicate that XL is expressed at low to undetectable levels in most normal adult tissues but has highest expression in hematopoietic cells. The presence of XL in mantle zone and GC subsets while absent in normal plasma cells is consistent with the Western data of representative cell lines presented here.</p>
        <p>The expression pattern of BCL11A-XL among B-cell lines suggests that its down-regulation might be a requirement for plasmacytic differentiation. This observation is supported by previous gene expression profiling studies where BCL11A-XL was identified as a possible target gene repressed by Blimp-1, a master regulator of plasma cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In support of this observation, we have identified a subset of putative BCL11A target genes which overlap with confirmed targets of Blimp-1 in plasma cells (G.C.I., P.W.T., and A.L.S, unpublished observations).</p>

        <p>We determined by reiterative oligonucleotide selection that in vitro BCL11A-XL binds to the core consensus 5'-C-C-C/T-A/G-C-3' (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). This sequence differs from the consensus binding sequence (5'-GGCCGGAGG-3') determined in a similar manner for the mouse BCL11A-L equivalent, Evi9a/CTIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We were unable to confirm specific binding to this sequence for either the human L form or for the XL and S isoforms (data not shown). The basis for this is unclear. We noticed that nearly 25% of our individual BCL11A-XL CASTing sequences constituted E-boxes (CAXXTG) or contained isolated E-boxes nearby. One particular E-box, CACCTG, can be found immediately upstream of numerous mature B-cell signature genes (e.g., CD19, CD21, and CD37) that are modulated, like BCL11A, by the induction or over-expression of Blimp-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p>
        <p>As shown previously for the mouse L form equivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], human XL and L also associate physically with the protein product of the BCL6 proto-oncogene (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The association of BCL11A and BCL6 also has been recently confirmed by mass spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. BCL6 encodes a multiple zinc finger-containing, sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional repressor that is frequently deregulated by translocation into <italic>IGH </italic>or into (at least) 20 other non-<italic>IGH </italic>loci in FL and DLBCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. BCL6 targets include genes involved in B cell activation, B cell differentiation (e.g., Blimp-1), inflammation, and cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>Since BCL11A and BCL6 are both proto-oncogenes with overlapping expression patterns, a clear biological significance could be envisioned for the heterodimerization of their protein products. Therefore, we were surprised at our inability to demonstrate robust reciprocal effects of BCL6 and BCL11A in transcription assays, whether we used B-cell lines negative (M12.4) or positive (BCL1, DT40) for endogenous BCL11A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5AâC</xref>), even though BCL6/BCL11A-XL association <italic>in vitro </italic>appears to alter DNA binding of either factor to its specific target sequence (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). There are several technical explanations. Nuclear matrix-associated proteins such as BCL11A-XL and BCL6 have been shown to most efficiently transactivate reporters that are integrated within chromatin â a condition not achieved in our transient assays. Alternatively, BCL11A isoform interactions in some cells might be strongly biased toward the homomeric, leaving insufficient opportunity for BCL6 to form heteromeric interactions <italic>in vivo </italic>(albeit the heterodimer can be observed <italic>in vitro </italic>or after lysis of intact cells). An explanation we favor is that the BCL6/BCL11A-XL interaction is merely indirect; ie, both proteins are sequestered proximally in the same subnuclear compartment and both associate with an intermediary protein complex. One such intermediary may be the Mi-2/NuRD co-repressor complex. Recent data demonstrate the interaction of NuRD (specifically the MTA subunits) with several transcription factors, including p53, BCL6, BCL11B, and BCL11A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although they appear to direct transcription independently, BCL6 and BCL11A may antagonize one another at the post-transcriptional level to contribute to the germinal center reaction through their interactions with the Mi-2/NuRD co-repressor complex.</p>

        <title>BCL11A and BCL6 reside in nuclear paraspeckles</title>
        <p>BCL6 was initially reported to colocalize with mouse Evi9a in nuclear dots of unknown identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have determined by colocalization of documented markers that the BCL11A-XL and BCL6 particles are paraspeckles. Paraspeckles are nuclear aggregates previously shown to contain hnRNA and three paraspeckle-specific (PSP) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Two of these (PSP1 and nonO) were shown to colocalize with BCL11A-XL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), and nonO can form an immunoprecipitable complex with XL (data not shown). Paraspeckles were thought to function exclusively in RNA metabolism. Our data challenge that contention and assign BCL11A and BCL6 as the first DNA-binding transcription factors to reside in this compartment. The subnuclear localization of BCL11A-XL in paraspeckles suggests that it may be involved in some topological aspect of transcription. Indeed, as shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>, transcription inhibitors and treatment with DNase (but not RNase) can significantly alter the subnuclear partitioning of BCL11A-XL. This was similarly documented for PSP1 and nonO and referred to as peri-nucleolar capping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. DNAse-mediated conversion to a diffused pattern indicated that paraspeckle structure is intimately associated with DNA structural integrity, such as provided by the nuclear matrix and its resident proteins, such as BCL11A-XL, BCL6, PSP1, and nonO.</p>
        <p>Our subcellular localization studies may provide an alternative and novel explanation for the lack of functional consequences of BCL6/BCL11A-XL interaction. Contents of paraspeckles have been shown to translocate into nucleoli under conditions of cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Accordingly, we observed under transcriptional starvation and following cell damage with etoposide that BCL11A-XL and BCL6 re-localized to nucleoli in U2OS osteosarcoma cells (data not shown). Often these nuclei showed a "donut" type pattern, in which BCL6 accumulated along the rim, and BCL11A-XL within the center. This pattern is strikingly similar to the "BCL6 dots" observed by electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and suggests that, under conditions of stress/DNA damage, XL and BCL6 collaboration <italic>in vivo </italic>may be inhibited because they are sequestered in discrete regions of the nuclear dot and incapable of functional association. Such conditions might exist in GC B cell nuclei as they undergo extensive double-stranded DNA damage during the SHM process.</p>

        <title>BCL11A isoform complexity and hematopoietic malignancies</title>
        <p>The N-terminus and C2HC zinc-finger are highly conserved across evolution within BCL11A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and among at least four other genes (EHZF, FOG1, FOG2, and BCL11B) such as to define a superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. All five genes are essential to myeloid (EHZF), megakaryocytic (FOG1 and FOG2), T-lymphoid (BCL11B) and B-lymphoid (BCL11A) development; three (BCL11A and B, EHZF) have been implicated in hematological malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In transient transfection assays, BCL11A isoforms act as repressors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5AâC</xref>). However, consistent with what has been observed for the FOG superfamily members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], homo- and heterodimerization of BCL11A likely occurs via the conserved C2HC zinc finger, and protein dimers might activate or repress transcription depending on context. Like the FOG genes, post-translational modifications of BCL11A or associated corepressors (e.g., Mi-2/NuRD) might regulate its activity as either a repressor or activator of transcription. We anticipate that some BCL11A targets will be shared and others will be isoform-specific.</p>
        <p>The first 12 amino acids of the conserved N-terminus, when tethered to GAL4DBD, are both necessary and sufficient to mediate repression of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This N-terminal superfamily repressor domain provides a rationale for our observation that the cytoplasmic S form can repress transcription. These data are consistent with studies of Evi9/CTIP1, indicating that a trans-repression domain resides within the shared N-terminal region of all isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although each of the four BCL11A isoforms can homodimerize with itself or heterodimerize with any of the other isoforms, only the nuclear forms (XL and L) interact with BCL6. A dramatic consequence of heterodimerization of the cytoplasmic isoforms with the nuclear isoforms is their nuclear translocation (shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> for S) to nuclear paraspeckles when heterodimerized with either XL or L forms. The data indicate that the interactions and probably the ratios among BCL11A isoforms and between BCL11A and BCL6 will be important in controlling their functions.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>BCL11A is one representative of a superfamily of transcription factors known to be involved in normal as well as malignant hematopoetic development. BCL11A can modulate transcription activity in vitro but in a way that is likely to be context dependent in vivo since we have shown that BCL11A can interact with other proteins (namely, the BCL6 proto-oncogene) and that BCL11A exhibits different subcellular and subnuclear compartmentalization according to which of the various isoforms is examined. Here we have focused attention on the novel XL isoform which had heretofore been undescribed. We have shown that BCL11A-XL is a DNA-sequence-specific transcriptional repressor in vitro, which, like the transcription factors BCL6 and nonO, localizes to nuclear paraspeckles in vivo. Because of the ability of BCL11A-XL to associate with itself as well as with other BCL11A isoforms, future studies of BCL11A will require a careful and thorough description of all the alternative splice variants produced at this locus.</p>
