      <abstract>
        <p>The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) is stabilized in a latent form by Î±4, a regulatory protein essential for cell survival and biogenesis of all PP2A complexes. Here we report the structure of Î±4 bound to the N-terminal fragment of PP2Ac. This structure suggests that Î±4 binding to the full-length PP2Ac requires local unfolding near the active site, which perturbs the scaffold subunit binding site at the opposite surface via allosteric relay. These changes stabilize an inactive conformation of PP2Ac and convert oligomeric PP2A complexes to the Î±4 complex upon perturbation of the active site. The PP2AcâÎ±4 interface is essential for cell survival and sterically hinders a PP2A ubiquitination site, important for the stability of cellular PP2Ac. Our results show that Î±4 is a scavenger chaperone that binds to and stabilizes partially folded PP2Ac for stable latency, and reveal a mechanism by which Î±4 regulates cell survival, and biogenesis and surveillance of PP2A holoenzymes.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the most important and abundant phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatases in all eukaryotic cells. It forms more than 100 trimeric holoenzymes that target a broad range of cellular substrates, and has a crucial role in many aspects of cellular function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Each holoenzyme comprises a common core enzyme, formed by a scaffold (A) and a catalytic subunit (C or PP2Ac), and a variable regulatory subunit from four distinct families that controls substrate specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Besides holoenzymes, PP2Ac also associates with a highly conserved regulatory Î±4 protein that displaces both scaffold and regulatory subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>Mammalian Î±4 was initially identified as an immunoglobulin-binding protein (IGBP1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and shown to be essential for the survival and maturation of T and B cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Conditional knockout of Î±4 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells showed that Î±4 is an essential inhibitor of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Consistent with this observation, overexpression of Î±4 has been linked to multiple types of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The yeast homologue of Î±4, TAP42, is essential for many aspects of cellular function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. TAP42/Î±4 has an important role in the Tor pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and DNA damage response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Interestingly, Tor signalling in turn regulates the level of phosphataseâTAP42 interactions in yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
    <p>The cellular function of Î±4 is presumably mediated by its interaction with PP2A and PP2A-like phosphatases, PP4 and PP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), which share a high degree of sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and regulatory mechanisms with PP2A. Despite intense study, the mechanism of Î±4 in phosphatase regulation remained elusive. Mammalian Î±4 was initially suggested to be a regulatory subunit that inhibits PP2A activity towards some substrates, but augments its activity towards others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. More recently, Î±4 was shown to protect PP2A from poly-ubiquitination and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Although Î±4 binds exclusively to PP2Ac and the Î±4-bound phosphatase is inactive, it was shown to be essential for the formation, stability, and activity of all PP2A complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, underlying the function of Î±4 in stable PP2A latency. Understanding the mechanism of Î±4 function relies on the high-resolution structure of Î±4 bound to PP2Ac, which, however, had been very slow to emerge.</p>
    <p>Here we report the structural basis of Î±4 interaction with PP2Ac and link their contacts to the cellular function of Î±4. Intriguingly, the Î±4-binding site is absent in active PP2Ac, but can be induced by dislodging catalytic metal ions or constitutively exposed in an N-terminal fragment of PP2Ac (nPP2Ac, 1â153). The crystal structure of nPP2Ac bound to Î±4 shows that Î±4 binding involves PP2A internal packing near the phosphatase active site, which requires local unfolding of a âhelix switchâ and âloop switchâ. This stabilizes an inactive conformation of the active site and leads to an allosteric relay through the central Î²-sheet that alters the scaffold subunit-binding site at the opposite surface. Our study demonstrates that Î±4 binds selectively to and stabilizes the partially folded PP2Ac for stable PP2A latency, which underlies an important molecular basis for the role of Î±4 in cell survival and phosphatase regulation.</p>

        <title>Crystallization of nPP2Ac bound to Î±4</title>
        <p>Initial efforts to determine the crystal structure of the PP2AcâÎ±4 complex were hampered by the lack of interaction between Î±4 and the purified recombinant active PP2Ac <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a,b</xref>). Based on reports that the interaction between PP2Ac and Î±4 was increased by heat shock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and our recent data that suggested a malleable nature of PP2Ac following eviction of catalytic metal ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we tested the possibility that Î±4 binds selectively to the partially folded PP2Ac. Co-incubation with pyrophosphate (PPi) at 37âÂ°C rapidly dislodges PP2A catalytic metal ions as indicated by ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), resulting in rapid formation of a stoichiometric complex between PP2Ac and Î±4 accompanied by a nearly complete loss of phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Î±4 binding in turn prevented rapid aggregation of PP2Ac upon dislodging of catalytic metal ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These results are consistent with our notion that PP2Ac is partially folded in the absence of catalytic metal ions, which allows Î±4 binding that in turn prevents aggregation, presumably by shielding exposed PP2Ac internal packing. The resulting PP2AcâÎ±4 complex, however, eluded crystallization despite considerable effort.</p>
        <p>We then turned our efforts to identify a sub-domain of PP2Ac that constitutively exposes the Î±4-binding site. Extensive test based on the structure of active PP2Ac (PDB accession code: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2IE3">2IE3</ext-link>) led to identification of an N-terminal fragment of PP2Ac (nPP2Ac, residues 1â153) that was successfully expressed in a soluble form and bound to Î±4 without incubation at 37âÂ°C. This partial PP2Ac encompasses the compact N-terminal helix motif and the closely packed Î²-strands in the first layer of the two central Î²-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The binding affinity between nPP2Ac and Î±4 was 0.3âÎ¼M measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, ITC barely detected any interaction between active PP2Ac and Î±4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). Thus, nPP2Ac resembles the partially folded PP2Ac in exposing the Î±4-binding site. This interaction is highly conserved, as TAP42 could replace Î±4 for interaction with nPP2Ac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2c</xref>). After extensive efforts, an nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex was crystallized and the structure was determined by Se-Met SAD (single-wavelength anomalous dispersion), and refined to 2.8âÃ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Although we had attempted molecular replacement using the structure of TAP42 or Î±4 (PDB accession codes: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="3QC1">3QC1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2V0P">2V0P</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and a partial structure derived from active PP2Ac (PDB accession code: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2IE3">2IE3</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, no solution was obtained, likely due to large conformational changes in the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Overall structure of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex</title>
        <p>The structure of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex showed that a pair of widely opened helix tweezers formed by helix 5 and 6 in Î±4, 45âÃ and 55âÃ in length, respectively, clamp onto the ends of the helix motif of nPP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The Î±4 helix tweezers are more open in the Î±4 apo-structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, but adopt a relatively closed conformation by interaction with nPP2Ac. Little change is observed for the PP2Ac helix motif compared with active PP2Ac, suggesting that folding of this helix motif remains intact in the partially folded PP2Ac. One of the helices (C63â69) is relaxed into an extended strand, likely induced by crystal packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
        <p>The single layer Î²-sheet in nPP2Ac self-associates at the crystal packing interface and partially restores the bilayer architecture in full-length PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Unlike the helix motif, the Î²-strands in nPP2Ac are shifted, and the three active site loops and metal-chelating residues within these loops are largely disordered and invisible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). These changes might reflect those in the partially folded PP2Ac. As binding of catalytic metal ions is required to stabilize the active site loops and enzyme structure, it is conceivable that the absence of catalytic metal ions might affect the conformation of the active loops and the central Î²-sheets that are directly linked to these loops.</p>
        <p>The structure of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex provides an important opportunity to elucidate changes in PP2Ac required for Î±4 binding. Alignment of active PP2Ac (PDB accession code: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2IE3">2IE3</ext-link>) and the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex via the unaltered helices revealed that two structural elements in active PP2Ac near the phosphatase active site need to be unfolded to allow Î±4 binding: a small helix (C120â126, helix switch) and an extended loop (C183â195, loop switch) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Dynamics of helix and loop switch in the Î±4-bound PP2Ac</title>
        <p>To corroborate the structural observation, we examined the dynamic nature of the helix and loop switch in the Î±4-bound PP2Ac using hydrogenâdeuterium (HâD) exchange mass spectrometry (MS). For active PP2Ac (stabilized by Mn<sup>++</sup>), the peptides encompassing the helix switch and its neighbouring active site loop (86â95) exhibited the highest level of backbone amide deuterium intake among all the detected PP2Ac peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), indicating that the helix switch is already dynamic in active PP2Ac. The level of deuterium intake into the Î±4-bound PP2Ac was compared with active PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Two buried peptides in active PP2Ac encompassing central Î²-strands (residues150â158 and 256â265) exhibit the highest increase in deuterium intake upon binding to Î±4, indicating that PP2Ac central structures become dynamic in the Î±4-bound PP2Ac. One of these peptides (residues150â158) is buried by the loop switch in active PP2Ac, consistent with the structural observation that Î±4 binding requires local unfolding of the loop switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Collectively, the results of HâD exchange support our notion that the structure of nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex reflects the interaction between PP2Ac and Î±4.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Displacement of PP2Ac internal packing</title>
        <p>The helix and loop switch directly contact each other and fold against the N-terminal helix motif in active PP2Ac (PDB accession code: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="2IE3">2IE3</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The underlying internal packing required for Î±4 binding is clustered at two arginine centres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). At the first arginine centre of active PP2Ac, Arg185 in loop switch makes extensive intramolecular H-bond interactions to the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 40, 42 and 152 and the sidechain of Asn44, buttressed by hydrophobic contacts made by Leu186 in loop switch to Thr40 and Tyr152. In the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex, Arg155 of Î±4 occupies the same position as Arg185 in PP2A loop switch, making similar intermolecular contacts, and Ile159 of Î±4 replaces internal hydrophobic contacts of Leu186 in PP2A loop switch and forms intermolecular contacts to the same PP2Ac residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). At the second arginine centre of active PP2Ac, Arg121 in helix switch makes extensive intramolecular H-bond and salt-bridge interactions to three acidic residues, Asp148, Asp151, and Glu188, buttressed by an H-bond formed by Thr122 and Trp143 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Arg121 also interacts with Glu188, contributing to internal packing between helix (Arg121) and loop switch (Glu188) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Relaxation of helix switch disrupts the internal packing of Arg121 and allows similar intermolecular H-bond and salt-bridge network to be formed between Lys158 of Î±4 and Asp148/151 of PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). It also allows van der Waals contacts between Trp143 of PP2Ac and at least four residues in Î±4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
        <p>The contacts with PP2Ac internal packing constitute the bulk central region of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 interface, which is buttressed by Î±4 contacts with the fully exposed PP2Ac surface residues at two peripheral arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). At one arm, Glu33 and Glu37 in PP2Ac make several H-bond interactions with Tyr162 of Î±4. At the other arm, Tyr130 in PP2Ac makes hydrophobic contacts with Ile217 and Leu218 in Î±4 and H-bond interaction with Î±4 acidic residues, Glu214. The later in turn makes a salt-bridge interaction with Lys144 of PP2Ac. Collectively, the nPP2AcâÎ±4 interface buries 1800 âÃ<sup>2</sup> of surface area, half of which involves PP2Ac internal packing.</p>
        <p>The nPP2AcâÎ±4 interface explains previous observations on phosphatase-Î±4 interactions. A majority of PP2Ac residues at the interface with Î±4 are the same as those in PP4c and PP6c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), consistent with previous observations that Î±4 specifically regulates the function of all PP2A-like phosphatases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Double mutation of TAP42 (R163E/K166D) or human Î±4 (R155E/K158D) abolished its interaction with PP2A and PP6 and compromised the function of Î±4 in protecting PP2A from degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Both of these residues contact PP2Ac internal packing at the nPP2AcâÎ±4 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Arg155 and Lys158 are located in helix 5 of Î±4 that adopts various conformations in TAP42 dramatically different from Î±4 apo-structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Despite these structural variations, TAP42 and Î±4 bind to nPP2Ac equally well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2c</xref>). Structural alignment shows that helix 5 in the open form of TAP42 (MolA) overlaps with helix 5 of the nPP2Ac-bound Î±4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). This supports TAP42 interaction with nPP2Ac, but neither forms of TAP42 would interact with active PP2Ac. Helix 5 in Î±4 apo-structure has minor clashes with active PP2Ac, but is placed near a patch of basic and hydrophobic surface of active PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>). The underlying repulsive contacts explain why Î±4 could not bind directly to active PP2Ac despite its ability to adopt a widely opened conformation.</p>

        <title>Î±4 stabilizes an inactive conformation of the active site</title>
        <p>One important consequence of displacement of PP2A helix and loop switch and Î±4 binding is that the PP2Ac active site is stabilized in an inactive conformation. The helix switch is connected to the PP2Ac active site loop harbouring metal-chelating residue Asn117, and juxtaposed to another active site loop that harbours metal-chelating residue Asp85 in active PP2Ac. Both loops are intrinsically dynamic as indicated by HâD exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex, both active site loops and metal-chelating residues are largely disordered and restricted in a distorted conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine whether the Î±4-bound PP2Ac is indeed stabilized in an inactive conformation, we purified the Î±4-bound full-length PP2Ac generated by PPi treatment over gel filtration column to remove PPi and free metal ions, followed by measurement of the phosphatase activity with and without re-activation by Mn<sup>++</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a</xref>). Addition of Mn<sup>++</sup> barely restored the phosphatase activity of the inactive complex that could barely associate with Mn<sup>++</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5b</xref>). This result is consistent with the structural observation that the Î±4-bound PP2Ac is stabilized in an inactive conformation that cannot bind metal ions.</p>

        <title>Exclusive binding of Î±4 and PP2A scaffold subunit</title>
        <p>Previous studies suggested that Î±4 and the scaffold subunit bind mutually exclusively to PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Strikingly, structures of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex and PP2A core enzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> show that Î±4 and the scaffold subunit bind to opposite sides of PP2Ac and do not overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We hypothesize that exclusive binding of Î±4 and the scaffold subunit is mediated by allosteric changes through PP2A inner structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The first central Î²-sheet of PP2Ac connects to the active site loops and the helix switch at one end, and to the scaffold-binding site at the other end<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Unfolding of helix switch and perturbation of active site loops would lead to shift of the central Î²-sheet that in turn alters the scaffold subunit-binding site at the opposite end. These changes favour Î±4 binding but weaken scaffold subunit binding.</p>
        <p>Consistent with this notion, perturbation of the PP2A active site by incubation with 2âmM PPi leads to rapid switch of the PP2A core enzyme (AC complex) to the GST-tagged Î±4/PP2Ac complex at 37âÂ°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The presence of 50âÎ¼M Mn<sup>++</sup> ions, which helps to stabilize the active site, inhibited slow conversion of PP2A core enzyme to the GST-Î±4/PP2Ac complex. No scaffold subunit was associated with the PP2AcâÎ±4 complex, supporting exclusive binding of Î±4 and the scaffold subunit.</p>
        <p>A weakened interaction between the scaffold and catalytic subunits is expected to also destabilize the trimeric holoenzyme. Co-incubation of GST-Î±4 and the holoenzyme containing Bâ²Î³1 at 37âÂ°C in the presence of 2âmM PPi led to rapid conversion of the holoenzyme to the GST-Î±4/PP2Ac complex, excluding both the scaffold and Bâ²Î³1 regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Conversion of the holoenzyme could be barely observed in the absence of PPi. The much lower rate of holoenzyme conversion compared with the core enzyme reflects the higher stability of the holoenzyme. This suggests that PP2Ac that cannot form stable holoenzymes would have a greater tendency to associate with Î±4. This explains why mutation of PP2Ac that disrupted binding of the scaffold subunit led to an increased association with Î±4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p>

        <title>Î±4-phosphatase interface dictates the role of Î±4 in survival</title>
        <p>To determine if the PP2AcâÎ±4 interface predicted from the structure of nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex is essential for Î±4 function, we identified Î±4 mutations that disrupted PP2Ac interaction. As shown by pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), Î±4 mutations, R155E and K158D at the interface with PP2Ac internal packing and Y162D and E214R at the interface with PP2Ac surface residues, completely abolished the interaction between Î±4 and the GST-tagged nPP2Ac. In contrast, a mutation located outside the nPP2AcâÎ±4 interface, E206R, barely affected the interaction. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding results, recombinant Flag-tagged Î±4 harbouring mutations at either interface, R155E and E214R, had severely reduced interaction with the cellular full-length PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next determined whether the Î±4 interface mutations affected the function of Î±4 in cell survival.

As shown by viable cell growth assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>, right panel), the cell death phenotype caused by Î±4 knockout (Î±4-KO) was reversed by the expression of wild-type Flag-Î±4, but not by vector control. In contrast, Flag-Î±4-bearing mutations at either PP2Ac interface, R155E or E214R, could not rescue cell death caused by Î±4-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

        <title>Interaction with Î±4 is essential for PP2Ac stability</title>
        <p>The previous study showed that knockout of Î±4 led to a complete loss of total cellular PP2A and PP2A-like phosphatases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. To test whether the stability of cellular PP2Ac relies on its interaction with Î±4, we examined the turnover rate of V5-tagged PP2Ac (V5-C)-bearing mutations that disrupt interaction with Î±4. The level of V5-C was monitored at different times after addition of cycloheximide to inhibit <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. Because a large area of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 interface involves PP2Ac internal packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), PP2Ac mutations were carefully chosen not to perturb internal packing and were limited to surface residues at the interface with Î±4. Recombinant wild-type V5-C interacted readily with Î±4 and exhibited a half-life of about 13âh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7aâc</xref>). V5-C-bearing mutation of PP2Ac surface residues at the interface with Î±4, Y130D/D131R, failed to interact with Î±4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>) and exhibited a higher turnover rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>) and a minimum of sixfold reduction in the half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). V5-C-bearing mutations outside the interface with Î±4, K29E, barely affected Î±4 binding or the cellular stability of PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7aâc</xref>). These data indicate that Î±4 interaction is required for the stability of cellular PP2Ac.</p>
        <p>Î±4 was also shown to stabilize PP2Ac and protect it from poly-ubiquitination and degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The structure of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex shows that several lysine residues of PP2Ac are located at or near the interface to Î±4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Among these residues, Lys41 was detected as a ubiquitination site in a global ubiquitination analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. By cycloheximide-chasing procedure, we showed that V5-C K41R exhibited an extended half-life in C6 cells compared with wild-type V5-C, whereas mutation to another lysine residue, K34R, had no effect on the turnover rate of V5-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although Î±4 is critical for the function of all eukaryotic cells and has been intensely investigated for almost two decades, the mechanism of Î±4 in PP2A regulation and in cellular function has remained enigmatic. In this study, we have shown that the PP2AcâÎ±4 interaction relies on partial unfolding near the phosphatase active site, and determined the crystal structure of Î±4 bound to nPP2Ac, a partial PP2Ac encompassing the N-terminal half of PP2Ac. The structure predicts that two structural elements near the phosphatase active site in active PP2Ac, loop switch and helix switch, hinder Î±4 binding. Displacement of these two structural elements is essential for Î±4 binding, and associated with two major consequences: distortion of the active site conformation, and allosteric changes that alter the scaffold subunit binding sites at the opposite surface. These structural changes underlie important molecular basis for PP2A latency and exclusive binding of Î±4 and PP2A scaffold subunit.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that Î±4 binding to the partially folded PP2Ac is counterintuitive. All crystal structures of the PPP family serine/threonine phosphatases, including recent structures of PP2A complexes, give similar conformation of the catalytic subunits. The dynamic nature of PP2A active site was suggested in a recent study showing that recombinant PP2Ac could not be fully methylated due to a direct binding of PP2A methyltransferase (LCMT-1) to the active site unless the active site conformation is primed by PP2A phosphatase activator (PTPA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
      <p>Insights from the structure of the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex are limited by the fact that some of the conformational changes are derived from missing of the C-terminal half of PP2Ac. Nonetheless, the fact that the loop switch is missing and the helix switch is relaxed in the Î±4-bound nPP2Ac suggests that nPP2Ac resembles partially folded, full-length PP2Ac in Î±4 binding. To further demonstrate the dynamic nature of PP2Ac in Î±4 binding, we provided five lines of supporting evidence besides the structural insights derived from the nPP2AcâÎ±4 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>): 1) Î±4 could not bind directly to active PP2Ac; 2) Î±4 binding blocks aggregation of the inactivated PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), presumably by shielding the exposed PP2Ac internal packing; 3) HâD exchange data showed that the PP2A active site loops directly linked to or adjacent to the helix switch are intrinsically dynamic and that the peptide buried by the loop switch and other inner structure in active PP2Ac become more dynamic in the Î±4-bound PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>); 4) allosteric relay through central Î²-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>) explains mutually exclusive binding of Î±4 and the scaffold subunit; 5) Î±4 contacts with both PP2Ac internal packing and surface residues are essential for Î±4 interaction with the full-length PP2Ac in cells and the role of Î±4 in cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Structural observations suggest that displacement of PP2Ac internal packing for Î±4 binding is an energetically plausible process. Dynamics of the active site loops and helix switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and the increased protein dynamics in the absence of catalytic metal ions would reduce energy barrier of conformational changes required for Î±4 binding. The energy cost of conformational changes is also compensated by the PP2AcâÎ±4 interaction that mimics PP2Ac internal packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Furthermore, the Î±4 interface with PP2Ac internal packing is buttressed by contacts with PP2Ac surface residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our studies suggest that binding of Î±4 with PP2A internal packing near the phosphatase active site underlies elegant mechanisms for stable PP2A latency. Î±4 binding stabilizes PP2Ac in an inactive conformation, which would suppress the uncontrolled phosphatase activity before formation of substrate-specific phosphatase activity. In addition, Î±4 binding prevents aggregation of the latent PP2Ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and sterically hinders a PP2A ubiquitination site at Lys41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). These results illuminated dual mechanism of Î±4 in stabilizing cellular PP2Ac<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and provided the structural basis of Î±4 in PP2A latency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Stable PP2A latency likely contributes to the role of Î±4 in cell survival by preventing the cell-detrimental uncontrolled phosphatase activity via stabilizing the free PP2Ac in an inactive form. Stable PP2A latency is crucial for biogenesis of PP2A holoenzymes, which also contributes to cell survival. Loss of PP2A holoenzymes was previously shown to cause cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
      <p>The unique mode of Î±4 binding also suggests an elegant mechanism for mutually exclusive binding of Î±4 and the scaffold subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. These two proteins had been proposed to have overlapping binding site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. We showed that the Î±4-binding site on PP2Ac is opposite from the scaffold subunit-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This led to a novel model of an extended allosteric relay via the helix switch, the active site loops, the central Î²-sheet, and the scaffold subunit-binding site linked to the opposite end of the Î²-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As a result of this allosteric relay, the binding preferences of PP2Ac are robustly altered, resulting in efficient conversion of PP2A core enzyme and holoenzyme into the PP2AcâÎ±4 complex upon perturbation of the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The conformational switch of PP2Ac in altering the binding preferences provides an important molecular basis for the recent observation on dissociation of PP2A holoenzymes and recycling of PP2Ac in response to DNA damage response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Recycling of PP2Ac from holoenzymes might be crucial for surveillance of PP2A holoenzymes and regulation of holoenzyme redistribution during cellular signalling. PP2A holoenzyme assembly is believed to be regulated by methylation at a conserved carboxylterminal peptide motif of PP2Ac<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The role of Î±4 in holoenzyme surveillance is reflected by the fact that defect in PP2A methylation led to increased association between PP2Ac and Î±4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), presumably due to reduced holoenzyme stability.</p>

Ratio of deuterium intake by PP2Ac bound to Î±4 versus PP2Ac bound to Mn<sup>++</sup> for each peptide was used to evaluate increased dynamics in Î±4-bound PP2Ac.</p>

        <p>The Flag-tagged human Î±4 (Flag-Î±4), V5-tagged human PP2A catalytic subunit Î± isoform (V5-C) and their missense mutants were cloned into murine leukaemia retroviral vectors harbouring a CMV promoter for overexpression, or a PGK promoter for expression at endogenous levels. 293T, C6 glioma cells and MEFs harbouring conditional Î±4 knockout Î±<italic>4</italic><sup><italic>fl</italic></sup> and stable Cre-ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100âunits per ml of penicillin and 100âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup> of streptomycin. Retroviruses harbouring the recombinant gene were packaged in 293T cells, and the same titre of retroviruses was used to infect cells with 50â80% confluence for expression of Flag-Î±4, V5-C and their mutants. Knockout of Î±4 was induced by addition of 200ânM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) (Sigma) to Î±<italic>4</italic><sup><italic>fl</italic></sup> MEFs Cre-ER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
        <p>The infection efficiency of retroviruses was monitored by the fluorescence signals of RFP or GFP included in retroviral vectors. The expression level of recombinant and endogenous proteins was monitored by western blot using antibodies that specifically recognize Flag-tag (Sigma, M2), V5-tag (Millipore), Î±4 (Millipore, 5F6) or PP2A CÎ± subunit (Millipore, 1D6). For loading control, cell extracts with equal amounts of protein (10â50âÎ¼g) were detected by western blot using an antibody that specifically recognizes actin (Millipore, C4).</p>

        <title>Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)</title>
        <p>The interaction between wild-type or mutant Flag-Î±4 and PP2Ac was determined by co-IP using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, A2220) to immunoprecipitate PP2Ac. The level of Flag-Î±4 and the associated PP2Ac were determined by western blot as described above. Similarly, the interaction between V5-C and Î±4 was determined by co-IP using anti-V5 antibody (Millipore) and the associated PP2Ac subunit was detected by western blot as described above. All experiments were repeated three times; representative results are shown.</p>

        <title>Cell viability assay</title>
        <p>Cell death caused by knockout of Î±4 was determined using viable cell assays. Briefly, the same number of Î±4fl MEFs Cre-ER cells that stably express Flag-Î±4 or its mutants were placed into 96-well plates (~1,000 cells per well). Proliferation of viable cells was determined using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) 24âh after induction of Î±4-KO at the indicated time. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. MeanÂ±s.e.m. were calculated.</p>

        <p>C6 cells that stably express wild-type or mutant V5-C were mixed with 100âÎ¼gâml<sup>â1</sup> cycloheximide (Sigma) and passed into six-well plates with about 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well. The cells were collected at the indicated time and the level of V5-C was monitored by western blot using the antibody that specifically recognizes the V5-tag. Actin was detected by western blot as a loading control. All experiments were repeated three times. The data were fitted in GraphPad Prism to calculate the half-life of V5-C. MeanÂ±s.e.m. were calculated.</p>
