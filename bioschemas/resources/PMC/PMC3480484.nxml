      <abstract>
        <p>Centriolar satellites are PCM-1-positive granules surrounding centrosomes. Proposed functions of the centriolar satellites include protein targeting to the centrosome, as well as communication between the centrosome and surrounding cytoplasm. CEP90 is a centriolar satellite protein that is critical for spindle pole integrity in mitotic cells. In this study, we examined the biological functions of CEP90 in interphase cells. CEP90 physically interacts with PCM-1 at centriolar satellites, and this interaction is essential for centrosomal accumulation of the centriolar satellites and eventually for primary cilia formation. CEP90 is also required for BBS4 loading on centriolar satellites and its localization in primary cilia. Our results imply that the assembly and transport of centriolar satellites are critical steps for primary cilia formation and ciliary protein recruitment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Centriolar satellites are electron-dense materials concentrated near the centrosome in various cell types <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kubo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kubo2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A major biological function of centriolar satellites may be protein targeting to the centrosome and communication between the centrosome and the surrounding cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0048196-Barenz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. PCM-1 is considered a central scaffold of the centriolar satellites because knockdown of PCM-1 results in the disappearance of the electron-dense satellite structures <xref rid="pone.0048196-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. PCM-1 depletion also makes other satellite proteins lose their typical localization patterns near centrosomes <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0048196-Sedjai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, another group of proteins is responsible for the subcellular distribution of centriolar satellites rather than existence. BBS4, Hook-3, OFD1, FOR20 and Par6Î± are centriolar satellite proteins whose depletion results in the dispersal of the centriolar satellites <xref rid="pone.0048196-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Lopes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Sedjai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0048196-Kodani1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. BBS4 is especially important for transport of centriolar satellites toward centrosomes, because it interacts with p150<sup>glued</sup>, a subunit of the dynein/dynactin motor complex <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. By contrast, CEP290 is a protein, depletion of which induces abnormal concentric accumulation of PCM-1 granules at the centrosome <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Additional members should be discovered to understand subcellular behaviors of centriolar satellites.</p>
      <p>Primary cilium functions as a sensor for chemical or mechanical signals from outside the cell <xref rid="pone.0048196-Singla1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It assembles through an ordered pathway of distinct steps <xref rid="pone.0048196-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. First, a basal body forms from a mother centriole, migrates to the cell surface and docks onto the actin-rich cortex. Next, the basal body nucleates the outgrowth of axonemal microtubules, which protrude beneath the membrane extension, giving rise to a cilium. A continued supply of ciliary proteins is required for cilia formation. It is believed that centriolar satellites are involved in cilia formation because depletion of selected satellite components results in defects in cilia formation <xref rid="pone.0048196-Barenz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CEP90 was recently identified as one of centriolar satellite proteins <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Depletion of CEP90 caused mitotic arrest, misaligned chromosomes, and spindle pole fragmentation, suggesting a role in spindle pole integrity <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In this study, we tested whether CEP90 is critical for centrosome protein recruitment in interphase cells. Our results revealed that CEP90 is required for the centrosomal accumulation of centriolar satellites and eventually for primary cilia formation.</p>

        <title>CEP90 is required for the accumulation of the PCM-1 granules at the centrosome</title>
        <p>To gain an insight into the biological functions of the centriolar satellites, we knocked down CEP90 and PCM-1 in RPE-1 cells and observed the resulting phenotypic changes. Transfection of siRNAs specific to CEP90 and PCM-1 effectively depleted the cellular protein levels by 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). PCM-1 granules in interphase cells were concentrated near the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0048196-Dammermann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the PCM-1 granules in CEP90-depleted cells were scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The total cellular levels of PCM-1 were not affected by CEP90 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that CEP90 is required for the centrosomal accumulation of PCM-1.</p>

            <p>(A) RPE-1 cells were transfected with <italic>siCTL</italic>, <italic>siCEP90</italic> or <italic>siPCM-1</italic> and cultured for 48 or 72 h. The cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to PCM-1, CEP90 and Î²-tubulin. An asterisk indicates a non-specific band. (B) The CEP90-depleted RPE-1 cells were co-immunostained with antibodies specific to PCM-1 and Î³-tubulin. The resulting images were merged, along with DAPI (nuclear) staining. The insets are magnified views of the centrosomes. The number of cells with centrosome-concentrated PCM-1 was counted. Over 300 cells per experimental group were analyzed in 3 independent experiments. (CâE) The CEP90-depleted RPE-1 cells were cultured in the presence of nocodazole (1 Î¼g/ml) for 3 h and placed in fresh medium for 0, 1 or 5 min. (C) The cells were co-immunostained with the antibodies specific to PCM-1 and Î±-tubulin. (D) The centrosomal Î±-tubulin intensities were determined at 1 min in fresh medium. Forty cells per experimental group were analyzed by densitometry in two independent experiments. n.s. indicates not significant. (E) The intensities of centrosomal PCM-1 were determined at the indicated time points. (F) CEP90 localization in PCM-1-depleted RPE-1 cells. The cells were co-immunostained with antibodies specific to CEP90 and acetylated tubulin (Ac-tub). Arrows indicate basal bodies at the base of cilia.

        <p>The microtubule network is critical for the transport of centriolar satellites to the centriolar area <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kubo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Dammermann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We performed microtubule re-growth assays to determine whether CEP90 is involved with microtubule organization in interphase cells. The results showed that microtubules were assembled from the centrosomes of both control and CEP90-depleted cells as soon as nocodazole was removed from the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The microtubule organization activity of the CEP90-depleted cells was more or less identical to that of the control cells, as determined by the aster intensity of the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The centrosomal PCM-1 levels in control cells were low with nocodazole treatment, but they quickly recovered when the cells were rescued to a nocodazole-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1C, E</xref>). However, recovery of the centrosomal PCM-1 levels in the CEP90-depleted cells was significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1C, E</xref>). These results suggest that CEP90 is required for centrosomal targeting of centriolar satellites, irrespective of the microtubule network.</p>
        <p>It is known that CEP90 localization at centriolar satellites is also dependent on PCM-1 <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. CEP90 granules were concentrated near the centrosome with a typical pattern of centriolar satellites in both non-ciliated and ciliated RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). In PCM-1-depleted cells, the CEP90 signals at centriolar satellites disappeared but those at centrosome remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This PCM-1 depletion also reduced the cellular CEP90 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposal, in which PCM-1 functions as a scaffold for the assembly of centriolar satellites <xref rid="pone.0048196-Ge1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>

        <title>CEP90 is involved in subcellular distribution of centriolar satellite proteins</title>
        <p>We also determined whether the other satellite proteins in CEP90-depleted cells are dispersed along with PCM-1. Here, we showed that OFD1 and CEP290 lost a typical granular pattern surrounding the centrosome but were dispersed within the cytoplasm along with PCM-1 in CEP90-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g002">Figure 2A, B, D</xref>). These results confirm that CEP90 is critical for centrosomal recruitment of centriolar satellites. In contrast, the BBS4 signals in CEP90-depleted cells were hardly detectable at the PCM-1 granules, which were dispersed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g002">Figure 2C, D</xref>). We examined BBS4 localization at primary cilia after CEP90 depletion. As previously reported, PCM-1 depletion did not change ciliary localization of BBS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0048196-Stowe1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, CEP90 depletion reduced the number of ciliated cells with BBS4 at their cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In BBS4-depleted cells, both CEP90 and PCM-1 were dispersed in the cytoplasm but remained co-localized at the dispersed granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g002">Figure 2F, G</xref>). These results suggest that CEP90 is required for recruitment of BBS4 and eventual targeting of the centriolar satellites to the centrosome.</p>

        <p>We prepared a series of CEP90 truncated mutants and used them to determine an interaction domain with PCM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the 271â363aa residues of CEP90 are responsible for interaction with PCM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In fact, a CEP90 construct without 271â363 (Flag-CEP90<sup>Î271â363</sup>) failed to interact with PCM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Analysis by immunostaining revealed that Flag-CEP90<sup>Î271â363</sup> was absent from the centriolar satellites, whereas the control groups such as Flag-CEP90<sup>1â757</sup> and Flag-CEP90<sup>Î200â270</sup> were detected at the centriolar satellites along with PCM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These results indicate that physical interaction with PCM-1 is critical for CEP90 localization at the centriolar satellites.</p>

        <p>We further examined the importance of CEP90 in subcellular localization of PCM-1 with knockdown-rescue experiments. Immunoblot analysis revealed that endogenous CEP90 was effectively depleted, and ectopic CEP90 proteins resistant to the specific siRNA were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Subsequent immunostaining analysis showed that the PCM-1 granules were normally accumulated at the centrosome when the CEP90-depleted cells were rescued with the wild-type CEP90 (Myc-CEP90r<sup>1â757</sup>), but not with the CEP90 mutant, which is unable to interact with PCM-1 (Myc-CEP90r<sup>Î271â363</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>). We forced centrosomal localization of the ectopic CEP90 proteins by adding a PACT domain at the C-terminal end and determined subcellular localization of PCM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g004">Figure 4D, E</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0048196-Gillingham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The results showed that the PCM-1 failed to localize near the centrosome, even though the Myc-CEP90r<sup>Î271â363</sup>âPACT protein is concentrated at the centrosome in a similar level with Myc-CEP90r<sup>1â757</sup>-PACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g004">Figure 4D, E</xref>). These results strongly suggest that a physical interaction between CEP90 and PCM-1 is essential for centriolar localization of PCM-1 granules.</p>

        <title>CEP90 interaction with PCM-1 is required for primary cilia formation</title>

Over 300 cells were analyzed in 6 independent experiments. The graphs show mean values and standard errors (A, B, D). (E) A model: CEP90 for centrosomal localization of centriolar satellites and primary cilia formation. For assembly of centriolar satellites, PCM-1 functions as a scaffold to recruit CEP90, BBS4 and other components (Others). CEP90 may mediate BBS4 recruiting during centriolar satellite assembly. The centriolar satellites with structural integrity can transport to the centrosome by a microtubule- and dynein/dynactin-dependent manner. In quiescent cells, centriolar satellites near the basal body promote primary cilia formation.</p>

        <p>We performed rescue experiments to confirm importance of CEP90 in primary cilia formation. Cytochalasin D treatment induced primary cilia formation in 50% of the GFP-expressing control RPE-1 cells, and this frequency was reduced significantly in CEP90-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g005">Figure 5C, D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we report that CEP90 physically interacts with PCM-1 at centriolar satellites. The interaction of CEP90 with PCM-1 is important for centrosomal accumulation of the centriolar satellites. Furthermore, this interaction is essential for primary cilia formation. Based on these results, we propose that CEP90 makes centriolar satellites functional for ciliogenesis by recruiting ciliary proteins into the centrosome, where the primary cilium is assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is well-known that BBS4 in centriolar satellites links PCM-1 to the dynein motor complex and brings centriolar satellites toward the centrosome <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In fact, centriolar satellites in BBS4-depleted cells are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g002">Figure 2G</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Here, we reveal that CEP90 is essential for BBS4 loading onto centriolar satellites. The centriolar satellites in CEP90-depleted cells cannot be recruited to the centrosome, possibly because they are absent of BBS4. Although endogenous CEP90 and BBS4 are in the same complex <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, we failed to coimmuoprecipitate the overexpressed proteins (data not shown). This suggests that CEP90 controls BBS4 loading to centriolar satellites in an indirect manner. CEP90 might help to stabilize the interaction between PCM-1 and BBS4. In addition, other satellite proteins, such as Hook-3, OFD1 and FOR20, might also be involved in BBS4 loading to the centriolar satellites.</p>
      <p>Recent studies reveal the involvement of centriolar satellites in ciliogenesis. Some ciliopathy proteins, such as BBS4, CEP290 and OFD1, are constituents of centriolar satellites <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Lopes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Graser1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, PCM-1 and FOR20 have no known linkage with ciliopathy, but are required for ciliogenesis <xref rid="pone.0048196-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Sedjai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048196-Graser1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our results suggest that CEP90 might function in two steps for cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048196-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). First, CEP90 may be involved in the loading of cilia precursor proteins to centriolar satellites. Second, CEP90 is required for delivering the precursor proteins on centriolar satellites to the vicinity of basal bodies where primary cilia are assembled.</p>
      <p>Our results imply that the assembly and transport of centriolar satellites are critical steps for primary cilia formation and ciliary protein recruitment. Detailed mechanisms in the subcellular transport of centriolar satellites should be investigated in the future.</p>
