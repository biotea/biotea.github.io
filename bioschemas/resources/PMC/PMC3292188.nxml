      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">Packaging of proteins from the ER into COPII-vesicles is essential for secretion. In cells, most COPII-vesicles are ~60-80nm in diameter, yet some must increase their size to accommodate 300-400nm procollagen fibers or chylomicrons. Impaired COPII function results in collagen deposition defects, cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia, or chylomicron retention disease, but mechanisms to enlarge COPII-coats have remained elusive. Here, we have identified the ubiquitin ligase Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> as a regulator of COPII coat formation. Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> catalyzes the monoubiquitination of the COPII-component Sec31 and drives the assembly of large COPII coats. As a result, ubiquitination by Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> is essential for collagen export, yet less important for the transport of small cargo. We conclude that monoubiquitination controls the size and function of a vesicle coat.</p>

    <p id="P2">The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a scaffold for cell attachment and binding sites for membrane receptors, such as integrins, making it essential for the development of all metazoans <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. When engaged with the ECM, integrins trigger signaling cascades that regulate cell morphology and division, yet in the absence of a functional ECM, integrins are removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The proper interplay between integrins and the ECM is particularly important during early development <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, as stem cells depend on integrin-dependent signaling for division and survival <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">The establishment of the ECM requires secretion of several proteins, including its major constituent collagen. Following its synthesis in the ER, the export of collagen from cells depends on COPII-vesicles <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and mutations in genes encoding COPII-proteins lead to collagen deposition defects, skeletal aberrations, and developmental diseases, such as cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">COPII-vesicles are surrounded by a coat consisting of the Sar1 GTPase, Sec23-Sec24 adaptors, and an outer layer of Sec13-Sec31 heterotetramers <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These coat proteins self-assemble into cuboctahedral structures with a diameter of ~60-80nm, which are too small to accommodate a procollagen fiber with a length of 300-400nm <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Thus, collagen transport in cells must involve factors that are absent from <italic>in vitro</italic> self-assembly reactions. Indeed, TANGO1 and its partner cTAGE5 interact with collagen and Sec23/24, thereby recruiting collagen to nascent COPII coats <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The deletion of <italic>TANGO1</italic> in mice resulted in collagen deposition defects similar to those caused by loss of COPII <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and mutations in human TANGO1 are associated with premature myocardial infarction <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. However, TANGO1 is not known to regulate the size of COPII-coats and mechanisms that permit the COPII coat to accommodate a large cargo remain poorly understood.</p>
    <p id="P5">By analyzing mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) division, we have identified Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> as a regulator of COPII coat formation. Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> monoubiquitinates Sec31 and drives assembly of large COPII-coats. As a result, ubiquitination by Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> is essential for collagen export, a step that is required for integrin-dependent mESC division. We conclude that monoubiquitination determines the size and function of a vesicle coat.</p>

      <title>Cul3 regulates mESC morphology</title>
      <p id="P6">To provide insight into stem cell-specific division networks, we depleted ubiquitination enzymes from mESCs and scored for effects on proliferation and morphology. We found that loss of the ubiquitin ligase Cul3 caused mESCs to form tightly packed cell clusters with prominent actin cables and aberrant adhesions, as seen by confocal microscopy analysis of actin and vinculin localization (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). A similar phenotype was observed upon depletion of UBA3, a component of the Nedd8-pathway that activates Cul3 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1a</xref>). Cul3-depleted mESCs were delayed in proliferation (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1b, d</xref>), yet retained their pluripotency, as seen by Oct4- and alkaline phosphatase-staining and the absence of differentiation markers in expression analyses (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1c, e, f; Fig. S2b</xref>). In contrast to mESCs, depletion of Cul3 had weaker consequences in fibroblasts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), although a previously reported increase in multinucleation was observed (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1g</xref>; <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>).</p>
      <p id="P7">Several observations show that the mESC-phenotypes were caused by specific depletion of Cul3. First, multiple siRNAs targeting distinct regions of the Cul3-mRNA had the same effects on mESCs, with a close correlation between knockdown efficiency and strength of phenotype (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a</xref>). Second, microarray analysis showed a strong reduction in Cul3-mRNA upon siRNA-treatment, whereas no other gene was significantly and reproducibly affected (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2b</xref>). Third, siRNAs that target closely related proteins, such as other cullins, did not disturb the morphology of mESCs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P8">The aberrant morphology of Cul3-depleted mESCs was reminiscent of increased RhoA GTPase-activity, which triggers actin filament bundling <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Accordingly, a reduction in RhoA-levels or inhibition of the RhoA-effector kinase ROCK1 rescued Cul3-depleted mESCs from compaction (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3a</xref>). Among several possibilities, higher RhoA-activity in the absence of Cul3 could result from RhoA stabilization or defective integrin-signaling. Stabilization of RhoA by co-depletion of all RhoA-specific Cul3-adaptors, the Bacurds <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, did not affect mESC morphology (data not shown). By contrast, depletion of components of integrin-signaling pathways phenocopied the loss of Cul3 in mESCs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3b</xref>); partial reduction in Cul3-levels showed synthetic lethality with dasatinib, an inhibitor of the Src kinase that acts downstream of integrin-activation (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3c</xref>); and Î²1-integrin was absent from the plasma membrane of Cul3-depleted mESCs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">Cul3 could regulate integrin-synthesis and trafficking, or it could allow for efficient deposition of ECM proteins to prevent integrin internalization <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. To distinguish between these possibilities, we grew mESCs on growth factor-depleted matrigel to provide an exogenous ECM. Strikingly, under these conditions, Î²1-integrin was found at the plasma membrane of Cul3-depleted mESCs and no cell clustering was observed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, Cul3 controls integrin-signaling in mESCs, most likely by supporting the establishment of a functional ECM.</p>

      <title>Klhl12 is a key Cul3-adaptor in mESCs</title>
      <p id="P10">Cul3 recruits substrates through adaptors with BTB-domains <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, yet siRNA-approaches did not yield roles for BTB-proteins in ESCs. As an alternative strategy to isolate Cul3-adaptors, we made use of the observation that stem cell regulators are highly expressed in ESCs, but downregulated upon differentiation <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified 31 BTB-proteins that interact with Cul3 in mESCs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4a; Table S1</xref>). When analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunoblot, we found that three adaptors, Klhl12, KBTBD8 and IBTK, were highly expressed in mESCs, but downregulated upon differentiation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3d</xref>). Next, we depleted these adaptors from mESCs that were sensitized for changes in integrin-signaling by treatment with dasatinib. Importantly, depletion of Klhl12, but no other BTB-protein, resulted in mESC compaction, as seen with loss of Cul3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Accordingly, endogenous Klhl12 effectively binds Cul3 in mESCs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4b</xref>). These experiments, therefore, identify Klhl12 as a key substrate-adaptor for Cul3 in mESCs and the Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> ubiquitin ligase as an important regulator of mESC morphology.</p>

      <title>Cul3 monoubiquitinates Sec31</title>
      <p id="P11">To isolate the substrates of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>, we constructed 293T cell lines that allowed for the inducible expression of <sup>FLAG</sup>Klhl12. By affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified the COPII-proteins Sec13 and Sec31 as specific binding partners of Klhl12 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Immunoblotting confirmed retention of endogenous Sec13 and Sec31 in Klhl12-purifications, but not in precipitates of other BTB-proteins (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5a</xref>). As seen in pulldown assays, Klhl12 directly bound Sec31, but not Sec13 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5c, d</xref>), and this interaction was mediated the N-terminus of Sec31 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6a</xref>) and the Kelch-domain of Klhl12 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6b</xref>). In cells, ~30% of endogenous Klhl12 was associated with Sec13/31 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5b</xref>). Consistent with such a prominent interaction, Sec13/31 and Klhl12 co-localized in punctae, which likely represent ER-exit sites of COPII-vesicles (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>; <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>). Importantly, siRNAs that compromise COPII resulted in mESC compaction (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> and the COPII-coat act in the same pathway.</p>
      <p id="P12"><italic>In vitro</italic>, Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> catalyzed the monoubiquitination of Sec31 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), which was not observed if a Klhl12-mutant with a defective Sec31-binding interface was employed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Sec31 was also monoubiquitinated in cells, which was strongly increased upon expression of Klhl12 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Klhl12-mutants unable to bind Sec31 abolished its monoubiquitination (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>), which is likely due to dimerization with and inactivation of endogenous Klhl12 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6c</xref>). Sec31-monoubiquitination was also strongly diminished upon expression of dominant-negative Cul3 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>) or depletion of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> by siRNA (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). As seen upon expression of lysine-free ubiquitin, Sec31 was monoubiquitinated at one preferred and an alternative, less prominently used lysine (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>), consistent with proteomic analyses that identified Lys647 and Lys1217 in Sec31A as ubiquitination sites <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, neither mutation of these residues nor any other of the 65 lysine residues of Sec31 blocked ubiquitination by Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> (data not shown), revealing flexibility in the actual modification site.</p>
      <p id="P13">Co-expression of Klhl12 and Cul3 triggered Sec31-multiubiquitination and degradation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6d</xref>), which was not observed with lysine-free ubiquitin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). However, whereas Sec31 was monoubiquitinated by endogenous Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>, its multiubiquitination was only seen when Cul3 and Klhl12 were overexpressed. Depletion of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> or proteasome inhibition did not change Sec31-levels in untransfected cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6e</xref>), and blockade of ubiquitin chain formation or proteasome inhibition did not impair Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>-function (see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, multiubiquitination of Sec31 is unlikely a key outcome of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>-activity in mESCs. Instead, it appears that Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> acts by catalyzing monoubiquitination, with the COPII-protein Sec31 as a major substrate.</p>

      <title>Cul3 regulates the size of COPII coats</title>
      <p id="P14">To identify a role for monoubiquitination by Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>, we induced Klhl12-expression in cells and followed the fate of Sec31 by microscopy. Shortly after Klhl12-induction, the majority of Klhl12 and Sec31 co-localized in small punctae (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Over time, these punctae grew into much larger structures that contained most of Sec31, as well as other COPII-components, such as Sec13 or Sec24C (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). As seen by high-resolution confocal imaging, the large structures were hollow and spherical with a diameter of 200-500nm, and they were decorated with the proteins of the COPII-coat and with Klhl12 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Accordingly, thin-section electron microscopy revealed large, crescent-shaped tubules, possibly of ER origin, in cells transfected with Klhl12 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Immunogold-labeling EM showed comparable structures of 200-500nm that were decorated with Klhl12 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The Klhl12-dependent structures neither contained a <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi protein; Ergic-53, which is absent from procollagen transport vesicles <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>; ER-membrane markers that do not accumulate at ER-exit sites <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>; nor endosomal or autophagosomal markers (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7a-c</xref>). Importantly, Sec31-binding deficient mutants, including Klhl12<sup>FG289/290AA</sup>, neither co-localized with Sec31 nor induced formation of large structures (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7d</xref>), and depletion of Sec31 blocked formation of large structures by Klhl12 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Thus, binding of Klhl12 to Sec31 triggers formation of large COPII-containing structures.</p>
      <p id="P15">When Klhl12 was expressed with a Cul3-mutant that blocks Sec31-ubiquitination (Cul3<sup>1-250</sup>), COPII-structures were not enlarged (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). In addition, depletion of Cul3 by siRNAs, which also abolishes Sec31-monoubiquitination, prevented formation of large COPII-structures by Klhl12 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, c</xref>). By contrast, if Klhl12 was expressed with lysine-free ubiquitin to allow mono-, but not multiubiquitination, large COPII-structures were readily detected (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c, e</xref>), and these structures were enriched for ubiquitin, consistent with monoubiquitination being non-proteolytic (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7e</xref>). Thus, monoubiquitination by Cul<sup>Klhl12</sup> promotes formation of large COPII-structures, which likely represent a mixture of nascent coats at ER-exit sites and budded coats on large COPII-vesicles or tubules.</p>

      <title>Cul3 is required for collagen export</title>
      <p id="P16">Our screen linked Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> to the establishment of the stem cell ECM, which requires collagen secretion. Thus, the Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>-dependent increase in COPII-size might function to promote collagen export from the ER. To test this hypothesis, we expressed Klhl12 in IMR90 cells, which at steady state accumulate collagen in the ER due to inefficient export. Strikingly, Klhl12, but not Klhl12<sup>FG289/290AA</sup> or unrelated BTB-proteins, triggered depletion of procollagen I from intracellular ER-pools (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). As a result, increased collagen levels were detected in the supernatant of cells expressing Klhl12, but not Klhl12<sup>FG289/290AA</sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). When secretion was inhibited with brefeldin A, or if collagen folding in the ER was impaired by removal of ascorbate from the medium, procollagen remained within Klhl12-expressing cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Time-resolved experiments showed that Klhl12 strongly accelerated collagen export from IMR90 cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Shortly after inducing secretion, Klhl12 and collagen were detected at overlapping locations (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7f</xref>), all of which indicates that Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> facilitates collagen traffic from the ER.</p>
      <p id="P17">Blockade of Sec31-ubiquitination by dominant-negative Cul3 interfered with the Klhl12-dependent export of collagen from IMR90 cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8a</xref>). Similarly, depletion of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> from engineered HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells severely impaired collagen export, and most cells retained high levels of collagen in their ER (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8b</xref>). In contrast, smaller COPII-cargoes, such as fibronectin or EGF receptor, were properly localized in the absence of Cul3 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8c, d</xref>). Similar observations were made in mESCs, where depletion of Cul3 led to a strong intracellular accumulation of collagen IV, comparable to the effects observed upon loss of Sec13 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8e</xref>). Thus, Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> is required for collagen-export, while it is less important for the trafficking of smaller COPII-cargo.</p>
      <p id="P18">If promoting collagen export were the key role of Cul3 in mESCs, the phenotypes of Cul3-depletion might be mitigated by addition of collagen <italic>in trans</italic>. Indeed, this was the case: when mESCs were plated on purified collagen-IV, depletion of Cul3 did not cause cell clustering, and Î²1-integrin was detected at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). We conclude that promoting collagen secretion is a key a function of Cul3, in agreement with its role in driving the assembly of large COPII-coats.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P19">In this study, we have identified Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> as an essential regulator of collagen export, which is required for mESC division. Deletion of Cul3 in mice results in early embryonic lethality with completely disorganized extraembryonic tissues <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, a phenotype that can in part be attributed to its role in collagen secretion. Moreover, Klhl12 has been identified as an autoantigen in the connective tissue disorder Sjogrenâs syndrome <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that aberrant function of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> might be related to disease.</p>
      <p id="P20">Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> monoubiquitinates Sec31 and promotes formation of large COPII-coats that can accommodate unusually shaped cargo. As a result, Cul3 is essential for the secretion of procollagen fibers, while it is not required for the transport of smaller or more flexible molecules, such as fibronectin, EGF receptor or Î²1-integrin. Thus, Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> appears to be specifically required for the COPII-dependent transport of large cargo.</p>
      <p id="P21">How ubiquitination affects COPII-size or structure coats is not known. None of the 65 lysine residues of Sec31 was essential for ubiquitination by Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>, showing that Cul3 can target alternative lysine residues if the primary site is blocked. Despite this flexibility, Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> does not stoichiometrically ubiquitinate Sec31. Thus, if Sec31-ubiquitination performs a structural role, then few ubiquitinated molecules must suffice to produce large COPII-coats, and these vesicles must tolerate considerable variation in the modification site. Alternatively, as often seen with monoubiquitinated proteins, modified Sec31 might recruit an effector that delays COPII-budding or promotes coat polymerization. As Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> ubiquitinates other proteins <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, Sec31 may not be its only substrate in the secretory pathway. Identification of the complete set of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>-substrates and potential effector molecules should reveal the mechanism underlying the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of vesicle size.</p>
      <p id="P22">Our findings have the potential to be translated into therapeutic strategies. We envision that agonists of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup>-function mitigate consequences of Sec23A-mutations in cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia or Sar1-mutations in chylomicron retention disease <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. By contrast, interfering with Cul3-activity may counteract increased collagen deposition during fibrosis or keloid formation <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Given the strong clustering phenotypes observed in Cul3-depleted mESCs, inhibition of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> might impair the proliferation of metastatic cells, which display features of undifferentiated cells <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Thus, our identification of Cul3<sup>Klhl12</sup> as a regulator of COPII size and function provides an exciting starting point to understand and therapeutically exploit key events in protein trafficking.</p>

        <p id="P51">Mock- and Klhl12-transfected HeLa cells were grown to 70% confluence as a monolayer on an Aclar Â® sheet (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hartfield, PA). The cells were fixed for 30min in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2% glutaraldehyde, and subsequently washed with buffer prior to post-fixation with 1% Osmium tetroxide on ice. This was followed by staining with 1 % aqueous Uranyl Acetate for 30 min at room temperature. For dehydration with progressive lowering of temperature, each incubation period was 10 min, with exposure to 35% ethanol at 4Â°C, to 50% ethanol and 70% ethanol at â20Â°C, and 95%, and 100% ethanol at â35Â°C. Cells were restored to room temperature in 100% ethanol before flat embedding in an Epon resin. Thin (70-100nm) sections were collected on Formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grids and post-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and 2% tannic acid. The sections were imaged at 120 kV using a Tecnai 12 Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands).</p>
        <p id="P52">For the purpose of immunolabeling, HeLa cells expressing <sup>FLAG</sup>Klhl12 or doxycycline-inducible 293T Trex <sup>FLAG</sup>Klhl12 stable cell lines were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde and embedded in LR white resin. Fixation and infiltration were performed in a microwave oven (Pelco model 3450, Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). 70 nm thick sections were picked on 100-mesh nickel grids coated with Formvar film and carbon, incubated in blocking buffer (5% BSA, 0.1% fish gelatin, 0.05% Tween20 in PBS) for 30 min, and followed by incubation with Î±FLAG antibody at a dilution of 1/40 for 1h. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 10 nm gold (BD Biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody at a diltuion of 1/40 for 1 h. Sections were poststained in 2% uranyl acetate for 5 min.</p>

        <title>Gene expression analysis by microarray</title>
        <p id="P53">To compare gene expression profiles of WT-mESCs versus Cul3-depleted mESCs, we transfected D3 mESCs with control or Cul3-siRNA, followed by growth on gelatin-coated 6-well plates. 48h later, total RNA was extracted by TRIzol and chloroform, and further purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat. # 74104). Microarray analysis was performed by the Functional Genomics Laboratory (UC Berkeley) using Affymetrix Mouse 430A 2.0 chip.</p>

        <title>Analysis of collagen export from cells</title>
        <p id="P54">IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts grown on 100mm dishes in DMEM/10% FBS were transfected with <sup>FLAG</sup>Klhl12, <sup>FLAG</sup>Klhl12<sup>FG289AA</sup>, <sup>FLAG</sup>Keap1 and pcDNA5-flag using nucleofection kit R (bought from Lonza) as described in the manufacturerâs protocol and plated on 6 well plate with 25mm coverslips. When indicated, co-transfections with 2Î¼g each of <sup>FLAG</sup>Klhl12 and dominant-negative Cul3 were performed. Dialyzed 10% FBS media was used for ascorbate free transfections. Brefeldin A (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 2.5mg/ml and cells were incubated for 30min. MG132 was used at 20Î¼M for 2h, choloroquine was used at 200Î¼M for 1h. Media was collected the next day and cells on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30min and remaining cells on a plate were used to prepare lysates. Cells on coverslips were permebealized with 0.1% Triton for 15min at room temperature followed by blocking with 1%BSA for 30min. Primary antibodies used were polyclonal anti Procollagen (LF-67,diluted 1:1000) and anti-flag (diluted 1:200). Secondary antibodies were Alexa fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat ant-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:200). After staining cells with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, we fixed coverslips on slides using mounting reagent containing DAPI. Images were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope and captured with Zen10 software. Merges of images were performed with ImageJ and LSM image Browser. Media collected from 6-well plates was normalized with respect to lysate protein concentration estimated using BCA method. Media and lysates of each reaction were checked by immunoblot analysis. Tubulin was used as loading control for lysates. Ascorbate chase experiments were done by adding ascorbate (0.25mM ascorbic acid and 1mM asc-2-phosphate) to Klhl12-transfected cells, followed by incubation for 5, 10, 30 and 60min.</p>
        <p id="P55">A human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080) stably transfected with proalpha1(1) was used for Cul3 knockdowns. Cul3- and Klh12-shRNAs targeting two different regions in both genes were cloned into pSuperGFP and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. pSuper GFP was used as negative control. Cells were grown on 25 mm coverslips in 6-well plates and fixed 2d post transfection. Collagen staining was done using LF-67 (1:1000) and ER was stained with anti-PDI (1:1000) antibody. Fibronectin and EGFR were stained in parallel experiments. Fibronectin expression was induced in HT1080 using 1uM dexamethasone before Cul3 knockdowns. ER retention or secretion was scored in cells expressing GFP shRNAs. Cells without GFP shRNAs and transfected with pSUPER GFP were quantified as well. Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and visualized with LSM image browser. Lysates were prepared from remaining cells on 6 well and checked for knockdown efficiency.</p>
