        <p>Mitochondrial disorders have the highest incidence among congenital metabolic disorders characterized by biochemical respiratory chain complex deficiencies. It occurs at a rate of 1 in 5,000 births, and has phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in about 1,500 nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins may cause mitochondrial dysfunction of energy production and mitochondrial disorders. More than 250 genes that cause mitochondrial disorders have been reported to date. However exact genetic diagnosis for patients still remained largely unknown. To reveal this heterogeneity, we performed comprehensive genomic analyses for 142 patients with childhood-onset mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies. The approach includes whole mtDNA and exome analyses using high-throughput sequencing, and chromosomal aberration analyses using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We identified 37 novel mutations in known mitochondrial disease genes and 3 mitochondria-related genes (<italic>MRPS23</italic>, <italic>QRSL1</italic>, and <italic>PNPLA4</italic>) as novel causative genes. We also identified 2 genes known to cause monogenic diseases (<italic>MECP2</italic> and <italic>TNNI3</italic>) and 3 chromosomal aberrations (6q24.3-q25.1, 17p12, and 22q11.21) as causes in this cohort. Our approaches enhance the ability to identify pathogenic gene mutations in patients with biochemically defined mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies in clinical settings. They also underscore clinical and genetic heterogeneity and will improve patient care of this complex disorder.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mitochondria play a crucial role in ATP biosynthesis and comprise proteins encoded in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Although more than 250 mitochondrial disease-causing genes have been reported, the exact genetic causes in patients remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed to provide further insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of mitochondrial disorders. We investigated the genes encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes using comprehensive genomic analysis in 142 patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies. We identified 3 novel disease-causing mitochondria-related genes (<italic>MRPS23</italic>, <italic>QRSL1</italic>, and <italic>PNPLA4</italic>) as well as other disease-causing genes and novel pathogenic mutations in known mitochondrial disease-causing genes. All pathogenic mutations in this study are validated by genetic and/or functional evidence. Our findings, including the achievement of firm genetic diagnoses for 49 of 142 patients (34.5%), were higher than the general diagnosis rate of approximately 25% and demonstrated the value of comprehensive genomic analysis. Accordingly, we have shed light on the genetic heterogeneity underlying mitochondrial disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disease has the highest incidence among congenital metabolic disorders characterized by a biochemical respiratory chain complex deficiencies and is thought to occur at a rate of 1 in 5,000 births[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. No more than 15â30% of pediatric diseases diagnosed as mitochondrial disorders show mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the remaining cases occur because of defects in genes encoded in the nucleus. A certain amount of nuclear-encoded gene products are present in the mitochondria, and roughly 1,500 are thought to play important roles in mitochondrial function[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is particularly difficult to diagnose patients with OXPHOS disease at the molecular level because of the massive numbers of potentially involved nuclear genes and genes not yet linked to human disease. Therefore, identification of the causative genes and an understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of OXPHOS disease remain unsolved challenges.</p>
      <p>Recent studies[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have shown that heterogeneous genetic backgrounds as well as genes previously not linked to mitochondrial functions or localization are associated with this disease. However, because of phenotypic and locus heterogeneity, only a fraction of patients has been identified to date. Limitations in target resequencing have motivated us to apply a comprehensive genomic analysis for more accurate molecular diagnosis and for the identification of novel causative genes.</p>
      <p>Here, we aimed to determine whether a comprehensive genomic analysis approach could be used to reveal the broad spectrum of genetic background of the disease[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One hundred and forty-two unrelated individuals with displayed childhood-onset mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies were selected. We applied long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based whole mtDNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing (WES), and high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions or deletions (indels), and chromosomal aberrations for comprehensive genomic analyses.</p>

        <title>Comprehensive genomic analysis in 142 patients</title>
        <p>In this study, 142 patients with childhood-onset mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies were enrolled and subjected to comprehensive genomic analyses (detailed clinical characteristics are described in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). A schematic workflow of these analyses is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. Comprehensive genomic analyses included three approaches: (i) amplicon-based whole mtDNA sequencing for pathogenic mutations and large duplications/deletions, (ii) WES for pathogenic mutations in nuclear DNA, and (iii) high-density oligonucleotide arrays for chromosomal aberrations. The prioritized variants derived from each approach are described below.</p>

            <p>All 142 patients were subjected to mtDNA amplicon-based sequencing, WES, and high-density oligonucleotide array analysis in parallel. Variants were filtered on the basis of their rarity in public databases and population-matched datasets. For each analysis, candidate variants were prioritized on the basis of the type of variant. Candidate variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and tested for segregation within the family if DNA was available. mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; pVUS, prioritized variant of unknown significance; CNV, copy number variation</p>

        <title>Prioritized variants in 142 patients</title>
        <p>After comprehensive genomic analysis shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, rare variants were filtered out and prioritized on the basis of the strategy described below. For mtDNA variants, we targeted variants confirmed and reported in MITOMAP[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Exome sequencing covered 89% (ranged: from 70%âto 98%) of the targeted bases, with more than 20-fold coverage. Detailed sequence statistics is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>.</p>
        <p>The precise strategy for WES variant prioritization is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>. We evaluated our prioritization pipeline to validate whether it could feasibly enrich known OXPHOS disease-causing genes or mitochondria-related genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Known OXPHOS disease-causing genes were clearly enriched in disease cases, whereas no prioritized genes were detected in healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, mitochondria-related genes also exhibited a 1.64-fold enrichment. No enrichment was observed in randomly selected genes. These results suggest that mitochondria-related gene enrichment is caused by unidentified causative genes.</p>
        <p>To analyze chromosomal aberrations, we focused on rather large (&gt;100 Kb) deletions or duplications. For prioritizing candidate aberrations, we filtered out deleted or duplicated regions found in the 524 in-house controls and manually curated the pathogenicity of the aberrations by referring to the OMIM, DGV, and DECIPHER databases.</p>
        <p>A breakdown of the 142 patients according to prioritized variants is shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. Of the 142 patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies, 102 (71.8%) harbored at least 1 prioritized mtDNA mutation, nuclear gene mutation, or chromosomal abnormality. Ten (7.0%) patients harbored mtDNA mutations, including one large deletion (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). In 29 patients (20.4%), firm molecular diagnoses were made in 20 genes previously linked to mitochondrial disorders. We newly confirmed 3 mitochondria-related genes (<italic>MRPS23</italic>, <italic>QRSL1</italic>, and <italic>PNPLA4</italic>) as causative genes of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies. Three patients (2.1%) harbored mutations in genes known to cause monogenic diseases (<italic>MECP2</italic> and <italic>TNNI3</italic>). Intriguingly, 4 patients (2.8%) had pathogenic chromosomal deletions previously linked to other disorders (6q24.3-q25.1, 22q11.21, and 17p12) but not linked to mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies.</p>

        <p>In 53 (37.3%) patients, we identified and designated candidate genes or loci as prioritized variants of unknown significance (pVUS) because these variants have possibilities to be pathogenic but have insufficient evidence to support a disease linage. The current lack of functional validation for linking these genes with mitochondrial disorders led us to classify these variants as inconclusive with respect to pathogenicity (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Tables).

        <p><italic>BOLA3</italic>, which plays an essential role in ironâsulfur cluster production, was mutated in 4 unrelated patients with severe lactic acidosis and combined respiratory chain complex deficiencies (MIM 614299). Three of these patients (Pt045, Pt268, and Pt314) exhibited multiple organ failure; Pt268 and Pt314 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and Pt045 developed seizures. All 4 patients exhibited decreased complex II activity and harbored the c.287A&gt;G (p.H96R) mutation. Pt314 and Pt286 patients showed clear long contiguous stretches of homozygosity (LCSH) (2.8 Mb, 3.2 Mb respectively) around this p.H96R mutation. Pt268 also showed a short contiguous stretch of homozygosity (0.3 Mb). This homozygous region encompassing <italic>BOLA3</italic> was shared between these unrelated individuals. Sanger sequencing identified the parents for these three patients as heterozygous carriers of this mutation. No p.H96R carriers were found in NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500), and 1 Japanese carrier in 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) was found. We screened for mutations that violated the HardyâWeinberg principle and only identified the p.H96R mutation. These results suggest that p.H96R is common in the Japanese population and has originated from a single founder (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> Figs).</p>
        <p><italic>NDUFAF6</italic>, which plays an important role in complex I assembly, was mutated in 4 unrelated patients: Pt101, Pt512, and Pt598 exhibited regression, whereas Pt330 exhibited muscle atrophy. All patients had complex I deficiency (MIM 256000). Pt101 shared 1 allele with Pt512 and another with Pt598. Pt330 harbored homozygous mutation c.820A&gt;G (p.R274G) located in 1.3 Mb LCSH. Sanger sequencing identified the parents as heterozygous carriers of this mutation. Only 1 family was reported to harbor a mutation in this gene[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Figs).</p>
        <p><italic>NDUFB11</italic>, recently reported as causative gene for microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome (MIM 300952) and encoding a complex I component, was mutated in Pt067, a boy born to non-consanguineous parents under conditions of intrauterine growth restriction; this patient presented with heart failure, respiratory failure, complex I deficiency, and lethal infantile mitochondrial disorder (LIMD). He harbored a hemizygous <italic>de novo</italic> mutation, c.361G&gt;A (p.E121K), and there was no NDUFB11 protein expression in his fibroblasts (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Because the p.E121 residue is highly conserved in this gene, we performed functional <italic>in vivo</italic> assays using a <italic>dndufb11</italic>-knockdown <italic>Drosophila</italic> model (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>); compared with controls, the mean lifespan was significantly reduced and the metabolic rate was lower in knockdown flies. Blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis showed a loss of complex I assembly, and lactate and pyruvate levels were increased in the knockdown flies. The <italic>in vivo dndufb11</italic>-knockdown <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiment further supported this conclusion. While preparing this manuscript, two girls harboring mutations in <italic>NDUFB11</italic> with microphthalmia with linear skin defects were reported by van Rahden et al[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our patient was a male and died 55 h after birth. He presented with redundant skin but had no linear skin defects.</p>
        <p>Pt459, a boy with lactic acidosis, developmental delays, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, seizure, and combined complex deficiencies (I and IV), harbored the compound heterozygous mutations c.1343T&gt;A (p.V448D) and c.953T&gt;C (p.I318T) in <italic>KARS</italic>. KARS is a lysyl-transfer RNA synthetase that produces 2 proteins that localize to the cytosol and mitochondria. A cDNA complementation assay revealed that mitochondrial KARS successfully rescued the enzyme defect, but not cytosolic form (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>).

        <title>Newly identified mutations in mitochondria-related genes</title>
        <p>Five (<italic>MRPS23</italic>, <italic>C1QBP1</italic>, <italic>ALAS2</italic>, <italic>SLC25A26</italic>, <italic>QRSL1</italic>) genes were identified as novel candidate genes (Tables <xref rid="pgen.1005679.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). These genes were previously reported links to mitochondrial function but not mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies. Of these, we obtained pathogenic support for mutations in <italic>MRPS23</italic> and <italic>QRSL1</italic>. In addition, candidate genes that have no evidence of functional involvement in current mitochondrial biology are good targets for underlying novel mitochondrial biological functions. In one such case, we identified <italic>PNPLA4</italic> as a novel causative gene for mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies and proved its mitochondrial localization for the direct evidence of mitochondrial functions. The supportive evidence included (i) the identification of independent mutations in candidate genes in unrelated individuals with exquisitely similar phenotypes, (ii) rescue of patientsâ cellular phenotypes in a cDNA complementation assay, and (iii) identification of a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation in the candidate gene.

Collectively, this study defined firm genetic diagnoses in 49 of the 142 patients (34.5%). While the overall diagnostic rates for major and minor subgroups were similar (33.9% in the major subgroup and 36.4% in the minor subgroup), 35 out of 49 genetically diagnosed patients showed biochemical defects in their fibroblasts (71.4%), indicating a much higher genetic diagnostic yield in patients with such cellular defects. This is the first report to comprehensively assess patients diagnosed clinically and biochemically.</p>
      <p>MRPS23 is a component of the small mitochondrial ribosome subunit (28S ribosome). Mutations in <italic>MRPS16</italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and <italic>MRPS22</italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] cause mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies because of reductions of 12S rRNA, a 28S ribosome component. One patient exhibited a reduced 12S rRNA/16S rRNA ratio that was restored in a complementation study. This was the first case of <italic>MRPS23</italic>-induced mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies.</p>
      <p>QRSL1 (GatA) is involved in Gln-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> formation. No mitochondrial glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) has been identified in mammals; therefore, Gln-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> synthesis was proven to occur via an indirect pathway[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In particular, mt tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> is first misaminoacylated by mt glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) to form Glu-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>, followed by transamidation to form Gln-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>. This transamidation is processed by a human homolog of the Glu-tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> amidotransferase hGatCAB heterotrimer. We clearly showed that mutations in QRSL1 (GatA), a component of hGatCAB, observed in our patients were associated with severe transamidation activity defects.</p>
      <p><italic>PNPLA4</italic> encodes a calcium-independent phospholipase A2Î· (iPLA2Î·) that acts as an acylglycerol and retinol transacylase, triglyceride hydrolase. PNPLA4 has never been reported to associate with the mitochondria. Nine patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins (PNPLA1â9) are encoded in the human genome. iPLA2Î³ (PNPLA8) is known to be involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis and mitochondrial respiration[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recently, mutations in human <italic>PNPLA8</italic> identified in a young girl with a suspected mitochondrial myopathy[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. She presented with progressive muscle weakness, hypotonia, seizures, poor weight gain, and lactic acidosis. A deficiency in iPLA2Î² (PNPLA9) was previously shown to cause abnormal phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial defects in mice[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here we demonstrated the mitochondrial localization of iPLA2Î· using immunohistochemistry and restored of the amount of complex IV in Pt712 fibroblast cells via the exogenous expression of wild-type <italic>PNPLA4</italic>. We assume that <italic>PNPLA4</italic> is also required for mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism and respiratory chain function.</p>
      <p>Although all patients were diagnosed with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies, we identified 2 disease-causing genes and 2 pathogenic CNVs known to cause other genetic disorders in our cohort. These included <italic>MECP2</italic>, <italic>TNNI3</italic>, 6q24.3-q25.1 deletion, and 22q11.21 deletion. Because all of these patients had complex II activities within the normal range (percentage of protein and citrate synthase ratio), we concluded that their defects were not artefactual[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Because these genes and loci are not directly linked to the respiratory chain complex, we consider the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies are caused by secondary. Pt053, Pt369, and Pt827 were classified as having major ETC reductions in affected tissues, whereas Pt452, Pt695, and Pt587, harbored deletions are all classified as minor. The fact these heterozygous deletions are all classified as minor suggests that the mitochondrial defects in these patients might be caused indirectly through haploinsufficiency.</p>
      <p>Because Pt053 and Pt369 harbored <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations known to cause Rett syndrome, we re-evaluated the phenotypes of both patients and found phenotypes that overlapped with Rett syndrome characteristics (seizures, microcephaly, cerebral atrophy, and hearing loss). Previous studies also reported mitochondrial dysfunction in Rett syndrome[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although Pt827 was enrolled with a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, after comprehensive genomic analyses, the clinical diagnosis was changed to cardiomyopathy, familial restrictive (OMIM: 115210) caused by a mutation in <italic>TNNI3</italic>. Jia et al reported a link between Tnni3 and mitochondrial dysfunction using knockout mice [<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
      <p>Two independent patients from our cohort showed 6q24.3-q25.1 deletions. Pt452 exhibited a phenotype similar to that of cases reported cases in OMIM (MIM 612863). Pt695 presented with respiratory distress and a congenital heart defect. We classified these patients as having chromosome 6q24-q25 deletion syndrome. The enrichment of this deletion supports the suggested link with mitochondrial dysfunction. Pt587 was difficult to diagnose based on clinical information, because he did not have the facial anomalies and cleft palate characteristic of DGS/VCFS. The 22q11.21 deletion includes some mitochondria-related genes (<italic>PRODH</italic>, <italic>SLC25A1</italic>, <italic>MRPL40</italic>, <italic>TXNRD2</italic>, <italic>COMT</italic>, <italic>TANGO2</italic>, <italic>ZDHHC8</italic>, and <italic>AIFM3</italic>), suggesting a link between this deletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. The inclusion of a patient with features of DGS/VCFS and complex I deficiency in a study by Calvo et al[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] also indicates a link with mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
      <p>With these in mind, we should be mindful that some patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex defects will have mutations in genes apparently unrelated to mitochondrial functions.</p>
      <p>Previous reports of mitochondrial disorders can be classified as either target resequence studies[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or whole exome approaches[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. When comparing target resequencing groups, our approaches are advantageous for the identification of mutations in other disease-causing genes, and the detection of chromosomal aberrations. WES groups[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and our group detected pathogenic mutations in genes not linked to mitochondrial disorders. When comparing WES groups, our approaches are advantageous in terms of mtDNA sequencing and chromosomal aberration analysis. Our analysis could detect mtDNA heteroplasmy using long-range PCR-based sequencing and also revealed established pathogenic chromosomal deletions. Accordingly, we identified a composite combination of <italic>COX10</italic> SNV and 17p12 deletion (Pt657). Previous WES and target exome reports achieved molecular diagnoses in 20%â60% of their cohorts. A precise comparison of overall diagnostic rates with previous studies is difficult, given the existence of several biases that affect the diagnostic rate, including prior mtDNA/nDNA genetic screening, population characteristics, phenotyping accuracy, and study design. In particular, the reports by Taylor et al[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] described a high rate of diagnosis (approximately 60%) in their cohort, although their patient group appeared to be enriched by consanguineous families (12 of 28 diagnosed cases). The report by Wortmann et al[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] described a rate of diagnosis (38%) similar to ours. In our study, we emphasized functional analyses to conclude disease causality against pVUS and attempted to present molecular evidence of pathogenicity;in contrast, some previous studies lacked sufficient molecular evidence of pathogenicity. We designated the variants without any molecular evidence of pathogenicity as pVUS, even when the gene had been reported as a causal gene for mitochondrial disorders. We consider molecular evidence to be indispensable for a conclusive firm genetic diagnosis.</p>
      <p>We found that approximately 28.2% of patients lacked any prioritized variants. We likely missed pathogenic mutations in these unresolved cases for the following reasons, as discussed in a report by Calvo et al[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]: first, we may have missed pathogenic mutations because of a lack of sensitivity from low sequence coverage. Second, pathogenic mutations may be located in uncovered genomic regions (e.g., uncovered exons, introns, or regulatory regions not targeted by whole exome platforms). Third, our filtering strategy may have filtered true pathogenic mutations, although some were recovered by manual curation. Fourth, the hereditary assumption may be wrong. More dominant-acting cases may exist. Digenic/polygenic inheritance may also exist beyond our expectation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, for suspected mitochondrial disorders, comprehensive analyses such as those in this study are worthwhile. We expanded the clinical disease spectrum and revealed the genetic landscape of this disorder.</p>

        <title>Patient information</title>
        <p>In total, 142 patients with childhood-onset and enzymatically diagnosed mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies were enrolled in this study. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and their families before participation in the study. Patients with suspected mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiency were referred to the Saitama Medical University Hospital and Chiba Childrenâs Hospital in Japan from 2007 to 2013. The inclusion criterion was a biochemical diagnosis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity in a clinically affected tissue (skeletal muscle, liver, or heart) or fibroblasts in patients younger than at the age of 15 years. Patients with known nuclear or mtDNA mutations at the time of recruitment were excluded. The 142 included patients had not received a prior molecular diagnosis, despite varying degrees of exposure to genetic testing. This cohort included 3 non-Japanese cases: Pt346 (father, American; mother, Japanese), Pt298 (Brazilian), and Pt223 (Vietnamese). Enzyme activity[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was measured on the basis of spectrophotometric enzyme assays using fibroblasts from patientâs skin or biopsy specimens from diseased organs of patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. All enrolled patients in this study had biochemical mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies; the enzymatic diagnoses are shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>. In brief, complex I deficiency was most common (61 patients, 43.0%), followed by (in decreasing order of prevalence) combined respiratory chain complex deficiencies (46 patients, 32.4%), complex IV deficiency (27 patients, 19.0%), MTDPS (5 patients, 3.5%), and complex III deficiency (3 patients, 2.1%); no patients exhibited complex II deficiency. Diagnoses of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies were assessed as âmajorâ or âminorâ on the basis of biochemical complex activity. Based on the Bernier criteria, severity was defined as major (&lt;20% in a tissue, &lt;30% in a fibroblast cell line, or &lt;30% in â¥2 tissues) or minor (&lt;30% in a tissue, &lt;40% in a fibroblast cell line, or &lt;40% in â¥2 tissues) in accordance with the residual mean citrate synthase or complex II activities relative to those of normal controls (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). The distribution of age of onset of these patients was as follows: 45.7% (65 patients) before 1 month, 19.7%(28 patients) within 1â6 months, 19.7%(28 patients) within 6â24 months, 12,7% (18 patients) within 2â10 years, and 2.1% (3 patients) within 10â15 years (<xref rid="pgen.1005679.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). The clinical diagnoses of 142 patients are also shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005679.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>. The most common diagnosis was mitochondrial cytopathy (27 patients, 19.0%), followed by Leighâs disease (25 patients, 17.6%), LIMD (23 patients, 16.2%), sudden unexpected death (17 patients, 12.0%), non-lethal infantile mitochondrial disorder (NLIMD) (16 patients, 11.3%), cardiomyopathy (11 patients, 7.7%), hepatic disease (11 patients, 7.7%), enteropathy (6 patients, 4.2%), neurodegenerative disorder (4 patients, 2.8%), and short stature (2 patients, 1.4%). The male:female ratio was 76:66. There were no consanguineous relationships among our cohort.

We only retained variants predicted to modify protein function; these included nonsense, splice site, coding indel, or missense variants. We removed variants with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of &gt;1.0% for dbSNP 137 without known medical impact (allele frequencies were extracted from common_no_known_medical_impact_20130808.vcf.gz), &gt;0.1% for ESP6500 (provided by ANNOVAR program) database, &gt;1.0% for 1KG (these data are based on a phase 1 release v3 called from the 20101123 alignment and provided by ANNOVAR), &gt;0.1% for the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, accessed on December 2014), and &gt;0.4% in HGVD (contains genetic variations determined by exome sequencing of 1,208 individuals in Japan; see <xref rid="sec040" ref-type="sec">URLs</xref>). Variants that were too common among cases (â¥10 alleles) were also excluded. Careful inspection of the reads using the Integrative Genomics Viewer[<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005679.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and NextCODE clinical sequence analyzer (see <xref rid="sec040" ref-type="sec">URLs</xref>) excluded doubtful genes from prioritized candidate genes when 2 sequence variants were present in the same read (or read-pair). Variants that appeared to be mapping artifacts (called by suspicious reads or end positions of NGS reads) were also excluded through a manual inspection of NGS reads. Variants located within segmental duplication regions were excluded. In addition to these filters, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) scores &gt; 0.15 and Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) scores &lt; 2.5 were used for further prioritization. We also excluded variants inconsistent with a recessive mode of inheritance. Two (or more) variants on a single haplotype as identified by Sanger sequencing were also excluded. Finally, we filtered remaining genes based on MAF and genotype information in the 1,070 whole-genome reference panel database (1KJPN) constructed in the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project in Japan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ijgvd.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/">http://ijgvd.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/</ext-link>).
