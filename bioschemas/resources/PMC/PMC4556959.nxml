      <abstract>
        <p>Neuroserpin (NS) is an inhibitory protein belonging to the serpin family and involved in several pathologies, including the dementia Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB), a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by accumulation of NS polymers. Our Molecular Dynamics simulations revealed the formation of a persistent salt bridge between Glu289 on strand s2C and Arg362 on the Reactive Centre Loop (RCL), a region important for the inhibitory activity of NS. Here, we validated this structural feature by simulating the Glu289Ala mutant, where the salt bridge is not present. Further, MD predictions were tested <italic>in vitro</italic> by purifying recombinant Glu289Ala NS from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The thermal and chemical stability along with the polymerisation propensity of both Wild Type and Glu289Ala NS were characterised by circular dichroism, emission spectroscopy and non-denaturant gel electrophoresis, respectively. The activity of both variants against the main target protease, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), was assessed by SDS-PAGE and chromogenic kinetic assay. Our results showed that deletion of the salt bridge leads to a moderate but clear reduction of the overall protein stability and activity.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Human neuroserpin (NS) is a member of the serpin family (SERine Protease INhibitor)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It is mainly secreted from neurons and, as an inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, it is involved in many physiological processes, such as synaptic plasticity, memory and the permeability of the neurovascular compartment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, as well as in neurological disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. NS is also directly involved in a severe genetic disease, the dementia Familial Encephalophaty with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB), due to the aberrant polymerisation of NS within the endoplasmic reticulum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
    <p>Beyond its relevance in FENIB, NS is an excellent model for studying serpins and the common pathways that may lead to serpinopathies, a class of serpin-related diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Indeed, NS has a high structural analogy with the archetypal serpin <italic>Î±</italic><sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>; the polymerisation propensity of mutated NS variants is directly related to the severity of disease with a remarkable genotype-phenotype correlation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>; moreover, NS polymerisation can be induced by thermal stress, even in the wild type (WT) form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
    <p>After the determination of the crystal structure of the native and cleaved conformers of NS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, other studies have revealed the main structural features of monomeric and polymeric NS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In a recent work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of different NS isoforms, finding that the conformational stability and flexibility of NS arise from a characteristic spatial distribution of intramolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. The MD trajectory for native NS revealed the presence of a persistent salt bridge between the glutamic acid Glu289 on strand s2C in the main protein core and the arginine Arg362 located in the reactive centre loop (RCL), close to the cleavage site (P1-P1â). The RCL is a key structural element of all inhibitory serpins. It acts as a bait for the target protease, which cleaves the RCL forming an acyl-enzyme complex and triggering the insertion of the RCL as a new strand of the main central <italic>Î²</italic>-sheet. This mousetrap-like mechanism causes the translocation of the protease to the opposite side of the serpin and its disruption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
    <p>The salt bridge between Glu289 and Arg362 was not observed in the available crystal structures of native NS, due to the intrinsic flexibility of the RCL. On the other hand, analogous motifs may be found in other serpins. In <italic>Î±</italic><sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin, a salt bridge links Glu223 on strand s3C to Arg354 on the RCL, near to the clevage site (P1-P1â) at residues Met358-Ser359<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
    <p>Here, we performed the <italic>in silico</italic> mutation of Glu289 into Alanine, E289A, and back to glutamic acid, in order to validate the existence of this salt bridge and its statistical significance. Also, we performed the <italic>in vitro</italic> mutation E289A by site directed mutagenesis of WT NS. We have investigated the stability, conformation, function and dynamics of WT and E289A NS both <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The deletion of the salt bridge 289â362 did not damage the fold and inhibitory capability of NS, however it affected its overall stability and dynamics, with a slight reduction of its inhibitory activity and its resistance against polymerisation.</p>

        <p>In our previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we reported a long MD simulation of native NS, which showed the formation of a persistent salt bridge between the arginine Arg362 on the RCL and the glutamic acid Glu289 on strand s2C in the main protein core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> shows that the distance between the acid or basic groups of of the two residues is below 3âÃ for most of the simulation run. Such a structural detail remained undetected in previous studies of NS.</p>

        <title>Validation of a structural feature revealed by MD by alchemical perturbation</title>
        <p>Since this salt bridge was not evident in the available crystal structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, we challenged its actual existence and performed an alchemical mutation of Glu289 to Alanine. This <italic>in silico</italic> mutation removes the salt bridge and alters the overall protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). After an adequately long simulation run, the inverse mutation A289E was performed by the same method. As shown in the distance trajectory of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, the salt bridge was soon restored (with high stability after 18âns). The two-step mutation with elimination and restoration of the charged side chain of residue E289 was used to rule out any accidental dependence upon the initial coordinates. The stability of the bridge during the rest of the simulation (with some fluctuation observable after 43âns), confirmed its robust persistence in the protein structure and allowed us to validate its statistical significance.</p>

        <title>Effects of the E289A mutation on the structure of neuroserpin</title>
        <p>The disruption of the salt bridge between residues 289 and 362 caused distinct changes in the structure and stability of NS. The main structural parameters of E289A NS in comparison to WT NS were computed after a long simulation run and they are reported in the tabular scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. A notable difference was observed in the increased radius of gyration of E289A NS with respect to WT NS. This is likely due to the higher mobility of the RCL, which is not anchored by the salt bridge. The largest structural difference was in the number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) between main chain atoms (Table of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The picture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> shows HBs that were present with more than 50% occupancy in the WT and were lost in the E289A (blue ball and stick), and viceversa (red ball and stick). Interestingly, many of the main HBs that stabilised <italic>Î²</italic>-sheet A between strands s3A and s5A were lost in the mutant form of NS. As studied in our previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, the free-energy gain obtained in the conformational change from native to latent or cleaved NS is largely controlled by an increased number of HBs. Thus, we may argue that E289A NS may present a lower stability towards the non-native conformations that require the insertion of RCL as a strand in <italic>Î²</italic>-sheet A. More in general, HBs included in <italic>Î±</italic>-helical structure appear more persistent in WT NS, while HBs linking <italic>Î²</italic>-sheet strands have a relatively longer occupancy in E289A (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supporting Figure S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effects of the E289A mutation on protein dynamics</title>
        <p>The analysis of root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) revealed other less expected effects of the E289A mutation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> highlights the protein regions with the larger variation in RMSF of WT and E289A NS. Apart from the expected increase in RCL mobility, which is not anchored by the salt bridge in the E289A NS, we observed a decrease in the mobility of the Î©-loop in E289A NS. The Î©-loop is formed by a few residues between strands 1B and 2B and protrudes from the surface of the molecule and, in contrast to every other serpin, it regulates the inhibitory activity of NS against tPA, as proved before by deletion of this motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3b,c</xref> display as solid bars the pairs of residues exhibiting the strongest correlated motions (in terms of Linear Mutual Information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), and not belonging to the same secondary structure element. Operatively, this was implemented by taking into account correlated residues with a distance larger than 2ânm. As for the Î©-loop, the point mutation extends its effect towards distal regions of the protein. A striking effect is the loss of correlation between the main protein core and the F helix, which is a region important for polymerisation and activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>

        <p>In order to address the predictions of the MD simulations, a recombinant variant of NS was produced in E.

        <title>Kinetics of E289A neuroserpin polymerisation</title>
        <p>The polymerisation of NS can be induced by moderate thermal stress. We incubated both WT and E289 NS at 52âÂ°C for different time intervals and monitored the progress of polymerisation by non-denaturing poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The formation of small-size polymers produced the typical ladder-like pattern presented in Fig. 4a,b<sup>29</sup>. At the same time we observed the formation of latent NS, which run faster than native monomeric NS, due to its reduced hydrodynamic radius<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Both WT and E289A NS exhibited analogous polymerisation kinetics. A closer inspection by densitometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>) revealed that the polymerisation kinetics of E289A NS was slightly faster when compared to WT NS.</p>

        <title>Inhibitory activity of E289A neuroserpin</title>
        <p>The ability of E289A NS to form a complex with tPA was tested by mixing NS and tPA and incubating for different time intervals. The formation of the NS/tPA complex was monitored by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). We clearly observed the rapid formation of the complex, and since the complex is known to be fragile at late stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, we also observed the appearance of protein bands corresponding to cleaved NS and to non-complexed tPA, as well as the reduction in intensity of the complex. The densities of the gel bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref> did not display any significant difference in the ability to form the complex, while they showed a slower reduction of native NS for E289A NS with respect to the WT NS equivalent, in agreement with the chromogenic assay presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, which reports the progress of tPA inhibition by NS against a chromogenic substrate, IPR-pNA. The inhibitory activity of E289A NS was lower than that of WT NS. At later stages, our results suggest that tPA released after complex formation was still active, meaning that the protease is only partially translocated. Alternatively, this may suggest a disruption of the tPA-NS covalent bond and subsequent recovery of the integrity of the active site of tPA.</p>

        <title>Conformational stability of E289A neuroserpin</title>
        <p>The correct folding of E289A NS was verified by far-UV circular dichroism (CD), a technique able to quantify the secondary structure content of protein folds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref> shows the CD spectra of both WT and E289A NS, which exhibited no differences, in agreement with the conformational stability in MD simulations. Also, the thermal stability of both NS variants, monitored by CD at 216ânm during a thermal ramp, displayed no relevant differences. Indeed, the main transition typically observed in a thermal ramp for NS is due to the formation of latent or polymer NS, rather than to thermal unfolding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref> also shows the spectra for NS after a temperature ramp up to 90âÂ°C, and therefore mainly related to polymeric NS, coherent with previously reported spectra of NS polymers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Again, no significant changes were observed in the folding of both variants. The chemical stability of the native conformation was assessed by incubating NS with different amounts of a denaturant agent, guanidine hydrochloride (Gnd-HCl), and monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of aromatic residues. In particular, the photoluminescence emission of tryptophans depends upon their exposure to a polar environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; hence, the red-shift of the emission band (or more concisely of its first moment) can be used as a measure of protein unfolding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6b</xref> shows that both E289A and WT NS presented a two-step unfolding transition at 0.8âM and 2.6âM Gnd-HCl concentration, as previously observed for WT NS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In comparison to WT NS, E289A NS exhibited a decrease of cooperative behaviour to reach the final unfolding state.</p>

      <p>MD simulations may play an important role in structural biology studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In protein science, they may complement the information obtained by X-ray crystallography or NMR. In our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we used MD to refine the structure of native and cleaved NS, and we uncovered some clues to the structure of the unsolved latent conformer. Here, we highlight a structural detail, not previously reported, that emerged from MD and was not resolved in crystallographic structures. A strong salt bridge links the Arg362 residue on the RCL to the Glu289 on strand s2C.</p>
      <p>Analogously, another MD study of WT NS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> reported the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between Arg362 and Asp373 close to strand s1C. Such a difference with respect to our simulation may depend upon the choice of initial coordinates which were based upon the crystal structure of <italic>Takehara et al. 2009</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Indeed the two published structures of native WT NS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> exhibit larger differences in the RCL structure. Our MD work was based on the crystal structure of <italic>Ricagno et al. 2009</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, where the RCL is completely resolved. We extended our MD work by performing the simulation of mutant Glu289 to Ala289 (E289A) and back to Glu289 (A289E), in order to validate the statistical significance of the presence of such a salt bridge and rule out the possible influence of initial coordinates. Our simulations and <italic>in silico</italic> mutations show that the Arg362 tends to approach residue Glu289, more than the region of Asp373 or the other RCL residues. The results of the simulations by Sarkar <italic>et al.</italic> and the present results both confirm that the RCL has a high probability of being anchored to the protein body by a strong hydrogen bond. In the present work we experimentally explored by point-site mutation the effects of the deletion of one anchor point by single aminoacid mutation of WT NS.</p>
      <p>This salt bridge is located in a region that is critical for the inhibitory activity, which is close to the cleavage site. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the deletion of this salt bridge on protein structure and dynamics. From MD trajectories, we learned that such a point mutation may affect the dynamical behaviour of regions far from the mutated region. Interestingly, the mutation reduced the mobility (namely the RMSF) of the Î©-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), a region which is considered important for NS activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Also, it reduced the dynamical correlation between the main protein body and the F-helix, a region that is thought to be relevant for both activity and polymer formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A recombinant E289A variant of NS was produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> by site directed mutagenesis. We tested the conformational stability of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), its inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), its stability with respect to chemical denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), and its stability against thermal stress, that is, its propensity to polymer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The removal of the salt bridge under analysis did not alter dramatically the native fold of NS. It altered the stability of NS in a subtle way. It slightly reduced the inhibitory efficiency and very slightly enhanced the polymerisation propensity, easing polymer formation and hindering the formation of a final complex with tPA. MD studies point to the Î©-loop and the F-helix as hot spots, responsible for setting a free-energy barrier between native NS and the unfolding state.</p>

        <p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 Rosetta 2 Competent Cells Novagen (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) were transformed with the plasmid coding for human NS with a N-terminus 6-His tag in the pQE81L vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with ampicillin resistance.

The E289A mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction using the NS DNA template and specific mutagenic primers. The sequence of WT and mutant NS was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire NS gene.</p>
        <p>The protocol for protein expression and purification was optimised from <italic>Belorgey et al. 2002</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and <italic>Takehara et al. 2010</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.

Cells were grown at 37âÂ°C in 2xYT media containing 0.27âmM ampicillin by shaking at 180ârpm for about 4âhours until the O.D. at 600ânm reaches a value of 0.7âÂ±â0.2â<italic>cm</italic><sup>â1</sup>, followed by isopropyl-<italic>Î²</italic>-D-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5âmM) induction, a further shaking at 150ârpm for 16âhr at 25âÂ°C, and eventual cell harvesting by centrifugation at 3500âg for 10âminutes. The pelleted cells were washed twice with lysis buffer (50âmM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 500âmM NaCl, pH 7.8), incubated on ice for 30âminutes upon addition of 1 tablet (for 5â10âgrams of cells) of COMPLETE protease inhibitor cocktail (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) or/and 5âmM Aminoethyl-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1âmg/ml Lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO, USA), 5âmM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then disrupted by sonication at 4âÂ°C (with long cooling intervals for each sonication cycle).
