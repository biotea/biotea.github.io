      <abstract>
        <p>Apoptosis is a genetically regulated cell suicide programme mediated by activation of the effector caspases 3, 6 and 7. If apoptotic cells are not scavenged, they progress to a lytic and inflammatory phase called secondary necrosis. The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we show that caspase-3 cleaves the GSDMD-related protein DFNA5 after Asp270 to generate a necrotic DFNA5-N fragment that targets the plasma membrane to induce secondary necrosis/pyroptosis. Cells that express DFNA5 progress to secondary necrosis, when stimulated with apoptotic triggers such as etoposide or vesicular stomatitis virus infection, but disassemble into small apoptotic bodies when DFNA5 is deleted. Our findings identify DFNA5 as a central molecule that regulates apoptotic cell disassembly and progression to secondary necrosis, and provide a molecular mechanism for secondary necrosis. Because DFNA5-induced secondary necrosis and GSDMD-induced pyroptosis are dependent on caspase activation, we propose that they are forms of programmed necrosis.</p>

    <p>Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways have important physiological roles in growth, survival, homeostasis and innate immunity of all multicellular organisms. Two important, yet phenotypically distinct, forms of PCD include apoptosis and programmed necrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Although apoptosis is immunologically âsilent', programmed necrosis is an inflammatory form of PCD characterized by cellular swelling, lysis and release of pro-inflammatory molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Programmed necrosis is mediated by two distinct signalling pathways; the necroptotic pathway induces necroptosis and the pyroptotic pathway induces pyroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Necroptosis is triggered by activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), which phosphorylates the pseudokinase MLKL, causing it to translocate to the plasma membrane to induce cell permeabilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Pyroptosis is triggered primarily by activation of the inflammatory caspases, which include caspase-1 and caspase-11 (caspase-4/-5 in humans)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Caspase-1 is activated by multiprotein complexes assembled by several proteins such as NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, pyrin and NLRP1, collectively referred to as canonical inflammasomes (reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). By contrast, human caspase-4 and -5, and their mouse ortholog caspase-11, are activated within non-canonical inflammasome complexes by directly binding to lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Studies have demonstrated that on activation of inflammatory caspases by the canonical and non-canonical pathways these caspases cleave a cellular substrate called gasdermin D (GSDMD) after Asp276 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), generating a necrotic N-terminal fragment capable of inducing pyroptosis by forming pores in the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
    <p>In contrast to programmed necrosis, apoptosis is a non-inflammatory form of PCD mediated by activation of the apoptotic caspases and can occur either via an extrinsic or an intrinsic pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although the extrinsic pathway is activated by signalling through cell surface death receptors, the intrinsic pathway is activated by mitochondrial damage. However, both pathways converge on the activation of the executioner caspases (caspase-3, 6 and 7), which target &gt;600 substrates to orchestrate morphological changes associated with apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. At the terminal stage of apoptosis, cells are phagocytosed <italic>in vivo</italic> by scavenger cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils. However, if these cells are not removed in a timely fashion, as is the case <italic>in vitro</italic>, they progress to a final phase called secondary necrosis characterized by cytoplasmic swelling and plasma membrane damage, similar to the phenotype of cells undergoing pyroptosis or necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The mechanism of secondary necrosis and whether it is mediated by substrates of apoptotic caspases is not clear.</p>
    <p>DFNA5 belongs to the same gasdermin superfamily, as GSDMD and has been implicated in the induction of cell death and as a putative tumour suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Mutations in intron 7 of the <italic>DFNA5</italic> gene have been shown to cause sensorineural hearing loss because of skipping of exon 8 at the pre-mRNA level and the translation of a C-terminally truncated protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Although the full-length product does not have cytotoxic activity, the truncated form does<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In addition, promoter hypermethylation leading to DFNA5 inactivation has been detected in 52% of primary gastric cancers making it a putative tumour suppressor and further suggesting a role in promoting cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Finally, expression of DFNA5 is induced by the transcription factor p53 in response to etoposide, a potent inducer of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
    <p>Because DFNA5 is related to GSDMD, and its C-terminal truncation has been shown to cause cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we investigated whether it is cleaved by apoptotic caspases to induce secondary necrosis. Here we show that DFNA5 is a physiological substrate for caspase-3. Mechanistically, caspase-3 cleaves DFNA5 after Asp270 to generate a necrotic DFNA5-N fragment that translocates to the plasma membrane to permeabilize it and induce secondary necrosis/pyroptosis. In 293T cells that stably express DFNA5, activation of caspase-3 by stimulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with Bax overexpression, or infection by the apoptosis-inducing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) results in cleavage of DFNA5 and induction of secondary necrosis. Similarly, in WT and caspase-1/caspase-11 (casp-1/11)-deficient macrophages, infection with VSV or treatment with etoposide results in cleavage of endogenous DFNA5 into the necrotic N-terminal fragment and induction of secondary necrosis. Deletion of DFNA5 in macrophages mostly inhibits VSV-induced and etoposide-induced secondary necrosis. Interestingly, unlike WT cells, DFNA5-deficient cells do not swell, but extensively disassemble into small apoptotic bodies. Combined, our results indicate that DFNA5 regulates disassembly and progression of apoptotic cells to secondary necrosis on cleavage by caspase-3.</p>

        <title>DFNA5 is specifically cleaved by caspase-3</title>
        <p>Our studies in VSV-infected immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from casp-1/11-deficient mice revealed that these macrophages undergo a caspase-dependent necrotic form of cell death resembling pyroptosis. VSV-infected casp-1/11-deficient macrophages released high amount of LDH in the culture supernatants and showed microscopic features of plasma membrane swelling characteristic of necrosis/pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of the necroptotic pathway with the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 alone did not block this cell death. However, combined treatment with GSK'872 and the pancaspase-inhibitor zVAD-fmk completely blocked cell death, indicating that this VSV-induced necrotic-like cell death is not mediated by necroptosis but is mediated by caspases other than caspase-1 and caspases-11. The observed high LDH release in the presence of zVAD-fmk is caused by zVAD-fmk-induced necroptosis, because inhibition of caspases leads to activation of the RIPK3-MLKL necroptotic cell death pathway in macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Since casp-1/11 dKO macrophages lack inflammatory caspases, which induce pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), these results suggest that the observed VSV-induced necrosis in these cells is likely the result of non-inflammatory caspase activity on substrates other than GSDMD. To test this hypothesis we investigated whether non-inflammatory caspases can cleave other GSDMD-related family members to induce necrosis-like phenotype.</p>
        <p>DFNA5, a GSDMD-related family member, shares only â¼28% identity with GSDMD within the region corresponding to the pyroptotic GSDMD N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Nevertheless, genetic mutations within intron 7 of human DFNA5 that cause skipping of exon 8 and truncation of the C-terminus of DFNA5 at residue 315 leads to hearing loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, suggesting that the N-terminal domain of DFNA5, like GSDMD N-terminal domain, may possess cell-death inducing activity. As a first step to investigate whether DFNA5 is an effector of necrotic-like cell death downstream of caspase activation, we tested whether DFNA5 is a target for caspases. Incubation of N-terminal T7 tagged recombinant DFNA5 with caspase-3, but not with caspase-1, resulted in the generation of â¼35âkDa N-terminal fragment similar in size to the caspase-1 generated GSDMD N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Among human caspases only caspase-3 was able to efficiently cleave DFNA5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably, caspase-3 was also capable of cleaving GSDMD but resulted in the generation of a 13âkDa GSDMD N-terminal fragment. This result is consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, which showed that GSDMD is cleaved at Asp87 during apoptosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wellslab.ucsf.edu/cgibin/retrieve_1.0.cgi?degrabase_type=both&amp;p1_type=all&amp;substrate=gsdmd">http://wellslab.ucsf.edu/cgibin/retrieve_1.0.cgi?degrabase_type=both&amp;p1_type=all&amp;substrate=gsdmd</ext-link>). This residue is part of a consensus caspase-3 cleavage site (DxxD) and is conserved in both human and mouse GSDMD. The physiological consequence of this cleavage remains to be investigated. Cleavage of DFNA5 by caspase-3 was very efficient and complete, and appears to occur only at a single site because only two fragments (DFNA5-N and DFNA5-C) were generated when the cleaved products were visualized by Coomassie stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, right panel).</p>
        <p>To identify the caspase-3 recognition site in DFNA5 we searched for a consensus caspase-3 recognition motif (DxxD) in the linker region between the DFNA5-N and DFNA5-C domains. We found that both human and mouse DFNA5 proteins contain putative caspase-3 recognition motifs at residues 267â270 (267DMPD270) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To confirm that this site is indeed cleaved by caspase-3, we substituted Asp270 with Glutamate in human DFNA5 by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting D/E mutant DFNA5 was completely resistant to cleavage by caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We further subjected the DFNA5-C fragment to Edman degradation and obtained the N-terminal sequence AAHGI, which exactly matches the N-terminal sequence of the predicted DFNA5-C fragment generated by cleavage of human DFNA5 after Asp270.</p>
        <p>To show that DFNA5 is a physiological target for caspase-3 after its activation by the Apaf-1 apoptosome, we stimulated S100 cell extracts from 293T cells stably expressing a C-terminal EGFP-tagged WT or D270E DFNA5 proteins (293T-DFNA5-EGFP cells or 293T-DFNA5-D270E-EGFP cells, respectively) with cytochrome c. Notably, activation of endogenous caspase-3 within the Apaf-1 apoptosome by cytochrome c resulted in robust processing of WT DFNA5 but not the D270E DFNA5 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Caspase-3 activation by cytochrome c in S100 extracts from 293T cells stably expressing GSDMD-EGFP (293T-GSDMD-EGFP cells) also resulted in processing of GSDMD at Asp87 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). No DFNA5 or GSDMD processing was observed in S100 lysates from the caspase-3-deficient MCF7 breast cancer cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, indicating that caspase-3 is the primary protease responsible for processing of DFNA5 and GSDMD downstream of the apoptosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>, left panels, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Consistent with this, DFNA5 processing was restored in MCF-7 cells stably expressing caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>, right panels). Similarly, activation of S100 extracts from HEPG2 cells which unlike 293T cells express detectable endogenous DFNA5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), or from immortalized caspase-1/11-double knockout macrophages, resulted in processing of endogenous DFNA5 and GSDMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Combined, these results indicate that caspase-3 specifically cleaves DFNA5 after Asp270 and that DFNA5 is a physiological target of caspase-3 downstream of the Apaf-1 apoptosome.</p>

        <title>The processed DFNA5-N fragment has a necrotic activity</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the caspase-3-generated DFNA5-N fragment has a necrotic activity like the GSDMD-N fragment that is generated by inflammatory caspases, full-length DFNA5 and GSDMD and their processed fragments DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N, respectively, were ectopically expressed in 293T cells. In contrast to full-length proteins, both DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N fragments induced extensive cell death with characteristic morphological and biochemical features of necrosis as evidenced by ballooning of the cell membrane and LDH release, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Because of their potent killing activity the expression levels of DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N fragments were barely detectable compare to full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Induction of necrosis by DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N fragments was largely not inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, indicating that these proteins do not require caspase activity to induce cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). However, there was a slight reduction in LDH and HMGB1 release in the zVAD-fmk treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b,c</xref>), suggesting that caspase activation occurs during this form of necrosis and may contribute to enhancement of cell death.</p>
        <p>To determine the minimal sequence of DFNA5-N fragment capable of inducing necrosis, we made progressive N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants of human DFNA5-N and mouse GSDMD-N. Expression of these deletion mutants in 293T cells revealed that the first 4N-terminal residues of DFNA5-N are critical for its killing activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Deletion of the homologous residues in GSDMD (residues 5â7) also inactivated GSDMD-N killing activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). This region contains a phenylalanine residue (F2 in DFNA5; F4 in GSDMD), mutation of which to alanine dramatically increased the expression of this mutant but significantly reduced its killing activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,c</xref>). Progressive deletions at the C-termini of DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N fragments revealed that residues 235â270 of DFNA5-N fragment or residues 232â276 of GSDMD-N fragment are not important for their killing activity. Interestingly, deletion of the last phenylalanine (F234) in the DFNA5â1â234 fragment or deletion of the last leucine (L231) in the GSDMD-1â231 fragment completely inactivated these proteins. Collectively these results indicate that the caspase-3 generated DFNA5-N fragment has an intrinsic necrotic activity, and that the N-terminal F2 and C-terminal F234 residues are critical for this activity.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>DFNA5-N targets the plasma membrane</title>
        <p>The intrinsic ability of DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N to induce plasma membrane swelling and necrosis suggests that these proteins target the plasma membrane. To provide evidence that DFNA5-N targets the plasma membrane we generated a construct encoding a C-terminal-EGFP tagged DFNA5-N fragment. Ectopic expression of this protein in 293T cells induced rapid and extensive necrosis, which hampered clear assessment of its subcellular localization. However, ectopic expression of an EGFP-tagged DFNA5 F2A mutant which has reduced killing activity and increased expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) allowed clear visualization of DFNA5-N on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This DFNA5 mutant showed membrane localization with some cytoplasmic distribution in healthy cells (upper panels) but mainly membrane localization in necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref> middle panels and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Videos 1â3</xref>). The full-length DFNA5 protein showed exclusive cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, lower panels).</p>
        <p>To provide additional evidence that the DFNA5-N fragment targets the plasma membrane, we activated DFNA5 by incubation of cell lysates from WT macrophages or 293T-DFNA5-EGFP cells with cytochrome c and then fractionated the cell lysates into membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation. Consistent with the confocal microscopy results, the activated endogenous DFNA5-N fragment from WT macrophages and the exogenous DFNA5-N fragment from 293T-DFNA5-EGFP were found in the heavy membrane and S100 fractions, whereas the unactivated full-length DFNA5 was found almost exclusively in the S100 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). These results are similar to those reported for GSDMD recently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that DFNA5-N fragment, like the GSDMD-N fragment, targets the plasma membrane to induce necrosis.</p>

        <title>DFNA5 N-terminus harbours a membrane targeting domain</title>
        <p>While this work was under review several recent reports showed that N-terminal fragments of members of the gasdermin family indeed target the plasma and mitochondrial membranes through interactions with membrane lipids leading to formation of large pores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

We generated a homology model of DFNA5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>) using SWISS-MODEL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> based on the crystal structure of GSDMA3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, which is 19.7% sequence identical to DFNA5. Both proteins are built by two arches closed like a clamp to bury an N-terminal moiety enriched in hydrophobic and basic residues (coloured in red in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Caspase-3 cleavage releases DFNA5 N-terminal arch (res. 1â270) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>) that, like GSDMA3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), has no apparent structural similarity to known proteins in the RCSB database. However, removing the N-terminal residues 1â57 that pack loosely against DFNA5 concave surface, reveals a seahorse-shaped fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>) characterized by a four stranded, highly twisted Î²-sheet decorated with small clusters of Î±-helices, characteristic of the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin-like Family (MACPF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6e,f</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Accordingly, a DALI search<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> identified several members of the membrane attack complex/perforin-like family super-family such as astrotactin (Z-score=3.1), the complement component C8a protein (âPoly-C8') (Z-score=2.4) and Pleurotolysin B (Z-score=2.0) as <italic>bona fide</italic> structural homologues of DFNA5-core. Interestingly, the structure of the oligomeric pore-forming Poly-C9 component of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) was recently determined using cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis, revealing a 22-fold symmetric ring of C9 molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7aâc</xref>). Poly-C9 heterodimerizes with the closely related Poly-C8 subunit and other subunits to form the MAC, a multi-protein complex that forms pores in the membrane of target pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The ability of these proteins to penetrate and insert into biomembranes is based on two helices (known as TMH1 and TMH2 and shown in red in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7aâc</xref>), which change conformation to form anti-parallel Î²-hairpin, generating an 88-strand pore-forming Î²-barrel (shown in red in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref> for only one protomer). Using the structural similarity between DFNA5 and Poly-C8/C9, we generated a model of the putative pore-conformation of DFNA5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d,e</xref>), which is â¼125âÃ in diameter. In analogy to other pore-forming toxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, we propose DFNA-5N-terminal moiety undergoes a complex conformational change upon oligomerization that results in formation of a membrane penetrating-tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>).</p>
        <p>Residues 1â56 of DFNA-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) contain an amphipathic Î±-helix and a Î²-hairpin exposing a basic patch (39-KKKR-42); overall this domain contains 19 hydrophobic residues that we propose are involved in membrane targeting and penetration (we refer to this region of DFNA5 as Membrane Targeting Domain or MTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). In analogy to the Poly-C9 component of the MAC complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, we speculate that DNFA5 MTD also undergoes conformational changes upon insertion into the plasma-membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>). Supporting this model, point mutations of K39, K40 and K41 to alanines almost completely prevented targeting of DFNA5-N to the plasma membrane and significantly reduced its necrotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,h</xref>). Combined mutation of K39 and K41 to alanines also largely prevented targeting of this mutant to the plasma membrane and significantly reduced its necrotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). However, mutation of K40 to alanine did not significantly reduce its necrotic activity but showed both membrane and cytoplasmic localization similar to the F2A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,h</xref>). Interestingly, a combined mutation of F2 and K40 to alanines resulted in total cytoplasmic localization and no necrotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,h</xref>). The significantly reduced necrotic activity and increased expression of the F2A mutant compared with WT or K40A mutant suggest that this residue might also be critical for DFNA5-N oligomerization. These results indicate that residues 1â56 of DFNA5 contain the MTD of DFNA5 and may also facilitate its oligomerization. Unlike known pore-forming toxins that assemble pores from the outside of the plasma-membrane, DFNA5 is a cytoplasmic protein that must assemble oligomers and penetrate the plasma-membrane from the inside. This is likely dictated by the lipid composition of the inner membrane. The molecular details of DFNA5 cell-penetration remain to be investigated in future studies.</p>

        <title>DFNA5 is activated by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway</title>
        <p>Intriguingly, a process called secondary necrosis has been observed following activation of the apoptotic programme in many cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Secondary necrosis refers to a terminal phase at the end of the apoptotic programme characterized by plasma membrane permeabilization, swelling and lysis, three features that are also common to pyroptosis and necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. This process occurs if the full apoptotic programme is completed and there is no intervention of scavengers such as seen under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, or when there is too much apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic> that overwhelms the available scavenging capacity. To demonstrate a role for cleaved DFNA5 in secondary necrosis downstream of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway we stably reconstituted 293T cells, which do not express detectable endogenous DFNA5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), with DFNA5-EGFP or DFNA5-D270E-EGFP. We then transfected these cells with an expression construct for Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, expression of Bax in the WT DFNA5-EGFP-reconstituted 293T cells led to processing of the DFNA5-EGFP protein to generate the active DFNA5-N fragment. However, expression of Bax in the DFNA5-D270E-EGFP-reconstituted 293T cells did not induce processing of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Consistent with a role for DFNA5-N fragment in inducing necrosis, Bax expression also caused significant LDH release from the 293T-DFNA5-EGFP cells but not from the cells expressing the D270E mutant DFNA5-EGFP or GSDMD-EGFP proteins (293T-GSDMD-EGFP cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The 293T-DFNA5-EGFP cells also showed microscopic features of necrosis (ballooning of the cell membrane), which were largely absent in the cells expressing the D270E mutant DFNA5-EGFP, GSDMD-EGFP or EGFP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with the above results transfection of 293T-DFNA5-EGFP cells with a constitutively active<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, but not inactive mutant caspase-3 also led to processing of DFNA5 and significant induction of LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). No processing of DFNA5 or significant LDH release was observed in 293T-DFNA5-D270E-EGFP cells. In addition, no significant LDH release was observed in the GSDMD-EGFP-expressing 293T-GSDMD-EGFP cells after transfection with active caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Combined these results show that DFNA5, but not GSDMD, mediates secondary necrosis downstream of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and caspase-3 activation.</p>

        <title>DFNA5 is activated by viral infection and etoposide</title>
        <p>Infection with ssRNA viruses such as VSV or ECMV can lead to caspase-3 activation and cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To investigate whether activation of caspase-3 by viral infection can lead to DFNA5-dependent secondary necrosis, WT and casp-1/casp-11-double knockout (casp-1/11 dKO) macrophages were infected with VSV and then subjected to western blot and LDH release assays to detect cleavage of DFNA5 and measure necrosis, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, VSV infection caused a dose-dependent processing of DFNA5 into the active DFNA5-N fragment in both WT and casp-1/11-dKO macrophages. Altogether with DFNA5 processing there was LDH release from both WT and casp-1/11-dKO macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). LDH release was slightly higher in the casp-1/11-dKO cells probably because of increased caspase-3 activation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, lower panels). This is consistent with recent results showing that caspase-1 deficiency increases the activity of caspase-3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). These results show that VSV infection is associated with caspase-3 activation, DFNA5 cleavage and secondary necrosis.</p>
        <p>To provide evidence that virus-induced necrosis is dependent on caspase-3-induced processing of DFNA5 and independent of inflammatory caspase activation, we knocked down DFNA5 with siRNA in casp-1/11-dKO macrophages and then infected them with VSV. VSV-induced LDH release and necrosis was significantly reduced when DFNA5 was knocked down in these macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6câe</xref>). Interestingly, VSV infection induced extensive blebbing and apoptotic bodies and very little plasma membrane swelling (ballooning) in the DFNA5-knocked down cells compared with control cells which showed both ballooning and blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>
        <p>Similar to the results obtained with mouse macrophages, VSV infection lead to significantly more LDH release from 293T-DFNA5-EGFP cells compared with 293T or 293T-GSDMD-EGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). DFNA5 was also cleaved in the VSV-infected 293T-DFNA5-EGFP and the cells exhibited the typical ballooning morphology associated with necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). Similar results were obtained when cells were infected with ECMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d,e</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Secondary necrosis has long been recognized as a terminal event following the completion of the apoptotic programme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This occurs <italic>in vitro</italic> under tissue culture conditions or <italic>in vivo</italic> when apoptotic cells are not removed by scavenging cells such as in lysosomal disorders that impair removal of apoptotic cells by scavenging cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> leading to secondary necrosis and inflammation. The main features of secondary necrosis are osmotic cell swelling and lysis, features that are also common to pyroptosis and necroptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Like pyroptosis and necroptosis, secondary necrosis leads to leakage of the cell contents thereby it may cause tissue injury and induction of inflammation and other immune responses if the dying cells are not quickly removed by phagocytes. Secondary necrosis has been discounted as a non-specific and non-programmed osmotic swelling, and thus the molecular mechanism that leads to its onset remained poorly understood. Here we present compelling evidence that secondary necrosis is a form of programmed necrosis similar to pyroptosis, mediated by the GSDMD-related protein DFNA5. Our results clearly demonstrate that secondary necrosis is orchestrated by the activity of apoptotic caspase-3 which directly cleaves DFNA5 to produce a necrotic DFNA5-N fragment that targets and permeabilizes the plasma membrane. This new caspase-3- and DFNA5-dependent necrotic pathway is activated downstream of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and can potentially be activated downstream of the apoptotic death receptor pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). Considering the structural homology between DFNA5 and GSDMD and their mechanism of activation by caspases, our results suggest that the necrotic DFNA5-N fragment has an intrinsic pore-forming activity, similar to that of GSDMD-N fragment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, that damages and permeabilizes the plasma membrane.</p>
      <p>Physiologically, formation of necrotic plasma membrane pores during secondary necrosis and pyroptosis may serve as a way to release a host of potent intracellular DAMPs (for example, HMGB1, ATP, inflammatory cytokines) that can act as alarm signals to activate and recruit immune cells to the site of apoptosis or infection. A recent study demonstrated that formation of the necrotic GSDMD pores also facilitate the trapping of intracellular pathogens within the largely intact plasma membrane, in a structure termed pore-induced intracellular trap (PIT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The PIT promotes efferocytosis of the cell corpse and entrapped pathogens by phagocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. These observations suggest that the GSDMD and likely the DFNA5 pores play important roles in the host innate immunity not only by releasing of alarmins but also by trapping pathogens within the cellular debris to be subsequently cleared by phagocytes. Our results show that VSV infection leads to activation of DFNA5 and induction of secondary necrosis, raising the possibility that the DFNA5 pores might also be involved in trapping of apoptotic pathogens like VSV, to allow for efficient efferocytosis of VSV-infected cells. Since both activated GSDMD and DFNA5 proteins have similar pore-forming activities, this suggests that they may have similar functions downstream of inflammatory and apoptotic caspases, respectively. This redundancy might be important for multicellular organisms considering that inflammatory caspases, GSDMD and DFNA5 might be differentially expressed in different cell types and tissues. It is also likely that DFNA5-N and GSDMD-N may function to target and kill different invading microorganisms as demonstrated recently for GSDMD-N (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). It is interesting that GSDMD-N fragment has a basic isoelectric point (pI=8.9) whereas DFNA5-N fragment has an acidic pI of 5.6 raising the possibility that they might have different specificities for different lipids and thus might kill different microorganisms. Future studies should clarify these points.</p>
      <p>Although casp-1/11 dKO macrophages cannot cleave and activate GSDMD, they can still progress to a caspase-dependent secondary necrosis phenotype when infected with VSV. This progression is also dependent on DFNA5 as knockdown of DFNA5 in these macrophages attenuates their necrotic response to VSV-infection. This indicates that activation of the apoptotic caspase-3 in the absence of inflammatory caspases could serve to induce secondary necrosis through cleavage of DFNA5. Therefore, in addition to it being involved in secondary necrosis, the DFNA5 pathway might also serve as a backup pathway in the events of inflammasome inhibition by pathogen-mediated inflammasome-suppression strategies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. For example, cowpox virus and orthopoxviruses encode serpins such as CrmA that inhibit the activity of caspase-1, whereas myxoma virus and Shope fibroma virus encode pyrin-only proteins that inhibit inflammasome assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Similarly, pathogenic bacteria produce virulence factors such as Yop proteins of Yersinia species to suppress the activity and activation of the inflammasome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p>
      <p>Unlike secondary necrosis, apoptosis is a non-inflammatory and an immunologically silent form of cell death. This is likely because under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions apoptotic cells are removed by scavenging cells before they fully activate DFNA5 and progress to secondary necrosis. Indeed, our results clearly demonstrate that there is a major difference in the outcome of the apoptotic programme between <italic>DFNA5</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>DFNA5</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> macrophages. <italic>DFNA5</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> macrophages initiate the apoptotic programm with membrane blebbing and terminate it with secondary necrosis, whereas <italic>DFNA5</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> macrophages show only membrane blebbing and disassemble into small apoptotic bodies without plasma membrane swelling or LDH release and do not progress further (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Videos 4 and 5</xref>), even after 8âh treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Similarly, induction of apoptosis by VSV infection or activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by Bax in the largely DFNA5-deficient 293T cells only results in classic signs of apoptosis such as membrane blebbing, but when DFNA5 is stably expressed in these cells they progress to secondary necrosis. These findings indicate that DFNA5 regulates progression of apoptotic cells to secondary necrosis and may also function to prevent cellular disassembly into small apoptotic bodies during apoptosis. Since progression to secondary necrosis is linked to inflammatory diseases associated with defective clearance of apoptotic cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, this also raises the possibility that activation of DFNA5 might be a major contributing factor in these diseases.</p>
      <p>DFNA5 has been implicated in hearing loss but the underling molecular mechanism involved in this process has not been elucidated. All DFNA5 mutations leading to hearing loss in humans have been attributed to exon 8 skipping at the pre-mRNA level leading to the translation of a C-terminally truncated DFNA5 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Because ectopic expression of this mutant protein cause cell death, it has been proposed that the DFNA5 mutations represent gain of function mutations that increase the apoptotic activity of DFNA5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Indeed, this conclusion is supported by our results which show that truncation of the C-terminus of DFNA5 by caspase-3 activates the necrotic activity of DFNA5. Thus, truncation and inactivation of the inhibitory DFNA5-C domain by hearing loss mutations unleash the necrotic activity of DFNA5 by mimicking processing of DFNA5 by caspase-3. This indicates that DFNA5 mutant-induced hearing loss is an outcome of disregulated secondary necrosis of hearing cells, raising the possibility that other forms of non-syndromic hearing loss might also be an outcome of disregulated secondary necrosis.</p>
      <p>In addition to its involvement in hearing loss, DFNA5 has also been implicated in cancer as a tumour suppressor protein. Several studies showed that DFNA5 is silenced in many types of cancers by epigenetic mechanisms such as promoter methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Reduced DFNA5 expression was shown to increase resistance of melanoma cells to etoposide-induced cell death, whereas increased DFNA5 expression by stable expression of DFNA5 in resistant cells resulted in increased etoposide-induced cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. DFNA5 is also a transcriptional target for p53 and its increased expression by p53 activation sensitizes tumour cells to cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Our results indicate that DFNA5 functions directly downstream of caspase-3 activation to induce necrotic cell death. Therefore, the ability of caspase-3 to unleash the necrotic activity of DFNA5 by cleaving-off its inhibitory C-terminal DFNA5-C domain provides a mechanistic understanding of the tumour suppressive activity of DFNA5. This also places DFNA5 among the effector molecules that mediate the cell death activity of caspase-3. Since GSDMD is only present in birds and mammals, whereas DFNA5 is found in diverse species from teleost fishes to human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, the DFNA5 necrotic pathway might provide the same function in fish, reptile and amphibian species as the GSDMD pyroptotic pathway in birds and mammals. It is likely that the GSDMD pyroptotic pathway evolved recently perhaps to provide protection against new avian and mammalian pathogens.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have identified DFNA5 as a key mediator of secondary necrosis and cellular disassembly downstream of apoptotic caspase-3. Future studies should elucidate whether activation of this pathway might serve as an innate immune pathway to induce secondary necrosis in response to infection with apoptotic pathogens and other apoptotic triggers, and whether it is responsible for inflammation associated with defective apoptotic cell clearance.</p>

        <title>Signalling pathways leading to activation of DFNA5.</title>
        <p>Various death stimuli or viral infection can lead to permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane causing the release of cytochrome c, which binds to Apaf-1 leading to assembly of the Apaf-1 apoptosome and activation of caspase-9. Within this complex active caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3 to generate the active caspase-3 heterodimer. Active caspase-3 in turns cleaves DFNA5 at Asp270 to generate the necrotic DFNA5-N fragment which permeabilizes the plasma membrane by forming large pores causing osmotic lysis of the cell and releasing cellular contents including pro-inflammatory mediators and alamins, into the extracellular space. Caspase-3 can also be activated by the death receptor pathway, which is activated by death receptor ligands at the cell membrane. This pathway can potentially lead to caspase-3-mediated processing of DFNA5 and secondary necrosis.</p>
