          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a retinal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by apoptosis of photoreceptor cells, is caused by mutations in many different genes. We analyzed the RP gene ceramide kinase-like (<italic>CERKL</italic>) to determine CERKL function and contribution to pathogenesis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec sec-type="methods">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>RTâPCR was performed to characterize <italic>CERKL</italic> expression in many human adult and fetal tissues, including retina. We analyzed the protein subcellular localization by confocal microscopy and further verified it by sucrose gradients. We performed lipid kinase activity assays. And finally, we studied the effects on cell apoptosis after <italic>CERKL</italic> overexpression in transiently transfected cultured cells by propidium iodide staining and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) caspase-dependent cleavage.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p><italic>CERKL</italic> transcripts underwent alternative splicing. In the human retina, four different CERKL isoforms of 532, 558, 419, and 463 amino acids were expressed. CERKL proteins were mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, but they also shifted localization to nuclei and nucleoli. We also found that CERKL prevented cells from entering apoptosis induced by oxidative-stress conditions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>CERKL remains a unique orphan lipid kinase in that no candidate substrate has been identified after intense research. The dynamic localization of CERKL suggests multiple sites of action. Remarkably, CERKL (but not the RP R257X mutant) exerts a protective role in cells against oxidative stress, consistent with RP mutations impairing the normal protein function in photoreceptors and thus tilting the balance toward apoptosis. These results provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms causing retinal degeneration.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive attrition of photoreceptor cells through apoptosis. Although mutations in many different genes have the same phenotypic outcome, there is not much information gathered on the biochemical processes linking the genotype to the eventual photoreceptor death. In the course of our search for new genes causing autosomal recessive RP in several Spanish families, we identified a previously unannotated gene, ceramide-kinase like (<italic>CERKL</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>CERKL</italic> are responsible for a phenotypically distinct RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], with characteristic macular and peripheral lesions. The name of the gene stems from the diacylglycerol kinase domainâwhich shares homology to ceramide kinasesâof the encoded protein.</p>
      <p>Ceramide is a chore sphingolipid (SL), being the precursor of other bioactive and complex SLs and one of the initial key players in stress-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. SLs are now considered lipid second messengers that behave as finely tuned sensors of cell status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, the enzymes involved in SL metabolism, and among them CERKL, are rheostats that integrate multiple stress stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Mutations in these genes cause multiple and complex phenotypic effects, including severe neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. A variety of extracellular and intracellular stimuli, including cytokines, cytotoxic agents, and stress signals, cause the accumulation of ceramide via sphingomyelin hydrolysis or de novo synthesis. To avoid entering apoptosis, cells counteract this ceramide increase by activating enzymatic pathways involved in ceramide clearance. In this context, the phosphorylation of ceramide by ceramide kinase exerts a protective role against apoptosis. Ceramide can be produced in different subcellular membranous compartments, adding to the complexity and the homeostasis of the whole system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of <italic>CERKL</italic> as an RP gene provided a missing link between alterations in SL metabolism to inheritable retinal disorders and suggested a new avenue for elucidating the ethiopathological mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Here we report that <italic>CERKL</italic> undergoes alternatively splicing events, which affect the exons encoding the lipid kinase domain. Four protein isoforms are generated, although only 2 of them contain the complete diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase domain. Here we present a detailed characterization of the expression of these 4 alternatively spliced isoforms in different human tissues, and demonstrate that these 4 variants are only present in the retina. The 4 proteins show a similar subcellular localization pattern, and are mainly located in the ER and Golgi compartments. Although <italic>CERKL</italic> substrates remains elusive under standard experimental conditions, we show that overexpression of CERKL isoforms protects cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress.</p>

        <title>Cloning of <italic>CERKL</italic> splicing variants in the human retina</title>
        <p>Specific primers flanking exons 2 and 13 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) were used to clone <italic>CERKL</italic> alternative splicing variants by PCR from Marathon-Readyâ¢ human retina cDNA (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) under the following conditions: 94Â Â°C for 30 s, 58Â Â°C for 30 s, and 72Â Â°C for 2 min for 35 cycles. The primer CERKL_E2_F annealed to exon 2 while the CERKL_E13_R primer annealed to exon 13 and introduced a BamHI site to facilitate subsequent subcloning. The 50Â Î¼l reaction mixture contained 10Â Î¼M of each primer, 2Â Î¼M of dNTPs, 1.5Â mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 U of Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR bands detected after electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel were cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptII KS and verified by sequencing. The full-length cDNAs of these <italic>CERKL</italic> isoforms were reconstituted by digesting the partial clones with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloning the corresponding fragments into a pBluescriptII KS vector that already contained the 5â² end of <italic>CERKL</italic> (the complete exon 1 and the stretch of exon 2 before the EcoRI site, obtained from the IMAGE clone 3870103).</p>

        <title>RTâPCR analysis of the presence of <italic>CERKL</italic> splicing variants in human tissues</title>
        <p>The splicing pattern of <italic>CERKL</italic> was analyzed in human retina cDNA and a panel of first-strand cDNAs from several human adult and fetal tissues, using specifically designed pairs of primers to amplify and distinguish each isoform (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), as follows: 1) to detect splicing variants <italic>CERKLa</italic> and <italic>CERKLb</italic> (RT_CERKLab_F and RT_CERKLab_R); 2) to amplify splicing variant <italic>CERKLc</italic> (RT_CERKLc_F and RT_CERKLcd_R); 3) to detect splicing variant <italic>CERKLd</italic> (RT_CERKLd_F and RT_CERKLcd_R). Two-step PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 94Â Â°C for 30 s and 58Â Â°C for 30 s. The 25Â Î¼l reaction mixture contained 10Â Î¼M of each primer, 2Â Î¼M of dNTPs, 1.5Â mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 U Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The concentration of the Marathon-Readyâ¢ human retina cDNA and first-strand cDNAs from the tissue panel (BD Biosciences) in the reactions were 0.01 ng/Î¼l and 0.1 ng/Î¼l, respectively.</p>

        <p>Expression vectors containing the full-length open reading frame of the four <italic>CERKL</italic> isoforms were assembled by PCR amplification of each variant using the CERKL_E2_F primer, which anneals upstream of the EcoRI site in exon 2 and the CERKL_E13_HA_R primer, which anneals in exon 13 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Primer CERKL_E13_HA_R also encoded a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag and included an EcoRV site for subsequent cloning. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and EcoRV and cloned into a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) that contained exons 1 and 2 of <italic>CERKL</italic> (previously cloned between HindIII and EcoRI sites). The integrity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. To generate the truncated RP mutant protein (R257X), site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the 2 constructs containing the isoforms CERKLa and CERKLb (encompassing the lipid kinase domain). The 847C&gt;T change was introduced with the mutCERKL_F and mutCERKL_R primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In these constructs, the HA epitope was added to the N-terminus of the protein for immunodetection.</p>
        <p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) or African green monkey kidney (COS-7) cells were seeded at 3Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells/dish in 10 cm cell culture dishes 1 day before transfection.

        <title>In vitro and in vivo kinase activity assays</title>
        <p>DAG and ceramide kinase activities were assayed in vitro as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Briefly, the source of the enzymatic activity were protein lysates from either HEK293T or COS-7 cells transfected with each CERKL isoform (250Â Âµg total protein), the empty vector or a CERK-expressing construct (negative and positive control, respectively) obtained by sonication in 20Â mM MOPS pH 7.0, 2Â mM EGTA, 1Â mM DTT, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors. The source of lipids were either: a) micelles obtained from commercial sphingolipids, which contained 880Â ÂµM lipids (ceramide and sphingosine, both from bovine brain sphingomyelin, or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1Â mM cardiolipin, 1.5% Î²-octylglucoside, 0.2Â mM diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DETAPAC); b) lipid micelles, obtained by sonication of 50Â Î¼g of lipids extracted from cultured 661W murine photoreceptor-derived cells in 1Â mM DETAPAC, 7.5% Î²-octylglucoside; or c) total 661W cell lysates that were heat-inactivated at 65Â Â°C for 20 min to abrogate endogenous enzymatic activities. Reactions were performed at 100Â Âµl final volume containing 20Â mM MOPS pH 7.2, 50Â mM NaCl, 1Â mM dithiothreitol, 2Â mM EGTA, and 3Â mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, with the corresponding lipid and protein sources. Reactions were started by adding MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 0.5Â mM final concentration plus Î³-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP (2â5Â ÂµCi/reaction), incubated at 30Â Â°C for 30 min, 60 min, or overnight, and stopped with 250Â Âµl of chloroform, 250Â Âµl of methanol and 125Â Âµl HCl 2.4 M. After vortexing, the phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase removed and vacuum-dried. Lipids were resuspended in 25Â Âµl chloroform:methanol (95:5, v/v), spotted onto silica gel plates and separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). For the enzymatic assays in vivo, we seeded 1.5Ã10<sup>6</sup> 661W cells on 10 cm diameter plates and transfected using either the two pEGP-CERKL long isoforms (a and b) or the pEGFP empty-vector (negative control). Transfected cells were enriched by using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to select green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells. These cells were reseeded on smaller plates, and 4Â Î¼l of radioactive <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate was added to the medium. Cells were collected after 4 h, and lysed directly in a solution of chloroform:methanol:chlorhydric acid (100:100:1). After vigorous vortexing, cellular debris was sedimented by centrifugation in a microfuge (100x g) and the liquid phase was vacuum-dried on completion. The lipid pellet was resuspended in a solution of 1:1 chloroform:methanol and loaded onto silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ). All TLCs (assays in vivo and in vitro) were run in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v). Radiolabeled lipids were visualized by autoradiography.</p>

The constructs were transformed into BL21 Codon Plus <italic>E.coli</italic> cells (Stratagene) to avoid premature protein truncation due to the strongly biased codon usage of the <italic>CERKL</italic> human gene. Recombinant proteins were produced in 500Â ml cultures induced by the addition of 0.5Â mM Isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).

The membranes were equilibrated for 5 min in 10Â mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150Â mM NaCl, and 0.1% v/v Tween-20 (TBST). They were then blocked with 3% BSA in TBST (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was then incubated overnight at 4Â Â°C in blocking solution containing 0.5Â Âµg/ml of the GST-fusion protein on a rocking platform. The membranes were washed twice for 15 min in TBST with gentle agitation, and then incubated for 1 h with 1:1,000 anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing as before, membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:3,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma).

Cells were grown on coverslips in 12 well plates. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamineâ¢2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Next, 24 h or 48 h post-transfection cells were rinsed with PBS 1X (137Â mM NaCl, 2.7Â mM KCl, 1.5Â mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8Â mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4Â Â°C for 30 min. Cells were then washed and permeabilized for 10 min with a solution that contained 0.1% Triton X-100, 20Â mM glycine, and 10Â mM PBS. After permeabilization, cells were rinsed and blocked in a solution composed of 1% BSA, 20Â mM glycine, and 10Â mM PBS. Then, cells were incubated with 1:250 anti-HA polyclonal antibody and either specific 1:25 anti-calnexin, 1:250 anti-GM130, or 1:1,000 anti-EEA1 monoclonal primary antibodies (all from BD Biosciences) at 37Â Â°C for 1 h. Mitochondria were labeled by adding reduced MitoTracker Orange (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 500 nM for 45 min before the fixation procedure and subsequent immunocytochemistry. Upon washing, cells were incubated with 1:300 AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit and 1:300 AlexaFluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies.

At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with 1X PBS, and then incubated 20 min at 4Â Â°C in a solution that contained 10Â mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 3% sucrose w/v, and 1% protease inhibitors (Roche). After this incubation, the concentration of sucrose was increased up to 0.25 M, and cells were broken by 15 strokes in an iced-chilled Dounce homogenizer. Cellular debris, nuclei, and unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation at 1,300x g for 5 min at 4Â Â°C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged overnight at 100,000x g at 4Â Â°C. The pellet containing cell organelles was resuspended in 1.5 M sucrose and laid at the bottom of a 1.8Â ml swing-out (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) centrifuge tube. Subsequent layers of equal volumes of 1.15, 0.9, 0.6, and 0.25 M sucrose were added, and the final sucrose gradient was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000x g at 4Â Â°C. Next, 11 fractions of approximately 150Â Î¼l were collected from bottom to top. Samples were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide SDSâPAGE gels, transferred to 0.45Â Âµm polyvinylidene fluoride PDVP membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and underwent immunodetection with the corresponding antibodies.</p>

        <title>CERKL transcripts are alternatively spliced in the human retina</title>
        <p>The initially characterized <italic>CERKL</italic> gene spanned 13 exons in chromosome 2q31.2â31.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). While attempting to clone the full-length <italic>CERKL</italic> on retina cDNA using primers spanning the ATG (forward) and the STOP (reverse) codons, we observed several faint bands, which were indicative of alternatively spliced variants. Therefore, we devised a two-step strategy of RTâPCR and cloning (see Methods) to characterize the full-length isoforms based on the structure of the gene. The RTâPCR analysis of human retina mRNA using primers from exons 2 and 13 allowed us to identify several spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) that would result in several protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1 B</xref>): 1) CERKLa, which corresponded to the already reported variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], spanning 13 exons and encoding a 532 amino acid protein (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=4090">AY357073</ext-link>); 2) CERKLb, a 14 exon isoform, which includes an additional exon (4b) between exons 4 and 5 and encodes a 558 amino acid protein (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=5723">AY690329</ext-link>); 3) CERKLc, a splicing variant devoid of exons 3-4-4b-5, which encodes a 419 amino acid protein (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=5723">AY690330</ext-link>); and 4) CERKLd, a splicing variant that skips exons 4-4b-5 and encodes a 463 amino acid protein (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=5723">AY690331</ext-link>). Two very faint bands corresponded to not in-frame splicing variants (accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=5723">AY690332</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=nuccore&amp;id=5723">AY690333</ext-link>) that would generate prematurely truncated proteins. These were considered aberrant transcripts, and given the mRNA quality control regulation, if they were produced in cells, they would be most probably cleared by the nonsense mediated decay mechanism.</p>

        <p>The longest isoforms (CERKLa and CERKLb) contained the complete DAG domain and a putative N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) region.

        <p>Noticeably, exons 4b and 5, which are alternatively spliced, show the rare GC donor splice site instead of the more common GT (marked by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both exons and the GC donor site sequences are conserved in the chimpanzee genome. The mouse <italic>Cerkl</italic> gene, which shows overall strong conservation in exon and intron structure, has no equivalent for exon 4b, thus suggesting that there are only 3 CERKL isoforms in the mouse. Again, the donor site of exon 5 in rodents is GC.</p>

        <title>CERKL shows a complex alternative splicing pattern in human tissues</title>
        <p>As we had previously found that <italic>CERKL</italic> was expressed in a variety of human adult and fetal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], we searched for <italic>CERKL</italic> isoforms in tissues other than retina. To this end, we used a panel of first strand cDNAs from several human tissues. In accordance with our previous data, no <italic>CERKL</italic> isoform was found in adult skeletal or heart muscle. However, some of the four in-frame splicing variants were detected in other adult and fetal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). cDNAs encoding protein isoforms CERKLa and CERKLb (with an intact DAG kinase domain) were present in adult liver and pancreas, as well as in fetal brain, lung, and kidney. One or both short isoforms (c and d) were detected in adult lung, adult kidney, adult pancreas, fetal lung, and fetal liver. Notably, retina was the only tissue in which all 4 isoforms were expressed under the conditions tested. However, basal levels of most isoforms were observed in most tissues after a saturating number of PCR cycles (data not shown).</p>

        <title>CERKL does not phosphorylate ceramide under standard conditions</title>
        <p>Given the structural similarities of CERKL to the reported ceramide kinases, a series of experiments were conducted to assess ceramide kinase activity. The protocol from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] with minor modifications was used for in vitro ceramide kinase assays. We changed either of the following: 1) the source of the ceramides, namely a commercial mixture of brain ceramides (Sigma) or lipid micelles prepared from 661W cells (mouse photoreceptor precursor cell line, kindly provided by M.R. Al-Ubaidi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]; or 2) the source of the enzymatic activity to be tested, namely protein lysates from transiently transfected HEK293T and COS-7 cells overexpressing each CERKL isoform, or affinity-purified recombinant GST-CERKL variants (after expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and only used in assays in vitro). No kinase activity was detected for any isoform at any combination of the lipid and protein lysate sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, lysates from co-transfections with constructs expressing 2 different isoforms, or the 4 of them together, were assayed for kinase activity. However, no significant difference with respect cells transfected with the empty vector or single CERKL isoforms could be detected (data not shown). We then attempted to detect CERKL kinase activity in vivo using photoreceptor-derived 661W cells. As 661W are neuronal, they transfect poorly; therefore, we used CERKL-GFP fusion constructs to enrich by FACS the population of transfected cells. Unfortunately, no differences were detected between cells transfected with CERKL and the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Subcellular CERKL localization is highly dynamic</title>
        <p>Ceramide and other sphingoid lipids are highly dynamic membrane components. Proteins involved in sphingolipid metabolism appear to be specifically localized in subcellular compartments of the secretory pathway, from the ER-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. In this context, we aimed to determine CERKL subcellular localization by transient expression of each alternative splicing variant in cultured COS-7 cells, as the 4 isoforms display a specific domain architecture, which might account for slight differences in function or compartment localization. We used C-terminal HA-tagged CERKL isoforms (CERKL-HA), as well as the fusion CERKL-GFP constructs, in these transient transfections.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, neither a unique localization pattern nor a restricted subcellular localization could be ascribed to any CERKL isoform, as all variants showed similar patterns that appeared to be cell-specific. Two main protein localizations emerged consistently in all preparations, as seen for the isoform CERKLa (532 amino acids; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4AâD</xref>). Most cells showed CERKL in a strong perinuclear distribution, while the nucleus was practically devoid of signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Additionally, few cells in each field presented CERKL within the nucleus, where it was either localized to, or clearly excluded from, the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A,B,D</xref>). No exclusive colocalization with reference markers of subcellular compartments was observed, as CERKL colocalized both with the ER (calnexin) and Golgi matrix (GM130) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). To further assess association of CERKL with other membranous compartments, we assayed colocalization to endosomes (EEA1) or mitochondria (labeled by MitoTracker staining). However, no precise colocalization was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). Instead, the mutant RP truncated protein CERKLa R257X (the localization of CERKLb 257X was identical; data not shown) showed a more stable localization pattern in the ER and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>), in agreement with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Similar CERKL subcellular localization results were obtained at 24 h or 48 h post-transfection, although a shift toward perinuclear accumulation was clearly observed. The same pattern was obtained when analyzing the localization of all 4 CERKL-GFP isoform constructs (data not shown). Overall, these results point to a highly dynamic localization of CERKL, which may relocate according to the stimuli acting upon a cell.</p>

        <title>CERKL protects cells from apoptosis in oxidative stress conditions</title>
        <p>One of the working hypotheses to explain why mutations in <italic>CERKL</italic> cause RP is based on its cellular protective role through the regulation of the ceramide/ceramide-1-phosphate ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Photoreceptors are under constant oxidative challenge. Environmental stress as well as genetic mutations (e.g., on <italic>CERKL</italic>) would make them more susceptible to damage, tilting the survival/death balance and triggering apoptosis. To test whether CERKL has a protective role, we assayed the effect of CERKL overexpression in transiently transfected cells under normal or oxidative stress conditions. As most neuronal cell lines, retina derived cells are very poorly transfected, so we had to resort to transfections on COS-7 and HeLa cell lines to obtain statistically significant results.</p>
        <p>COS-7 cells were transfected with each of the CERKL isoforms as well as the mutant RP protein, and cell death was assayed by propidium iodide staining after treatment with 200Â Î¼M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 4 h. The results were compared to those obtained with cells transfected with either empty vector or a construct expressing the known ceramide kinase, CERK (this construct was a gift from F. Bornancin). Dead cells were stained with propidium iodide and quantified (as a percentage) against total cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Expression of the CERKL or CERK constructs caused a slight increase in mortality in basal conditions. Under oxidative stress, there was a 3.4-fold increase in mortality in the empty-vector transfected cells, whereas cells overexpressing any of the 4 CERKL isoforms maintained a similar mortality rate (no increase in mortality) with a high statistical significance (MannâWhitney, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). Remarkably, the CERKL R257X (the RP mutant) failed to protect cells; the mortality rate increased under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>), although to a lesser level than the empty-vector cells (1.8 fold increase in mortality; statistical significance, p&lt;0.05 in comparison to either CERKL isoforms or the empty vector). As propididum iodide staining was performed on coverslips, the transfection efficiency of each construct was assessed by western detection on protein lysates of replicate transfections.</p>

        <p>Propidium iodide labels both apoptotic and necrotic cell nuclei. We attempted then to determine whether this protective effect of CERKL overexpression was on preventing cells from entering apoptosis. Activation of caspases is a well established event in apoptosis, and detection of caspase-cleaved substrates, such as PARP-1 (poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase)-1, is one of the most widespread hallmarks to quantify cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. PARP caspase-dependent cleavage was immunodetected in HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with either the empty vector or the CERKLa isoform (532 amino acids, encompassing the DAG kinase domain) in normal or under oxidative stress conditions, and using several reagents and concentrations: 300Â Î¼M and 400Â Î¼M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, fetal bovine serum (FBS) deprivation and 0.3Â mM sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The analysis was performed at different window times to determine the best range of conditions for quantification of any potential protective effect. CERKL did protect against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>) in cells treated with 300Â Î¼M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This effect was dependent on the degree of oxidative insult, as it was much more effective at 300Â Î¼M (no apoptosis increase), than at 400Â Î¼M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (no significant protection). It was also dependent on the type of inducer, as cells overexpressing CERKLa did not behave differently from empty-vector transfected cells after FBS deprivation or SNP addition.</p>

        <p>This protective effect was also dependent on time, and presented an effective window frame.

In addition, this effect appeared to be much more prominent at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>), where the protection appeared to be maximal, around 50% protection (p&lt;0.05, MannâWhitney test). However, the effect was no longer observed at 48 h (data not shown), where PARP cleavage was high and comparable between empty-vector and CERKLa transfected cells. The expression of CERKLa was comparable in all transfections (65%â68%), as assayed by western blot (data not shown), thus the observed differences were solely attributable to the overexpression of this isoform. Interestingly, this protective effect at 24 h-treatment was only found for the full-length CERKLa but not the truncated R257X mutant (neither in the a nor the b isoform constructs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref>), in accordance to the pathogenicity of this mutation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There is mounting evidence that most human genes show alternatively spliced isoforms, many of them regulated by tissue-specific factors. Indeed, alteration of alternative splicing is frequently linked to severe genetic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. We report the characterization of 4 in-frame alternatively spliced isoforms of <italic>CERKL</italic>, which is responsible for an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP26). In our case, the isoform multiplicity increased the complexity of the functional analysis of a yet to be characterized lipid kinase. For instance, comparison of isoforms CERKLa and CERKLb revealed an additional exon (E4b), which introduces 26 additional amino acids in-frame within the DAG kinase catalytic domain and immediately upstream of the phosphate-donor binding site (GGDGS). The position of this exon in the presumptive catalytic domain makes it a good candidate for modulating the catalytic, substrate- or partner-binding abilities of the protein, as has been postulated for alternatively-spliced exons within encoded functional domains after an in silico genomic survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, the other two in-frame isoforms, CERKLc and CERKLd, lack the exons encoding the DAG kinase (mainly encoded in exons 4 and 5) domain, which may severely compromise the catalytic activity while preserving other functions, among them substrate recognition. That exons 4b and 5 share a rare splice donor site (GC) strongly suggests that the production of these alternatively spliced isoforms is regulated. Genome-wide analyses on the usage of splice sites showed that only 0.69% of exon/intron donor sites are GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], making it highly improbable that 2 such sites flanking exons tandemly arrayed occurred in the same gene unless there was some kind of regulation behind. Given that GC- splice donor sites are intrinsically weak, explaining why 60% of the GC-flanked exons are alternatively processed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], and that this site is evolutionarily conserved, <italic>CERKL</italic> splicing is probably highly regulated.</p>
      <p>From sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis, CERKL unambiguously clusters within the ceramide kinase subfamily of lipid kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. However, at present, there is no experimental evidence to support CERKL kinase activity on ceramides. Therefore, it still stands as an orphan lipid kinase, in agreement with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. It may well be that, although not yet identified for other lipid kinases, a partner is required for substrate recognition or catalysis. Alternatively, the substrate may be a ceramide-derived lipid undetectable under standard ceramide separation conditions. In any case, the presence of 4 different isoforms, of which 2 are devoid of the kinase domain, suggests that CERKL is involved in cellular roles other than lipid phosphorylation. Remarkably, in contrast to other lipid enzyme genes that are spread throughout all the eukaryotes, <italic>CERKL</italic> may be exclusive to the vertebrate lineage. Highly homologous sequences can be found in chick and fish, but no evidence of <italic>CERKL</italic> is found in the lancelet, the closest chordate ancestor to the vertebrates, which instead shows an unambiguous hit to <italic>CERK</italic> (data not shown). Further support to its vertebrate confinement comes from the fact that other invertebrate genomes, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, are also devoid of any <italic>CERKL</italic> homologs. In this evolutionary context, the more complex vertebrate retina may have required genes with novel enzymatic functions to protect cells against stress, adding further refinement to the metabolism of bioactive lipids as second messengers.</p>
      <p>The versatile subcellular localization of CERKL in the COS-7 and HEK293T cell lines is common to all isoforms. This complex and highly dynamic pattern may reflect changes in the intracellular sphingolipid pools, as it occurs with other proteins in the ceramide metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. CERKL has been reported to contain one bona fide nuclear localization signal (amino acids 102â106) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], which would account for its import into the nuclei. In our studies and for all wild-type CERKL isoforms, nuclear localization is not a general event. Thus, the evident retention of the truncated R257X protein mutant seemed relevant to pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Further investigation is needed to determine how and why CERKL is imported into the nuclei and the nucleoli as well as what is the function of the protein in these organelles. Indeed, transient nuclear localization of CERKL may be related to the regulation of the chromatin-associated ceramide and sphingomyelin pools, in accordance with the intranuclear distribution of other key enzymes of the ceramide metabolism, as happens for SMase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>], ceramidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], and SPHK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. In addition, the consistent localization in the ER and Golgi compartments is compatible with the membrane-associated rolesâsuch as non-vesicular traffickingâreported for lipid kinases and other lipid-related proteins. It has been claimed that compartmentalization of ceramide function requires transfer between different membranous organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], although ceramide kinase activity has also been detected in the cytosol, where it is not associated with membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], This indicates, overall, that these enzymes translocate between different compartments. In this scenario, the observed variable CERKL intracellular distribution is not so surprising, particularly when considering that similar protein localization dynamicsâwhich shift depending on the cellular state or stimuliâare now being reported for other proteins involved in lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Under our conditions, the 4 isoforms showed a similar localization pattern, irrespectively of the epitope used (HA or GFP), suggesting that the functional differences among them are not dependent on subcellular localization. Besides lipid phosphorylation, CERKL isoforms may be involved in the regulation of its own enzymatic activity, lipid trafficking and storage, as well as in binding to distinct substrates or protein partners. In this context, the multiplicity of isoforms in the same tissue (or even in the same cell) and the fact that two of the four isoforms lack the lipid kinase domain, gives support to the rationale of multiplicity of functions.</p>
      <p>RP is characterized by progressive depletion of photoreceptor cells through apoptosis. Many different genetic defects converge in retinal cell malfunction and trigger programmed cell death. The retina consists of several ordered layers of differentiated neuronal cells that are under constant oxidative stress conditions due to light exposure and a high metabolic rate. Therefore, photoreceptor survival depends on the action of anti-apoptotic mechanisms to prevent premature death. Our data support that CERKL plays a crucial protective role as its overexpression protects cells from entering apoptosis. This protective effect is dependent on time and the severity of the insult suggesting that CERKL overexpression is effective only under a range of stress conditions, but probably not after massive cell damage. Remarkably, the R257X protein causing RP cannot protect cells after sustained injury. The weak protective effect observed at 4 h treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was no longer detectable after 24 h treatment. This RP mutation lies within the <italic>CERKL</italic> exon 5, which is skipped in the variants that do not contain the DAG kinase domain (isoforms CERKLc and CERKLd). Thus, these two variants probably are not compromised in the RP26 patients. In this context, the physiologic relevance of each CERKL isoform and their particular contribution to retinal disorders is yet to be determined. Conceivably, the RP pathology could be caused by the absence of the longer isoforms or alternatively, the toxicity of the 2 truncated proteins. Our results, and the fact that most transcripts with premature STOP codons are degraded by nonsense mediated decay, support the first scenario.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge this is the first time CERKL has been shown to be directly involved in protection against apoptosis. Thus, we link RP-causative mutations to a regulatory mechanism for cell survival, which highlights the feasibility of an RP-gene therapy approach based on protection factors to prevent photoreceptor neurodegeneration and promote cell survival.</p>
