      <abstract>
        <p>Using two-hybrid screening, we isolated the integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein (ICAP-1), an interactor for the COOH terminal region of the Î²1A integrin cytoplasmic domain. To investigate the role of ICAP-1 in integrin-mediated adhesive function, we expressed the full-length molecule in NIH3T3 cells. ICAP-1 expression strongly prevents NIH3T3 cell spreading on extracellular matrix. This inhibition is transient and can be counteracted by coexpression of a constitutively activated mutant of Cdc42, suggesting that ICAP-1 acts upstream of this GTPase. In addition, we found that ICAP-1 binds both to Cdc42 and Rac1 in vitro, and its expression markedly inhibits activation of these GTPases during integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin as detected by PAK binding assay. In the attempt to define the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, we show that ICAP-1 reduces both the intrinsic and the exchange factorâinduced dissociation of GDP from Cdc42; moreover, purified ICAP-1 displaces this GTPase from cellular membranes. Together, these data show for the first time that ICAP-1 regulates Rho family GTPases during integrin-mediated cell matrix adhesion, acting as guanine dissociation inhibitor.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rho family GTPases are cytoplasmic proteins controlling several crucial cellular functions such as organization of the cytoskeleton in cell motility, gene expression, and cell cycle progression. Three of these GTPases, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, have been studied in some detail and shown to play a major role in regulating actin cytoskeleton in response to soluble extracellular stimuli known to induce cell motility, such as PDGF and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1998</xref>). In particular Cdc42 and Rac1 regulate the ability of the cell to elongate membrane protrusions, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, whereas RhoA controls the organization of actin in stress fibers (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 1998</xref>) ending at âfocal adhesions,â sites of cell matrix contact where integrins are clustered.</p>
      <p>Filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fibers are also formed during integrin-mediated cell adhesion to and spreading on insoluble extracellular matrix proteins in the absence of soluble motogenic factors. Integrins are major membrane receptors involved in cell matrix adhesion that generate a cascade of intracellular signals, leading to the organization of the actomyosin filaments (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schoenwaelder and Burridge, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Shattil, 2000</xref>). Analysis of such signals indicated that integrins can trigger activation of Rho family GTPases (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Olivo et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, it has been shown that integrins can activate p21PAK and ACK2, two known effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1, very shortly after binding to fibronectin (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). Activation of these effectors is inhibited by expression of a dominant negative form of Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1999</xref>), which also strongly inhibited cell spreading (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Olivo et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, only modest effect on cell spreading was observed with Rac1 dominant negative mutants or by inhibiting RhoA with C3 exoenzyme (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Olivo et al., 2000</xref>). These data clearly indicate that activation of Cdc42 is crucial for integrin-mediated cell spreading on matrix proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to regulation of Cdc42 upon integrin binding to their ligands are still poorly defined.</p>
      <p>Activation of monomeric GTPases is determined by cycling between the GDP- and GTP-bound states. This process is controlled by three major classes of molecules known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>). GEFs induce the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus promoting the activation of the GTPases. Over 30 different GEFs have been described, all of which contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain flanked at the COOH-terminal by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 1994</xref>). Although the DH domain is responsible for the GEF catalytic activity, the PH domain localizes the GEF protein to the plasma membrane where their GTPase substrates reside. Numerous GAPs have also been identified, which increase the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of the GTPase, thus promoting the transition to the inactive GDP-bound state. The third class of GTPase regulators is represented by the GDIs. Only a few of these proteins have been identified to date, and their structure has been solved recently. GDIs form a complex with GTPases sequestering these molecules in the cytoplasm and preventing their membrane association (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Leonard et al., 1992</xref>). The formation of this complex is mediated by the COOH-terminal region of the GDI molecule, which forms a hydrophobic pocket accommodating the GTPase-bound isoprenyl lipid necessary for membrane localization, of the GTPase (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gosser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keep et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Scheffzek et al., 2000</xref>). The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the GDI molecule consists of a flexible arm capable of inhibiting GDP dissociation by binding to the switch I and II domains of the GTPase (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Keep et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Scheffzek et al., 2000</xref>).Thus, activation of a Rho family GTPase likely involves activation of GEFs and the simultaneous inhibition of GDIs and/or GAPs.</p>
      <p>Using the two-hybrid system, we identified a group of proteins capable of binding to the cytoplasmic domain of Î²1-integrin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brancaccio et al., 1999</xref>). Among these, we isolated the integrin cytoplasmic domain associated protein (ICAP-1), which was also isolated by other laboratories using similar baits but different cDNA libraries (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Hemler, 1999</xref>). The data presented here show that overexpression of ICAP-1 strongly reduces the integrin-mediated cell spreading on extracellular matrix and inhibits both Cdc42 and Rac1. In addition, ICAP-1 induces release of Cdc42 from cellular membranes and prevents the dissociation of GDP from this GTPase. Thus, ICAP-1 is a new GTPase regulatory protein endowed with GDI activity and involved in the integrin-mediated actin cytoskeleton regulation during cell matrix adhesion.</p>

        <title>Isolation of ICAP-1 by two-hybrid screening and binding specificity</title>
        <p>To identify proteins able to interact with the Î²1-integrin cytoplasmic domain, we performed an interaction trap approach (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gyuris et al., 1993</xref>). Using the entire Î²1A cytoplasmic region as a bait to screen a cDNA heart neonatal rat library, we isolated three different proteins (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brancaccio et al., 1999</xref>). One of these proteins was found to be the integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein, ICAP-1, isolated recently also in other laboratories by screening of different cDNA libraries (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Hemler, 1999</xref>). ICAP-1 was found to specifically bind to Î²1-integrin but not to Î²2, Î²3, and Î±5. In addition, no binding was observed with the Î²1B and Î²1D isoforms, which differ from Î²1A in the COOH terminus of the protein (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balzac et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Belkin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). To map the amino acid sequences of Î²1 required for binding to ICAP-1, swapping mutants were generated between the Î²1A and Î²1D molecules and tested in the two-hybrid system. The results of these experiments indicate that, although important, the NPXY sequences alone (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>) are not sufficient for ICAP-1 binding (bait Î²1A/D/A in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). In fact, the six amino acid region AVTTVV (878â884) of Î²1A located between the two NPXY motives is required for ICAP-1 binding (bait Î²1D/A/D in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p>

        <title>ICAP-1 inhibits the initial phase of cell spreading</title>
        <p>To test the possible function of ICAP-1, we transiently transfected this molecule in NIH3T3 cells. As detected with our polyclonal antibody, the endogenous level of ICAP-1 was very low in these cells and raised â¼20 times after transfection. Transfected cells were detached from the dish and replated on fibronectin-coated glass to test their ability to adhere and spread. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> , cells expressing ICAP-1 attach to fibronectin, but only 35% Â± 6 spread after 60 min of plating on the coated substratum, whereas 84% Â± 4 of control untransfected cells present in the same sample spread under the same plating conditions. The inhibition of cell spreading by ICAP-1 expression was not the result of a toxic or non specific effect, since cells recover from inhibition and spread normally after overnight incubation on fibronectin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, b). Moreover, expression of a different Î²1 integrin interactor, such as melusin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brancaccio et al., 1999</xref>), did not alter cell adhesion or spreading (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>Interestingly, ICAP-1 effect can be appreciated only when cells were detached and replated on fibronectin. In fact, transient transfection of cell monolayer or microinjection of adherent cells with ICAP-1 constructs did not significantly alter the cell morphology (unpublished data). These data show that inhibition of cell spreading by ICAP-1 is specific and occurs only when cells are replated on fibronectin, suggesting a crucial role of ICAP-1 during the initial phases of cellâmatrix interaction.</p>
        <p>Given that ICAP-1 binds to Î²<sub>1</sub>A but not to Î²<sub>3</sub> and Î²<sub>5</sub> integrin subunits (unpublished data; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>), we wondered whether the ICAP-1 antispreading effect was dependent on integrin Î²<sub>1</sub>A binding. To this purpose, we analyzed spreading of ICAP-1âexpressing NIH3T3 cells on vitronectin, a substrate for Î±<sub>V</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub> and Î±<sub>v</sub>Î²<sub>5</sub>. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> , ICAP-1âexpressing cells spread poorly on vitronectin after 1 h of adhesion. This ICAP-1 inhibitory effect was comparable to that observed on fibronectin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>, compared with <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that in our experimental condition ICAP-1 effect seems not to be dependent on integrin binding.</p>

        <title>ICAP-1 inhibition of cell spreading is reversed by an activated form of Cdc42</title>
        <p>Rho family GTPases regulate the actin organization required for cell adhesion and migration (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nobes and Hall, 1999</xref>). Previous work has shown that transient expression of a Cdc42 dominant negative mutant strongly inhibits cell spreading during adhesion on extracellular matrix (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Olivo et al., 2000</xref>). The fact that expression of ICAP-1 and a dominant negative form of Cdc42 induce a similar phenotype raises the possibility that the two proteins act on the same pathway. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected ICAP-1 with the constitutively activated form of Cdc42, V12Cdc42. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, ICAP-1 induced only a modest inhibitions of cell spreading in cells transiently transfected with V12Cdc42. Similar results were observed in cells stably expressing V12Cdc42 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In these cells, ICAP-1 induced a 1.8â2.7-fold decrease of cell spreading, whereas in control cells it induced much strong response (4-fold decrease; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). These results suggest that Cdc42 acts downstream of ICAP-1 during cell spreading on extracellular matrix.</p>

        <title>ICAP-1 binds and inhibits Cdc42 and Rac1</title>
        <p>Based on the results described above, we tested the possibility that ICAP-1 could regulate the activity of Rho family GTPases. To measure the activation state of Cdc42 and Rac1, the GTP-bound form of these proteins was isolated using the CRIB domain of the effector protein PAK (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sander et al., 1998</xref>). Cells transfected with control vector or ICAP-1 were either maintained in suspension or plated on fibronectin, and cell extracts were processed as described in Materials and methods. COS cells were used in these experiments in order to achieve high level of expression. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, the amount of GTP-bound GTPases is increased upon cell adhesion to fibronectin, indicating that both Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated during cell spreading on fibronectin. However, expression of ICAP-1 in these cells strongly reduced the level of GTP-bound form of both GTPases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To better understand the inhibitory action of ICAP-1 on Cdc42 and Rac1, we performed affinity chromatography experiments to test the ability of these proteins to interact with each other. COS cell extracts were incubated with Sepharose coupled to purified MBPâICAP-1 fusion protein. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, Cdc42 and Rac1 bind to MBPâICAP-1 but not to MBP carrier protein.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, affinity chromatography experiments showed that RhoA did not appreciably bind to MBPâICAP-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). Moreover, we tested the binding of transfected molecules unrelated to GTPases, such as melusin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brancaccio et al., 1999</xref>), or endogenous COS proteins such as p125Fak and paxillin. None of these proteins bind to ICAP-1 (unpublished data), demonstrating the specificity of the interaction with Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases.</p>
        <p>Rho family GTPases are posttranslationally modified in eukaryotic cells by covalent binding of an isoprenyl chain that allows association with cellular membranes to exert their biological activity. To test whether this modification affects binding to ICAP-1, Cdc42-containing extracts were prepared from membrane and cytosol fractions of COS and prokaryotic cells. Maximal binding was observed for Cdc42 extracted from the membrane fraction, whereas binding of Cdc42 from prokaryotic cells was eightfold less efficient, suggesting that isoprenylation is important for this interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D). In addition, the reduced binding of cytosolic Cdc42 to ICAP-1 compared with the membrane Cdc42 fraction is likely due to a preferential binding of cytoplasmic Cdc42 to endogenous Rho-GDI.</p>
        <p>In addition we found that ICAP-1 binds with similar intensity to the GTP or GDP form of Cdc42 (unpublished data).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report that ICAP-1, a protein which binds to the Î²1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, inhibits cell spreading on extracellular matrix substratum by interfering with Cdc42 and Rac1 activation.</p>
      <p>Hemler and coworkers have shown that ICAP-1 can promote Î²1-integrinâdependent cell migration (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Hemler, 1999</xref>). These authors have not analyzed the effect of ICAP-1 on cell spreading on extracellular matrix proteins, but their observation is consistent with our finding that ICAP-1 reduces cell spreading.</p>
      <p>Based on tests detecting effector protein activation, such as p21PAK and ACK2, it has been proposed that cell matrix adhesion causes rapid and transient activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Price et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). On the other hand, during the initial phase of cell spreading RhoA activity is not increased (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 1999</xref>) and might be even inhibited via a src-p190RhoGAP pathway (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arthur et al., 2000</xref>). Although Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate actin polymerization and assembly of protrusive membrane structures, such as filopodia and lamellipodia, necessary for cell spreading and locomotion on the substratum, RhoA is known to promote actin filament assembly in stress fibers and to increase the contractile forces exerted by the actomyosin filaments (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Schoenwaelder and Burridge, 1999</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that inhibition of RhoA during initial phases of cell spreading is necessary to prevent contractile forces that would interfere with the highly dynamic actin-based activity occurring at membrane protrusions during cell adhesion or migration.</p>
      <p>Here, by directly measuring GTP-bound forms we show that adhesion to fibronectin induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac1. Moreover, we report that ICAP-1 binds to both Cdc42 and Rac1 and prevents their activation along with cell spreading. Interestingly, RhoA binds very poorly to ICAP-1 and is not significantly activated during cell adhesion to fibronectin under the experimental conditions used. In addition, the activation state of RhoA triggered by the GEF protein Dbl or LPA treatment is not affected by ICAP-1 expression. Together, these data suggest that ICAP-1 acts as specific regulator of Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases during the initial phases of cell spreading on extracellular matrix protein.</p>
      <p>Rho family GTPases are covalently modified by isoprenylation that is required for their translocation from the cytosol to the cellular membrane where they perform their function (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>). On the other hand, through their isoprenoid moiety these GTPases can interact with GDI molecules that keep them in an inactive cytoplasmic pool (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Regazzi et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, we found that addition of purified ICAP-1 to a membrane fraction induces the release of membrane-bound Cdc42 and that ICAP-1 is able to reduce the release of the guanine nucleotide from Cdc42 in the presence of a known exchange factor such as Dbl. In addition, ICAP-1 was found to bind more strongly to Cdc42 isolated from the membrane fraction than to cytosolic Cdc42 or Cdc42 synthesized in prokaryotic cells where the GTPases cannot be isoprenylated. These properties support the idea that ICAP-1 exert a GDI activity. In our assay conditions, this activity was lower than that of RhoGDI, suggesting that ICAP-1 has distinct and unique properties from a previously characterized GDI. We can hypothesize that ICAP-1 acts only on the limited pool of Cdc42 and Rac1 involved in the turnover of new contact sites, spatially restricted to filopodia and lamellipodia during spreading or migration processes, whereas the remaining pool of Cdc42 could be regulated by other GDI molecules such as RhoGDI.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, comparative sequence analysis indicated an overall homology of 27% between ICAP-1 and RhoGDI (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) and several other members of the GDI family (unpublished data). The homology was particularly striking (34%) in the COOH terminal region spanning from residues 80 to 200. As shown by <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. (2000)</xref>, this region of RhoGDI consists of an immunoglobulin-like domain that binds to the isoprenyl moiety of the GTPase. More interestingly, 60% of the RhoGDI residues shown to be crucial for this interaction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, gray shaded residues) are conserved in the corresponding region of ICAP-1. Moreover, the predicted secondary structure of this region of ICAP-1 is significantly similar to the one determined by crystallography for the RhoGDI as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, these structural homologies are consistent with the ability of ICAP-1 to bind Cdc42 and release it from the membrane. In addition, the amino acid residues 45 and 47 in RhoGDI (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) crucial for the GDI activity and conserved in several GDI molecules are also conserved in ICAP-1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>At present, we do not know whether ICAP-1 has a GDI activity on Rac1, and we cannot definitively conclude whether the inhibition of Rac1 observed with the pull-down PAK assay is due to a direct GDI activity on this GTPase. It is also possible that Rac1 is inhibited as a consequence of Cdc42 inhibition by ICAP-1. It has been proposed that these GTPases can act in cascade, Cdc42 being able to activate Rac1 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>). However, the ability of ICAP-1 to bind Rac1 suggests that ICAP-1 should directly affect Rac1 activity. Further studies are necessary to precisely define the detailed mechanisms of ICAP-1 function on Rac.</p>
      <p>Previous work has shown that integrins can regulate GEF function. GEFs are proteins capable of stimulating the exchange of GDP with GTP, thus increasing the active GTP-bound form of the GTPases. In particular, two GEF molecules, Vav1 and cytohesin1, can be regulated in response to cell matrix adhesion. Vav1 is an exchange factor for Rac1 that can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crespo et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, integrin-mediated cell adhesion was shown to induce Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation in different cell types (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cichowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gotoh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Miranti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yron et al., 1999</xref>). Cytohesin1 is a GEF for ARF, a GTPase known to be involved in the regulation of vesicle traffic in the secretory/endocytic pathway. Recent results have shown that cytohesin1 is crucial in regulating integrin affinity state for the extracellular ligand, a process known as inside/out signaling (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geiger et al., 2000</xref>). Both Vav1 and cytohesin1 are expressed preferentially in hemopoietic cell lineages and are likely to play a major role in this system. Another GEF protein that is likely to play a role in integrin-mediated activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 is PIX (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 1999</xref>). This protein is part of a large complex that includes PAK, NCK, p95PKL, and paxillin. The important role played by paxillin in cell adhesion, and the localization of this complex at focal adhesions (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 1999</xref>) strongly argues for an important role of PIX as a downstream effector in integrin-mediated actin cytoskeleton organization.</p>
      <p>The existence of a GDI protein, like ICAP-1, in the pathway of integrin signaling suggests that during cell matrix adhesion not only GEF should be activated in order to increase the GTP-bound form of the GTPases, but the inhibitory action of the GDI molecule should be released. A hypothetical model can be envisaged in which in cells detached from the matrix, ICAP-1 forms an inhibitory complex with Cdc42 by displacing it from the plasma membrane and preventing the exchange of the GDP for the GTP. Upon interaction with extracellular matrix, ICAP-1 is modified to neutralize its GDI activity. Indeed, it has been shown that ICAP-1 is phosphorylated upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Hemler, 1999</xref>), and it can thus be postulated that this event affects the GDI activity of the protein. In the experimental system used here, ICAP-1 levels are increased several fold over the basal level in consequence of transfection, and thus its inhibition of the Rho family GTPases persists for longer times, causing the delay in cell spreading. The functional significance of ICAP-1 binding to the Î²1-integrin cytoplasmic domain is still to be defined. It is possible that ICAP-1 binds to the integrin cytoplasmic domain to perform other functions such as regulation of integrin affinity as proposed by Block and coworkers (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bouvard and Block, 1998</xref>). Indeed, we did not observe any difference in ICAP-1 effect on cell spreading using two distinct extracellular matrix substrates, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, suggesting that the potential Î²<sub>1</sub>A integrin-mediated control of ICAP-1 function was overcome due to ICAP-1 overexpression levels. However, overexpression approach led us to bring to light the important function of ICAP-1 as a GDI molecule.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, ICAP-1 specifically binds to the Î²1A isoform in the COOH terminal region known to differ among the splicing isoforms (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balzac et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fornaro et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Belkin et al., 1996</xref>). Binding involves the more COOH terminal NPXY motive present in Î²1A integrin cytoplasmic domain (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1997</xref>) and residues immediately upstream (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Interestingly, two isoforms of the Î²1 integrin, Î²1B and Î²1D, that do not bind ICAP-1 are incompetent to support cell spreading and cell migration on fibronectin (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balzac et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Belkin et al., 1997</xref>). These properties are consistent with the hypothesis that binding of ICAP-1 to Î²1 integrin is required to release the inhibitory effect of this protein on Cdc42 and Rac1, thus promoting cell spreading and migration. However, further work is necessary to test this hypothesis.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the data reported here show that ICAP-1, a protein isolated as an interactor of the Î²1-integrin cytoplasmic domain, binds and negatively regulates Cdc42 and Rac1, acting as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. Thus, this protein is a new element, potentially connecting integrin-mediated cell matrix adhesion with regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

        <p>Screening for proteins that interact with cytoplasmic tails of Î²1A was performed as described (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gyuris et al.,1993</xref>). To construct the bait plasmid, DNA sequence encoding amino acids 752â798 of Î²1A was amplified by PCR using primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites on either ends (Î²1A, 5â²-GGAATTCAAGCTTTTAATGA4TAATT-3â² and 5â²-CGGGATCCTCATTTTCCCTCATACTT-3â²) and cloned in pEG 202 vector in frame with LexA coding sequence. This plasmid was unable to activate transcription when cotransformed in EGY48 yeast strain with pSH 18â34 reporter plasmid. The expression of this fusion protein in yeast total protein extracts was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-LexA antibody (a gift from A. Zervos, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL). A cDNA library from heart neonatal rat fused to a galactose-inducible activation domain (a gift from A. Zervos) was transformed in yeast strain EGY48 that already contained pSH 18â34 reporter plasmid and pEG202-Î²1A using a LiAc high efficiency transformation protocol (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gietz et al., 1992</xref>). Primary transformants (2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>) were screened by plating 10<sup>7</sup> colonies on selectable medium lacking Ura, His, Trp, and Leu. Several positive clones were isolated, and their specific binding to integrins was tested by assaying the interaction with control baits such as bicoid, bFGF, cyclin A, and c-Myc (a gift from A.

        <p>To map the ICAP-1 binding site in Î²1A, four swapping mutant constructs of Î²1A and Î²1D cytoplasmic regions were generated by PCR amplification and cloned in frame with LexA sequence in pEG 202.

        <p>To purify the isoprenylated form of Cdc42, a construct encoding for the GST-Cdc42 fusion protein (pCEFL-GST-Cdc42) was transfected in COS cells. 48 h after transfection, 4Ã10<sup>7</sup> cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 TIU aprotinin, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 4 Î¼g/ml pepstatin) with 20 strokes of a 7-ml glass/glass Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,0000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h, the cytosol-containing supernatant was removed, and the crude membrane pellet was solubilized with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 4 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, 0.1 TIU/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM PMSF for 90 min at 4Â°C and then clarified by centrifugation at 10,0000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h.
