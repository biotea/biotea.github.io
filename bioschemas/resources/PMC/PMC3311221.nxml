        <p id="P1">Export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in COPII-coated vesicles occurs at defined sites, which contain the scaffolding protein Sec16. We identify TFG-1, a new conserved regulator of protein secretion that interacts directly with SEC-16 and controls the export of cargoes from the ER in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Hydrodynamic studies indicate that TFG-1 forms hexamers, which facilitate the co-assembly of Sec16 with COPII subunits. Consistent with these findings, TFG-1 depletion leads to a dramatic decline in both SEC-16 and COPII levels at ER exit sites. The amino-terminus of human TFG was identified previously as a fusion partner of two protein kinases, creating a pair of oncogenes. We propose that fusion of these kinases to TFG relocalizes their activities to ER exit sites, where they prematurely phosphorylate substrates during ER export. Our findings provide a mechanism by which translocations involving TFG can result in cellular transformation and oncogenesis.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P2">The trafficking of most secretory cargoes begins with their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In metazoans, cargoes are packaged into vesicles that emerge at defined sites on the ER and ultimately fuse with the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). This process relies on the efficient recruitment of a set of soluble factors known as the COPII coat, which is composed of two multimeric protein complexes (Sec23-Sec24 and Sec13-Sec31) (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A number of rare diseases have been directly linked to perturbations in COPII function, including Craniolenticulosutural dysplasia, in which a mutation in Sec23A leads to impaired collagen export from the ER (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although COPII vesicle formation has been reconstituted with purified coat proteins on synthetic membranes (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), regulators of COPII assembly remain largely unexplored.</p>
      <p id="P3">Of the known COPII interacting proteins, the small GTPase Sar1 and the putative scaffolding protein Sec16 are among the best characterized (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). When activated by the Sec12 exchange factor, Sar1 recruits the Sec23-Sec24 complex, which forms an adaptor layer for Sec13-Sec31 lattice assembly, completing the COPII coat (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Sec23 also functions as a Sar1 activating protein, which is stimulated by Sec31, leading to coat disassembly following vesicle budding (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In contrast to Sar1, which has only been shown to bind Sec23 directly, Sec16 interacts with all COPII coat components, potentially serving as a scaffold for their recruitment (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, Sec16 may stabilize the COPII coat to prevent premature disassembly following activation of the Sec23 GAP (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Surprisingly, few other proteins have been implicated in the regulation of COPII recruitment. Considering the necessity for controlling secretory flux during cell differentiation and development, additional factors that govern this process likely exist, and some may function via direct regulation of Sar1 or Sec16. Here, we report the identification of a new regulator of ER export, which interacts directly with Sec16 and controls COPII subunit accumulation at ER exit sites.</p>

        <title>Identification of SEC-16 interacting proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
        <p id="P4">Based upon the sequence of human Sec16A, we identified a Sec16 homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic> encoded by ZK512.5, which we named <italic>sec-16</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Antibodies directed against SEC-16 recognized a band at the appropriate molecular weight (~135 kD) following immunoblot analysis of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> lysate and were used to immunoprecipitate SEC-16 and associated proteins from detergent-solubilized embryo extracts (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. S1a-S1c</xref>). We conducted solution mass spectrometry to identify 19 proteins that were reproducibly isolated by SEC-16 antibodies, which were individually depleted using RNA interference (RNAi). We found that 7 out of 19 gene products were necessary for embryo production: SEC-16, four COPII subunits (SEC-23, SEC-24.2, SEC-13, and SEC-31), the Sar1 specific GEF SEC-12, and TFG-1 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P5">We focused our attention on the interaction between SEC-16 and TFG-1. Immunoblot analysis of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> lysate using TFG-1 antibodies revealed at least two closely migrating bands immediately below the 75 kD marker, significantly larger than the predicted size of 49.8 kD (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1d</xref>). Similarly, recombinant TFG-1 also exhibited a slow migration on SDS-PAGE (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Analysis of a SEC-16 immunoprecipitate using TFG-1 antibodies confirmed their interaction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), and TFG-1 immunoprecipitation led to an enrichment of SEC-16 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). We also generated recombinant forms of both TFG-1 and SEC-16 and measured their association <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that a GST-fusion to SEC-16, but not GST alone, was capable of binding to recombinant TFG-1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Additionally, we generated polyhistidine-tagged recombinant forms of full-length TFG-1 and two truncations of TFG-1 encoding the amino-terminus (amino acids 1â195) and carboxyl-terminus (amino acids 196â486), and measured their ability to interact with endogenous SEC-16. In a similar fashion to the full-length recombinant protein, the amino-terminal portion of TFG-1 was able to bind to SEC-16, while the carboxyl-terminus did not (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data confirm a direct biochemical association between SEC-16 and TFG-1.</p>

        <title>TFG-1 localizes to ER exit sites with SEC-16</title>
        <p id="P6">To determine whether SEC-16 interacts with TFG-1 at ER exit sites, we examined the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive system, which is enriched for TFG-1 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1e</xref>). TFG-1 antibodies stained punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm of oocytes, 85% of which co-localized with SEC-16 on ER exit sites (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). In many cases, TFG-1 staining extended beyond the puncta labeled with SEC-16 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, see <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>Ã zoom). Using immuno-gold electron microscopy (EM), we further defined the localization of TFG-1 in proximal oocytes to a cloud-like region at ER exit sites that spread to the ERGIC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The high concentration of labeling observed suggested that TFG-1 forms a matrix in this region, which would correspond well to the elevated electron density seen there by EM. Dual immuno-gold labeling with TFG-1 and SEC-13 antibodies indicated that both proteins localize to an identical area next to ER exit sites, although the SEC-13 labeling was more discrete (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We conclude that TFG-1 localizes to ER exit sites with both SEC-16 and COPII machinery.</p>
        <p id="P7">The architecture of ER exit sites was also examined using EM. We found that ER exit sites range in size from 70â150 nm, and always contain coated buds emerging from smooth ER that are directed toward ERGIC and Golgi membranes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. S1f and S1g</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S1</xref>). Electron tomography was used to confirm these findings and provide a high-resolution depiction of COPII vesicle biogenesis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S2</xref>). Consistent with these observations and our data showing that TFG-1 localizes specifically to ER exit sites, we failed to observe co-localization between TFG-1 and the glucuronyl transferase SQV-8, a marker of the cis-medial Golgi (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1h</xref>). Instead, TFG-1 appeared directly adjacent to SQV-8 labeled structures, further illustrating that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, ER exit sites are closely juxtaposed to the Golgi, forming an integrated secretion unit.</p>
        <p id="P8">We next examined the distal region of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, which constitutes a stem cell niche that constitutively requires membrane biosynthesis and secretion (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). ER exit sites in this region were morphologically similar to those seen in the proximal gonad (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis of exit sites in the distal germline revealed a distribution of intensities for both SEC-16 and TFG-1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3c and 3d</xref>). However, the ratio of the fluorescence intensities between SEC-16 and TFG-1 largely did not vary among different ER exit sites, indicating that in wild-type animals, levels of SEC-16 correlated with those of TFG-1, regardless of whether they were high or low (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">To determine localization dependencies between TFG-1 and SEC-16, we depleted each protein using RNAi. Depletion of TFG-1 did not result in a significant decline in the number of SEC-16 labeled ER exit sites (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>). However, the distribution of SEC-16 intensities was dramatically altered under these conditions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The number of exit sites harboring a high level of SEC-16 declined significantly (approximately 30-fold), while the number of low intensity sites increased approximately 2-fold. As the stability of SEC-16 was not diminished following depletion of TFG-1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), these data suggest that TFG-1 controls the abundance of SEC-16 at ER exit sites. Depletion of SEC-16 led to nearly complete loss of puncta labeled by TFG-1, and the few structures that were observed appeared abnormally large and did not co-stain for the COPII component SEC-13 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and our unpublished data). We conclude that TFG-1 requires SEC-16 for its localization, while SEC-16 requires TFG-1 to accumulate normally on ER exit sites.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S5">
        <title>TFG-1 self-associates to form hexamers that regulate proper SEC-16 complex assembly</title>
        <p id="P10">Based on size exclusion chromatography, native SEC-16 and TFG-1 exhibit similar elution profiles, which correspond to globular complexes larger than 800 kD (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Since TFG-1 was amenable to recombinant expression, we measured its Stokes radius (107.8 Ã) and sedimentation value (7.0 S) in the absence of SEC-16 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Based on these data, we calculated the native molecular weight of TFG-1 to be ~318 kD, nearly identical to the predicted mass of a TFG-1 hexamer. Furthermore, we found that the amino-terminus assembled into an octamer, while the carboxyl-terminus formed a dimer (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4c and 4d</xref>). These data suggest that the amino-terminus of TFG-1 mediates its oligomerization, while the carboxyl-terminus may restrict the full-length protein to form hexamers in solution. Since levels of TFG-1 and SEC-16 at ER exit sites co-vary in control animals and loss of TFG-1 leads to diminished accumulation of SEC-16 on ER exit sites, such hexamers of TFG-1 likely play a role in proper SEC-16 complex assembly. Consistent with this idea, depletion of TFG-1 caused a reduction in the Stokes radius of SEC-16 (by ~70 Ã) isolated from whole animals (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Concomitantly, loss of TFG-1 also affected the assembly of complexes containing COPII proteins. Analysis of native SEC-13 by size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the COPII subunit is a component of a large complex (Stokes radius of 128.1 Ã), similar in size to SEC-16 and TFG-1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). In addition, SEC-13 was found in a 54.3 Ã complex, which likely corresponds to a SEC-13-SEC-31 heterotetramer that was described previously (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and as a globular monomer (Stokes radius of 23.9 Ã). However, following TFG-1 depletion, the majority of SEC-13 was found in a monomeric state (Stokes radius of 24.2 Ã), although we continued to detect the COPII subunit in high molecular weight fractions as well. We conclude that the normal assembly of large complexes containing SEC-16 and COPII subunits is facilitated by TFG-1 hexamers.</p>

      <sec id="S6">
        <title>TFG-1 is required for protein secretion</title>
        <p id="P11">We next examined the fate of COPII localization in animals with and without TFG-1. In control animals, the COPII subunit SEC-13 is found in close apposition to SEC-16 labeled exit sites and on the nuclear envelopes of proliferating germ nuclei (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Following depletion of TFG-1, the intensities of both SEC-13 and SEC-16 on punctate structures within the germline declined dramatically, while localization of SEC-13 to the nuclear envelope was largely unaffected (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). By measuring the fluorescence intensities of SEC-13 and SEC-16 in control and TFG-1 depleted animals, we found that their ratio was not altered significantly, indicating that the remaining SEC-16 on ER exit sites can continue to recruit COPII components in the absence of TFG-1, albeit to lower levels (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">To determine whether the substantially reduced levels of SEC-16 and SEC-13 were sufficient to support protein secretion following TFG-1 depletion, we examined several secreted integral membrane proteins. Under steady state conditions in the distal region of the germline, the majority of a GFP fusion to the v-SNARE synaptobrevin (GFP:SNB-1) co-localizes with a mCherry fusion to the PH domain of rat PLC1Î´1 (mCherry:PH), which binds specifically to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>; 18). However, in TFG-1 depleted animals, GFP:SNB-1 accumulated in the ER (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Similarly, we found that several other transmembrane proteins, including the <italic>C. elegans</italic> caveolin-like protein CAV-1 and the glucuronyl transferase SQV-8, which normally traffic to other organelles following synthesis, accumulate in the ER in the absence of TFG-1 (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. S2c and S2d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P13">To further examine the effect of TFG-1 depletion, we used serial section EM. In control animals, ER exit sites were juxtaposed to well-organized stacks of membranes corresponding to the ERGIC and Golgi cisternae (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, left). Vesicles that were 48.2 +/â 1.2 nm (n=15) in diameter were observed throughout the region between the ER and ERGIC. In contrast, subsequent to TFG-1 depletion, ERGIC and Golgi membranes appeared smaller and more poorly stacked, and the ER became fragmented (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, right). In addition, fewer Golgi networks were observed overall. However, consistent with our findings that reduced levels of SEC-16 at ER exit sites can continue to recruit COPII following depletion of TFG-1, we identified vesicles that were 48.8 +/â 0.7 nm (n=39) in diameter between the ER and the ERGIC. Although the sizes of vesicles were not affected by TFG-1 depletion, their distribution was altered. The majority of vesicles observed accumulated close to the ER and failed to migrate toward the ERGIC and Golgi membranes. These data suggest that TFG-1 is required for the efficient, directed movement of COPII vesicles away from the ER, but not for their initial formation.</p>
        <p id="P14">We also generated animals that stably express a GFP fusion to the Golgi Rab-type GTPase RAB-6, which mediates retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, to study perturbations resulting from TFG-1 depletion. Since RAB-6 also cycles between the Golgi and early endosomes (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we co-expressed a mCherry fusion to the early endosome marker RAB-5, to allow us to distinguish between endosome- and Golgi-associated RAB-6. In control animals, RAB-5 and RAB-6 exhibited distinct localizations in the distal region of the germline (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2e</xref>). However, following depletion of either SEC-16 or TFG-1, RAB-6 accumulated on fewer, large punctate structures in the germline that also harbored RAB-5, suggesting that RAB-6 localization was shifted from the Golgi to enlarged early endosomes (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2e</xref>). These data further support the idea that TFG-1 depletion leads to a defect in normal Golgi assembly.</p>

        <title>Human TFG localizes to ER exit sites and interacts with Sec16</title>
        <p id="P15"><italic>C. elegans</italic> TFG-1 has a single human homolog, previously annotated TFG (for TRK-fused gene; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>). We generated a GFP fusion to full-length TFG and co-transfected it into HeLa cells with a mCherry fusion to human Sec16B to measure co-localization. Analysis of cells expressing both markers indicated that greater than 90% of GFP:TFG labeled puncta also contained mCherry:Sec16B (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). These data demonstrate that analogous to <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFG-1, human TFG functions at ER exit sites.</p>
        <p id="P16">We next examined the dynamics of Sec16B relative to TFG using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Similar to GFP:Sec16A (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), we found that only a fraction (56.8 +/â 6.3%) of the fluorescence of mCherry:Sec16B recovered following photobleaching, with a half-time of 5.68 +/â 0.34 seconds. In contrast, a smaller proportion of GFP:TFG recovered (33.6 +/â 5.1%), which exhibited a longer half-time of 8.22 +/â 0.64 seconds (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6b and 6c</xref>). These data indicate that Sec16B and TFG are not loaded onto exit sites simultaneously and instead suggest that they assemble onto ER exit sites via distinct mechanisms.</p>
        <p id="P17">Similar to our findings with <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFG-1, endogenous human TFG exhibited a large Stokes radius (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>), and a recombinant form of its amino-terminus (amino acids 1â193) assembled as an octamer with a native molecular weight of 172 kD (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6e and 6f</xref>). Thus, human TFG and <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFG-1 share multiple physical properties, which suggest they share a common function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this idea, depletion of TFG caused a substantial delay in the secretion of VSVG(ts045)-GFP, a type I transmembrane protein used widely to study the mammalian secretory pathway (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">To determine whether human TFG binds to Sec16, we transfected cells stably expressing mCherry:Sec16B with either a GFP fusion to full length TFG or its amino-terminus, and conducted immunoprecipitations using mCherry antibodies. We found that endogenous TFG was recovered under these conditions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). Additionally, we found that both GFP-tagged isoforms were able to bind to mCherry:Sec16B (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). These data support the idea that the amino-terminus of TFG interacts with Sec16 in an evolutionarily conserved manner.</p>

        <title>Mistargeting of the NTRK1 kinase domain to ER exit sites causes the hyperactivation of downstream NTRK1 effectors and cell transformation</title>
        <p id="P19">TFG was initially identified as part of a gene fusion with the receptor tyrosine kinase NTRK1 (also called TrkA), resulting in the formation of an oncogene (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that TFG is also a fusion partner of the receptor tyrosine kinase ALK in some anaplastic large cell lymphomas (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In both instances, the amino-terminus of TFG is fused to the carboxyl-terminus of the other gene, resulting in an oncogenic product. We found that the amino-terminal domain of TFG localizes to ER exit sites and is capable of redirecting the carboxyl-terminal domain of NTRK1 there as well (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7a-7d</xref>). These data suggest a role for TFG in targeting the kinase activites of NTRK1 and ALK to ER exit sites.</p>
        <p id="P20">NTRK1 is a high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Binding of NGF to NTRK1 leads to its dimerization and autophosphorylation, ultimately causing the activation of several downstream signaling cascades, including the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, to promote cell survival and growth (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The oncogenic TFG-NTRK1 fusion protein is constitutively active (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and expression of GFP-TFG-NTRK1 in hTERT-RPE1 cells caused an increase in the levels of phospho-ERK1 and -ERK2, as compared to control cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). To determine whether dimerization of the kinase domain is sufficient to initiate signaling downstream of NTRK1, we linked the constitutive dimer GST to NTRK1 and expressed it as a GFP fusion in hTERT-RPE1 cells. Under these conditions, levels of phospho-ERK1 and -ERK2 increased by only 2-fold as compared to control cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). These data indicate that dimerization of the NTRK1 kinase domain alone is not adequate to cause the hyperactivation of its downstream effectors as is observed following TFG-NTRK1 expression.</p>
        <p id="P21">As suggested earlier, an alternative mechanism by which fusion to TFG may cause oncogenic NTRK1 activity is through its mislocalization to ER exit sites. Therefore, we tested the effect of targeting the NTRK1 kinase domain to exit sites independently of TFG. We fused a region of Sec16B (amino acids 1â791), which localizes to ER exit sites similarly to the full length protein, to NTRK1 and expressed it as a GFP fusion in hTERT-RPE1 cells (GFP:Sec16B-NTRK). Hydrodynamic analysis of a portion of this region in Sec16B (amino acids 34â234) indicated that it oligomerizes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). GFP:Sec16B-NTRK1 localized to ER exit sites (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>), and expression of this fusion protein resulted in hyperactivation of ERK1 and ERK2, similar to the effect following GFP-TFG-NTRK1 expression (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). We conclude that targeting of the NTRK1 kinase domain to ER exit sites is necessary for its constitutive activity in cells.</p>
        <p id="P22">To test whether the ER exit site-targeting of NTRK1 was sufficient to transform cells, we generated NIH3T3 cell lines expressing either GFP, GFP:GST-NTRK1, GFP:TFG-NTRK1, or GFP:Sec16B-NTRK1. Cells expressing the ER exit site-targeted forms of NTRK1 produced at least 8-fold more colonies than the dimerized form of NTRK1 (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4c</xref>). These data indicate that localization of NTRK1 to ER exit sites strongly contributes its ability to transform cells.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P23">We have demonstrated that TFG-1 localizes to ER exit sites and is required for protein secretion in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. Additionally, we have found that TFG-1 accumulates at ER exit sites in several other tissues, including the intestine, hypodermis, and muscle (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>), suggesting a common role in multiple cell types. We further demonstrate that human TFG functions at ER exit sites and likely regulates the secretion of multiple cargoes. Consistent with this idea, overexpression of human TFG has been shown to partially rescue the trafficking defect of mutant F508del-CFTR, which aberrantly accumulates in the ER in cystic fibrosis patients (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Since levels of TFG-1 at ER exit sites appear to correlate with levels of SEC-16 and COPII, additional TFG-1 may increase COPII recruitment and stimulate secretion from the ER (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P24">Based on our data, we speculate that TFG family members generate a matrix at ER exit sites, which may serve as a molecular sink to help retain COPII components locally and facilitate efficient vesicle formation and egress. The increased membrane flux mediated by TFG-1 may also function to maintain proper Golgi organization in tissues under a high secretory demand, such as the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. Together, our findings reveal a new component of the early secretory pathway that regulates anterograde trafficking from the ER.</p>
      <p id="P25">Furthermore, our studies also provide a key insight into the mechanism by which TFG functions as a proto-oncogene. In the case of the TFG-NTRK1 fusion generated by a chromosomal translocation, concentrating constitutive NTRK1 kinase activity at ER exit sites may cause to the premature stimulation of multiple effectors, including components of the ERK1-ERK2 kinase cascade, which leads to cell transformation. Notably, stimulation of ERK2 at ER exit sites may cause hyper-phosphorylation of Sec16, resulting in the formation of new exit sites that would recruit additional TFG-NTRK1 (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Such a feed-forward mechanism may play an important role during oncogenesis.</p>

The antibodies were affinity purified from serum by binding to columns of the same antigens following removal of the GST tags by cleavage with Prescission protease. To produce SEC-13 specific monoclonal antibodies, 10 mice were each immunized with 50 Î¼g of purified GST-SEC-13 fusion protein in PBS using complete Freundâs adjuvant. Hybridoma fusions were generated following booster injections and subsequently screened by ELISA according to standard protocols. Mouse monoclonal SEC-13 antibodies were purified via Protein-A Sepharose beads. Antibodies directed against human TFG were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (A302-341A and A302-343A).

        <p id="P27">Images were acquired on a swept field confocal microscope (Nikon Ti-E) equipped with a Roper CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera using a Nikon 60X, 1.4NA Planapo oil objective lens. Acquisition parameters were controlled by Nikon Elements software, and image analysis was conducted using Metamorph software. Immunofluorescence of fixed gonads was performed as described previously (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) using directly labeled rabbit antibodies at a concentration of 1 Î¼g/mL. Briefly, 60â120 Z sections at 0.2 Î¼m steps were acquired (depending on sample thickness). The fluorescence intensity of each ER exit site was always confined to a maximum of seven Z planes, which were used to generate a maximum intensity projection. To calculate the fluorescence intensity of proteins that localize to ER exit sites, the total intensity in a box containing the ER exit site (from a maximum intensity projection) was measured and the camera background was subtracted. For live imaging of <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonads, animals were anesthetized and mounted on an agarose pad. HeLa cells were grown on 35-mm glass bottom dishes maintained at 37Â°C for time-lapse imaging. Photobleaching was performed using a 405-nm laser, coupled into a Nikon Photo Activation Illuminator Unit to create a single diffraction limited spot. The signal at the first post-bleach time point was subtracted from all post-bleach measurements, and the percentage of fluorescence recovered at each time point was calculated by dividing by the difference between the pre-bleach and first post-bleach measurements. Kaleidagraph software was used to fit the data and calculate the maximal fractional recovery and the half-time for recovery. To determine the percent co-localization between two proteins, ER exit sites were analyzed individually using Nikon Elements software.

        <p>(a) Schematic representation of human and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Sec16 isoforms. The central conserved domain (CCD) is highlighted in each protein. (b) SEC-16 was immunoprecipitated from <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo extract and blotted with Î±-TFG-1 antibodies (n=3). A mock IP was conducted in parallel using rabbit IgG. (c) TFG-1 was immunoprecipitated from <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo extract and blotted with Î±-SEC-16 antibodies (n=3). A mock IP was conducted in parallel using rabbit IgG. (d) GST alone and GST-tagged full length SEC-16 were immobilized on glutathione agarose beads, which were incubated with an extract generated from <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing recombinant TFG-1. Following a series of washes, proteins were eluted using reduced glutathione, separated by SDS-PAGE, and either stained using Coomassie (top) or immunoblotted using TFG-1 antibodies (bottom). (e) Polyhistidine-tagged full length and truncated forms of TFG-1, either encoding amino acids 1â195 (TFG-1<sup>(N)</sup>) or 196â486 (TFG-1<sup>(C)</sup>), were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> onto nickel affinity resin and incubated with freshly prepared whole worm extract (n=3). Imidazole eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie (top), and blotted with Î±-SEC-16 antibodies (bottom).

        <title>TFG-1 localizes to ER exit sites that are juxtaposed to the Golgi</title>
        <p>(a) Dissected <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonads were fixed and stained using Cy2-labeled Î±-TFG-1 and Cy3-labeled Î±-SEC-16 antibodies (n=8). Both individual and merged images of proximal oocytes with TFG-1 in green and SEC-16 in red are shown (Bar, 10 Î¼m). The upper right image is the boxed area in the panel below magnified 6Ã (Bar, 2 Î¼m). Also shown is a schematic of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive system, which includes a syncytial stem cell niche in the distal gonad (boxed region in light green) and proximal oocytes that have undergone cellularization (boxed region in dark green). (b and c) Lowicryl sections of <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes were stained with antibodies against TFG-1 or a combination of TFG-1 and SEC-13 antibodies. Arrows highlight Golgi cisternae. Large arrowheads point out 15 nm gold particles associated with immunoreactive TFG-1, and small arrowheads highlight 5 nm gold particles associated with SEC-13. Bars, 100 nm. An inset is provided in panel c to clearly show the distribution of 5 nm particles at higher magnification (Inset bar, 15 nm). In addition, a three-dimensional reconstruction of TFG-1 immunolocalization is shown. The image was generated using the software Reconstruct from serial 50 nm thin sections. Vesicles were reconstructed using the sphere setting, and all other components (ER, ERGIC, coats, Golgi stacks) were generated using the Boissonnat surface setting. Light grey: ER; dark grey: COPII coat; orange: ER-derived transport vesicles and ERGIC; red, green and blue: Golgi cisternae; from cis to trans, respectively. (d) An electron micrograph illustrating two ER exit sites and adjacent Golgi complexes in the proximal most oocyte of an animal following high pressure freezing and freeze substitution (Bar, 500 nm). On the right is a three-dimensional reconstruction of the same pair of Golgi complexes and associated ER exit sites. The ER exit sites are surrounded by vesicles that fuse to form the ERGIC. Light grey: ER; dark grey: COPII coat; orange: ER-derived transport vesicles and ERGIC; yellow, red and blue: Golgi cisternae; from cis to trans, respectively.</p>

        <p>(a) In the proximal gonad, a 300 nm section of the early secretory pathway (ER exit sites, ERGIC, and Golgi) was analyzed by electron tomography. ER exit sites are highlighted by arrowheads. On the left are individual sections from the tomographic stack. On the right are two orthogonal views of the tomogram following three-dimensional reconstruction. Light grey: ER; black: COPII coat; orange and yellow: ER-derived transport vesicles and ERGIC; green, red, blue: Golgi cisternae; diffuse grey: not further resolvable matrix. Bar, 100 nm. (b) An electron micrograph illustrating ER exit sites and adjacent Golgi complexes in the distal gonad following high pressure freezing and freeze substitution. An arrowhead highlights the presence of budding vesicle from smooth ER (Bar, 100 nm). Below is a three-dimensional construction of the same Golgi complexes and associated ER exit sites. (c) Dissected gonads from control, TFG-1 depleted, and SEC-16 depleted animals were fixed and stained using Cy2-labeled Î±-TFG-1 and Cy3-labeled Î±-SEC-16 antibodies. Individual and merged images of the distal gonad with TFG-1 in green and SEC-16 in red are shown (Bar, 10 Î¼m). (d) Fluorescence intensity of SEC-16 in the distal gonad was measured in control and TFG-1 depleted animals, and intensities were segregated into low, medium and high thresholds. To establish individual thresholds, a histogram of fluorescence intensities was equally divided into three regions, and the number of ER exit sites within each area was calculated. The bar graph indicates the percentage of all ER exit sites that fall into a specific threshold. For each condition, at least 1000 unique ER exit sites were examined. Error bars represent mean +/â SEM; 10 different animals. **p &lt; 0.01 compared with control, calculated using a paired <italic>t</italic> test. (e) Western blots of extracts prepared from animals depleted of TFG-1 by RNAi (n=3). Serial dilutions of extracts prepared from control animals were loaded to quantify depletion levels. Blotting with Î±-CAR-1 antibodies was performed to control loading.</p>

        <p>The results presented in each panel are representative of at least three individual experiments performed. In all cases, the intensities of each band were measured to identify the peak elution fraction, which was used to calculate either a Stokes radius or sedimentation value, depending on the experiment. (a) Western blots using SEC-16 antibodies (top) or TFG-1 antibodies (bottom) of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo extract fractionated on a Superose 6 gel filtration column. The peaks corresponding to SEC-16 and TFG-1 partially overlap. A Stokes radius was calculated for each protein based on comparison with the elution profiles of known standards. (b-d) Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged TFG-1 or fragments of TFG-1 described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref> were expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts using nickel resin. A Coomassie stained gel of the peak elution fractions after fractionation of the recombinant proteins on a Superose 6 gel filtration column are shown (top). Proteins were fractionated on a 10â30% glycerol gradient (bottom), and S-values were calculated based on the location of characterized standards run on a parallel gradient. (e) Western blots of control and TFG-1 depleted <italic>C. elegans</italic> whole worm extracts fractionated on a Superose 6 gel filtration column and probed with SEC-16 antibodies (top) or SEC-13 antibodies (middle panels). Fractionation of HGRS-1, a component of the ESCRT-0 complex, was examined in both control and TFG-1 depleted conditions (bottom panels), to ensure gel filtration profiles were directly comparable. Stokes radii were calculated for each protein based on comparison with the elution profiles of known standards.</p>
