      <abstract>
        <p>Repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells primarily occurs by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which requires seven core proteins (Ku70/Ku86, DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit), Artemis, XRCC4-like factor (XLF), XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV). Here we show using combined affinity purification and mass spectrometry that DNA-PKcs co-purifies with all known core NHEJ factors. Furthermore, we have identified a novel evolutionary conserved protein associated with DNA-PKcsâc9orf142. Computer-based modelling of c9orf142 predicted a structure very similar to XRCC4, hence we have named c9orf142âXLS (XRCC4-like small protein). Depletion of c9orf142/XLS in cells impaired DSB repair consistent with a defect in NHEJ. Furthermore, c9orf142/XLS interacted with other core NHEJ factors. These results demonstrate the existence of a new component of the NHEJ DNA repair pathway in mammalian cells.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are among the most cytotoxic DNA lesions for mammalian cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Effective repair of DSBs is essential for cellular survival and for suppression of potential deleterious chromosomal rearrangements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Two main DNA repair pathways eliminate DSBsâhomologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR utilises an undamaged copy of the chromosome as a template to direct repair, thus this restricts HR to the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, when such an extra chromosome copy is available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> NHEJ performs the bulk of DSB repair in mammalian cells and in particular in during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where the cells are completely dependent on NHEJ. NHEJ can be further subdivided into so-called classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) and alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> These DNA repair pathways utilise distinct protein components and also show different efficiencies of end ligation. In general, c-NHEJ is much more effective in end ligation than alt-NHEJ and can ligate most unrelated DNA ends directly or with minimal processing. In contrast alt-NHEJ requires short microhomologies between the DNA ends for ligation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> C-NHEJ requires the following seven core proteins: Ku70/Ku86 dimers, DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit), Artemis nuclease, XRCC4-like factor (XLF) and the XRCC4/ligase IV complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The DSB repair during c-NHEJ is initiated by the Ku dimer that senses the presence of free double-stranded DNA ends in cells and rapidly binds such ends with high affinity. DNA-bound Ku then recruits DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcs/Ku70/Ku86 complex is termed DNA-PK holoenzyme), which has a protein kinase activity and is required for activation of the nuclease Artemis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Artemis, in turn, is responsible for DNA end processing in order to achieve DNA end structures suitable for ligation. The final step of c-NHEJ is the ligation of processed DNA ends by XRCC4/ligase IV complex. This final step is stimulated by XLF protein that interacts with XRCC4 forming long filamentous structures at DSBs to facilitate DNA end joining.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> XRCC4 and XLF factors are distinct among NHEJ factors in that they share similar tertiary structure but show low primary sequence conservation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Since the identification of XLF in 2006, no new core factors have been discovered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Importantly, c-NHEJ is essential for proper development, as mutations in this pathway lead to immunodeficiency and defective neurogenesis in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> It is therefore essential to fully decipher the identity of components for the c-NHEJ pathway and their regulation.</p>
    <p>In this study, proteomic analysis of DNA-PKcs-containing protein complexes identified an abundant previously uncharacterised protein c9orf142, which we have named c9orf142âXLS (XRCC4-like small protein). Structural modelling predicts XLS to be highly similar to XRCC4 and XLF, and depletion of XLS delays ionising radiation (IR)-induced DNA DSB repair. Moreover, XLS is associated with other core c-NHEJ factors. Our data strongly suggest that c9orf142/XLS represents a novel c-NHEJ component in mammalian cells.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>To identify and characterise novel DNA-PKcs-interacting proteins, we have generated a HEK293 cell line stably expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged DNA-PKcs at physiological expression levels. Diluted nuclear extracts from these cells were subject to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by FLAG peptide elution and analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs contained several visible protein bands compared with control samples including 70 and 85âkDa species, presumably corresponding to Ku70/Ku86 subunits of the DNA-PK holoenzyme. Immunoblotting of eluates from control and FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs identified all known core NHEJ components (Ku70/Ku86, Artemis, DNA Ligase IV, XRCC4 and XLF) specifically in FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Cellular DNA damage induced by IR is known to affect the stability of various DNA repair complexes by eliciting activation of stress signalling pathways, which catalyse many protein post-translational modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Therefore, further experiments were performed under basal conditions or after exposing samples to IR. In order to assess the effect that contaminating DNA had on complex assembly, additional samples were treated with ethidium bromide (EtBr) before elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Although IR did not show obvious visible changes to the distribution of silver-stained bands, EtBr led to disappearance of several prominent protein bands including the 70- and 85-kDa species, which we believe represent both Ku proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Western blotting of core NHEJ factors revealed that Artemis directly interacted with DNA-PKcs as shown previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> All other core NHEJ proteins interacted with DNA-PKcs in a DNA-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Interestingly, IR significantly increased the abundance of XLF and XRCC4/DNA ligase IV factors associated with DNA-PKcs, whereas the levels of Ku70/Ku86 and Artemis remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We reasoned that based upon our ability to detect all known core NHEJ factors in the FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs, it is possible that we may also detect previously uncharacterised core NHEJ components. To systematically analyse the protein composition of FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs, eluates were analysed by mass spectrometry to determine their proteomic composition. This proteomic analysis revealed the presence of large amounts of Ku proteins associated with DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and d</xref>). The other most abundant proteins were PARP1, the FACT complex (SP16H and SSRP1) Werner protein (WRN) and protein phosphatase 6 regulatory subunit 3 (PP6R3) as previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Importantly, we also found substantial quantities of a previously uncharacterised protein c9orf142 consistently co-purifying with FLAG-DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a, b and d</xref>), which we have named XLS. Notably, compared with other core NHEJ factors, XLS was greater than fourfold, more abundant than XRCC4, XLF, DNA ligase IV and Artemis in the FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs, and its levels were not increased in response to radiation in contrast to XRCC4, XLF and DNA ligase IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2d</xref>). The presence of XLS in DNA-PKcs IPs was verified by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These results also demonstrated that XLS associated with DNA-PKcs in a DNA-dependent manner, although interestingly the concentration of EtBr required for stripping XLS from the beads was significantly lower than the amount of EtBr needed for complete removal of Ku factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
      <p>We were intrigued by the high relative abundance of XLS in our DNA-PKcs IPs. Although primary sequence analysis of XLS did not reveal significant similarities to any known proteins, computer-based structural modelling using the Phyre2 algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> revealed a structure of high similarity to XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). It also showed structural resemblance to XLF, a known XRCC4 interactor, that forms filament-like structures with XRCC4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Although XLS is significantly smaller that XRCC4 (204 aa compared with 334 aa), it maintains similar overall predicted domain structure characterised by the presence of a N-terminal head domain followed by a centrally located extended coiled coil and a C-terminal predicted bipartite nuclear localisation sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The Phyre2 algorithm modelled amino acids 8â160 of XLS (ca. 75% of the full-length XLS) with high confidence (ca. 95%). However, the C-terminal portion of XLS (aa 161â204) could not be modelled with high confidence and hence remained unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Modelling results obtained with the use of Phyre2 server were confirmed by subjecting XLS sequences to I-TASSER computer modelling platform (data not shown). The primary sequence of XLS is strongly phylogenetically conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) with surprisingly high-sequence conservation in the C-terminal region of XLS, which might suggest essential functional and/or regulatory roles for this region of the protein. Evolutionary conservation of XLS structure can be further exemplified by its comparison with coral XLS orthologue. Although conservation of the protein sequence between the human and coral XLS is low (ca. 20% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), the model for the coral XLS orthologue generated using the Phyre2 algorithm also predicted with high confidence similarity to XRCC4 (ca. 95% model confidence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>
      <p>The high relative abundance of XLS in DNA-PKcs IPs and its predicted striking structural similarity to XRCC4 led us to hypothesise that XLS may be involved in DSB repair. In order to assess the function of XLS, we first depleted XLS (and XRCC4 as a reference) using siRNA in two human cell types and observed efficient knockdown of XLS in both cell lines by qPCR and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). A typical phenotype of the NHEJ pathway deficiency is cellular radiosensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Notably, knockdown of XLS in cells produced a radiosensitivity phenotype similar to depletion of XRCC4 measured by clonogenic survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). To further establish similarity between XLS function and the activity of core NHEJ factors, we took advantage of the observation that XLF-deficient cells show substantially delayed resolution of histone H2AX phosphorylation after radiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> We therefore assessed the kinetics of histone H2AX phosphorylation after IR in XLS-depleted cells. Knockdown of XLS delayed the disappearance of histone H2AX phosphorylation after IR consistent with defective DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In order to confirm the DSB repair defect, we directly scored the repair kinetics of DSBs in XLS-depleted cells by visualisation of nuclear foci stained for phospho-Ser139-H2AX mark, a known DSB marker in eukaryotic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Depleting XLS led to a strong reduction in overall efficiency of DSB repair in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), closely resembling the previously reported phenotype of a human XLF mutant cell line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Collectively, these deficiencies in DSB repair suggest a defect in NHEJ.</p>
      <p>To gain further evidence for XLS being a component of NHEJ, FLAG-tagged XLS was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of HEK293S cells and IPs were probed for the presence of core NHEJ factors. Importantly, although XLS co-purified with DNA-PK subunits, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV, treatment of cells with IR led to substantial increases in XRCC4/Ligase IV in FLAG-XLS IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Historically most c-NHEJ factors have been discovered through complementation experiments, in which previously isolated mutant cell lines served as a critical starting point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> A notable exception was the discovery of DNA ligase IV, which was found as a XRCC4-associated protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> and the discovery of XLF by the Jackson group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> through a two-hybrid approach. Here we have shown that immunoaffinity purification coupled with proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry can be successfully applied to identify new c-NHEJ proteins using a known NHEJ factor as bait (DNA-PKcs in this instance). However, this method is not without caveats. For example, although we could detect Artemis nuclease in our FLAG-DNA-PKcs IPs, the overall yield of Artemis was comparatively low, thereby making it technically challenging to discover Artemis in an unbiased fashion among other proteins of low abundance present in the complex. This is in striking contrast to our discovery of c9orf142/XLS that robustly co-purified with DNA-PKcs and was consistently observed among the most abundant proteins detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and d</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we have demonstrated that c9orf142/XLS is a new factor required for DSB repair in mammalian cells. Besides core proteins, the c-NHEJ DNA repair pathway uses additional so-called accessory factors (e.g., APLF (aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase-like factor) protein and NR4A orphan receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>). These proteins typically serve to increase the efficiency of c-NHEJ without being absolutely essential. It appears possible that XLS represents a genuine core factor for c-NHEJ rather than an accessory molecule. This hypothesis is based on the observation that XLS is structurally similar to both XRCC4 and XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Notably depletion of XLS produces a strong DSB repair defect and increased radiosensitivity, features uncommon for accessory NHEJ factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> However, more definitive proof for XLS being considered a core factor for c-NHEJ is nevertheless required. Other hallmarks of c-NHEJ deficiency include a shift in DSB repair to microhomology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> and a defect in somatic VDJ recombination in lymphocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> With regard to VDJ recombination, it will be essential to assess the efficiency of this process in XLS knockout mice or potential human patients bearing inactivating mutations in the XLS-encoding gene. Precisely, how XLS functions within the c-NHEJ complex remains to be established. Understanding the pattern of XLS interactions among the c-NHEJ components will be important in deciphering its function in DSB repair. Accordingly, it is intriguing to note that, based on the relative abundance of c-NHEJ factors in our DNA-PKcs IPs, it is interesting to speculate whether XLS may be directly bound to DNA-PKcs or via Ku, as only Ku factors are present in large enough quantities to mediate the bridging of XLS to DNA-PKcs. Given that interaction of XLS with DNA-PKcs is DNA dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), it is more likely that XLS binds Ku subunits and/or DNA directly. Interestingly, FLAG-XLS co-purified with other c-NHEJ core factors, consistent with XLS being a core NHEJ component. Clearly, more experimental work needs to be done using XLS-deficient cells to draw a definitive conclusions regarding exact contribution of this protein to mammalian DSB repair.</p>
      <p>While this manuscript was under preparation, another group reported the discovery of c9orf142 as a novel c-NHEJ factor. Although their functional data largely overlap with ours, their discovery of c9orf142 occurred through application of bioinformatics- and structure-guided approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p>

LC-MS data were processed and searched using Waters ProteinLynx Global SERVER version 3.0 (PLGS, Waters) and identified, using the UniProt Human reviewed database (UniProtKB release 2014_11, 20265 entries). Raw data files were analysed using PLGS version 3 and ISOQuant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> These data were used for âtop 3' absolute quantification of proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> For database searching in PLGS, peptide mass tolerance and fragment mass tolerance were set to auto, with one missed cleavage and variable modification for methionine oxidation. A false-discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was used for PLGS and for ISOQuant analysis an FDR of 0.1% was used with only TOP 3 peptide hits used for quantification.
