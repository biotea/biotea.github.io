        <p id="P1">Zinc-finger (ZF) transcriptional repressor Gfi-1 plays an important role in hematopoiesis and inner ear development, and also functions as an oncoprotein that cooperates with c-Myc in lymphomagenesis. Gfi-1 represses transcription by directly binding to conserved sequences in the promoters of its target genes. <italic>CDKN1A</italic> encoding p21<sup>Cip1</sup> has been identified as a Gfi-1 target gene and shown to contain Gfi-1 binding sites in the upstream promoter region. We show here that Gfi-1 represses <italic>CDKN1A</italic> in a manner that is independent of its DNA binding activity. Gfi-1 interacts with POZ-ZF transcription factor Miz-1, originally shown to be a c-Myc interacting partner, and via Miz-1 binds to <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter. Interestingly, Gfi-1 and c-Myc, through Miz-1, form a ternary complex on the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter, and act in collaboration to repress <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. Gfi-1 knockdown results in enhanced levels of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and attenuated cell proliferation. Notably, similar to c-Myc, the expression of Gfi-1 is downregulated by TGFÎ² and the level of Gfi-1 influences the response of cell to the cytostatic effect of TGFÎ². Our data reveal an important mechanism by which Gfi-1 regulates cell proliferation and may also have implications for understanding the role of Gfi-1 in lymphomagenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Growth factor independence 1 (Gfi-1) is a nuclear transcriptional repressor that is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), lymphoid and granulocytic cells as well as nonhematopoietic tissues, including lung, sensory epithelia, neuronal precursors and the developing epithelia of the inner ear (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Moroy, 2005</xref>). In hematopoietic system, Gfi-1 is required for granulocytic differentiation, and plays an important role in T and B cell development, and in the maintenance of stem cell functional integrity. Gfi-1<sup>â/â</sup> mice lack mature neutrophils and have reduced numbers of mature T and B cells (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Hock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Karsunky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002b</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). HSCs from Gfi-1<sup>â/â</sup> mice show elevated proliferation and are functionally impaired in long-term repopulation and serial transplantation assays (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In nonhematpoietic tissues, Gfi-1 has been shown to regulate the development of inner ear hair cells, lung neuroendocrine cells and intestinal epithelium (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Kazanjian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Shroyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Wallis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P3">Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant activation of Gfi-1 may lead to oncogenesis. The <italic>Gfi-1</italic> locus was first identified as a provirus integration site that rendered Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced T cell lymphoma lines independent of interleukin 2 (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Gilks <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Overexpression of Gfi-1 was later found to inhibit apoptosis and override cell cycle arrest induced by growth factor withdrawal (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Grimes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996b</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Karsunky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Rodel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Transgenic mice that overexpress Gfi-1 in T cells are weakly predisposed to lymphoma, and combinatorial activation of Gfi-1 and Myc or Pim-1 leads to accelerated development of lymphoma (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Scheijen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Zornig <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). These results indicate that Gfi-1 is a weak oncoprotein, but cooperates with Myc and Pim-1 in lymphomagenesis. Additionally, Gfi-1 may play a role in the development of lung and prostate cancers (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dwivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Kazanjian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P4">Gfi-1 consists of a 20 amino acid N-terminal SNAG domain, a middle portion and 6 C-terminal zinc fingers (ZFs). The transcriptional repression activity of Gfi-1 is dependent on the integrity of its N-terminal SNAG domain (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Grimes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>). Gfi-1 represses transcription by directly binding to the consensus DNA sequence AATC through the C-terminal ZFs. An asparagine-to-serine substitution in the fifth ZF of Gfi-1 (N382S), identified in patients with severe congenital neutropenia, abolishes the DNA binding activity and the N382S mutant acts in a dominant negative (DN) manner (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Person <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Transcriptional repression by Gfi-1 involves recruitment, through its different domains, of corepressors and histone modifying enzymes, including eight-twenty-one (ETO), CoREST, histone demethylase LSD1, histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2, and the histone lysine methyltransferase G9a (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Duan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Grimes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">McGhee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Saleque <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P5">Little is known about how Gfi-1 regulates cell cycle progression and survival. <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, which encodes the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, has been identified as a Gfi-1 target gene. Gfi-1 was shown to bind to the upstream sequences in the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter and repress transcription through recruiting HDAC1 and G9a (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Duan andHorwitz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Duan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Indeed, overexpression of Gfi-1 antagonized p21<sup>Cip1</sup> upregulation by phorbol ester in Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Karsunky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the level of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> is increased in mouse Gfi1<sup>â/â</sup> T cells (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Pargmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, unlike T cells, deficiency of Gfi-1 in mouse HSCs leads to reduced expression of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Hock <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>)]. It remains to be determined whether p21<sup>Cip</sup> downregulation in Gfi1<sup>â/â</sup> HSCs results directly from Gfi-1 deficiency or rather is an indirect event. Irrespectively, these results indicate that the effects of Gfi-1 on p21<sup>Cip1</sup> expression are cell context-dependent.</p>
      <p id="P6">Miz-1 is a POZ domain ZF transcription factor that possesses a potent anti-growth function and was originally identified as a c-Myc interacting protein (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Wanzel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Miz-1 has been implicated in c-Myc-mediated repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>CDKN2B</italic> encoding another CDKI p15<sup>INK4B</sup>, and <italic>Mad4</italic> (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Herold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Kime and Wright, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Staller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Miz-1 binds to the core promoters of these genes and activates their transcription. c-Myc does not directly bind to, but is recruited to them via Miz-1. Transcriptional activation by Miz-1 is abolished upon c-Myc recruitment and the Miz-1/c-Myc complex functions to repress transcription. Significantly, the expression of c-Myc is downregulated by the cytostatic cytokine transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²), which represents an important mechanism by which TGFÎ² activates <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B</italic>, and exerts its growth-inhibitory effect (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). We show here that Gfi-1 is recruited to <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter via Miz-1 and represses <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription. Notably, the DNA binding activity of Gfi-1 is dispensable for its repression activity. Our data also indicate that Gfi-1 and c-Myc, via Miz-1, form a ternary complex on the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter and exhibit functional collaboration in the repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. Interestingly, like c-Myc, Gfi-1 is also downregulated by TGFÎ² and regulates TGFÎ² sensitivity in hematopoietic cells. These results have implications for understanding the action of Gfi-1 in cell proliferation and its collaboration with Myc in lymphomagenesis.</p>

        <title>DNA binding activity of Gfi-1 is not required for repressing TGFÎ²-induced activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic></title>
        <p id="P7">Gfi-1 has been shown to repress <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, which contains Gfi-1 binding sites approximately 1.4 kb and 2.8 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Duan and Horwitz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Duan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We addressed whether direct DNA binding is required for repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> by Gfi-1. Hela cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter constructs containing the 2.4-kb or 111-bp fragment of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Datto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) along with the expression constructs for Gfi-1 and the N382S mutant. Notably, the 111-bp promoter fragment is devoid of a consensus Gfi-1 binding site, and the N382S mutant of Gfi-1 is defective in DNA binding and acts in a DN manner (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Person <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Cells were subsequently stimulated with TGFÎ², which has been shown to induce the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> in epithelial cells (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Letterio, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, both <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter fragments were activated by TGFÎ², but were completely inhibited by Gfi-1. The N382S mutant also effectively repressed the two C<italic>DKN1A</italic> promoter fragments. Together, these data indicate that the DNA binding ability is not essential for the inhibitory effect of Gfi-1 on TGFÎ²-induced activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>.</p>

        <title>Miz-1 recruits Gfi-1 to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter</title>
        <p id="P8">As repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> by Gfi-1 is independent of its DNA binding activity, we speculated that Gfi-1 may be recruited to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter by a DNA binding protein. We recently identified Miz-1 as a Gfi-1-interacting protein that recruits Gfi-1 to the <italic>CDKN2B</italic> promoter and is involved in Gfi-1-mediated repression of <italic>CDKN2B</italic> (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Basu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Notably, Miz-1 has been shown to recruit c-Myc to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter and is required for repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> by c-Myc (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Oligonucleotide precipitation assays were conducted to investigate whether Gfi-1 bound to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter via Miz-1. 293T cells were transiently transfected with Miz-1, Gfi-1 or both. Whole cell extracts were incubated with the biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning â49 bp to + 16 bp of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter, which lacks a consensus Gfi-1 binding site and was used by others to specifically pull down Miz-1 (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Proteins that bound to the oligonucleotide were precipitated using the streptavidin-coated beads. As expected, Miz-1 was pulled down by the oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Notably, Gfi-1 was pulled down only when Miz-1 was present in the whole cell extracts. The N382S mutant was also recruited to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter by Miz-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), in agreement with its ability to repress <italic>CDKN1A</italic></p>
        <p id="P9">ChIP assays were then conducted on 293T cells ectopically expressing Gfi-1 and Miz-1 to evaluate whether Gfi-1 binding to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> was also dependent on Miz-1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, Gfi-1 barely bound to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter in 293T cells transfected with Gfi-1 only. Expression of Miz-1 in 293T cells markedly increased Gfi-1 occupancy of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter, but not of the upstream and downstream regions. Consistent with this, Miz-1 bound to the proximal promoter region, but not the upstream and downstream regions of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. ChIP assays on HL-60 and Jurkat cells demonstrated that endogenous Gfi-1 also bound to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Interestingly, although the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter has been shown to contain two Gfi-1 binding sites located approximately 1.4 kb and 2.8 kb upstream of the transcription initiation sites (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Duan and Horwitz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Duan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), PCR using primers spanning the two sites failed to demonstrate significant Gfi-1 binding, suggesting that Gfi-1 may not occupy the two sites <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further demonstrate that Gfi-1 occupancy of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter was dependent on Miz-1, the expression of Miz-1 was knocked down in HL-60 cells through lentivirus-mediated delivery of the Miz-1 shRNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, Miz-1 knockdown significantly reduced Gfi-1 occupancy of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter. Together, these data indicate that Gfi-1 bound to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter via Miz-1.</p>

        <title>The C-terminal ZFs of Gfi-1 are involved in interaction with Miz-1</title>
        <p id="P10">To define the Gfi-1 region implicated in Miz-1 interaction, a series of Gfi-1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) were generated and expressed in 293T cells along with Myc-tagged Miz-1. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that truncation of the N-terminal SNAG domain (Gfi-1-dN) had no noticeable effect on the ability of Gfi-1 to interact with Miz-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, deletion of the C-terminal 3 (Gfi-1-dZF3) or 6 (Gfi-1dZF6) ZFs of Gfi-1 abolished Miz-1 interaction, indicating that the C-terminal ZFs 4â6 are required for Miz-1 interaction. Accordingly, Gfi-1-dN, but not Gfi-1-dZF6, was recruited to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter by Miz-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Gfi-1 represses the activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> by Miz-1</title>
        <p id="P11">As Gfi-1 was recruited to <italic>CDKN1A</italic> via Miz-1, we examined the role of Gfi-1 in Miz-1-mediated activation of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter using the luciferase reporter assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, the 2.4-kb promoter fragment of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> was activated by Miz-1 in Hela cells, but was repressed by Gfi-1 in a dose dependent manner. Notably, Gfi-1 also repressed Miz-1-mediated activation of the 111-bp core promoter fragment of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The activity of the 111-bp promoter fragment was also inhibited by the N382S mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus, analogous to its effect on TGFÎ²-induced activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, repression of Miz-1-activated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> by Gfi-1 is also independent of direct DNA binding.</p>
        <p id="P12">To provide evidence that Gfi-1 repressed endogenous <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, we assessed the effect of Gfi-1 knockdown on the level of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> in myeloid leukemic HL-60 and TF-1 cells, and pro-B Ba/F3 cells. Lentiviral delivery of <italic>Gfi-1</italic> shRNAs, but not the empty vector, significantly reduced the expression of Gfi-1, which was associated with increased levels of p21<sup>Cip</sup> in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). We also examined the effect of Gfi-1 knockdown on cell proliferation. As compared with cells infected with the empty lentiviral vector or shRNAs that failed to knock down Gfi-1, cells in which Gfi-1 was knocked down initially grew extremely slowly. The growth-inhibitory effect of Gfi-1 knockdown became less apparent after prolonged culture. Sufficient amounts of cells could be collected for evaluation of Gfi-1 expression and cell proliferation approximately 6 weeks after lentiviral delivery of the Gfi-1 shRNA. At that time, Gfi-1 knockdown exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

Murine Pro-B Ba/F3 cells, which were sensitive to the cytostatic effect of TGFÎ² (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Lodish 1996</xref>), were transiently transfected with the retroviral expression construct Gfi-1-RV and sorted based on GFP expression. Transfection of Ba/F3 cells with Gfi-1 moderately counteracted the cytostatic effect of TGFÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). We further examined the effect of Gfi-1 knockdown on the TGFÎ² response of Ba/F3 cells. Consistent with the results obtained in HL-60 and TF-1 cells, Gfi-1 knockdown through lentivirus-mediated delivery of the Gfi-1 shRNA inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Significantly, the Gfi-1 knocked-down Ba/F3 cells exhibited markedly increased sensitivity to the cytostatic effect of TGFÎ².

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P17">In this paper, we have demonstrated that Gfi-1 interacts with Miz-1 through its C-terminal ZF domains and, via Miz-1, is recruited to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter, resulting in transcriptional repression. Consistent with this, repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> by Gfi-1 is independent of its DNA binding activity, as evident from the facts that Gfi-1 represses the 111-bp <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter fragment which is devoid of a Gfi-1 binding site and the DNA-binding defective N382S mutant of Gfi-1 is fully capable of repressing <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter activity. We recently showed that Gfi-1 represses <italic>CDKN2B</italic> encoding p15INK4B through interaction with Miz-1 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Basu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The data presented here add <italic>CDKN1A</italic> to the list of genes that are regulated by Gfi-1 through Miz-1.</p>
      <p id="P18"><italic>CDKN1A</italic> has been shown to contain two Gfi-1 binding sites located at approximately â1.4 kb and â2.8 kb in the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Duan and Horwitz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Duan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Gfi-1 occupancy of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter was confirmed in HL-60 cells by ChIP assays in which the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter fragment spanning from approximately â390 bp to â250 bp was amplified by PCR (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Duan and Horwitz, 2003</xref>). However, we were unable to demonstrate significant Gfi-1 binding using PCR primers that flank the two sites in our ChIP assays although Gfi-1 binding to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter was consistently detected in HL60 and Jurkat cells, suggesting that Gfi-1 may not bind to the upstream regions of the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, Miz-1 knockdown significantly reduced Gfi-1 binding <italic>in vivo</italic> to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter. These data suggest that Miz-1 may be required for Gfi-1 binding to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter.</p>
      <p id="P19">Miz-1 has been implicated in c-Myc-mediated repression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>CDKN2B</italic> and <italic>Mad4</italic> (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Herold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Kime and Wright, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Seoane <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Staller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Like Gfi-1, c-Myc does not bind to, but is recruited to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> core promoter via Miz-1. Notably, the C-terminal ZFs 1â12 of Miz-1 are involved in interaction with Gfi-1 whereas the regions flanking ZFs 1â12 are required for binding to Myc (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Basu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Peukert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Thus, Miz-1 may interact simultaneously with Gfi-1 and Myc through distinct regions. Our data indicate that Gfi-1 and c-Myc form a ternary complex with Miz-1 on the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter and exhibit functional cooperation in repressing <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. We have recently demonstrated that Gfi-1 cooperates with c-Myc in repressing <italic>CDKN2B</italic> (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Basu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Taken together, these results support a model in which Miz-1 recruits Gfi-1 and c-Myc to form the Gfi-1/Miz-1/c-Myc ternary complex on the core promoters of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>CDKN2B</italic> and probably other Miz-1 target genes, leading to cooperative repression of these genes by Gfi-1 and c-Myc. Interestingly, Gfi-1 has been shown to collaborate with c-Myc in lymphomagenesis (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Scheijen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Zornig <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Our data, while not directly addressing, offer a potential explanation for the role of Gfi-1 in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Scheijen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Zornig <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P20">TGFÎ² inhibits the proliferation of epithelial and early hematopoietic cells, and impaired TGFÎ² signaling has been implicated in hematopoietic and epithelial malignancies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Letterio, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The cytostatic effect of TGFÎ² is dependent on its ability to induce the expression of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and p15<sup>INK4B</sup> at least in part through rapid downregulation of c-Myc (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Frederick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Yagi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Our data indicate that Gfi-1 also suppresses TGFÎ²-induced activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and counteracts the cytostatic effect of TGFÎ². Significantly, like c-Myc, the expression of Gfi-1 is downregulated by TGFÎ² at both mRNA and protein levels, consistent with a recent study (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, TGFÎ² downregulates both Gfi-1 and c-Myc, which may release Miz-1 from the Gfi-1/Miz-1/c-Myc complex to activate <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>CDKN2B</italic> and other possible target genes involved in the negative regulation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). It is possible that suppression of TGFÎ²-induced activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and other Miz-1 target genes may contribute to the oncogenic potential of Gfi-1.</p>
      <p id="P21">While Gfi-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphomas, little is known about its role in leukemogenesis. It has been shown recently that Gfi-1 may suppress leukemogenesis through repression of <italic>HoxA9</italic>, <italic>Pbx1</italic>, and <italic>Meis1</italic>, which are required for immortalization and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Horman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, our results indicate that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Gfi-1 in myeloid leukemic cells led to attenuated cell proliferation. The growth-inhibitory effect of Gfi-1 knockdown appeared to be dramatic at early stages of Gfi-1 knockdown, but became less significant upon prolonged culture, suggesting that leukemic cells may develop compensatory mechanisms. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of Gfi-1 in leukemogenesis.</p>
