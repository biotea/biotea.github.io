        <p>The KEOPS/EKC complex is a tRNA modification complex involved in the biosynthesis of N<sup>6</sup>-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t<sup>6</sup>A), a universally conserved tRNA modification found on ANN-codon recognizing tRNAs. In archaea and eukaryotes, KEOPS is composed of OSGEP/Kae1, PRPK/Bud32, TPRKB/Cgi121 and LAGE3/Pcc1. In fungi, KEOPS contains an additional subunit, Gon7, whose orthologs outside of fungi, if existent, remain unidentified. In addition to displaying defective t<sup>6</sup>A biosynthesis, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains harboring KEOPS mutations are compromised for telomere homeostasis, growth and transcriptional co-activation. To identify a Gon7 ortholog in multicellular eukaryotes as well as to uncover KEOPS-interacting proteins that may link t<sup>6</sup>A biosynthesis to the diverse set of KEOPS mutant phenotypes, we conducted a proteomic analysis of human KEOPS. This work identified 152 protein interactors, one of which, C14ORF142, interacted strongly with all four KEOPS subunits, suggesting that it may be a core component of human KEOPS. Further characterization of C14ORF142 revealed that it shared a number of biophysical and biochemical features with fungal Gon7, suggesting that C14ORF142 is the human ortholog of Gon7. In addition, our proteomic analysis identified specific interactors for different KEOPS subcomplexes, hinting that individual KEOPS subunits may have additional functions outside of t<sup>6</sup>A biosynthesis.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Living organisms rely on a core set of universally conserved genes to sustain life and cellular function, with a majority of essential genes partaking in transcriptional and translational processes. The post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs is one such process, whereby specific tRNA nucleotides, in particular those at positions 34 and 37, are modified to modulate tRNA structure and function (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). An essential modification of tRNAs at nucleotide position 37, known as N<sup>6</sup>-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t<sup>6</sup>A) or its derivative cyclic-t<sup>6</sup>A, is found on all ANN-codon-recognizing tRNAs in the three domains of life (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The biosynthesis of t<sup>6</sup>A is catalyzed by two universally conserved protein families: Sua5/YrdC (alternatively known as Tcs2/Tcs1) and Kae1/Qri7/YgjD (alternatively known as Tcs3/Tcs4/TsaD) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Using threonine, bicarbonate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as substrates, Sua5/YrdC first catalyzes the formation of a threonylcarbamoyladenylate intermediate (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), which is subsequently used by Kae1/Qri7/YgjD to catalyze the transfer of a threonylcarbamoyl moiety onto substrate tRNAs. While Sua5/YrdC family members function independently as monomers, Kae1/Qri7/YgjD members functions as part of related but distinct protein complexes in the different domains of life (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In the mitochondria of eukaryotes, Qri7 operates as an isolated homodimer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In bacteria, YgjD operates in a ternary complex with the inactive YgjD structural ortholog YeaZ (alternatively known as TsaB) and the ATPase YjeE (alternatively known as TsaE) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In archaea and eukaryotes, Kae1 operates as part of the KEOPS/EKC complex (referred to here simply as KEOPS) with the ATPase Bud32 (alternatively known as Tcs5), the ATPase regulator Cgi121 (alternatively known as Tcs7) and the dimerization module Pcc1 (alternatively known as Tcs6). In budding yeast, KEOPS contains a fifth subunit, Gon7 (alternatively known as Tcs8). Whether this subunit is unique to yeast or present but yet-to-be discovered in other eukaryotes and archaea remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>KEOPS was originally discovered in two independent genetic screens conducted in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In the first study, KEOPS subunit Cgi121 was discovered as a genetic suppressor of the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> allele that causes a telomere-capping defect (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In support for Cgi121 functioning as a novel telomere regulator, deletion of <italic>CGI121</italic> in a <italic>cdc13-1</italic> strain reversed the accumulation of single-stranded DNA at telomeres, which is a hallmark of telomere dysfunction imparted by the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> allele. Tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis of Cgi121 revealed that it formed a protein complex with Kae1, Bud32 and Gon7 proteins. Subsequent deletion of each KEOPS subunit resulted in extreme slow growth and shortened telomeres phenotypes in yeast. In the second study, KEOPS subunit Pcc1 was discovered as a genetic suppressor of a U1snRNP splicing defect allele that causes a cold-sensitivity phenotype (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that defects in U1snRNP function abolished proper splicing of the Pcc1 transcript and that depletion of Pcc1 was causative for the cold-sensitive phenotype. Similar to the previous study, tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis of Pcc1 revealed that it formed a protein complex with Kae1, Bud32, Cgi121 and Gon7. The authors additionally showed that Pcc1 localized to the chromatin of transcriptionally active genes, suggesting that Pcc1 played a role in transcriptional activation. In agreement with this hypothesis, yeast strains harboring a temperature sensitive <italic>pcc1-4</italic> allele demonstrated defects in recruiting the transcriptional co-activators Mediator and SAGA to transcriptionally active chromatin. How the slow growth, shortened telomere and transcriptional defect phenotypes of KEOPS in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> relate to the underlying biochemical function of KEOPS in t<sup>6</sup>A biosynthesis remains a mystery.</p>
      <p>Although sequence analysis suggests that Gon7 is absent from archaea and multicellular eukaryotes, it is nonetheless essential for life and necessary for <italic>in vivo</italic> t<sup>6</sup>A biosynthesis in yeast (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Structurally, Gon7 in isolation is an intrinsically disordered protein and only partially folds into a discrete conformation when it heterodimerizes with Pcc1 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). One possible explanation for the lack of readily identifiable Gon7 orthologs is that the absence of an autonomous fold in Gon7 has allowed the primary protein sequence to diverge to such a degree that distant orthologs are no longer detectable using first-pass bioinformatic approaches. In this study, we conducted an affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis on the four recognizable KEOPS subunits in HEK293 cells to explore whether a human Gon7 ortholog can be found, and to identify additional novel interacting proteins that might provide a link between the role of KEOPS in t<sup>6</sup>A biosynthesis and the diverse set of phenotypes associated with its depletion. In total, we identified 152 high-confidence KEOPS interactors, which in concordance with its recognized role in modifying tRNAs, were enriched in proteins implicated in protein translation. We identified a single small protein, C14ORF142, which prominently interacted with all four KEOPS subunits, suggesting that C14ORF142 may be an integral core component of the human KEOPS complex. We conducted follow on characterizations of C14ORF142 and showed that C14ORF142, like Gon7, is intrinsically disordered in isolation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), binds directly to LAGE3 (human ortholog of Pcc1) and to the LAGE3-OSGEP subcomplex (human ortholog of Pcc1-Kae1) within KEOPS (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and forms a 1:1:1:1:1 complex with OSGEP, PRPK, TPRKB and LAGE3 proteins (human orthologs of Kae1, Bud32, Cgi121 and Pcc1, respectively) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Lastly, we showed that C14ORF142 potentiates the t<sup>6</sup>A catalytic activity of human KEOPS <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together, these findings identify C14ORF142 as the human ortholog of fungal Gon7.</p>

        <p>The cDNA for human OSGEP, PRPK, TPRKB, LAGE3 and C14ORF142 were cloned into pcDNA5-FRT-FLAG (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and co-transfected into Flp-In T-REx-293 cell lines with pOG44, a commercially available Flp-Recombinase expression vector (ThermoFisher Scientific) in a 60 mm dish. On the following day, all cells were passaged onto a 150 mm dish, and stably integrated cells were selected with hygromycin and blasticidin. Colony formation occurred over a span of 14 days, at which point cells were further passaged for experimentation. Tetracycline treatment for 24 h was used to induce expression of each FLAG-tagged KEOPS subunit.</p>

        <title>Affinity purification of protein complexes and peptide digestion</title>
        <p>Affinity purification was conducted as previously described (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, two near-confluent 150 mm dishes were used for each affinity purification experiment. Cells were collected by scraping in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation. Ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1x Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail P8340) was added to the cell pellet, followed by a single freeze-thaw cycle to assist cell lysis.

Within ProHits, the resulting RAW files were converted to an MGF format using ProteoWizard (v3.0.4468) and then searched using Mascot (v2.3.02) and Comet (v2012.02 rev.0). The spectra were searched with the RefSeq database (version 53, May 28, 2014) acquired from NCBI against a total of 34 374 human and adenovirus sequences supplemented with âcommon contaminantsâ from the Max Planck Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://141.61.102.106:8080/share.cgi?ssid=0f2gfuB">http://141.61.102.106:8080/share.cgi?ssid=0f2gfuB</ext-link>) and the Global Proteome Machine (GPM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thegpm.org/crap/index.html">http://www.thegpm.org/crap/index.html</ext-link>). The database parameters were set to search for tryptic cleavages, allowing up to 2 missed cleavage sites per peptide with a mass tolerance of 3 Da for precursors with charges of 2+ to 4+ and a tolerance of Â±0.6 Da for fragment ions. Variable modifications were selected for deamidated asparagine and glutamine and oxidized methionine. The results from each search engine were analyzed through the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP v4.6 OCCUPY rev 3) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) via the iProphet pipeline (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). SAINTexpress (v3.3) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was used to calculate the probability value of each potential proteinâprotein interaction using default parameters. For SAINTexpress scoring, 10 negative controls were selected for modeling; to minimize the scoring of spurious contaminants as interactors, the 5 highest spectral count values (across the 10 selected controls) were selected for each prey protein (this strategy was described in detail in (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)). Probabilities calculated for each biological replicate were averaged to generate the final probability; a Bayesian false discovery rate of 1% or lower was required for proteins to be classified as significant interaction partners.</p>

        <p>In our AP-MS analyses, we observed that PRPK and TPRKB, which bind directly within the KEOPS complex, shared a number of significant interacting proteins that were weakly or not at all detected for LAGE3 and OSGEP. These 72 proteins were highly enriched with the âpoly(A) RNA bindingâ GO molecular function term (<italic>P</italic>-value 6.33 Ã 10<sup>â66</sup>; 64 terms intersect), as well as a number of molecular function, biological process and cellular compartment GO terms relating to protein translation (Supplementary Table S1). This enrichment was specific to PRPK and TPRKB and was not observed for LAGE3 and OSGEP, suggesting that PRPK-TPRKB may form sub-complexes distinct from KEOPS that function in mRNA-related processes. We note, however, that the interactions between PRPK-TPRKB and ribosomal proteins could be mediated through DNA and/or RNA, as we did not conduct AP-MS experiments with nuclease-treated samples. In addition to poly(A) binding proteins, we also detected unique interactions between PRPK-TPRKB and the TRMT6-TRMT61a complex, a tRNA modification complex involved in the methylation of adenosine 58 on initiator tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>. This interaction may provide additional opportunities for PRPK-TPRKB to influence tRNA function.</p>
        <p>We also detected a number of significant LAGE3 interactors that were weakly or not at all detected for PRPK, TPRKB and OSGEP. The 57 significant LAGE3 interacting proteins were enriched with âprotein foldingâ GO biological process term (<italic>P</italic>-value 2.19 Ã 10<sup>â13</sup>; 15 terms intersect) (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that LAGE3 might have additional roles outside of KEOPS in regulating chaperones and protein folding.</p>

        <title>C14ORF142 as a potential functional ortholog of Gon7</title>
        <p>In our AP-MS analysis of human KEOPS, we identified a single protein, C14ORF142, which interacted strongly with all four subunits. This observation was reminiscent of the tandem affinity purification experiments of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> KEOPS, where a fifth subunit, Gon7, interacted strongly with Bud32, Kae1, Cgi121 and Pcc1 proteins (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and suggested that C14ORF142, like Gon7, might be an integral component of KEOPS. C14ORF142 is a 100-amino acid protein with no previously assigned function. However, C14ORF142 was previously identified as an interactor of three KEOPS subunits in a high throughput proteomics study, which led to speculation that C14ORF142 may be a Gon7 ortholog, although it was not experimentally confirmed (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We first tested whether C14ORF142 could rescue the slow growth phenotype of a <italic>gon7Î</italic> yeast strain. In contrast to overexpression of Gon7, expression of C14ORF142 did not functionally complement <italic>GON7</italic> deletion in yeast (Supplementary Figure S2). This finding was not unexpected considering the low sequence similarity between C14ORF142 and Gon7 (pairwise sequence identity of 17%) that reflects the evolutionary divergence between the two proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Interestingly, in a multiple sequence alignment of readily recognized orthologs of Gon7 in fungal species and C14ORF142 in metazoan species (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), we observed that a <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> protein possessed stretches of sequence similarity that apparently link the two otherwise dissimilar protein families. Specifically, <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Gon7 possesses a MELCAEYV N-terminal sequence that highly resembles the MELLGEYV N-terminal sequence of human C14ORF142. Beyond the N-terminus, the pairwise identity between <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Gon7 and other fungal Gon7 orthologs ranges from 39.4% to 62.5%, with the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Gon7 orthologs having a pairwise identity of 62.5%. In contrast, the pairwise identities between <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Gon7 and metazoan C14ORF142 orthologs only range from 22.2% to 31.5%, with the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> Gon7 and human C14ORF142 orthologs having a pairwise identity of 29.2%. Together, these weak but tantalizing similarities led us to further investigate C14ORF142 as a potential ortholog of Gon7 in greater detail. Before doing so, we first validated C14ORF142 as an interactor of KEOPS by reciprocal AP-MS using HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cells stably expressing FLAG-C14ORF142 combined with immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies recognizing endogenous C14ORF142, OSGEP and PRPK. In agreement with our initial AP-MS proteomics analyses, FLAG-C14ORF142 interacted with all four KEOPS subunits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), endogenous C14ORF142 co-immunoprecipitated with OSGEP and PRPK (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and endogenous C14ORF142 showed nuclear enrichment localization similar to OSGEP and PRPK (Supplementary Figure S3). Collectively, our data suggested that C14ORF142 is a core component of the human KEOPS complex.</p>

        <title>C14ORF142 interacts directly with human KEOPS</title>
        <p>If C14ORF142 is a true Gon7 ortholog, we reasoned that C14ORF142 would bind directly to KEOPS in a stoichiometric manner. To test this hypothesis, we generated a 5-subunit (OSGEP, PRPK, TPRKB, 6xHis-LAGE3 and C14ORF142) KEOPS polycistronic vector for protein expression in insect cells using the baculovirus system. We observed that C14ORF142 co-purified with OSGEP, PRPK, TPRKB and LAGE3 during nickel chelate affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We next attempted to localize the direct binding partner of C14ORF142 within the KEOPS complex. To this end, we were able to produce a PRPK-TPRKB binary sub-complex in bacteria and a OSGEP-LAGE3 binary sub-complex in insect cells and tested each for binding to recombinant GST-C14ORF142 in pull-down reactions using glutathione resin. We observed that GST-C14ORF142 bound directly to the OSGEP-LAGE3 sub-complex but not to the PRPK-TPRKB sub-complex. However, GST-C14ORF142 did retain the PRPK-TPRKB sub-complex when incubated in the presence of the OSGEP-LAGE3 sub-complex, consistent with OSGEP-LAGE3 serving as bridging factors. As anticipated, GST-Cdk2, a fusion protein of a readily available protein kinase in our lab that was not detected as a KEOPS interactor using AP-MS, displayed only weak residual binding to OSGEP-LAGE3 and PRPK-TPRKB complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since yeast Gon7 and Pcc1 proteins formed tight stoichiometric complexes when co-expressed in bacteria (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), we expected that C14ORF142 and LAGE3 would similarly form tight stoichiometric complexes when co-expressed in bacteria (Supplementary Figure S5). We first expressed C14ORF142 and LAGE3 as GST- and 6xHIS-GST fusion proteins, respectively, in bacteria and purified the proteins to homogeneity using glutathione affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). During SEC purification, C14ORF142 and LAGE3 in isolation displayed elution volumes of 17 ml and 11 ml, respectively, with an overall yield of LAGE3 far lower (&gt;1000-fold) than that observed for C14ORF142. Upon purification of C14ORF142 and LAGE3 co-expressed in bacteria, the yield of LAGE3 was dramatically improved (â¼100-fold) and the two proteins co-migrated with 1:1 stoichiometry at an elution volume of 14 ml. In the same experiment, excess C14ORF142 migrated with an elution volume of 17 ml, identical to the behavior of C14ORF142 produced in isolation. Together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that C14ORF142 is a Gon7 ortholog that binds directly to LAGE3.</p>

        <title>C14ORF142 binds KEOPS subunits with a 1:1:1:1:1 binding stoichiometry</title>
        <p>Previous studies showed that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Gon7 binds directly to Pcc1 on the same surface that supports Pcc1 homo-dimerization (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the absence of Gon7, Pcc1 homodimerization can support the super-dimerization of a 4-subunit archaeal KEOPS complex with a 2:2:2:2 binding stoichiometry (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The disruption of superdimerization via the Gon7-Pcc1 binding interaction may account for the observation that a yeast 5-subunit KEOPS complex has a 1:1:1:1:1 stoichiometry in solution (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We reasoned that if C14ORF142 was a Gon7 ortholog, the binding of C14ORF142 to OSGEP, PRPK, LAGE3 and TPRKB will also result in the formation of a 1:1:1:1:1 complex. To assess the precise binding stoichiometry of human KEOPS complexes in the presence and absence of C14ORF142, we performed SEC-MALS analysis on the recombinant 4-subunit and 5-subunit KEOPS complex produced from insect cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Consistent with the superdimerization disruption behavior of yeast Gon7, the 5-subunit KEOPS complex with C14ORF142 eluted as a single mono-disperse species with a calculated mass of 107 kDa, in good agreement with the theoretical mass of 109 kDa for a 1:1:1:1:1 stoichiometric complex. In contrast, the 4-subunit KEOPS complex lacking C14ORF142 eluted as two distinct peaks, the most prominent of which displayed a calculated mass of 208 kDa, in good agreement with the theoretical mass of 198 kDa for a 2:2:2:2 stoichiometric complex. Re-analysis of the pooled prominent peak by SEC revealed the identical profile as the original 4-subunit KEOPS complex sample, indicating that the 4-subunit complex resides in a equilibrium between a well defined 2:2:2:2 complex and a larger heterogeneous soluble aggregate.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>The AP-MS analysis of the human KEOPS complex and subsequent biophysical and biochemical characterizations lead us to conclude that C14ORF142 is the human ortholog of yeast Gon7. The finding of a functional Gon7 ortholog in human raises the possibility that archaeal Gon7 orthologs may also exist, but due to an even greater evolutionary drift, these proteins cannot be detected by sequence alone. Thus, a proteomic analysis of KEOPS in archaeal species, as we performed in human cells, may be warranted. The discovery of the missing fifth regulatory subunit in human KEOPS (and by inference the missing Gon7 orthologs in other multicellular eukaryotic species) opens the door for future comprehensive studies into the biological and biochemical function of KEOPS in additional multicellular eukaryotes. We note that we did attempt to assess intracellular t<sup>6</sup>A levels in a hTERT-RPE1 C14ORF142 CRISPR-derived knock out cell line, but the resulting slow-growth phenotype of selected clones hampered our ability to produce sufficient quantities of tRNA required for the analysis.</p>

        <title>Possible functions for PRPK, TPRKB, LAGE3 and C14ORF142 outside of t<sup>6</sup>A biogenesis</title>
        <p>The interaction network for PRPK and TPRKB is highly enriched for ribosomal proteins, suggesting that a KEOPS-independent PRPK-TPRKB sub-complex might function in a translation-related process. Interestingly, the closest structural orthologs of PRPK, namely the Rio1 and Rio2 ATPases, are both components of the ribosome and play important roles in the maturation of ribosomal RNA in the 40S ribosomal subunit (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This observation hints that PRPK-TPRKB, similar to Rio1 and Rio2, may also regulate ribosomal RNA maturation. In addition to a possible role in ribosomal RNA maturation, we detected novel PRPK-TPRKB interactions that suggest that PRPK-TPRKB may regulate tRNA modifications distinct from t<sup>6</sup>A. For example, we observed that PRPK-TPRKB strongly interacted with the m<sup>1</sup>A58 tRNA methyltransferase complex (TRMT61a-TRMT6), which methylates adenosine 58 on initiator tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The absence of m<sup>1</sup>A58 results in lower steady state levels of tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> and causes a slow growth phenotype in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, similar to what is observed for KEOPS dysfunction in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Intriguingly, t<sup>6</sup>A-deficient yeast strains show a greater tendency to initiate protein translation at upstream non-AUG codons, which further alludes to a dysfunctionality of tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> molecules (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). These similarities in phenotype suggest that the PRPK-TPRKB sub-complex may regulate both t<sup>6</sup>A and m<sup>1</sup>A58 biosynthesis.</p>
        <p>Similar to PRPK-TPRKB, we detected interactions that suggest that the LAGE3-C14ORF142 sub-complex may function outside of KEOPS. Specifically, we detected an enrichment of interactors implicated in protein folding for both LAGE3 and C14ORF142. This suggests that protein chaperones may be critical to the proper folding of LAGE3 and C14ORF142 or alternatively, that LAGE3 and C14ORF142 are more pervasive regulators of protein folding. Interestingly, five of the six LAGE3- and C14ORF142-interacting heat shock chaperones, HspA9 (PDB 4KB0) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), HspA5 (PDB 3LDL) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), HspA8 (PDB 4H5N) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), HspA1B (PDB 4J8F) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and HspA1L (PDB 3GDQ) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), belong to the ASKHA fold superfamily of proteins, which also includes OSGEP. If LAGE3 and C14ORF142 do indeed regulate protein folding, we speculate that the two proteins may engage and regulate their chaperone interactors in the same manner that they engage and regulate OSGEP.</p>
        <p>In sum, the collection of our interaction data shed new light on the identity, structure and function of C14ORF142 as the missing fifth subunit in the human KEOPS complex. In addition, our findings provide new leads for future investigation into the diverse biological functions of KEOPS and its individual subunits.</p>
