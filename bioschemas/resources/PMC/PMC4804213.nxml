        <p>Voltage-gated e<italic>ther Ã  go-go</italic> (EAG) K<sup>+</sup> channels are expressed in various types of cancer cells and also in the central nervous system. Aberrant overactivation of human EAG1 (hEAG1) channels is associated with cancer and neuronal disorders such as Zimmermann-Laband and Temple-Baraitser syndromes. Although hEAG1 channels are recognized as potential therapeutic targets, regulation of their functional properties is only poorly understood. Here, we show that the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) is a potent inhibitory gating modifier of hEAG1 channels. PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits the channel activity by directly binding to a short N-terminal segment of the channel important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM) binding as evidenced by bio-layer interferometry measurements. Conversely, depletion of endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> either by serotonin-induced phospholipase C (PLC) activation or by a rapamycin-induced translocation system enhances the channel activity at physiological membrane potentials, suggesting that PIP<sub>2</sub> exerts a tonic inhibitory influence. Our study, combining electrophysiological and direct binding assays, demonstrates that hEAG1 channels are subject to potent inhibitory modulation by multiple phospholipids and suggests that manipulations of the PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling pathway may represent a strategy to treat hEAG1 channel-associated diseases.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The human <italic>ether Ã  go-go</italic> channel (hEAG1, also known as Kv10.1, encoded by the gene KCNH1) is a voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel mainly expressed in neuronal and cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Besides the well-established roles in tumor development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, the importance of hEAG1 channels in the nervous system is now increasingly appreciated. For instance, recent genetic studies have demonstrated that EAG1 channels are critical for shaping the action potential in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and gain-of-function mutations of the channel are associated with Zimmermann-Laband and Temple-Baraitser syndromes, two severe neurological and developmental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The hEAG1 channel has promising therapeutic and diagnostic potential, and development of the channel inhibitors is one therapeutic strategy for treating cancer and neurological disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, regulation of the hEAG1 channel function is only beginning to be understood. Although a section of the C-terminal area of hEAG1 shares high sequence similarity with the cyclic nucleotide binding domain in cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the hEAG1 channel fails to bind cyclic nucleotides<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Only a few endogenous regulators of the hEAG1 channel have been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Among them, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM) potently inhibits the EAG1 channel by binding to up to three discrete intracellular areas located in its N and C termini<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
    <p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), a phospholipid composed of one negatively charged head group and two fatty acid tails, serves as a structural cofactor for many membrane proteins and it is the precursor of two important second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>). Acting as a multifunctional molecule, PIP<sub>2</sub> plays pivotal roles in normal and pathological cellular functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. For instance, PIP<sub>2</sub> is implicated in cell proliferation and neurological diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Consequently, the lipid kinases including phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5KIs) responsible for PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis are considered to be potential therapeutic targets for various disorders involving altered neuronal excitability such as chronic pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In addition, the degradation of PIP<sub>2</sub> is subject to dynamic regulation by many important neuronal transmitters via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-induced phospholipase C (PLC) activation, which in turn affects many important downstream targets including a wide array of ion channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The mechanisms of ion channel regulation by PIP<sub>2</sub> appear diverse. A crystal structure of an inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel with PIP<sub>2</sub> bound shows a direct interaction between the negatively charged head group of the lipid and a cluster of positively charged residues of the channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Besides the direct interaction mechanism, PIP<sub>2</sub> also exerts its modulatory influences on ion channels indirectly by binding to numerous channel-associated inositol-binding proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Moreover, modulation of ion channel function by PIP<sub>2</sub> may involve alteration of the physical and chemical properties of the plasma membrane, which could then change the channel structure and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. For instance, membrane lipid rafts enriched in PIP<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> may influence ion channels contained therein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Despite the existence of these direct and indirect mechanisms, many studies investigating modulation of ion channels by PIP<sub>2</sub> relied solely on electrophysiological measurements and mutagenesis, and failed to clarify the exact mechanism of the PIP<sub>2</sub> action.</p>
    <p>The potential importance of both hEAG1 channels and PIP<sub>2</sub> in neurological and developmental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> prompted us to investigate whether hEAG1 channels are regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub>. In this study, we show that gating of the hEAG1 channel is potently inhibited by exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> and that physiological depletion of endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane enhances the channel activity. Moreover, the bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay demonstrates that PIP<sub>2</sub> directly binds to the hEAG1 channel complex. Removal of a short domain located in the N terminus of the channel abolished its interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub> as well as the lipid-induced ionic current inhibition. Our findings show that the hEAG1 channel is directly regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub> and that this regulation may contribute to normal human physiology and pathology.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of hEAG1 channels by PIP<sub>2</sub></title>
        <p>The effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> on heterologously expressed hEAG1 channels was studied by direct application of exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> to the intracellular side of excised patches from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transiently expressing hEAG1 channels. Acute application of 3 Î¼M brain-derived PIP<sub>2</sub> with 18 to 20 carbon tail groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> to the intracellular side caused a rapid and potent current inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Because currents through hEAG1 channels frequently underwent progressive rundown after patch excision, our analysis was typically limited to the results obtained within 5â8 min of patch excision. We also tested the effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> on the whole-cell current by perfusing PIP<sub>2</sub> into the HEK293T cells stably expressing hEAG1 channels using a fast intracellular perfusion system and observed a similar inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). The development of the inhibitory effect was slower with lower concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and the results obtained with 200-s PIP<sub>2</sub> application epochs showed that the fractional decrease in current size was also concentration dependent with an apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.35âÂ±â0.01 Î¼M and the Hill coefficient of 0.92âÂ±â0.32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>). By contrast, dioctanoyl-PIP<sub>2</sub> (diC8- PIP<sub>2</sub>) and its analogs with different numbers of negative charges (3 Î¼M), which have 8-carbon tails and higher water solubility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> than brain-derived PIP<sub>2</sub>, showed less overall potency in inhibiting hEAG1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1FâH</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> value for diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> was 18.6âÂ±â0.6 Î¼M, suggesting that the inhibitory potency of PIP<sub>2</sub> depends on the length of the fatty acid chains.</p>
        <p>In addition to PIP<sub>2</sub>, other types of phosphatidylinositol (PIs) are also involved in cellular signaling and they may show specificities in ion channel regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We therefore tested whether these PI lipids inhibited the hEAG1 channel. When applied at 3 Î¼M, PI, PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> differed noticeably in their abilities to alter the hEAG1 current, from no effect by PI to the strongest inhibition by PIP<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I</xref>), showing that the number of negative charges of the head group is also critical for the channel inhibition.</p>
        <p>PIP<sub>2</sub> (3 Î¼M) virtually annihilated currents through hEAG1 at 40 mV at which the channel was maximally activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, even with PIP<sub>2</sub> present (2 Î¼M), depolarization to an extremely positive voltage (e.g., 200 mV) did elicit a robust outward current and the peak tail current size following the depolarization was similar to that after depolarization to 40 mV without PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). This observation suggests that hEAG1 remained functional even in the presence of 3 Î¼M PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>) but the voltage dependence of activation was shifted markedly to the positive direction. Consistent with this possibility, the conductance-voltage (GV) curve obtained with a lower concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> (0.1 Î¼M) showed a clear positive shift; the half-activation voltage (V<sub>0.5</sub>) changed from â16.1âÂ±â4.0 to 40.8âÂ±â6.1 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>). Additionally, the GV curve became less steep; the slope factor (k) increased from 14.7âÂ±â1.2 to 44.2âÂ±â9.3 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2CâF</xref>).</p>

        <title>hEAG1 channels interact directly with PIP<sub>2</sub></title>
        <p>To test whether PIP<sub>2</sub> directly interacts with the hEAG1 channel, we used bio-layer interferometry (BLI) to measure the kinetics of binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> to the purified hEAG1 channel complex. BLI is a novel methodology that has emerged recently for detecting protein-protein interactions as well as those between proteins and small molecules. Binding events between a protein and its ligands can be measured by changes in optical interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The quality and the specificity of purified biotinylated hEAG1 channel protein was confirmed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Addition of PIP<sub>2</sub> to the protein anchored to the BLI sensor tip rapidly increased the optical interference signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The kinetics of the BLI signal resembled those observed in the patch-clamp measurements in the excised patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The kinetics of the increase in the BLI signal by PIP<sub>2</sub> was concentration dependent, becoming faster with greater concentrations, and the BLI signal increase was partially reversible after 3 min of wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). Using a 200-s application epoch at each concentration as utilized in the electrophysiological experiments, the cumulative concentration dependence suggested a dissociation constant (KD) value of 0.35âÂ±â0.04 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>), similar to the IC<sub>50</sub> value obtained from the electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
        <p>The close correspondence between the result from the BLI and electrophysiological measurements was also observed in the ligand selectivity. PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (3 Î¼M), which effectively inhibited the hEAG1 channel electrophysiologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I</xref>), elicited robust BLI signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F,G</xref>). In contrast, diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> (3 Î¼M), which failed to inhibit the hEAG1 channel in our electrophysiological experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1G,H</xref>), also failed to elicit any noticeable BLI signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F,G</xref>).</p>

        <title>Depletion of endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> increases hEAG1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents</title>
        <p>Some inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels require PIP<sub>2</sub> for function, indicating that these channels are subject to basal tonic modulation by PIP<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We investigated whether a similar tonic modulation of hEAG1 channels exists by selectively depleting PIP<sub>2</sub> in HEK293T cells stably expressing hEAG1 channels. We used the plasma membrane-targeted, rapamycin-induced translocation system based on inducible dimerization of PM-FRB-CFP and 5-phosphatase-FKBP-mRFP to acutely deplete PIP<sub>2</sub> by a specific dephosphorylation of PIP<sub>2</sub> at the 5â² position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion in the plasma membrane was monitored by PLCÎ´1PH-GFP, which binds to PIP<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. When hEAG1-expressing cells were transfected with PLCÎ´1PH-GFP alone, the GFP fluorescence was found primarily near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> top and middle), suggesting an appreciable level of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane at rest. Application of 100 nM rapamycin to these cells changed neither the location of GFP fluorescence distribution nor the electrophysiologically measured whole-cell hEAG1 current size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> bottom, C). By contrast, the same concentration of rapamycin diminished the GFP signal when 5-phosphatase-FKBP-mRFP and PM-FRB-CFP constructs were cotransfected with PLCÎ´1PH-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref> top and middle), indicative of a decrease in the level of plasma membrane PIP<sub>2</sub>. Rapamycin also increased the whole-cell hEAG1 current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref> bottom). The fractional increase in current was especially noticeable at more negative voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), consistent with the idea that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion shifted the current-voltage (IV) relationship to the negative direction.</p>
        <p>One of the physiological ways by which PIP<sub>2</sub> is hydrolyzed is by the action of phospholipase C (PLC) following activation of GPCRs such as serotonin receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, which are in turn implicated in tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and also in neuronal signaling. We thus examined if serotonin increases the hEAG1 channel activity by depleting PIP<sub>2</sub>. We transfected the hEAG1-expressing HEK293T cells with human 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2A (HTR<sub>2A</sub>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and PLCÎ´1PH-GFP. Hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> by PLC leads to IP<sub>3</sub> release and increases the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), which may confound any effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. To avoid this potential complication, the âfastâ Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>Nâ²</italic>,<italic>Nâ²</italic>-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA, 10 mM) was used in the whole-cell recording solution to rapidly control [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Serotonin (100âÎ¼M) had no detectable effect on the GFP signal or the current size in the control hEAG1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D,F</xref>). However, when the channels were co-expressed with the serotonin receptor HTR<sub>2A</sub>, serotonin dimmed the GFP signal reporting the PIP<sub>2</sub> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref> top and middle) and noticeably increased the whole-cell current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref> bottom, F). The fractional increase in current was greater at more negative voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>), suggesting that the IV curve shifted to the negative direction. The results collectively suggest that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> exerts a detectable tonic inhibitory influence on hEAG1 channels in intact cells.</p>

        <title>Molecular determinants of hEAG1 channel inhibition by PIP<sub>2</sub></title>
        <p>PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites typically consist of positively charged amino acid residues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. To identify the molecular locus required for the PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent regulation of hEAG1, we first investigated whether the positively charged residues in S4 of hEAG1 are involved in PIP<sub>2</sub>-induced channel inhibition in part because PIP<sub>2</sub> alters the GV characteristics of the hEAG1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The hEAG1 S4 segment, like those in other voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, contains multiple positively charged residues that move within the electric field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). If these mobile charges interact with PIP<sub>2</sub> applied to the intracellular side, some voltage/S4 state dependence of the effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> on hEAG1 may be expected as observed in KCNQ channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. PIP<sub>2</sub> quickly inhibited the hEAG1 channel when the membrane potential was held at 40âmV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>,D). At this voltage, assuming that hEAG1 and Kv1.2/2.1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> activate in a similar fashion, the voltage sensors are expected to be fully activated, placing hEAG1 K327 through R336 on the extracellular side and R339 interacting with negatively charged residues in S2 and S3. A similar inhibition was observed when the membrane potential was held at â80âmV at which R330 through K340 electrically should face the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). Furthermore, neutralization of the positively charged residues at R333, R336, R339, and/or K340 had no appreciable effect on the PIP<sub>2</sub>-induced channel inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Amino-acid sequences of hEAG1, hELK1, and hERG1 show considerable similarity (~40%). A recent study has shown that PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits hELK1 by interacting with some of the positively charged residues in the S4âS5 linker, S6, and EAG domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. However, these residues are not well conserved in hEAG1 channels. By contrast, PIP<sub>2</sub> increases currents through hERG1 and a short region rich in positively charged residues (<sup>883</sup>RQRKRKLSFRRR<sup>894</sup>) in the intracellular C terminus of hERG1 has been implicated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The distal C terminus of hEAG1 also contains a similar segment with multiple positively charged residues (C3 <sup>806</sup>KRKSWARFK<sup>814</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Deletion of this segment did not alter the inhibitory effect of exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> (âC3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). In many ion channels such as KCNQ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, TRPC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, SK2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, and CNG channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, the putative PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction sites overlap with CaM binding sites. Therefore, we hypothesized that the CaM interaction domains in the hEAG1 channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> may be involved in the inhibitory effect of PIP<sub>2</sub>. Up to three potential CaM binding segments in hEAG1 have been reported: CaM-N in the N terminus and CaM-C1 and CaM-C2 in the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. We deleted these CaM binding sites individually (âCaM-N, âCaM-C1 and âCaM-C2). Currents through hEAG1 âCaM-C1 and hEAG1 âCaM-C2 maintained wild-type-like sensitivity to PIP<sub>2</sub>; however, those from hEAG1 âCaM-N were virtually unaltered by PIP<sub>2</sub>, up to 3âÎ¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>,C). Moreover, no BLI signals were observed from the purified hEAG1 âCaM-N in response to PIP<sub>2</sub> (3âÎ¼M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>,E). In addition to hEAG1, we also found that PIP<sub>2</sub> significantly inhibited hEAG2 (KCNH5, Kv10.2) channels, which have virtually the same sequence near the CaM-N area as hEAG1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional independence between PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in the regulation of hEAG1 channels</title>
        <p>The observation that the potential binding sites for PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in the N terminus overlap suggests that these two inhibitory factors may interfere with each other. Furthermore, both Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and PIP<sub>2</sub> may be present together under physiological conditions. The exposure of inside-out membrane patches to 200ânM CaM in 1âÎ¼M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> resulted in a complete inhibition of hEAG1 currents and this effect, unlike that by PIP<sub>2</sub>, was rapidly and fully reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). The second exposure to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM at the same concentrations together with PIP<sub>2</sub> (3âÎ¼M) inhibited the current as rapidly as the first exposure. However, no recovery was observed after wash out of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>), an indication of the long-lasting action of PIP<sub>2</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). To assess whether the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> alters its sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, we utilized the following protocol. We first verified that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (30ânM CaM in 1âÎ¼M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) inhibited the current in a rapidly reversible fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>, first âCaMâ). Following wash out of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, application of PIP<sub>2</sub> (0.5âÎ¼M) decreased the current by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>, âPIP<sub>2</sub>â). Subsequent application of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM results in a near 100% inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>, second âCaMâ), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and PIP<sub>2</sub> may have additive effects on hEAG1 channel inhibition.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Increasing evidence suggests that hEAG1 K<sup>+</sup> channels are closely linked with tumorigenesis and developmental diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, the regulation of the hEAG1 channel function is only beginning to be elucidated and only a few physiologically relevant regulators have been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> . Here we have demonstrated that PIP<sub>2</sub> profoundly shifts the voltage dependence of activation of the hEAG1 channel to the positive direction and acts as a potent inhibitory modulator of the channel. Further, we have identified that a region near the channelâs N-terminal CaM interaction site is essential for both the electrophysiological effects and binding of PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p>Membrane lipids may be an important class of modulators of EAG channels. A recent study has shown that mouse neurons have two populations of EAG channels, one of which is sensitive to the alteration of lipid raft integrity such as cholesterol depletion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. In our study, temporally-controlled depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> by rapamycin-induced translocation of 5-phosphatase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> in whole cells noticeably increased hEAG1 currents especially at negative voltages. Thus, PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition of hEAG1 channels is well suited to influence action potential firing in neurons. Physiological relevance of the tonic inhibitory influence of PIP<sub>2</sub> as an endogenous modulator of hEAG1 is further suggested by the finding that activation of serotonin HTR<sub>2A</sub> receptors, known to activate PLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> to promote hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub>, also increases hEAG1 currents at negative voltages. However, the magnitude of hEAG1 current increase <italic>in vivo</italic> mediated by GPCR activation is difficult to predict. Under such conditions, GPCR activation leads to generation of multiple signaling molecules capable of affecting hEAG1 channels in distinct ways. For example, PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion by PLC produces IP<sub>3</sub>, which in turn can promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM could then inhibit hEAG1 channels, dampening the direct stimulatory effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion on the channels described here. In addition, activation of many GPCRs including serotonin receptors can stimulate phospholipases A2 (PLA2) thereby inducing the release of arachidonic acid (AA), a lipid messenger which has been reported to activate hEAG channels in human melanoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus, depending on the comparative potencies and kinetics of these direct and indirect effects, complex regulation of hEAG1 channels by PIP<sub>2</sub> under physiological conditions is possible.</p>
      <p>Numerous ion channels have been reported to be PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, elucidation of the exact mode of action of PIP<sub>2</sub>, for example direct binding vs. indirect effects, has been hampered by the lack of appropriate PIP<sub>2</sub> binding assays with a good time resolution that detect physiologically relevant binding events. Here, we used bio-layer interferometry (BLI), a novel assay capable for measuring the kinetics of binding between proteins and their ligands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, to detect binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> to the isolated hEAG1 protein. The BLI measurements showed the existence of two kinetic components in association and dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The fast BLI association and slow dissociation components especially well correspond to the electrophysiological results in their kinetics and concentration dependence. The slow BLI association component and the fast dissociation signals, which became more prominent at high concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub>, may be electrophysiologically silent. Furthermore, the deletion of the N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding area in hEAG1, which eliminates the electrophysiological effect of PIP<sub>2</sub>, also abolishes the BLI signal. A Hill coefficient (~1) of the concentration dependence curve of the current inhibition by PIP<sub>2</sub> hints that binding of one PIP<sub>2</sub> is capable of exerting a full inhibitory effect; this idea needs further investigation. The close correspondence between the electrophysiological and BLI results demonstrates that BLI, which requires no labeling and has a time resolution comparable to that of the patch-clamp method, could be a very promising method for studying the pharmacology of ion channels, thus complementing the established electrophysiological assays.</p>
      <p>Our electrophysiological results show that PIP<sub>2</sub> functions as a potent inhibitory gating modifier of the hEAG1 channel by shifting the overall voltage dependence of activation to the positive direction. We did not measure the exact shift at high concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub>; however, the observation that a functionally saturating concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> (3âÎ¼M) essentially eliminates the current at 40âmV where the normalized conductance without PIP<sub>2</sub> is near unity suggests that PIP<sub>2</sub> may induce a &gt;100âmV shift. Such a large shift in the voltage dependence of activation may partially explain the profound current inhibition. How binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> to the N terminus of hEAG1 leads to this marked shift in the overall voltage dependence can only be speculated. Studies show that the N-terminal region of the members of the KCNH channel family (K<sub>V</sub>10, K<sub>V</sub>11 and K<sub>V</sub>12) including hEAG1 (K<sub>V</sub>10.1) plays pivotal roles in channel gating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. An area termed the EAG domain in the N terminus directly interacts with an area in the C terminus called the cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which in turn regulates behavior of the ion conduction gate in S6 via the C-linker domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Downstream of the EAG domain close to S1, the N terminus contains one of the CaM binding sites, CaM-N, which is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-induced inhibition of hEAG1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our results show that the amino-acid residues involved in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding partially overlap with the CaM-N site, suggesting that PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM may interact. Such an interaction is in fact seen in many other ion channels such as TRPC6 in which PIP<sub>2</sub> binding disrupts the association of CaM with the channel protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. A structural study shows that PIP<sub>2</sub> activates type 2 small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (SK2) by binding to the positively charged residues located at the interface of the SK2-CaM complex and that phosphorylation of CaM reduces the affinity of PIP<sub>2</sub> for the channel complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. However, in hEAG1, the long-lasting inhibitory effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> is unaltered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM while we cannot formally exclude the possibility that binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> somehow renders the interaction of the CaM-N domain and CaM essentially irreversible. Thus, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM with vastly different kinetics are capable of regulating the channel in each otherâs presence, expanding the modulatory versatility of the hEAG1 channel. The N terminus of the EAG channel has been suggested to interact directly with CNBHD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Perhaps, this interaction is modified by PIP<sub>2</sub> to alter the voltage dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, we have demonstrated that PIP<sub>2</sub> is a potent endogenous gating modulator of the hEAG1 channel that exerts its tonic inhibitory influence by direct binding to the N terminus of the channel protein. Gain-of-function mutations in the gene coding for hEAG1 have been associated with developmental and neurological disorders such as Zimmermann-Laband and Temple-Baraitser syndromes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Thus, the tonic inhibition of the hEAG1 channel by PIP<sub>2</sub> may be beneficial to the aforementioned disorders and dysregulation of the PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling pathway may contribute to disease through hEAG1 channels.</p>
