      <abstract>
        <p>Selenocysteine (Sec) is found in the catalytic centers of many selenoproteins and plays important roles in living organisms. Malfunctions of selenoproteins lead to various human disorders including cancer. Known as the 21st amino acid, the biosynthesis of Sec involves unusual pathways consisting of several stages. While the later stages of the pathways are well elucidated, the molecular basis of the first stageâthe serylation of Sec-specific tRNA (tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>) catalyzed by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS)âis unclear. Here we present two cocrystal structures of human SerRS bound with tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> in different stoichiometry and confirm the formation of both complexes in solution by various characterization techniques. We discovered that the enzyme mainly recognizes the backbone of the long variable arm of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> with few base-specific contacts. The N-terminal coiled-coil region works like a long-range lever to precisely direct tRNA 3â² end to the other protein subunit for aminoacylation in a conformation-dependent manner. Restraints of the flexibility of the coiled-coil greatly reduce serylation efficiencies. Lastly, modeling studies suggest that the local differences present in the D- and T-regions as well as the characteristic U20:G19:C56 base triple in tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> may allow SerRS to distinguish tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> from closely related tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> substrate.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) catalyze the attachment of specific amino acids to the 3â² end of cognate tRNA molecules for protein synthesis. The reaction occurs as a two-step process, in which an enzyme-bound amino acid is first condensed with ATP to form a molecule of aminoacyl adenylate, and it is subsequently transferred to the 3â² terminal adenosine ribose of tRNA (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Each of the 20 common amino acids corresponds to a specific aaRS in general. However, the 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) lacks a proprietary aaRS in all three domains of life (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Sec-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is synthesized by the conversion of serine through a multistep process in a Sec-specific tRNA (tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>)-dependent manner. All selenoproteins are selenium-dependent enzymes, generally with Sec at their active sites, and many of them are essential for organismal viability (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In Sec biosynthesis, tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is first aminoacylated with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) to produce Ser-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>. The following step is species-dependent: in bacteria, Sec synthetase (SelA) converts Ser-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> to Sec-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> in a single-step reaction; in contrast, archaea and eukaryotes carry on the synthesis through an intermediate step where the serine moiety is phosphorylated by <italic>O</italic>-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (PSTK) to produce <italic>O</italic>-phosphoseryl-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (Sep-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which in turn becomes the substrate of <italic>O</italic>-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (SepSecS) to generate Sec-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) (Supplementary Figure S1).</p><p>Dimeric SerRS is a class II aaRS (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), whose catalytic aminoacylation domain (AD) is formed by a seven-stranded antiparallel <italic>Î²</italic>-sheet and contains three conserved motifs. In all organisms except for methanogens, SerRSs also possess a characteristic N-terminal tRNA-binding domain (TBD), which is composed of two long <italic>Î±</italic>-helices (coiled-coil region), protruding away from the AD. Compared to lower organisms, vertebrate SerRSs also display a â¼30-residue C-terminal extension named the UNE-S domain, and two other insertion domains named insertion I and insertion II, respectively (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Besides the well-characterized aminoacylation funcÂ­tions, mammalian SerRSs play a non-canonical role in the process of vascular development. This alternative function requires the UNE-S domain (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and is independent of the aminoacylation activity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The cocrystal structure of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> SerRS (TtSerRS) complexed with tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> (TttRNA<sup>Ser</sup>) was determined to 2.9 Ã more than two decades ago (PDB code 1SER) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). By contrast, cocrystal structures of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> have not been available until recently. In the heterologous complex formed between <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and <italic>M. kandleri</italic> SerRS, the N-terminal domain of the non-canonical SerRS interacts with the extra arm stem and the outer corner of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Addtionally, the crystal structure of <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> SelA complexed with tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> shows that the N-terminal domain of the protein interacts with the D-arm of tRNA, and a large cleft between two protein subunits accommodates the 3â² terminal region of Ser-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The crystal structure of archaeal PSTK in complex with tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> indicates that PSTK distinguishes Ser-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> from Ser-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> by recognizing the characteristic D-arm of the former (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The crystal structure of human tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> in complex with SepSecS shows that SepSecS employs a primordial tRNA-dependent catalytic mechanism where the enzyme makes contacts with the acceptor-, TÏC- and variable arms of Ser-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Lastly, the structure of hSerRS complxed with the Ser-AMP analog 5â²-<italic>O-(N</italic>-(L-seryl)-sulfamoyl) adenosine (Ser-SA) shows that the binding of Ser-SA dramatically leverages the position of the TBD over a 70 Ã distance (PDB code 4L87). Interestingly, this leverage is specific to higher eukaryotes but is not seen in bacterial, archaeal and lower eukaryotic SerRSs (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>All these complex structures provide great insights into the important steps in the Sec biosynthesis pathway. But to date, no structural information is available for the serylation step in terms of the interaction mode between the enzyme and the tRNA substrate, i.e. the serylation details of the Sec biosynthesis are still missing (Supplementary Figure S1). Here we report two crystal structures of human SerRS (hSerRS)-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> complex in different stoichiometry. We also demonstrate that both complexes are present in solution as observed in crystals. The structures address the recognition mechanism of tRNA substrates and allow for better understanding the dual substrate specificity of SerRS for both tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of hSerRS and mutants</title><p>The wild-type (WT) full-length hSerRS gene <italic>SARS</italic> (GenBank Accession No. BAA95602) was amplified from cDNA library of human 293T cell, which contains 514 residues. It was cloned into the expression vector pET-20b (+) vector (Novagen) with the restriction sites <italic>NheI</italic> and <italic>XhoI</italic>. The E156T/R157S, E447K and other mutants were generated by the <italic>quikchange</italic> method (Stratagene) with the WT plasmid as the template. All the primers used in this study were listed in Supplementary Table S1.</p><p>The plasmids of WT SerRS and mutants were transformed into the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) cells for overexpression. An overnight WT culture was grown in LuriaâBertani broth containing 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin. A 2 l fresh culture medium was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture. When A<sub>600</sub> reached 0.6â0.8 at 37Â°C, the expression of SerRS was induced by 0.2 mM isopropyl <italic>Î²</italic>-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and was kept shaking overnight at 25Â°C. The <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min and resuspended in pre-cooled nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM <italic>Î²</italic>-mercaptoethanol (<italic>Î²</italic>-ME) and 1 mM PMSF. The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 1 h at 4Â°C. The supernatant was then applied to Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen), which was previously equilibrated with Ni-NTA buffer A. The target protein was eluted with Ni-NTA buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 1 mM <italic>Î²-</italic>ME and 1 mM PMSF). The SerRS-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. SerRS was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Q-HP column (GE Healthcare) with a NaCl gradient, and SerRS was eluted at â¼250 mM NaCl. The final separation was performed by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (10/30), and the protein was eluted with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 75 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. The pure protein was collected and concentrated to 4 mg/ml. The aliquoted protein was flash-frozen and stored at â80Â°C until further use. For mutants to be tested with aminoacylation activity assays, 5% glycerol was added to the concentrated protein before it was frozen. Additionally, for the C46S and C117S mutants, no reducing reagent was added during the process of protein extraction and purification. All the purified mutants displayed a symmetrical peak on the size-exclusion column, suggesting that they were well folded.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title><italic>In-vitro</italic> transcription of tRNA substrate</title><p>Synthetic oligos corresponding to the T7 promoter plus tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>-encoding sequences were ligated into the pUC19 vector with the restriction sites <italic>HindIII</italic> and <italic>XbaI</italic>.

The dry pellet of DNA after precipitation was redissolved in DEPC-treated water to a concentration â¼400 Î¼g/ml. The <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription was carried out for 4 h at 37Â°C in a mixture containing 2.5 mM of each NTP,20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM spermidine and 0.3 Î¼M T7 RNA polymerase. The transcribed tRNA was purified by 12% denaturing Urea-PAGE gel, extracted, and was then ethanol-precipitated. The pellet was washed and redissolved in a buffer containing 10 mM sodium arsenate (pH 6.5) to a concentration 5 mg/ml. tRNA was annealed by heating to 65Â°C and allowed to cool to room temperature after addition of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The annealed RNA was stored at â80Â°C for further use. Other tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> mutants were prepared using the same protocol and all the tRNA sequences used in this study were listed in Supplementary Table S2.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>Crystallization, data collection and structure determination</title><p>High-throughput crystallization screen was performed using the Mosquito liquid transfer robot (TTP Labtech) and the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. In order to obtain the best crystals possible for structure determination, we introduced point mutations to both the protein and tRNA constructs for crystallization. These mutations greatly enhanced the diffraction quality of the cocrystals and finally led to the crystallization of the two complex structures. For crystallization of the 2:1 complex, E447K was mixed with tRNA<sup>Sec(G-C)</sup> at a molar ratio of 2:1.2 in a buffer containing 2 mM serine, 2 mM AMPPNP, 5 mM <italic>Î²</italic>-ME and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Cocrystals of the 2:1 complex were found in 12% PEG 3350, 0.2 M NaCl and 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After optimization, the best crystals were produced in a reservoir solution with 18% PEG 3350, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 M sodium malonate (pH 7.0). The 2:2 complex was prepared by mixing the E156T/R157S double mutant with tRNA<sup>Sec(G-G)</sup> at a molar ratio of 1:2.4, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> was omitted. All crystals were grown at 25Â°C and the fully-grown crystals were soaked for 2 min in a cryoprotective solution containing all the components of the reservoir solution plus 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The soaked crystals were mounted on a nylon loop and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Data were collected from frozen crystals at â173Â°C using Beamline 17U (BL17U) at the Shanghai Synchrontron Radiation Facility (SSRF, Shanghai, P.R.China). The two data sets were processed with the program <italic>HKL2000</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The E447K cocrystals belong to space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 and diffract to a resolution of 3.55 Ã while the E156T/R157S cocrystals belong to <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub> and diffract to 4.0 Ã resolution. The structures of the complexes were solved by molecular replacement (MR) using <italic>PHENIX</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Both the coordinates of the ligand-bound SerRS (PDB code 4L87 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and the coordinates of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (PDB code 3A3A (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)) were used as the search models and both components were searched simultaneously.

In the process of crystal optimization, we first changed the C2 base in the original tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> sequence to a G. The base opposite to this G was either changed to a complementary base C or left unchanged. The two resulting tRNA molecules, designated tRNA<sup>Sec(G-C)</sup> and tRNA<sup>Sec(G-G)</sup> respectively, were used in separate cocrystallization trials (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Activity assays show that the WT enzyme retains at least 2/3 activity toward the tRNA<sup>Sec(G-G)</sup> substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). We next generated two rounds of mutagenesis on the protein with the purpose to generate diffraction crystals. The first round of mutagenesis was mainly based on the crystal structure of the TtSerRS-TttRNA<sup>Ser</sup> complex (PDB code 1SER) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and we mutated many non-conserved residues in close range to the negatively tRNA molecule to positively charged lysine or arginine residues, in order to form stronger electrostatic interactions between hSerRS and tRNA. This allows us to obtain some low-resolution cocrystal structures (worse than 4.0 Ã). We subsequently analyzed the crystal packing patterns of these structures, and performed the second round of mutagenesis to create possible specific interactions (namely hydrogen bonds or salt bridges) between the symmetry molecules. We tested as many as 34 mutants, among which the E447K and E156T/R157S mutants gave the best results after extensive screening and led to two forms of cocrystals: the E447K-tRNA<sup>Sec(G-C)</sup> complex diffracted to 3.55 Ã, and there were a hSerRS dimer and one tRNA molecule in the asymmetric unit (named the 2:1 complex hereafter); the E156T/R157S-tRNA<sup>Sec(G-G)</sup> complex diffracted to 4.0 Ã and there were a hSerRS dimer and two tRNA molecules in the asymmetric unit (named the 2:2 complex).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The overall view of the hSerRS-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> complexes.

The tRNA acceptor end (G1-C4, C68-A76) and the anticodon loop (G30-U43) are not resolved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3A). The core region of tRNA comes into contacts with the coiled-coil region of subunit 1 while the acceptor end points to the catalytic region of subunit 2.

Like the apoenzyme, the UNE-S domains in both complexes are invisible.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>hSerRSâtRNA<sup>Sec</sup> interactions</title><p>Due to its higher diffraction resolution, we will focus on the 2:1 complex crystal structure to discuss the proteinâtRNA interactions. The interactions are mainly formed between coiled-coil region of the synthetase and the 16-nt variable arm, the D- and TÏC loops of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>. The tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>-facing side in the first long helix of the TBD is mainly comprised of charged or polar residues (referred to as helix 1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4). The OD2 atom of the highly conserved residue D51 is only 3.06 Ã from the N2 atom of G47a and also within 4 Ã distance from the O2â² atom of the ribose in A47k and the O2 atom of C47j (3.96 and 3.93 Ã, respectively). To assess the importance of the critical residues, we created a series of mutants and performed activity assays. We first discovered that 200 nM WT hSerRS keeps a linear initial velocity for up to 15 min under specified reaction conditions (inset in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). For the mutants, we only measured the activities at 2- and 5-min time points to ensure the time points that we chose were well within the linear range. Compared to WT, the activity of the D51A mutant is undetectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref> and Supplementary Figure S5). Semiconserved N54 can donate a hydrogen bond to the O2â² atom of the ribose in A47k while the invariant N58 is capable of forming two hydrogen bonds with the non-bridging oxygens of the phosphate in G47l as well as that of A47k. Similarly, D51 and R47 are near A47k for interactions with the sugar ring, while S61 is also likely to donate a hydrogen bond to the N3 atom of U20. The substitutions of these residues to alanines reduced aminoacylation activities to original 1/3â1/2. Furthermore, two highly conserved residues, R9 and R44 possibly form salt bridges with the phosphate oxygens of U47b and C47c (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Mutations of these two residues to alanines reduced the activities by more than 6- and 50-fold, respectively, suggesting their important roles in tRNA recognition. Interestingly, E447K displayed even slightly higher activity than that of WT enzyme, whereas the double-mutant E156T/R157S retained only â¼10% activity of WT for reasons that are not clear (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Finally, K104 and R107, two basic residues at the beginning of the second long helix (Î±4 in Supplementary Figure S6, referred to as helix 2) in the TBD, are in close distance from the sugar ring and the phosphate oxygen of C56, respectively, and may form contacts from the back of tRNA elbow (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Their alanine substitutions decreased the activities to â¼1/3 of WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). One should note that at 3.55 Ã resolution, the specific interactions can not always be determined with absolute certainty. But in combination with the results from the sequence alignment and activity assays, we can fairly assess the contribution of individual residues to tRNA recognition and aminoacylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Substrate recognition by hSerRS.

The disorder is most likely caused by clashes with the incoming tRNA molecule. Second, the two <italic>Î±</italic>4-helices in the TBDs rotate an angle of â¼6Â° from one to another, and their RMSD is relatively large (1.4 Ã over 112 C<italic>Î±</italic>s) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The ADs of the two subunits are similar, with a RMSD of 0.8 Ã over 320 C<italic>Î±</italic>s. In the 2:2 complex, the two subunits are more similar to each other, but larger differences are also observed in the TBDs. Additionally, the two tRNA molecules in the 2:2 complex are not in the exact same positions relative to their TBDs. By rotating 180Â° around the 2-fold axis of the dimer, we can nearly superimpose the protein molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). However, the acceptor stem of chain B is closer to the TBD of the other subunit, suggesting a tighter binding of chain B than chain D. Additionally, the anticodon regions of tRNAs are at large variations, which is probably due to the fewer contacts with the enzyme in these regions.</p><p>Lastly, the structures of two complexes also exhibit subtle differences. The tRNA position in the 2:2 complex is closer to the active site than that in the 2:1 complex although the TBD domains in the two complexes align well (FigureÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). These structural differences of the protein and RNA molecules between the two complexes or within the same complex, may reflect the intrinsic flexibility and constant adjustments of the TBD to external events like the binding of tRNA substrate.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Flexibility of TBD during serylation</title><p>To test how the flexibility of the TBD affects catalytic efficiencies of hSerRS, we introduced the two mutations at the hinge region of the coiled-coil region: P30G31Y (the mutation of the P30G31 dipeptide to a single tyrosine) and G136V (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These two mutations are intended to make the residues bulkier and hence to restrict the movements of the helical domain.

The error bars are calculated from three measurements.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkv996fig4"/></fig><p>Interestingly, an intra-subunit disulfide bond between C46 (from helix 1 of the TBD) and C117 (from helix 2 of the TBD) is discovered in each monomer of the 2:2 complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The difference map shows obvious continuous positive electron density when the two cysteines are truncated to C<italic>Î²</italic>s (Supplementary Figure S7). During crystallization, pre-added dithiothreitol (DTT) might have lost the reducing power during prolonged exposure to the air and leads to the formation of a disulfide bond between C46 and C117. Since the disulfide bridge may greatly constrain the relative movements of the two helices in the TBD and thus bundles them together, we suspected that this unforeseen linkage might play a role in aminoacylation. Since the formation of the disulfide bond could be easily controlled by oxidation with oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and by reduction with DTT, we could switch on and off the disulfide bridge and examine its effects by activity assays.We first checked the activity loss by oxidizing the WT enzyme with 1 mM GSSG, which only retained â¼16% activity of the untreated enzyme. But the enzyme after the oxidation followed by 10 mM DTT reduction fully recovered its activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). The WT activity gain (defined as the ratio of WT activity with reduction to that with oxidation) is â¼5.2-fold. In comparison, after the same oxidation-reduction cycle, the activity gain of the C46S mutant is only 1.95-fold. A similar trend is also exhibited by the C117S mutant, but to an even lesser extent (1.4-fold). On the other hand, the untreated C46S and C117S mutants exhibit even higher serylation activity than that of WT, suggesting that WT enzyme has been already partially oxidized during the course of protein purification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Therefore, both cysteine-to-serine mutants are less affected in serylation by the oxidation-reduction cycle treatment as reflected by the activity gains, due to their inability to form the disulfide bridge. These results confirmed our hypothesis and indicated that free movements of the TBD are important to the aminoacylation functions of hSerRS, presumably because the movements induced by the binding of tRNA at the TBD are coupled to subsequent binding of the acceptor end of tRNA at the active site.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Characterization of the complex formation in solution</title><p>We observed two types of SerRS-tRNA complexes in crystalline state, and we then tested whether we could obtain the same result in solution. We first checked the elution profile of the complexes formed at various protein/RNA molar ratios on an analytical Superdex 200 column (10/30, GE healthcare). E447K and tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> were mixed in the presence of excessive AMPPNP, in molar ratios ranging from 2:0.3 to 2:4.8. tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> amount was increased gradually while the E447K amount was kept constant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Starting from the 2:0.3 ratio, an extra, faster-moving peak at 11.96 ml forms, indicating the formation of the 2:1 complex. Increase of the ratio to 2:0.6 greatly promoted the peak formation of another complex that eluted at 11.72 ml (the 2:2 complex). As a result, two peaks are obvious although they are still partially overlapping. From ratios 2:1.2 to 2:2.4, two better-resolved, symmetrical peaks are generated. Additionally, the 2:2 complex species dominates over the 2:1 complex. Each fraction of the peaks was analyzed by silver staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. The intensities of the protein and RNA bands increase with RNA, indicating the formation of larger amounts of the complexes (Supplementary Figure S8).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Characterization of solution behavior of hSerRS.

By keeping the protein amount constant while increasing RNA, we saw the formation of the 2:1 complex at ratios of 2:0.3â2:0.6. Starting from 2:1.2, we observed a new, faster-migrating band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), suggesting the binding of the second tRNA molecule. Additionally, comparison of the unbound RNA in the complex samples with the control samples on the left side indicates that less amounts of free tRNA was present in the complexes (lane 5 versus 2, 7 versus 3 and 9 versus 4). This trend holds true for molar ratios up to 2:4.8.</p><p>Last, DLS was also used to characterize the behavior of the enzyme. The major particle size of SerRS alone is around 4.5â5.1 nm, corresponding to a protein size of 115â154 kDa. This calculation is marginally larger than the hSerRS dimer (â¼120 kDa) but is understandable, considering the elongated shape of the hSerRS dimer. The size of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> alone is around 2.5â3.0 nm or â¼30 kDa, which is close to the theoretical value. Interestingly, we saw an increase of the major particle radius accordingly as well as a constant increase in molecular weight â¼70â80 kDa (roughly the size of two tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> molecules) with the increment of tRNA component all the way up to the 2:1.4 ratio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We however did not obtain meaningful data for complex formation under the ratio range of 2:0.3â2:0.6 (the range where the 2:1 complex forms), where protein aggregation occurred and interfered with the sensitive DLS measurements. Taken together, our studies indicate that both stable complexes are authentic in solution and the formation of the 2:2 complex in solution starts from the molar ratio of 2:0.9. We later performed the same set of experiments with the WT enzyme and found that it displayed very similar behavior to E447K in solution (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>tRNA recognition mode of SerRS</title><p>The dimeric hSerRS makes most of the contacts with the variable arm of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> non-specifically using one monomer, and interacts with the acceptor end using the other. This binding mode is quite different from leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) to tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>, another tRNA with a long variable arm (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Aside from the differences between the class I and II synthetases, LeuRS interacts with the elbow of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> as well as the D-arm. All the interactions come from one protein molecule, which justifies the monomeric form as the catalytic form for LeuRS. Additionally, our structure reveals that the hSerRS contacts the tRNA backbone and thus recognizes the tRNA shape rather than specific nucleotides. This binding mode is reminiscent of the crystal structure of TtSerRS in complex with TttRNA<sup>Ser</sup>, and the mutations of individual residues on TtSerRS barely cause significant consequences in aminoacylation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

However, <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is almost completely resolved and contains a 9-bp variable arm, in contrast to the 5-bp arm present in htRNA<sup>Sec</sup>. Additionally, being a non-canonical SerRS, MkSerRS forms six-stranded Î²-sheet and four Î±-helices tRNA-binding module, instead of the coiled-coil observed in the typical SerRSs. Nevertheless, MkSerRS interacts with tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> using this module in a similar fashion to our complex structure, by contacting mainly with the phosphate groups and ribose moieties of nucleotides in variable region as well as the U20:G19:C56 base triple in tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>. The involvement of tRNA serylation by the idiosyncratic N-terminal domain in MkSerRS was in agreement with the biochemical studies conducted by Jaric <italic>etÂ al</italic>. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Based on a docking model, they tested the activities of mutants within the N-terminal region, and proved their involvement in binding and serylation of its cognate substrate tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>. Three positively charged residues, Arg76, Lys79 and Arg94 within the N-terminal domain were found to have a pronounced effect on the ability of the enzyme to serylate cognate tRNA.</p><p>The flexibility of the TBD is essential to aminoacylation. The translational and rotational movements of this region are governed by charged interactions, hydrogen bonds as well as the C46-C117 disulfide bridge. As revealed by the alignment in the Supplementary Figure S6, C46 is conserved only in vertebrate SerRSs while C117 is not conserved. Therefore, the C46âC117 covalent bond is probably a species-specific factor. Intrasubunit disulfide bonds formed upon oxidative stress have been reported to play a crucial role in cellular defense systems against a variety of stress challenges (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). For example, in the brain type creatine kinase, disulfide formation between the residues C74 and C254 can serve as a cellular defense mechanism against intracellular oxidative stress (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Although currently we are not clear about the physiological relevance of the disulfide bond, one possibility is that free radicals lead to the formation of the disulfide bridge on hSerRS in damaged cells, and serylation efficiencies may be affected, which in turn triggers downstream signaling pathways to counteract the harmful effects. Furthermore, we found that mutations at the hinge region P30G31 and G136 (conserved residues in vertebrates) are highly detrimental to aminoacylation activities. Taken together, we speculate that the structural flexibility is the intrinsic nature of the TBD, which is adapted to serylation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Dual substrate specificity</title><p>The idiosyncratic feature of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> and tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is their long variable arms (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), which are the most important identity element of these two closely related tRNA molecules. Their ability to interact with the TBD allows SerRS to distinguish them from normal tRNAs, which usually contain a 3â4 nt variable loop.</p><p>However, previous studies have demonstrated that hSerRS serylates the tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> substrate with only 1/10 efficiency of the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> substrate (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Therefore, the enzyme is still able to distinguish tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> from tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> during the charging process, which is a problem of interest. The TtSerRS-TttRNA<sup>Ser</sup> complex structure reveals that the coiled-coil region from one subunit of SerRS establishes contacts with the variable arm and the TÏC loop of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>, whereas the active site of the other subunit interacts with the acceptor stem. Here, our cocrystal structure may offer an explanation. Modeling studies by superposition of the SerRS from our complex with the TtSerRS-TttRNA<sup>Ser</sup> complex suggest that hSerRS could adjust the orientation of the coiled-coil region to respond to similar cognate tRNA substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However in tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, G19 and U20 in the D-loop and C56 in the T-loop form a characteristic base triple, U20:G19:C56 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>, the G19:C56 base pair is conserved (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (Supplementary Figure S10). In the tertiary interaction U20:G19:C56, U20 is bulged out and becomes accessible to the solvent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). There is only partial electron density for the U20 base ring but its backbone is clearly visible. The position of U20 is unique, because the corresponding base U20 in tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or C20 in TttRNA<sup>Ser</sup> points to the inside of these tRNA molecules. When in contact with the enzyme, the N3 atom of U20 is only 3.8 Ã from OG of highly conserved S61. In addition to the stem-loop pattern differences in the D- and T-regions (6 bp + 4 nt in D-region and 4 bp in the T-arm in tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> versus 4 bp + 8 nt in D-region and 5 bp in the T-arm in tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>), this unique base triple present in the elbow region may form the structural basis for SerRS to recognize tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> and thus distinguish two highly similar tRNA structures. The ability of hSerRS to distinguish two tRNA substrates is reasonable and is consistent with the needs of living species. There are only about 25 Sec-containing enzymes in human but practically every human protein contains serine. Serylation of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> by hSerRS is in much higher demands than serylation of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>. Higher serylation efficiency of the former ensures that Ser-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> is in an ample supply when serine is needed for protein synthesis. Similarly, other enzymes in the rest of the Sec biosynthetic route also make contacts with the D-loop of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which can be readily distinguished from tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> due to either the characteristic 4 nt D-loop in tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, or the differences of the base triple in the elbow region. Therefore, this structural feature may serve as important identity elements not only for the serylation of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, but also for the following steps in Sec generation.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The mechanism by SerRS to distinguish two similar tRNA substrates.

In addition, binding behavior characterization of yeast SerRS by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has shown that yeast SerRS can also bind to tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> in both 2:1 and 2:2 stoichiometry (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). EMSA experiments of the native and crosslinked SerRS-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> complex, as well as the pyrophosphate exchange assay suggest that two tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> binding sites on this enzyme are not equivalent, consistent with previous calculation (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Recently, French <italic>etÂ al</italic>. have shown that the SepSecS tetramer is able to bind to one or two tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> molecules (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), but the binding preference of hSerRS to tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is not clear. In this study, we obtained two types of complexes of crystals in different stoichiometry to rule out the possibility of crystallization artifacts. We went on further through size-exclusion chromatography studies, EMSA and DLS analyses to demonstrate that hSerRS remains the ability to form the same types of complexes in solution. Whether these complexes are both biologically relevant is not the focus of our research and is also beyond the scope of this study.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-4"><title>Consequences for Sec biosynthesis</title><p>PSTK accesses the tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> acceptor stem from the major groove and makes contacts with the D-arm using the C-terminal three-helix bundle. By superposition of the two tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> molecules in their complex forms, we found that the catalytic domain in the two structures partially overlap. Interestingly, their RNA-recognition elements (the coiled-coil region of SerRS and the three-helix bundle domain of PSTK), complement each other well (Supplementary Figure S11A). Together these tRNA-recognition domains form a ring structure and wrap around the tRNA substrate. This raises the possibility that SerRS, PSTK and tRNA form a transient ternary complex during the substrate channeling process. We could speculate that upon the synthesis of Ser-tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, PSTK approaches tRNA from the D-arm, and competes SerRS off the substrate by shoveling against SerRS with its catalytic domain. SerRS gradually loses âgripâ on the acceptor end and eventually becomes released from tRNA (Supplementary Figure S11B).</p></sec></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession codes 4RQF and 4RQE for the 2:1 and 2:2 complexes, respectively.</p></sec>
