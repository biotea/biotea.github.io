        <p>Somech and colleagues identify two new mutations in STN1 that causes Coats plus syndrome and telomere abnormalities in human, recapitulated in a zebra fish model.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The analysis of individuals with telomere defects may shed light on the delicate interplay of factors controlling genome stability, premature aging, and cancer. We herein describe two Coats plus patients with telomere and genomic defects; both harbor distinct, novel mutations in <italic>STN1</italic>, a member of the human CTC1âSTN1âTEN1 (CST) complex, thus linking this gene for the first time to a human telomeropathy. We characterized the patientsâ phenotype, recapitulated it in a zebrafish model and rescued cellular and clinical aspects by the ectopic expression of wild-type STN1 or by thalidomide treatment. Interestingly, a significant lengthy control of the gastrointestinal bleeding in one of our patients was achieved by thalidomide treatment, exemplifying a successful bed-to-bench-and-back approach.</p>

  <body><p>Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes essential for protecting the chromosome ends from degradation, activation of the DNA damage response, and end-to-end fusion (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">de Lange, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jain and Cooper, 2010</xref>). Abnormally short or otherwise deprotected telomeres compromise replicative potential and genome stability (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bodnar et al., 1998</xref>). Accelerated telomere attrition is associated with several inherited and noninherited human conditions termed telomeropathies (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Holohan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Townsley et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to the well described shelterin complex (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Diotti and Loayza, 2011</xref>), the human CST (CTC1âSTN1âTEN1) complex plays multiple roles in telomere C-strand synthesis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Lingner, 2013</xref>), as well as genome-wide replication and the recovery from replication stress (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). This conserved trimeric complex binds the telomeric G-strand, promotes the synthesis of the C-strand, and inhibits telomerase-mediated telomere elongation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Miyake et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of the CST complex in human and mouse cells affects telomere length and telomeric C-strand synthesis, leading to elongated 3â² overhangs (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of the CST complex is evidenced also by the occurrence of Coats plus syndrome in individuals affected by bi-allelic <italic>CTC1</italic> mutations (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Polvi et al., 2012</xref>). Such patients present with cranial calcifications, bone marrow failure, severe anemia, premature hair graying, osteoporosis, exudative retinopathy, and retinal telangiectasia, intestinal ectasia, and liver fibrosis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Polvi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Walne et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To date, germline mutations in either <italic>STN1</italic> (also designated <italic>OBFC1</italic>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2009</xref>) or <italic>TEN1</italic> have not been described.

Both patients had intrauterine growth retardation and, later in life, presented with premature aging symptoms, including poor growth, graying hair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), liver fibrosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, brain calcifications, white matter changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), osteopenia, pancytopenia, and hypocellular bone marrow (&lt;5% of normal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).

P1 succumbed at the age of 16 yr as a result of massive gastrointestinal bleeding, despite multiple treatments. In contrast, gastrointestinal bleeding in P2 was successfully managed with thalidomide treatment (100 mg daily), along with argon plasma coagulation. This patient became free of GI bleeding after initiation of thalidomide treatment. Blood transfusions were required only as a result of his bone marrow failure.</p></sec><sec id="s03"><title>Genetic evaluation</title><p>In both patients, consanguinity suggested autosomal recessive inheritance and the clinical constellation was suggestive of Coats plus syndrome (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Holohan et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, direct dideoxy-sequencing of the <italic>CTC1</italic> coding region was normal. Whole-exome sequencing performed for patients 1 and 2, yielded 1,143 and 1,076 homozygous variants that affect protein sequences, respectively. This list of variants was subsequently reduced to 67 and 53 (Table S2) rare variants for patients 1 and 2, respectively, by filtering out variants present in â¥0.01 of our in-house exomes (<italic>n</italic> = 250) and variants present with a minor allele frequency â¥0.01 in either the 1000 Genomes Project (1KG), dbSNP 135 database, or the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). Recessive analysis reduced the variants list of patient 1 to 12 candidate genes (Table S2). The only gene common to both lists was <italic>STN1</italic>, with a distinct homozygous mutation in each patient. STN1 was pursued because of its telomeric role and interaction with CTC1 within the CST complex (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Miyake et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bryan et al., 2013</xref>). Dideoxy Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) confirmed the presence of a different missense mutation in each patient (P1: c.404G&gt;C; p. Arg135Thr, AGA to ACA; P2, c.469G&gt;T; p. Asp157Tyr, GAC to TAC) in exons 5 and 6, respectively. Several observations support the pathogenic nature of these <italic>STN1</italic> mutations. First, mutation analysis in both families suggested a possible segregation with the disease. Second, they were absent from genome databases, as well as in 160 ethnically matched control alleles (unpublished data). Third, the mutations occurred in evolutionary highly conserved positions in vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Fourth, mapping of the mutations on the complete three-dimensional structure of wild-type hSTN1 suggested that they destabilize the protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref> and Table S3). Protein extracts from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of both patients demonstrated marginal differences in the level of <italic>STN1</italic> protein compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Abnormal cellular phenotypes of <italic>Stn1</italic> mutant patients' cells</title><p>Primary fibroblasts of both patients were abnormally large, contained cytoplasmic vacuoles and extended podia (not depicted), grew poorly in culture, and ceased to proliferate at a very low population doubling (PD; P1 at PD 2.8 and P2 at PD 4.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Control samples reached senescence at PDs 68.7 and 65.81, after 147 and 126 d in culture, respectively (unpublished data). DAPI staining of both patients' fibroblasts revealed apoptotic nuclei, high rates of micronuclei, intact or torn DNA bridges between nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), and Î³-H2AX foci at levels comparable to control normal fibroblasts at senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These findings support growth arrest caused by premature cellular senescence linked to STN1 loss-of-function, as previously described (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boccardi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, SA-Î²-Gal staining was not found to be prominent (unpublished data). Apoptosis caused by STN1 depletion has also previously been demonstrated in STN1 knockdown cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2010</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that both cellular senescence and apoptosis are instigated by STN1 loss-of-function. Cell cycle analysis showed compromised ability to release cells from S-phase after replication stress in both patients compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and Table S4). Consistent with this observation and similar to previous findings (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>), EdU uptake after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, was significantly lower in both patients compared with control (76% [P1] and 56.7% [P2] of control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). These findings support a marked attenuation in the recovery from replication fork stalling induced by HU treatment in <italic>STN1</italic> mutant fibroblasts. Both the poor cell growth and the lower EdU uptake were partially or fully rescued, respectively, by WT STN1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>), in P2 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the patient cells display replication aberrancies caused by the <italic>STN1</italic> mutations.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations in human <italic>STN1</italic> result in abnormal cellular phenotypes.</bold> (A) Fibroblasts from two healthy controls, the patients P1 and P2, and P2 cells expressing WT STN1 were grown, and cumulative PDs were calculated at each time point.

(C) STN1-mutated fibroblasts P1 (PD 2) and P2 (PD 3.5), and control fibroblasts at two PDs (PD 42 and PD 59) were stained with an antibody for Î³-H2AX, and then scored for the number of Î³-H2AX foci per cell. The number of foci per cell is depicted by the color code to the right and displayed in the graph as the percentage of total scored cells. At least 100 nuclei were scored for each sample per each independent analysis. Data are representative of two independent repeats for all samples with the exception of the control at PD42, whose analysis was performed once.

Consistent with the short telomeres detected by Southern analysis, P2 PBLs displayed a significantly higher rate of telomere loss by FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). CTC1-deficient patients display variable telomere length, thus excessive telomere shortening is not considered a hallmark of Coats plus (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Polvi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Walne et al., 2013</xref>).

Because compromised C-strand fill-in synthesis at the telomere ends is expected to result in the elongation of the telomeric G-rich overhang, we examined the G-overhang by in-gel hybridization of a C-rich telomeric probe to native DNA. PBLs from both patients displayed dramatically increased amounts of single-stranded G-rich telomeric DNA when normalized to noncarrier controls (4.5- and 2.2-fold increase for P1 and P2, P values of 0.019 and 0.057 by one-tail Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations in <italic>STN1</italic> result in abnormal telomere phenotypes.</bold> (A) DNA samples, prepared from PBLs of patient P1, her heterozygous father (F1), and a noncarrier sibling (S1) and patient P2, his heterozygous mother (M2), and two independent control samples (C), were analyzed by in-gel hybridization.

Single-stranded C-rich telomeric sequences were not detected by the G-rich probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Dysfunctional telomeres have been associated with enhanced telomeric recombination (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brault and Autexier, 2011</xref>), and, indeed, we observed elevated telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE) in P2 PBLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the <italic>STN1</italic> mutations identified in the patients are associated with abnormal telomere C-strand synthesis. Southern analysis of telomere length in P2 fibroblasts at two consecutive passages indicated normal telomere length (unpublished data). However, notably, telomere-FISH on these fibroblasts revealed that the majority of the metaphases contain at least one fused chromosome end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Moreover, the short replicative capacity of P1 and P2 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) suggested that telomeric defects are present in both patientsâ fibroblasts. DNA damage at telomeres constitutes a hallmark of telomere dysfunction in senescent primary fibroblasts, but rarely occurs in early passage fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kaul et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, analysis of telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) indicated that TIF levels in early passage P1 and P2 fibroblasts are comparable to those detected in late passage, presenescent cells (P1, 33.3%; P2, 35.8%; presenescent control, 42.2%; P &gt; 0.19; two-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>).

Analogous to the patients, they exhibited a drastic decrease in the number of red blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and an arrest in T cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The number of lyc<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and thrombocytes was dramatically elevated in comparison to uninjected controls (unpublished data). We presume that this myeloid expansion results from a myeloid bias among hematopoietic progenitors, which often accompanies dysfunction of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow failure syndromes. Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>Stn1</italic> also increased vascularity (enlarged vascular bed and expanded, but fragmented, vessels), as indicated by the increased number of <italic>fli1:EGFP</italic> marked blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The increased vascularity was further confirmed by angiography in <italic>stn1</italic>-morpholinoâtreated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>) and resembles the telangiectatic changes found in both patients with <italic>STN1</italic> mutations. This specific phenotype was improved in <italic>stn1</italic>-morpholinoâtreated embryos after thalidomide treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). The phenotype correction was similar to the clinical effect observed in P2 after thalidomide treatment. Moreover, the telangiectatic changes were rescued by ectopic expression of <italic>STN1</italic>, but not by the mutant allele of either patient, thereby directly tying the phenotype to the mutant <italic>STN1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>A zebrafish model for human STN1 deficiency.</bold> (A) To detect anemia in situ hybridization was performed on control and <italic>stn1</italic>-ATG-morphant embryos at five days after fertilization (dpf) using an anti-sense É-e1 probe.

As part of the CST complex, STN1 interacts with and stimulates the activity of DNA polymerase Î±-primase (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Casteel et al., 2009</xref>). It also plays a role in genome-wide replication restart after HU-induced replication fork stalling, likely by facilitating dormant origin firing (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kasbek et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, stable knockdown of STN1 increased the incidence of micronuclei, anaphase bridges, and multitelomeric signals (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, we show that cells from <italic>STN1</italic> mutant patients display elevated numbers of micronuclei and nuclear bridges, as well as decreased EdU uptake after HU treatment, suggesting defective recovery from induced fork stalling. These findings reinforce the assigned roles of STN1 in nontelomeric genomic regions. Furthermore, our findings of abnormal telomeric phenotypes are in line with previous studies, indicating that STN1 is critical for promoting telomere C-strand synthesis and maintenance (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, although the overall telomere length of the <italic>STN1</italic> mutant PBLs was not strikingly abnormal, with only one of the two patients showing relatively short telomeres, both our patients demonstrated extremely long single-stranded G-rich telomeric sequences, which could abrogate telomere protection and activate DNA damage response and repair by homologous recombination (resulting in telomere sister chromatid exchange) or by nonhomologous end joining (forming telomereâtelomere fusions). The high level of TIFs in the <italic>STN1</italic>-mutated fibroblasts suggests a significant contribution of telomere defects to the severely compromised replication capacity of these cells.</p><p>The clinical phenotypes of the patients, including gastrointestinal telangiectatic changes and bleeding can be attributed to the mutant <italic>STN1</italic> alleles, as these effects were recapitulated, in our study, in the zebrafish model and rescued by the normal but not the mutated human <italic>STN1</italic> alleles. Effective therapeutic strategies for severe GI bleeding caused by telangiectatic changes in patients suffering from telomeropathies are in great need and therapeutic approaches, such as using a combination of oral estrogen and progesterone to control GI bleeding in Coats plus patients, have been proposed (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Briggs et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, a significant, lengthy control of the GI bleeding in one of our patients was achieved by thalidomide treatment. Nevertheless, this effect should be viewed in light of the partial response to therapy (the patient still needs blood transfusions) and the limited duration of treatment. The efficacy of thalidomide lies in its potent inhibition of angiogenesis through the regulation of angiogenesis growth factors levels (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Folkman, 2001</xref>). Strikingly, the <italic>stn1</italic>-morpholinoâtreated zebrafish embryos displayed dramatic vascularization regression after thalidomide administration, illustrating a fruitful bed-to-bench-and-back approach.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings described here further confirm the role of STN1 in DNA replication at both telomeric and nontelomeric regions and have implications for diagnosis and treatment of Coats plus, as well as other telomeropathies and genome instability diseases. Precisely how the <italic>STN1</italic> mutations cause the disease characteristics, and how much of the features can be attributed to telomere or genome-wide replication defects, or to other defects not related to DNA replication, are yet to be explored.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s07"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s08"><title/><sec id="s09"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were studied at the Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Israel.
