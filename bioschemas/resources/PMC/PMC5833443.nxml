        <p id="Par1">While aberrant cancer cell growth is frequently associated with altered biochemical metabolism, normal mitochondrial functions are usually preserved and necessary for full malignant transformation. The transcription factor FoxO3A is a key determinant of cancer cell homeostasis, playing a dual role in survival/death response to metabolic stress and cancer therapeutics. We recently described a novel mitochondrial arm of the AMPK-FoxO3A axis in normal cells upon nutrient shortage. Here, we show that in metabolically stressed cancer cells, FoxO3A is recruited to the mitochondria through activation of MEK/ERK and AMPK, which phosphorylate serine 12 and 30, respectively, on FoxO3A N-terminal domain. Subsequently, FoxO3A is imported and cleaved to reach mitochondrial DNA, where it activates expression of the mitochondrial genome to support mitochondrial metabolism. Using FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cancer cells generated with the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system and reconstituted with FoxO3A mutants being impaired in their nuclear or mitochondrial subcellular localization, we show that mitochondrial FoxO3A promotes survival in response to metabolic stress. In cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents, accumulation of FoxO3A into the mitochondria promoted survival in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner, while mitochondrial FoxO3A was required for apoptosis induction by metformin. Elucidation of FoxO3A mitochondrial vs. nuclear functions in cancer cell homeostasis might help devise novel therapeutic strategies to selectively disable FoxO3A prosurvival activity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Carcinogenesis is a multistep process by which normal cells evolve to a neoplastic state by acquiring a succession of cancer hallmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Tumor cell homeostasis is sustained by the balance between these newly acquired oncogenic features and pre-existing cellular functions. Paradigmatic in this regard is the reprogramming of energy metabolism, where normal cellular processes providing increased energy production, macromolecular biosynthesis, and redox balance maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> are ensured by the preservation of key mitochondrial functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par3">Consistent with this view, proteins that have been classically considered as tumor suppressors are sometimes required to be functional for full malignant transformation. This is the case for FoxO3A, which can be both friend and foe to cancer cells depending on the cellular context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">FoxO3A belongs to the FoxO (Forkhead-box O) family of transcription factors, together with FoxO1, FoxO4 and FoxO6, which are evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In mammals, FoxO3A functions are mediated by the activation of a coordinated transcriptional program involving genes that regulate cell cycle control, cell death, cell metabolism, redox balance, DNA repair and autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. As all these genes share the conserved consensus core recognition motif FHRE (5â²TTGTTTAC3â²) within their DNA regulatory regions, expression specificity is ensured by additional regulation mechanisms such as phosphorylation-dependent subcellular localization, whereby some kinases trigger FoxO3A nuclear exclusion and subsequent cytoplasmic degradation (AKT and IKKÃ) and others enable its nuclear localization and transcriptional activation (p38 and AMPK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These enzymes define the so-called âmolecular FOXO codeâ, which is critical for the fine-tuned regulation of FoxO factorsâ different functions. FoxO3A has emerged as a major sensor for metabolic stress and chemotherapeutic drug response in cancer cells, playing a dual role at the crossroad between survival and death. In metabolically stressed cancer cells, activation of the FoxO3A-dependent transcriptional program first leads to autophagy and cell cycle arrest as an attempt to retain energy and increase ATP levels to survive, but then triggers cell death under persistent stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Consistently, in cancer cells undergoing therapy-induced genotoxic stress, FoxO3A is involved in detoxification and DNA repair thereby promoting survival, while its pro-apoptotic function likely reflects an irreparable level of damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">Recently, we reported that glucose restriction causes the AMPK-dependent accumulation of FoxO3A into the mitochondria of normal fibroblasts and muscle cells in culture, followed by the formation of a transcriptional complex containing FoxO3A, SIRT3 and the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAPOL) at mitochondrial DNA regulatory regions, thereby promoting expression of the mitochondrial genome and a subsequent increase in oxygen consumption. These results were confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> in tissues of fasting mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, thus revealing a mitochondrial arm of the AMPK-FoxO3A axis operating as a recovery mechanism to sustain cellular metabolism upon nutrient shortage and metabolic stress.</p>
      <p id="Par6">Here, we characterize this novel FoxO3A function in cancer cells and provide compelling molecular evidence that in metabolically stressed cancer cells and tumors FoxO3A is recruited to the mitochondrial surface in a MEK/ERK- and AMPK-dependent manner, while only the MEK/ERK signal is required in cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents. After cleavage of its N-terminal domain, FoxO3A is imported into the mitochondrial matrix where it activates a transcriptional program leading to cancer cell survival. On the other hand, mitochondrial FoxO3A (mtFoxO3A) is required for apoptosis induction in cancer cells treated with metformin.</p>

In LG, anti-FoxO3A antibodies revealed the presence of two bands in the whole mitochondria fraction (at around 90 and 70âkDa), while after PK treatment only the 70âkDa band was detected into the organelles (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d, e</xref> and Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). These results indicate that anti-FoxO3A antibodies recognized the full-length protein (90âkDa band) bound outside of the mitochondria, while inside the organelle they detected a shorter 70âkDa form. These findings were confirmed by treating cells with 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) or iodoacetic acid (IA), two diverse glycolysis inhibitors that induce metabolic stress (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Of note, a similar migration pattern was observed <italic>in vivo</italic> when analyzing mitochondria isolated from different mouse tissues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref> and Supplementary FigureÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par9">To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a shorter form of FoxO3A and suggests that FoxO3A may be processed similar to canonical mitochondrial proteins. To rule out non-specific antibody binding, we transfected a vector-expressing FoxO3A FLAG-tagged at the C-terminal domain (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) in glucose-restricted HCT116 and HEK293 cells. Anti-FLAG antibodies revealed two bands (90 and 70âkDa) corresponding to exogenous FoxO3A in the purified mitochondrial fraction, while only the 70âkDa band was detected after addition of PK (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Consistently, glucose-restricted HCT116 cells transfected with a newly generated vector-expressing FoxO3A tagged both at the N-terminus (with HA) and at the C-terminus (with FLAG) showed the presence of both signals (HA and FLAG) at 90âkDa in purified mitochondria, while only a 70âkDa band was detected by anti-FLAG antibodies after PK treatment (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Finally, we deleted the entire N-terminus (aa 1â148) from FoxO3A-FLAG and assessed its ability to localize at the mitochondria. Our data indicate that amino acids 1â148 are required for FoxO3A localization at, and translocation into the mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>FoxO3A is cleaved at its N-terminus upon translocation into the mitochondria of normal and cancer cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Scheme of plasmids used. <bold>bâe</bold> Cells were transfected with the indicated FoxO3A plasmids for 48âh; upon LG (0.75âmM glucose, 24âh), purified mitochondria were treated with PK alone or with PK and Triton X-100.

        <p id="Par10">To further characterize FoxO3A N-terminus, we searched for mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP) consensus motifs and found partially overlapping R-2, R-3, and R-10 motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> in sequence ARVLAPGGQD of FoxO3A region 98â108 (Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Thus, we generated a FLAG-tagged vector encoding for FoxO3A-Î80-108 and found that it was able to localize atÂ -but impaired in translocating into-Â the mitochondria, as shown by the absence of the 70âkDa band (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par11">We then purified mitochondria from metabolically stressed HCT116 and HEK293 cells and performed an immunoblot analysis of endogenous FoxO3A with two antibodies, one directed against the N-terminus, which only detected a single band of around 90âkDa in the whole mitochondria fraction, and the other targeting the C-terminal domain, which recognized both the 90âkDa and the 70âkDa bands in whole mitochondria and only the 70âkDa band inside the organelles (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Moreover, genetic silencing using two FoxO3A-specific siRNAs confirmed that the 70âkDa band detected inside the mitochondria is a shorter form of endogenous FoxO3A (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Further PK protection assays confirmed that endogenous FoxO3A is translocated into the mitochondria and reaches the matrix in its cleaved 70âkDa form (FoxO3A-cl.) (Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>b, S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2c</xref>).

        <p id="Par12">These data indicate that FoxO3A N-terminus (aa 1â148) is required for proper recruitment to the mitochondria, with residues 98â108 being necessary for FoxO3A cleavage and import into the mitochondrial matrix.

        <title>Phosphorylation at S12 and S30 of FoxO3A N-terminus is required for mitochondrial accumulation in metabolically stressed cancer cells</title>
        <p id="Par13">FoxO3A N-terminus (aa 1â148) has been poorly characterized, except for threonine 32, which represents a well-known target of AKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, we searched for novel residues that could be targeted by signaling pathways transducing extracellular stimuli. Based on our in silico analysis with NETPHOS 2.0 and DISPHOS 1.3 servers, only six serines (12, 26, 30, 43, 48 and 55) reached a significant threshold score (&gt;0.6) with both tools (Supplementary Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

        <p id="Par14">To test whether these serines were involved in FoxO3A accumulation into the mitochondria, we mutagenized them to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5a</xref>) and expressed the indicated FoxO3A FLAG-tagged proteins in glucose-restricted cancer cells. Our data show that alanine substitution at position 12 or 30 impaired the ability of full-length FoxO3A (FoxO3A-fl.) to be recruited at the outer membrane and to localize inside the mitochondria in its cleaved form (FoxO3A-cl.) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Furthermore, concomitant substitution of both serines (S12A/S30A) completely abrogated FoxO3A mitochondrial localization (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, d), suggesting that S12 and S30 are both required for FoxO3A translocation into the mitochondria in metabolically stressed cancer cells. These data were confirmed with a vector encoding for a FoxO3A mutant lacking the initial 30 residues of the N-terminal domain [FoxO3A-Î1-30-FLAG], which was found to be severely impaired in mitochondrial localization (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation at S12 and S30 of FoxO3A N-terminus is required for mitochondrial accumulation in metabolically stressed cancer cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Scheme of FoxO3A-WT-FLAG and mutated FoxO3A-FLAG plasmids obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. <bold>b</bold>,<bold> c</bold> HCT116 cells were transfected with the indicated FoxO3A-WT-FLAG and mutant plasmids for 48âh.

        <p id="Par15">Since AMPK is involved in FoxO3A mitochondrial accumulation in normal cells under glucose deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we performed a comparative analysis between well-known AMPK consensus phosphorylation motifs and the amino acid sequence surrounding FoxO3A serines located at the N-terminal domain. Our findings suggest that S30 could represent a novel AMPK phosphorylation site in FoxO3A (Supplementary Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Likewise, Kinasephos 2.0 analysis predicted that S12 could be part of an ERK consensus phosphorylation motif (Ser-Pro). Thus, we characterized glucose-restricted HCT116 cells and observed that both AMPK and ERK kinases were phospho-activated in these culture conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) and could be localized at the mitochondria together with FoxO3A (Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5b</xref>). Of note, pharmacological inhibition of the MEK/ERK or the AMPK pathway by PD98059 or compound C (CC), respectively, significantly prevented FoxO3A localization at (FoxO3A-fl.) and accumulation into (FoxO3A-cl.) the mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>). Furthermore, activation of AMPK by AICAR significantly induced FoxO3A mitochondrial processing and import, as shown by its cleaved form levels, even in HG culture conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par16">To confirm the hypothesis that S12 and S30 were targeted by ERK and AMPK, respectively, we generated two GST-FoxO3A constructs, one encoding for the N-terminal domain [GST-FoxO3A(1â148)], and the other for a region encompassing residues 386â525 [GST-FoxO3A(386â525)] and containing serines previously shown to be targeted by both AMPK (S399 and S413)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and ERK (S425)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). Moreover, the GST-FoxO3A(1â148) vector was mutagenized by serine/alanine substitution at positions 12 and/or 30 to obtain the constructs GST-FoxO3A(1â148)S12A, GST-FoxO3A(1â148)S30A and GST-FoxO3A(1â148)S12A/S30A (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). The indicated purified proteins were subjected to a kinase assay to test the ability of AMPK and ERK to directly phosphorylate their candidate residues <italic>in vitro</italic>. Data presented in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref> show that ERK could efficiently phosphorylate GST-FoxO3A(1â148) as well as the positive control [GST-FoxO3A(386â525)], and that the S12A substitution was sufficient to significantly abrogate <sup>32</sup>P. incorporation in GST-FoxO3A(1â148). Similar results were obtained with the S12A/S30A double-mutant, indicating that ERK directly phosphorylated FoxO3A at serine 12. To ascertain whether S30 could be phosphorylated by AMPK, we assayed GST-FoxO3A(1â148) and GST-FoxO3A(385â525) with AMPK and found that AMPK efficiently phosphorylated FoxO3A N-terminus <italic> in vitro</italic> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3m</xref>). Serine-to-alanine substitution at position 30 abolished the radioactive labeling and similar results were obtained with the S12A/S30A double-mutant, thus indicating that AMPK phosphorylates FoxO3A at S30 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par17">Of note, S30 is more conserved across species than S12 (Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4a</xref>) and is part of a highly conserved subdomain, which is shared by other human FoxOs, while S12 is not (Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>

Further, ChIP analyses performed on endogenous proteins from mitochondria purified from different human cancer cell lines and HEK293 cells confirmed that FoxO3A-cl. is recruited at FHRE sites together with SIRT3, TFAM and mtRNAPOL in glucose-restricted cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, f</xref> and Supplementary Figure S<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>a, S<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6b</xref>), and that these proteins form a complex into the matrix (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

Immunoblot analysis revealed the accumulation of both FoxO3A forms in fasted mice, suggesting that nutrient shortage caused localization of the transcription factor at the outer mitochondrial membrane (FoxO3A-fl.) and its subsequent import, cleavage, and translocation into the mitochondrial matrix (FoxO3A-cl.)

        <title>Role of mtFoxO3A in cancer cell response to metabolic stress</title>
        <p id="Par23">To evaluate the role of FoxO3A in tumor cells subjected to metabolic stress or treated with cancer therapeutics, HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cells were cultured in LG conditions or in the presence of drugs currently administered to colorectal cancer patients and whose activity has been shown to involve FoxO3A in cellular models (metformin, cisplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and etoposide)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cells were more sensitive to metabolic stress and chemotherapeutics than their wild-type isogenic counterparts, suggesting that the presence of FoxO3A results in resistance and survival (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Conversely, HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>+/+</sup> cells were more sensitive to metformin treatment than HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Then, we cultured several human cancer cell lines and HEK293 cells in LG conditions to assay their resistance under metabolic stress. Our results showed that the higher the amount of mtFoxO3A they accumulated, the more they survived in LG cultures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), suggesting that mtFoxO3A could represent a survival factor in these conditions. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted FoxO3A expression in HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cells by transfection with FLAG-tagged vectors encoding for FoxO3A-wt, the unphosphorylatable double-mutant FoxO3A-S12A/S30A (impaired in its mitochondrial localization, but still able to localize into the nucleus and bind target genes, see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4iâm</xref>) or FoxO3A-Î242-271 (which lacks the NLS, but is able to enter the mitochondria and bind FHRE sites at mtDNA, see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4nâp</xref>) and cultured them in LG conditions. Our results showed that reconstitution of FoxO3A-wt expression results in increased survival; of note, FoxO3A-Î242-271 was still able to rescue metabolic stress-dependent cell death, while the mutant impaired in mitochondrial localization failed to do so (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of FoxO3A target gene expression revealed that both the wild-type form and the Î242-271 mutant were able to activate mitochondrial transcription in surviving cells, while the FoxO3A-S12A/S30A mutant contributed to apoptosis induction in metabolically stressed cancer cells by promoting <italic>BIM</italic> transcription (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Subsequently, we transfected FoxO3A knockout cells with GFP-tagged vectors encoding for FoxO3A-wt, FoxO3A-S12A/S30A, or FoxO3A-Î242-271, then we induced metabolic stress by adding 2-DG and performed TMRE staining to visualize the polarization status of mitochondrial membranes in GFP-positive cells. Our data indicate that mtFoxO3A is required to maintain the membrane potential of functionally active and healthy mitochondria in cancer cells subjected to metabolic stress (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Indeed, TMRE failed to stain mitochondria of HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cells transfected with the FoxO3A-S12A/S30A mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), as they were undergoing apoptosis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). These results highlighted the functional importance of FoxO3A S12 and S30 residues, together with the activation of pathways dictating their phosphorylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>), in cancer cell resistance to metabolic stress, and prompted us to evaluate the inhibition of the MEK/ERK and/or the AMPK pathway in HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>+/+</sup> cells cultured in LG conditions. Of note, trametinib (a MEK inhibitor approved by the FDA for clinical use) and CC (an AMPK inhibitor) showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect in metabolically stressed cancer cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). In order to confirm these results <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>+/+</sup> cells in nude mice and treated growing tumors with 2-DG to induce metabolic stress. Our results reveal that activation of both the MEK/ERK and the AMPK pathways is induced in tumor tissues upon metabolic stress, together with FoxO3A mitochondrial localization, similar to what happens in culture (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>mtFoxO3A is involved in cancer cell response to metabolic stress.</title><p><bold>a</bold> HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>+/+</sup> and HCT116-FoxO3A<sup>â/â</sup> cells were subjected to different treatments: glucose restriction (LG, 0.75âmM glucose, 24âh), metformin (MET, 10âÎ¼M, 72âh), cisplatin (CDDP, 30âÎ¼M, 48âh), irinotecan (CPT-11, 30âÎ¼M, 24âh), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 2âÎ¼M, 24âh) and etoposide (VP-13, 40âÎ¼M, 24âh).

      <p id="Par26">Recent advances in cancer understanding suggest that the âWarburg effectâ should be reconsidered in its interpretation of the role of mitochondria in tumorigenesis. Indeed, although aberrant tumor cell growth is frequently associated with alterations of biochemical metabolism, mitochondrial function is not usually impaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In fact, large studies conducted to examine the mutational status of the mitochondrial genome in tumors revealed that detrimental and pathogenic mtDNA mutations are negatively selected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, implying that selective pressure for mitochondrial genome function preservation is a common feature in human tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In addition to respiration, mitochondria are the powerhouse for bioenergetics and biosynthetic pathways that are required for tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, understanding the role of mitochondrial function in cancer might reveal novel approaches to targeted cancer therapy. Indeed, recent reports suggested that cancer cells are highly susceptible to the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, and that mitochondrial translation inhibitors can act as sensitizers to cancer therapeutics and chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Consistently, our results indicated that MEK inhibition by trametinib synergized with AMPK inhibitors in reducing survival under metabolic stress, and with irinotecan in inducing cytotoxicity in colorectal cancer cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Importantly, combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents is predicted to overcome resistance mechanisms and potentiate the antitumor activity of each single agent, and various phase II/III trials based on such approaches are currently ongoing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>FoxO3A represents a survival factor in metabolically stressed cancer cells.</title><p>Normal cells and tissues under metabolic stress require only the AMPK signal on S30 to direct FoxO3A into the mitochondria. It seems that ERK involvement in FoxO3A mitochondrial localization is exclusive to tumor cells, which reveals a critical difference between normal and cancer cells that could be exploited for cancer therapeutics. In metabolically stressed cancer cells, FoxO3A is recruited to the mitochondria through activation of MEK/ERK and AMPK, which phosphorylate serine 12 and 30, respectively, on FoxO3A N-terminal domain. Subsequently, FoxO3A is imported and cleaved to reach mitochondrial DNA, where it activates expression of the mitochondrial genome to support mitochondrial metabolism. In cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents, accumulation of FoxO3A into the mitochondria promoted survival in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner, while mitochondrial FoxO3A was required for apoptosis induction by metformin</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41419_2018_336_Fig8_HTML" id="d29e1572"/></fig></p>
