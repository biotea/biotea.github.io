        <p id="Par1">HSV-2 is one of the most common sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide and HSV-2 infection triggers cytokine and chemokine production. However, little is known about which HSV-2 genes engage in the regulation of NF-ÎºB signaling and what mechanisms are involved. In a screen of the unique short (Us) regions of HSV-2, we observed that HSV-2 Us2 activates NF-ÎºB signaling. We additionally indicated that deficiencies of Us2 decrease HSV-2 WT mediated NF-ÎºB activation and cytokine and chemokine production, and overexpression of Us2 showed opposite effects. Co-immunoprecipitations indicated that Us2 interacted with TGF-Î² activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a serine/threonine kinase essential for NF-ÎºB activation, and Us2 has the ability to regulate the TAK1-mediated pathway and induces TAK1 downstream signaling. Further studies verified that Us2 induced the phosphorylation of TAK1, resulting in the activation of TAK1 mediated downstream signaling. The role of Us2 in HSV-2 induced NF-ÎºB pathways was also confirmed in the Us2-deficient mutant and HSV-2 WT infected mice. Our results indicate that HSV-2 Us2 gene product binds to TAK1 to positively regulate NF-ÎºB signaling and, for the first time, provide insights into the molecular mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">The transcription factor NF-ÎºB plays a pivotal role in many cellular events such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, inflammation, and immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Generally, NF-ÎºB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the IÎºB proteins family of inhibitory proteins, resulting in the inactivation of NF-ÎºB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A range of stimuli, including bacterial and viral infection, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stresses, and the engagement of antigen receptors, leads to activation of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates and ubiquitinates IkB proteins, releasing the bound NF-ÎºB dimers to translocate to the nucleus where they can bind as dimers to ÎºB sites in promoters to enhance a variety of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The dysregulation of NF-ÎºB activity is associated with metabolic diseases, cancer inflammatory disorders, and autoimmune activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par3">Given that the regulation of IKK activity is a key event in the activation of NF-ÎºB, it is not surprising that IKK activity is tightly controlled at multiple levels by regulatory elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Among these regulatory elements, the kinase TAK1 (transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²)âactivated kinase 1) is the one of most important regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. TAK1 belongs to the MAPKKK family of regulators and mediates various intracellular actions of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î± and interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. TAK1 is essential in the communication of the upstream signal from the receptor complex to the downstream signaling molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For example, the binding of IL-1Î² to its receptor IL-1R leads to interaction with the adaptor protein MyD88<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. MyD88 recruits IRAK family members, which in turn activates TRAF6, a ubiquitin E3 ligase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 associates with TAB and TAK1 to form a complex, resulting in the activation of TAK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Once activated, TAK1 initiates a cascade of signaling events, including activation of the IKK complex, phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkB, and the translocation of NF-ÎºB to the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a major sexually transmitted pathogen with a worldwide prevalence exceeding 500 million<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. HSV-2 can infect the genital epithelium to cause genital herpes and can also be transmitted to the central nervous system to establish a life-long latent infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The innate response plays an important role in the HSV-2 life cycle. In the early stages of the infection, the virus is cleared from the epithelium by the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Later in infection, the virus manages to escape the immune responses to establish and maintain a latent infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As part of the host innate response, studies have shown that HSV-2 infection activates NF-ÎºB signaling through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9-dependent and TLR 9-independent pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although HSV-2 induced NF-ÎºB signaling has been described, the regulatory mechanism has not been fully established.</p>
      <p id="Par5">HSV-2 is a double-stranded DNA virus that is part of the Herpesviridae family, genus Simplexvirus. The DNA genomes of HSV-2 have at least 74 open reading frames and are divided into unique long (Ul) and unique short (Us) regions. We investigated if any of the HSV-2 Us regions play a role in activation of NF-ÎºB. Our results show that HSV-2 Us2 is essential for HSV-2-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Additionally, we demonstrated that Us2 interacts with TAK1 leading to activation of TAK1âs downstream genes. Our results describe a novel mechanism for NF-ÎºB activation during HSV-2 infections.</p>

        <title>Us2 activates NF-ÎºB signaling and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines</title>
        <p id="Par6">It is well established that HSV-2 infection activates NF-ÎºB signaling through both TLR9 and non-TLR9 pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, the regulatory mechanism of HSV-2-activated NF-ÎºB signaling has not been adequately characterized. To screen the effect of the HSV-2 Us region for the ability to activate NF-ÎºB reporter luciferase activity, we cloned the ORFs of the HSV-2 Us region and screened their ability to activate an NF-ÎºB reporter gene in 293âT cells expressing TLR9. As shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>, the genes in the HSV-2 Us region, the Us2 gene product significantly stimulated NF-ÎºB reporter luciferase activity. We also examined the effect of Us2 on NF-ÎºB reporter luciferase activity in 293âT cells that did not contain the transfected TLR9 gene. Interestingly, Us2 also induced NF-ÎºB reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent manner in this cell line (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par7">To further investigate the role of Us2 on NF-ÎºB activation, we constructed an Us2-deficient HSV-2 mutant as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. HSV-2 was shown to induce two proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL-6) and two chemokines (IL-8 and CCL2) production, but not alter IFN-Î± production, in primary human genital epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These identified factors of TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and IFN-Î± are all regulated by NF-ÎºB. We next examined the effect of Us2 on expression of these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines using an Us2-deficient HSV-2 mutant. As determined by ELISA analyses, HSV-2 WT infection strongly enhanced the production of TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2, but the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were inhibited in End1/E6E7 cells which were infected with the Us2 mutant of HSV-2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1AâD</xref>). There was no observed differences in IFN-Î± expression between the HSV-2 or the Us2 mutant infected cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). The effect of Us2 on proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression was not cell-type specific because similar results were observed in another human cervical epithelial cell line ME180 cells (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We also explored the effect of HSV-2 and the Us2 mutant infection on NF-ÎºB reporter gene expression. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, the deficiency of Us2 inhibited the HSV-2 induction of NF-ÎºB reporter luciferase activity. We next investigated whether the HSV-1 Us2 gene similarly affected the activation of NF-ÎºB reporter. Using the reporter assay, we found that the Us2 gene of HSV-1 did not stimulate NF-ÎºB activation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). It was previously reported that the UL37 gene of HSV-1 could stimulate NF-ÎºB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, so transfection of UL37 was used as a positive control for activation. Additionally, neither expression of the Us2 gene of HSV-1 nor expression of the Us2 gene of HSV-2 induced the activity of the IFN-Î± promoter (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). These findings together indicate that HSV-2 Us2 plays a crucial role in NF-ÎºB signaling.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effect of Us2 on NF-ÎºB activity and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression.

        <title>Us2 induced NF-ÎºB signaling through TAK1</title>
        <p id="Par8">To determine which signaling components in NF-ÎºB signaling were required for Us2-induced signaling pathways, we constructed a panel of dominant-negative (DN) mutant forms of signaling intermediates including MAL, MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, TAB2, TAK1, IKK, and p65<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In reporter assays, overexpression of DN-p65 blocked the signaling induced by Us2, just as it blocked signaling by overexpression of MyD88 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Similarly, DN-TAK1 eliminated the activation of NF-ÎºB reporter by Us2 but had no effect on p65 stimulation of NF-ÎºB reporter activation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Overexpression of DN-MAL, DN-MyD88, DN-IRAK1, DN-TRAF6 or DN-TAB2 had no effect on Us2 signaling, but overexpression of DN-TAK1, DN-IKK, or DN-p65 inhibited Us2 activation of NF-ÎºB (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Thus, we speculated that Us2 regulates NF-ÎºB signaling through TAK1. To confirm that TAK1 was needed for the Us2 activation of NF-ÎºB, we designed three human TAK1 RNAi plasmids and tested their efficiency to alter Us2 activation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The plasmid expressing shRNA-TAK1 #3 was selected for the experiments described below. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C and D</xref>, the knockdown of TAK1 dramatically decreased HSV-2-induced NF-ÎºB activation and overexpression of TAK1 increased HSV-2-induced NF-ÎºB activation. We next investigated whether Us2 is involved in the regulation of TAK1-mediated signaling. Results from luciferase activity assays indicated that TAK1 overexpression stimulated Us2-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB and TAK1 expression knockdown inhibited Us2-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E and F</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TAK1 plays an important role in Us2 induced NF-ÎºB signaling.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Identification of cellular signaling molecules needed for NF-ÎºB activation by Us2.

        <p id="Par9">Given that the induction of NF-ÎºB signaling by Us2 occurred mainly through TAK1, we hypothesized that Us2 interacts with the TAK1 complex. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the binding of Us2 protein to TAB1, TAB2, or TAK1 <italic>in vivo</italic> using a GAL4/VP16-based mammalian two-hybrid system in 293âT cells. The results showed barely detectable luciferase activity in Us2 and the TAB1 or TAB2 co-transfection group (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A and B</xref>). In contrast, the levels of luciferase activity in the Us2 and TAK1 co-transfection group were as high as in cells co-transfected with positive control plasmids (pM-p53 and pVP16-T; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). To confirm these results indicating interaction, we next performed transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments to further analyze the interaction between Us2 and TAK1. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, Flag-tagged Us2 interacted with HA-tagged TAK1. Reverse co-immunoprecipitation experiments also indicated that Flag-tagged Us2 interacted with HA-tagged TAK1 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). In contrast, two other proteins in the TAK1 complex, TAB1 and TAB2, did not interact with Us2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E and F</xref>). Interesting, HSV-1 UL37 and HSV-1 Us2 did not interact with TAK1 (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We further performed endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and the results indicated that Us2 was weakly associated with TAK1 in cells infected with HSV-2 for 6âh; this association increased after 12âh of stimulation with HSV-2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). Because Us2 has previously been shown to associate with the plasma membrane (PM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we investigate the subcellular localization of Us2 with TAK1. In infected End1/E6E7 cells, Us2 and TAK1 localized to punctate cytoplasmic structures, to small vesicles that often appeared associated with the PM by 6âh postinfection (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). At 12âh postinfection, Us2 and TAK1 was found predominantly at the PM, in cytoplasmic vesicles, and also localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). A membrane flotation assay was performed to determine whether Us2 and TAK1 was associated with membranes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>, both Us2 and TAK1 floated with cellular membranes, while EGFP, as a negative control, was not enriched in the membrane-containing fractions. These results suggest that during HSV-2 infection, Us2 associated with TAK1 to positively regulate NF-ÎºB signaling.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Detection of the interaction between Us2 and TAK1. <bold>(A)</bold> 293âT cells were co-transfected with pG5-luc (a luciferase reporter plasmid), pVP16-Us2, and pM-TAB1 or with control plasmids for 48âh prior to luciferase assays.

        <title>Us2 activates TAK1 downstream genes</title>
        <p id="Par10">Activated TAK1 eventually phosphorylates and activates IKK leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºB proteins and thereby permitting the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To determine the role of Us2 on the TAK1-induced signaling pathway, End1/E6E7 cells were infected with HSV-2, UV-inactivated HSV-2, or the Us2 mutant of HSV-2. Western blot analyses showed that phoshporylated protein levels of TAK1, IKKÎ², and IÎºB were increased in the presence of HSV-2 infection but decreased in the presence of the Us2 mutant infection; TAK1, IKKÎ², and Î²-tubulin didnât increase under all conditions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). We also examined the effect of overexpression of Us2 on the TAK1/NF-ÎºB pathway. Western blot experiments indicated that Us2 overexpression potentiated TAK1 and IKKÎ² phosphorylation and IÎºB phosphorylation and degradation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Further experiments showed that TAK1, IKKÎ², and IÎºB phosphorylation was detected as early as 6âhours after HSV-2 WT infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). And phoshporylated protein levels of TAK1, IKKÎ², and IÎºB were increased at 12âhours after HSV-2 WT infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). However, the Us2 mutant infection did not affect the phosphorylation status of TAK1, IKKÎ², and IÎºB, suggesting that Us2 play an important role in NF-kB activation. We next examined the effect of Us2 on the translocation of NF-ÎºB from the cytosol to the nucleus, a hallmark of production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, NF-ÎºB protein levels were lowered in the cytosol and elevated in the nucleus after HSV-2 infection. Infection with the Us2 mutant inhibited the translocation of NF-ÎºB to the nucleus compared with HSV-2 infection. Similar results were obtained by immunofluorescence assays (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the TAK1-mediated signaling pathways were activated in response to Us2.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Us2 activates TAK1 and the downstream signaling pathways.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par12">The HSV activation of NF-ÎºB is biphasic with a first wave that is independent of viral replication and a second wave that requires viral gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, the regulation mechanism for this activation of NF-ÎºB by HSV-2 was unclear. In this study we determined that the Us2 gene product of HSV-2 plays an important role in NF-ÎºB activation by interacting with TAK1.</p>
      <p id="Par13">Some infectious diseases can be a manifestation of a constant battle between the host and viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Viral infection is sensed by the host innate immune system, which acts to limit viral infection by inducing antiviral cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To establish infection, many viruses have strategies to evade the innate immunity. Furthermore, in some cases viruses have evolved to use the host innate responses to their own advantages. In the innate immunity signal pathway using by viruses, NF-ÎºB play an important role. For example, Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax enhances T cell growth and transformation via inducing NF-ÎºB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 regulates B-lymphocyte growth transformation by inducing NF-ÎºB signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, a growing body of evidence suggests that NF-ÎºB activation increases the efficiency of HSV replication. HSV glycoprotein D abolished Fas-mediated apoptosis through NF-ÎºB signaling from 1 to 2âh after induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. HSV U<sub>L</sub>37 induce the NF-ÎºB activation from 2 to 5âh after induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. HSV ICP27 activated NF-ÎºB signaling pathways after 5âh after induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrate that HSV-2 Us2 gene product positively regulate NF-ÎºB signaling from 6 to 12âh after induction. In light of previous studies and our current results, gD and UL37 is response to early transient activation of NF-ÎºB, while ICP27 and Us2 is response to the later activation of NF-ÎºB. HSV-2 Us2 is a virion component that functions in the transport of the vesicles to the cell periphery, and its ability to induce NF-ÎºB represents a possible second function.</p>
      <p id="Par14">We next investigate the role of HSV-2 Us2 on inflammatory cytokine production. Results shown that HSV-2 Us2 induced TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2 production (FigsÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interesting, a published work has been shown that HSV-2 Us2 is able to regulate IFN-Î³ production, but not IL-4 and IL-12 production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Similar results were also observed in our study (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), implicating that Us2 can not regulate all inflammatory cytokine production. There are similar phenomena in other viruses. For example, Influenza A virus NS1 protein able to induce IL-1Î² and IL-18 production, but not IL-6 and MIP-1Î±<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Enterovirus 71 able to induce IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12p40 production, but not TNF-Î± production in human tonsillar epithelial cells UT-SCC-60A and UT-SCC-60B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The reasons for this phenomenon need to be explored in future studies.</p>
      <p id="Par15">HSV-1 and HSV-2 share roughly 83% nucleotide identity in the protein coding regions and both can establish latency in sensory ganglia and recurrently reactivate to cause diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, HSV-1 and HSV-2 exhibit substantial differences in latency and reactivation patterns. In this study, our results show that HSV-2 Us2, which is conserved in most members of the <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, induced the activation of NF-ÎºB, but HSV-1 Us2 did not exhibit this enhancement effect (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study has also found that, although HSV-1 Us1 shares nearly 60% of amino acid sequence with HSV-2 Us1, only HSV-2 Us1 inhibited IFN-Î² production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Given that finding and our current results, we believe that despite the considerable homology (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), the HSV-1 and HSV-2 proteins exhibit distinct activities. To our knowledge, it may due to the difference in tertiary structure between HSV-1 and HSV-2 Us2. It may also due to the discrepancy between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected site. Further studies will be needed to investigate these putative hypotheses.</p>
      <p id="Par16">To our knowledge, only one previous report has investigated the function of HSV-2 Us2. In that study, they reported that HSV-2 Us2 is a ubiquitin-interacting protein that is localized to the plasma membrane, recycling endosomes, and is also localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. TAK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions as an important intermediate node in NF-ÎºB signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Some reports found that phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of TAK1 are involved in the regulation of the TAK1-mediated pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Here, for the first time, we show that the Us2 protein interacts with TAK1 and Us2 overexpression induced the phosphorylation of TAK1 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Because Us2 is an ubiquitin-interacting protein, Us2 also may have effects on the polyubiquitination of TAK1. Recently, several studies confirmed that HSV-2 induced TLR4-MyD88/Mal and IRAK1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. TAK1 is a downstream signaling molecule of TLR4 and MyD88/Mal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Together with our work and previous studies, it seems like HSV-2 can regulate the function of proteins, which lies in one signaling pathway. Interestingly, there were other similar examples known. Enterovirus 71 3âC protein can inhibit RIG-I associated IFN response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. 3âC protein also can restrain this signaling pathway through cleavage of the TAK1/TAB1/TAB2/TAB3 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. HCV core protein blocks IFN signaling by interacting with signal transducers and activators of STAT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The core protein also induces expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, and blocks Janus kinaseâSTAT signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Our results suggest a mechanism that allows for virus to regulate inflammation network by interacting with proteins that play key roles inflammatory response.</p>
      <p id="Par17">Although other mechanisms may exist, we proposed a potential molecular model for Us2 regulation of NF-ÎºB signaling (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). During HSV-2 infection, HSV-2 Us2 interacts with TAK1 leading to the phosphorylation of TAK1, allowing it to activate the IKK complex. The IKK complex signals to translocate the NF-ÎºB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Although more studies are needed to understand the detailed regulatory mechanisms of Us2, our findings highlight the significance of HSV-2 Us2 in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, providing a novel mechanism for Us2 in the regulation of NF-ÎºB signaling.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Schematic model of the role of Us2 in the regulation of NF-ÎºB signaling.

Then 0.3âml of the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was mixed with 2.7âml of 85% (wt/vol) sucrose in NTE buffer (10âmM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1âmM EDTA, 100âmM NaCl) and was placed in the bottom of an SW41 centrifuge tube. Next, 6âml of 65% sucrose in NTE buffer, followed by 3âml of 10% sucrose in NTE buffer, was layered onto the PNS. This sucrose step gradient was centrifuged at 100,000âÃâg for 20âh (4âÂ°C). Fractions were collected from the top of the tube. Aliquots of fractions 1 to 12 were diluted with NTE buffer, and centrifuged at 100,000ârpm for 15âmin to pellet the membranes. Pelleted material was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. A cocktail of protease inhibitors was added to each type of buffer.</p>

        <p id="Par33">Where appropriate, data were from at least three independent experiments and expressed as meanâÂ±âStandard deviation (SD). To compare the mean of two groups, the statistical significance was measured by Studentâs t-test. To compare the difference between multiple groups, statistical significance was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by post Newman-Keulâs test. Calculations were performed with Graphpad Prism Statistical Software (GraphPad Software Inc, SanDiego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was defined as Pâ&lt;â0.05 or Pâ&lt;â0.01.</p>
