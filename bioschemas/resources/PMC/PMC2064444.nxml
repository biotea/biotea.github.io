        <p>At the plasma membrane, heterotrimeric G proteins act as molecular switches to relay signals from G proteinâcoupled receptors; however, G<sub>Î±</sub> subunits also have receptor-independent functions at intracellular sites. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) 14, which enhances the intrinsic GTPase activity of G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins, localizes in centrosomes, which suggests the coexpression of G<sub>iÎ±</sub>. We show expression of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> in the centrosomes and at the midbody. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis confirms a direct interaction between RGS14 and G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> in centrosomes. Expression of GTPase-deficient G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> results in defective cytokinesis, whereas that of wild-type or GTPase-deficient G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> causes prolonged mitosis. Cells treated with pertussis toxin, with reduced expression of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> or with decreased expression of RGS14 also exhibit cytokinesis defects. These results suggest that G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins and their regulators at these sites may play essential roles during mammalian cell division.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Besides their established role at the plasma membrane, heterotrimeric G proteins and their regulators including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), and regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins play a critical role in regulating microtubule (MT) pulling force during asymmetric cell division in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Wilkie and Kinch, 2005</xref>). G<sub>iÎ±</sub>-class GDIs, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> GPR1/2 and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Pins, inhibit the release of nucleotide from G<sub>Î±</sub>-GDP via their GoLoco domain. A <italic>C. elegans</italic> GEF, Ric-8, likely stimulates nucleotide exchange of GoLoco proteinâG<sub>Î±</sub>âGDP complex, producing free G<sub>Î±</sub>-GTP and signals force generation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hampoelz and Knoblich, 2004</xref>). RGS, a G<sub>Î±</sub> GTPase-activating protein (GAP), may also act as an effector by positively regulating the pulling force (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hess et al., 2004</xref>). Altered expression of G proteins or their regulators in <italic>C. elegans</italic> results in symmetric cell division, which causes inappropriate cell lineage determination and, ultimately, embryonic lethality. Emerging evidence suggests that mammalian heterotrimeric G proteins and their regulators also localize in the intracellular organelles and regulate MT pulling force (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tall and Gilman, 2005</xref>). However, the consequence of altered expression or function of these mammalian proteins on cell division has not yet been described.</p>
      <p>Unique among RGS and GDI proteins, RGS14 and RGS12 contain both an RGS domain for GAP activity and a GoLoco domain for GDI activity (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ponting, 1999</xref>). Both domains of RGS14 target members of the G<sub>iÎ±</sub> subclass (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Mittal and Linder, 2004</xref>). RGS14 also possesses two Raf-like Ras-binding domains, which overlap with the small GTPase, Rap-interacting domain (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Traver et al., 2000</xref>). RGS14 associates with centrosomes and MTs, and loss of <italic>Rgs14</italic> expression in mice is catastrophic, resulting in the failure of zygotes to progress to the two-cell stage (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Martin-McCaffrey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). Very little is known about which activity of RGS14 is involved in centrosome/MT-related function and how the different activities of RGS14 are regulated in vivo. We show that the G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins, targets for RGS14 regulation, localize in the centrosomes and midbody. We also demonstrate a direct interaction of RGS14 with G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> in the centrosomes and the necessity for normal G<sub>iÎ±</sub> and RGS14 function for proper cell division. These results implicate heterotrimeric G proteinâmediated signal transduction in centrosome biology and in cytokinesis.</p>

        <title>G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins localize in the centrosomes and at the midbody</title>
        <p>Based on RGS14 expression in centrosome and its G<sub>iÎ±</sub> selectivity, we examined whether G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, or G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> localized in the centrosomes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). A YFP fusion protein of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> localized at the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, but it also colocalized with CFP-tagged RGS14 in centrosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). YFP expressed from the vector control evenly localized throughout the cell, except in the areas that appeared to be nucleoli. G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP also colocalized with endogenous centrosome proteins, including RGS14, Î³-tubulin, and ninein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Expression of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP did not displace the endogenous centrosome proteins examined, suggesting that G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP expression did not interfere with centrosome recruitment of these proteins. G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>- and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub>-YFP also targeted to the centrosomes, colocalizing with another centrosome marker, pericentrin, as did the G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Coexpression of RGS14-CFP was not necessary for targeting of YFP fusions of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, or G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> to the centrosomes. The YFP tag in the G<sub>iÎ±</sub>-YFP constructs was shown not to interfere with G<sub>iÎ±</sub> function (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gibson and Gilman, 2006</xref>). The Glu-Glu (EE)âtagged G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins also localized to the centrosomes, excluding the possibility of altered targeting caused by the YFP tagging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The Alexa Fluorâconjugated secondary antibodies used in this study yielded no substantial staining of cells when used without primary antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Imaging of live cells transfected with the G<sub>iÎ±</sub>-YFP constructs demonstrated that the fusion proteins were predominantly localized at the plasma membrane in most cells, although not in all cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The fixation of cells with 50% acetone/50% methanol (used for centrosome staining) and subsequent immunostaining resulted in a considerable loss of fusion proteins localized at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, BâD</xref>). The YFP fusions of all three G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins also showed strong expression at the junction between two daughter cells during cytokinesis in live cell imaging, unlike the YFP expressed from the vector control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This may represent expression at the cleavage furrow, and/or possibly at the midbody, although these structures were difficult to discern in our low-resolution epifluorescence imaging of live cells.</p>

To ensure that these cells underwent cytokinesis, we followed cell division starting from rounding up of cells (indication of cells entering mitosis) to completion of cytokinesis (reattachment of cells). Compared with YFP expressed from the control vector, all three G<sub>iÎ±</sub>-YFP fusions showed very strong expression at the junction between two daughter cells (arrows).</p>

        <p>Next, we verified that endogenous G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins localized in centrosomes of HeLa and NIH3T3 cells, which are known to express G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> using G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>-, or G<sub>iÎ±3</sub>-specific antibodies (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Susa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Krumins and Gilman, 2006</xref>). To verify the specificity of each antibody, lysates of HeLa cells expressing EE-tagged human G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, or G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> were immunoblotted with the anti-G<sub>iÎ±</sub> and -EE antibodies. The results showed minimal cross-reactivity (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604114/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604114/DC1</ext-link>). To determine cell cycle position, we stained cells with anti- pericentrin or antiâ Î³-tubulin antibody and with Hoechst 33342 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> localized in the centrosomes of interphase and mitotic cells, but G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> did not, contrary to what we observed with G<sub>iÎ±3</sub>-YFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and to the recently published finding (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blumer et al., 2006</xref>). This is likely caused by centrosome expression of G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> at a level below detection by the antibody or epitope masking in the centrosomes. G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> expression is observed at the midbody; however, it is no longer detected in centrosomes during cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The expression pattern of G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> during cytokinesis mirrors that of pericentrin with modest midbody and strong centrosome expression (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Doxsey, 2005</xref>). We also detected midbody G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> and RGS14 staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Although RGS14 was reported to colocalize with MTs (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Martin-McCaffrey et al., 2004</xref>), neither N- or C-terminally tagged RGS14 did so nor did we observe significant MT staining with three RGS14 antibodies raised independently (unpublished data). Finally, we reconfirmed the intracellular staining pattern of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> using additional anti-G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and -G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> antibodies raised independently and by demonstrating the absence of centrosomal staining of G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> in the cells isolated from G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> knockout mice (Fig. S2; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2005</xref>). We observed some inconsistency in the plasma membrane staining with various anti-G<sub>iÎ±</sub> antibodies. The varying staining patterns by the antibodies raised against the same G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins are likely caused by the difference in epitope recognition and affinity. Furthermore, the fixation with 50% acetone/50% methanol also contributed to the inconsistency in plasma membrane staining of endogenous G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins. The fixation may weaken the integrity of plasma membrane and/or alter the antigenicity of G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins. This inconsistency has also been observed in previous studies. In the study by <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Stow et al. (1991)</xref>, anti-G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> antibody stained only Golgi and cytoplasm, whereas <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. (1994)</xref> reported strong plasma membrane and Golgi staining by an anti-G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> antibody in certain cells. However, the same anti-G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> antibody stained only Golgi (not the plasma membrane) in another type of cell (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

        <title>G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> directly interacts with RGS14 in the centrosomes via both RGS and GoLoco domains</title>
        <p>To investigate whether G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and RGS14 interacted in the centrosomes, we performed two independent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses on HeLa cells transfected with RGS14-CFP and G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP. First, the acceptor photobleaching method was used on fixed cells expressing the two fusion proteins. Cells containing centrosomes expressing both fusion proteins at similar levels were found on the basis of their specific fluorescence intensities. A representative FRET image of acceptor photobleaching assays performed is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>. Unlike the nonbleached centrosome, the CFP fluorescence intensity of the bleached centrosome increased considerably after YFP bleaching. The presence of FRET was also confirmed by using the sensitized emission FRET method on live cells. Initial images of live cells expressing a CFP/YFP fusion, RGS14-CFP, or G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP were use to adjust confocal microscope settings. The subsequent acquisition of FRET efficiency image clearly demonstrated a robust FRET signal in the centrosomes of live cells expressing wild-type RGS14-CFP and G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To figure out which domain of RGS14 was involved in interaction with G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> in the centrosomes, we generated CFP fusions of various deletion and point mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and tested the ability of the various fusion proteins to bind G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> by acceptor photobleaching (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The average FRET efficiency of unbleached centrosomes (1%) served as a negative control. Bleached centrosomes expressing wild-type RGS14-CFP (HC30) and G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP showed robust FRET signals, with an average FRET efficiency of 10.7%. Neither the HC31 lacking the N-terminal 184 amino acids nor HC32 containing centrosome-targeted, Rap-interacting domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>) yielded a true FRET. Various GoLoco domain deletion mutants, including HC33, could not be tested because they localized only in the nucleus (unpublished data). True FRET signals were observed from the HC34 and HC35 with an RGS and a GoLoco domain defective in G<sub>iÎ±</sub> binding, respectively. A likely explanation for why the RGS domain deletion mutant behaves differently from the RGS domain point mutant is that the N-terminal deletion may have globally affected RGS14 protein conformation, interfering with the G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>âRGS14 GoLoco interaction. The HC36 containing both defective RGS and GoLoco domains showed no true FRET signal. Together, our data indicate that both the RGS and GoLoco domains are involved in G<sub>iÎ±</sub> binding in the centrosome. A constitutively active Q204L mutant of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP also produced a true FRET with wild-type RGS14 in the centrosomes. In contrast to the centrosome interaction, no or low-efficiency FRET signals were observed between RGS14 and wild-type or the mutant G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> in the cytoplasm, suggesting a different mechanism of interaction in the centrosomes. RGS14 was recently shown to bind both wild-type and GTPase-deficient forms of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shu et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

Wild-type RGS14-CFP construct is designated as HC30. A mutant lacking N-terminal 66 amino acids and the RGS domain is named as HC31. HC32 construct contains only the RID domain. HC33 lacks a part of the GoLoco domain and C-terminal 25 amino acids. The point mutants defective in GAP, GDI, and both activities are named as HC34, HC35, and HC36, respectively.

        <title>Altered expression or function of G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins leads to defective cell division</title>
        <p>Next, we examined the effect of altered G<sub>iÎ±</sub> expression or function on cell division by time-lapse videomicroscopy. To assess progression of cell division and measure the duration of mitosis or cytokinesis, we used visual landmarks. Rounding up of attached cells was used as the initiation of mitosis, emergence of a daughter cell as initiation of cytokinesis, and the loss of roundness in conjunction with inability to detect intercellular bridge (reattachment) as the end time point for cytokinesis. These measurable durations may not truly reflect the actual durations, although they can be used for comparison. For example, absolving of midbody after mitosis, which cannot be visualized in our live imaging, may take up to several hours (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Schulze and Blose, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Sanger et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Rattner, 1992</xref>). Of almost all the cells expressing YFP, only control, wild-type G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, or G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> QL mutant underwent relatively normal cell division (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Videos 1 and 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604114/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200604114/DC1</ext-link>). The measurable durations of mitosis and cytokinesis of these cells were â¼30 min for these cells. However, a considerable number of dividing cells expressing wild-type or QL mutant of G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> (â¼35 and 20% of cells examined, respectively) showed prolonged mitosis with an average duration of 176 min (from the metaphase to the initiation of cytokinesis), but underwent relatively normal cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Video 3). In an extreme case, a cell stayed in the mitotic phase for &gt;8 h before initiation of cytokinesis. In contrast, cells expressing the G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> QL mutant exhibited relatively normal mitosis, but â¼40% had prolonged or unresolved cytokinesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Video 4). More than 7 h lapsed between the initiation of cytokinesis and the appearance of midbody in the cell shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>. Two daughter cells remained unattached (rounded up). Mitosis was also slightly delayed in â¼15% of cells expressing wild-type G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Silencing G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> or RGS14 by siRNA induces cytokinesis failure</title>
        <p>We took advantage of a recent report demonstrating efficient silencing of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> in HeLa cells using siRNAs and closely followed the previously described method (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Krumins and Gilman, 2006</xref>). A significant compensatory increase in G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> expression was observed after silencing of G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> or G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> in HeLa cells, demonstrating the adaptability of G protein signaling networks. Different G<sub>iÎ±</sub> isoforms may also be able to functionally compensate for the lack of others. Therefore, we used two siRNAs reported to simultaneously silence all three G<sub>iÎ±</sub> isoforms (G<sub>iÎ±1-3</sub> siRNA; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Krumins and Gilman, 2006</xref>). Cells were harvested for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry or subjected to videomicroscopy 6â7 d after the first transfection. Transfection efficiency was monitored with DY547-tagged siRNA yielding an average of â¼90% efficiency (unpublished data). Immunoblotting demonstrated a significant reduction in expression of all three G<sub>iÎ±</sub> isoforms in G<sub>iÎ±1-3</sub> siRNAâtransfected cells compared with cells transfected with siRNA control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). The centrosome staining by anti-G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> or -G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> antibody was also significantly reduced (an average of â¼40% reduction for both G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>) in HeLa cells transfected with G<sub>iÎ±1-3</sub> siRNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

To demonstrate reduced expression of RGS14, RT-PCR was used instead of immunoblotting because our antibody recognized RGS14 protein only in immune cell lysate, where RGS14 expression was relatively high, but not in HeLa cell lysate with a lower level of RGS14 expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Emerging evidence suggests that heterotrimeric G proteins and their regulators localize in diverse intracellular compartments and may function independently of GPCRs. A recent genetic study has demonstrated a new mechanism for G<sub>Î±</sub> signaling in yeast (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Slessareva et al., 2006</xref>). The yeast G<sub>Î±</sub>, Gpa1, localizes to endosomes and directly binds PI3K instead of pairing with G<sub>Î²Î³</sub>. Intriguingly, the catalytic subunit of PI3K binds preferentially to the activated form of G<sub>Î±</sub>, whereas the regulatory subunit of PI3K prefers the inactive GDP-bound form, suggesting cycling between active and inactive forms of G<sub>Î±</sub> in the endosome. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, both G<sub>Î±</sub> and G<sub>Î²</sub> localize on asters and are implicated in regulation of centrosome movement and spindle positioning (Gotta and Ahringer, 2001). Mammalian proteins that regulate G<sub>Î±</sub> protein activity, such as LGN and RGS14, are also reported to localize in the centrosomes and at the midbody (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Martin-McCaffrey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blumer et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we show that three mammalian G<sub>iÎ±</sub> isoforms, G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub>, localize in the centrosomes and at the midbody. FRET assays demonstrate that RGS14 can bind G<sub>iÎ±</sub> protein in the centrosomes via both RGS and GoLoco domains. Preliminary immunocytochemistry data indicate that a mammalian GEF, Ric-8A, also resides in centrosomes (unpublished data). These results suggest that cycling between GDP- and GTP-G<sub>iÎ±</sub> may also be of functional importance in the mammalian centrosomes. Like the two subunits of yeast PI3K, centrosomal RGS14 can bind both inactive and active form of G<sub>iÎ±</sub>. LGN, which recruits NuMA to the cell cortex, and possibly to the spindle poles during mitosis, can bind the inactive G<sub>iÎ±</sub> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>). Centrosomal Ric-8A may dissociate the G<sub>iÎ±</sub>-GDPâLGNâNuMA complex releasing G<sub>iÎ±</sub>-GTP and NuMA, thereby regulating the MT function, as reported at the cell cortex (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tall and Gilman, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, forced expression of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> gave two distinct phenotypes during cell division. Both wild-type and the GTPase-deficient form of G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> resulted in prolonged mitosis, although they did not affect cytokinesis. The GTPase-deficient form of G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> caused defective cytokinesis, but did not impact mitosis. Overexpression of the wild-type G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>, wild-type G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>, or the GTPase-deficient form of G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> did not reveal any apparent abnormalities during cell division. The difference between G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> may arise, in part, from their differing intracellular localization. G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> is present in the centrosomes early in mitosis, and it shifts to the midbody, as has been observed with the centrosome proteins Cep55 and centriolin (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Doxsey, 2005</xref>). It also differs slightly from G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> in being more centrally located in the midbody region. Because it is likely that multiple regulators of G<sub>iÎ±</sub> are involved, the phenotypic difference may also reflect differences in binding specificities of the regulatory proteins. For example, LGN and Ric-8 can bind only the GDP-bound G<sub>iÎ±</sub>, but not the QL forms. In contrast, RGS14 can bind both GDP- and GTD-bound G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub>, although it is unknown whether and how these interactions are regulated. There may be spatial and/or temporal regulation determining where and when the interaction between various G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins and their regulators occurs. Expression of G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> and G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> induced altered spindle orientation in mammalian neural progenitors and abnormal rocking motion of chromosome in MDCK cells, respectively, although how these defects affected cell division was not reported (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Sanada and Tsai, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interfering with G<sub>iÎ±</sub> function by PTX or with G<sub>iÎ±</sub> expression by siRNAs resulted in mainly defective cytokinesis. The mitotic spindle and spindle midzone (likely regulated by centrosome function) provide spatiotemporal control over many of the mechanical events occurring at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bringmann, 2005</xref>). It is reported that depletion of the centrosome/midbody protein centriolin results in cytokinesis failure without affecting mitosis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gromley et al., 2003</xref>). In Swiss3T3 and neuroepithelial cells, PTX treatment impaired cell proliferation, which was suggested to result from inhibited GPCR signaling (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Crouch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Shinohara et al., 2004</xref>). However, the PTX-induced intercellular bridge and MT defects may be the consequence of abnormal G<sub>Î±</sub> function in the centrosomes. PTX may also interfere with G<sub>iÎ±</sub> GDP/GTP exchange by centrosomal Ric-8A. Whether G<sub>Î±</sub> is coupled with G<sub>Î²Î³</sub> in the centrosome/midbody has never been examined. Whether PTX can ribosylate G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins complexed with a protein other than G<sub>Î²Î³</sub> also remains to be seen. In addition, defective G<sub>Î±</sub> function at the midbody may contribute to the observed defects. Although the exit from cytokinesis was severely delayed in G<sub>iÎ±1-3</sub> siRNA-transfected cells, many interconnected cells eventually became separated. This may be caused by the residual expression of G<sub>iÎ±</sub> proteins in knockdown cells. Reduced expression of RGS14 also induced cytokinesis defects, suggesting that GAP and/or GDI activity may be required for proper cell division. The uneven thickness of intercellular bridge MTs caused by decreased RGS14 expression suggests dysregulation of MT stability/dynamics or uneven pulling force, leading to abnormal cytokinesis. It is not clear how MTs in the intercellular bridge extended from one daughter cell, but not from the other is affected. Contrary to a previous report (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Martin-McCaffrey et al., 2004</xref>), we did not observe any significant reduction in tubulin staining in the cells transfected with RGS14 siRNA. The difference may be caused by our relatively modest knockdown compared with theirs.</p>
      <p>More studies are needed to model a molecular mechanism by which the G proteins and regulators exert their control on cell division via centrosome/midbody function. However, the following mechanisms are conceivable. First, the mechanism proposed for MT pulling force involving G<sub>iÎ±</sub>, LGN, NuMA, and Ric-8A may be used to regulate MT stability, dynamics, or pulling force at these sites (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tall and Gilman, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blumer et al., 2006</xref>). RGS14 may serve to regulate these processes. It may act as a GAP via RGS domain and/or sequester G<sub>iÎ±</sub> away from LGN via GoLoco domain, thus interfering with NuMA interaction. Second, G proteins may regulate MT function via direct interaction with tubulins. Both G<sub>Î±</sub> and G<sub>Î²Î³</sub> modulate MT assembly in vitro, and the heterotrimer inhibits the ability of G<sub>Î²Î³</sub> to promote MT assembly, suggesting that G protein activation is required for functional coupling between G<sub>Î±Î²Î³</sub> and tubulin/MTs (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Roychowdhury et al., 2006</xref>). Third, analogous to the signal transduction at the plasma membrane, G proteins and regulators may activate and deactivate yet-to-be identified centrosome/midbody effectors.</p>
      <p>G<sub>Î±</sub> proteins and regulators are present in many different cellular compartments. Therefore, the phenotypes we observe may not arise solely from perturbation of G<sub>iÎ±</sub> function in the centrosomes/midbody. Dysregulation of the endogenous G<sub>Î±</sub> subunits at the cell cortex/plasma membrane may also contribute to the observed phenotypes. However, differential localization of G<sub>Î±</sub> proteins to centrosome and midbody, the mitotic and cytokinesis defects observed with G<sub>Î±</sub> overexpression, G<sub>Î±</sub> underexpression, or PTX-treated cells, in addition to reported direct role of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> G<sub>Î±</sub> and regulators in MT function strongly argue that they play a more direct role during cell division. There are many unresolved issues, such as which proteins are the downstream effectors of centrosomal and midbody G proteins, whether or how the G proteins and their regulators, such as RGS14, LGN, and Ric-8A, are regulated during cell cycle, and how these proteins are targeted. Future studies should help resolve these issues in what is a new and exciting avenue for heterotrimeric G protein research.</p>

        <title>Reagents, DNA constructs, immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and siRNA knockdown</title>
        <p>A rat G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP construct was a gift of M. Lohse (University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bunemann et al., 2003</xref>). The human G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-, G<sub>iÎ±2</sub>-, and G<sub>iÎ±3</sub>-YFP constructs were provided by S. Gibson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gibson and Gilman, 2006</xref>). The rat and human G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP constructs generally produced similar results in our assays. EE-tagged G<sub>iÎ±</sub> constructs were purchased from Unite Mixte de Recherche cDNA Resource Center. The antibodies used were purchased as follows: antiâÎ³-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich; anti-EE monoclonal from Covance; anti-ninein polyclonal from Abcam; monoclonal anti-G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> from Millipore; polyclonal monoclonal anti-G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> from EMD Biosciences; and monoclonal anti-G<sub>iÎ±1</sub> and -G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> and polyclonal anti-G<sub>iÎ±3</sub> from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. To construct CFP fusions, various mouse RGS14 (available under GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U85055">U85055</ext-link>) DNA fragments were cloned into pN1-CFP vector in frame with C-terminal CFP, and RGS14 and G<sub>iÎ±</sub> point mutants were generated as previously described (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). Cells were fixed with 4% PFA/0.1% Triton-X100 for MT staining using antiâÎ±-tubulin antibody or with 50% acetone/50% methanol for centrosome staining using antibodies raised against centrosome proteins.</p>
        <p>The method of <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Krumins and Gilman (2006)</xref> was closely followed for G<sub>iÎ±</sub> siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells. G<sub>iÎ±1/3</sub> (721â739; CCGAAUGCAUGAAAGCAUG) and G<sub>iÎ±2</sub> (681â699; CUUGAGCGCCUAUGACUUG) siRNAs, control siRNA, and DY547-tagged siRNA to monitor transfection efficiency were purchased from Dharmacon. For RGS14 siRNA silencing, three RGS14 siRNAs (216â226, AACGGGCGCAUGGUUCUGGCU; 347â367, AACCGAGGAGCAGCCUGUGGC; 474â494, AAGGCCUGCGAGCGCUUCCAG; available under GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_006480">NM_006480</ext-link>) were selected based on the Dharmacon siRNA user guide and purchased from Dharmacon. HeLa cells were transfected with the pool of three siRNAs, as described above.</p>

        <title>Confocal microscopy and FRET assays</title>
        <p>Images were collected on a TCS-SP2 or SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) and processed as previously described (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>), except that 561- and 405-nm diode lasers were used for Alexa Fluor 568 and Hoechst 33342, respectively. When it was not possible to eliminate cross-talk between channels, the images were collected sequentially and later merged. The exposure times were kept equal within each series of images and chosen such that all pixel intensities were within the linear range. A 63Ã oil lens was used, unless mentioned otherwise. Confocal zoom factors between 1 and 8 (Z1 to Z8) were used.</p>
        <p>Acceptor photobleaching module of the Leica software was used for acceptor photobleaching FRET assay. The 405-nm laser line was used to excite CFP and the 514-nm laser line was used to excite and bleach YFP. Microscopic fields containing two to three centrosomes that expressed both RGS14-CFP and G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP with similar levels of expression were found. A region of interest was drawn on only one of the centrosomes in the field or on a randomly chosen area in the cytoplasm for bleaching. The Leica confocal software was configured to achieve a 50 or 80% bleach of YFP only in the selected region of interest. FRET efficiency was calculated as follows: FRETeff = <italic>D<sub>post</sub></italic> â <italic>D<sub>pre</sub></italic>/<italic>D<sub>post</sub></italic> for all <italic>D<sub>post</sub></italic> &gt; <italic>D<sub>pre</sub></italic> when <italic>D<sub>pre</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>post</sub></italic> were donor fluorescence intensity before and after photobleaching, respectively. The Leica acceptor photobleaching method collected 8-bit images (gray scale 0â256). Therefore, any fluorescent intensity &lt;20 was regarded as background, as these were near the limits of detection. At least 20 different cells were examined for the presence of FRET signals in each experiment. The FRET efficiencies of each construct were averaged for comparison.</p>
        <p>For live cell FRET analysis, cells were imaged using sensitized emission routine of the Leica software. A CFP-YFP fusion was used as a positive control. Images of RGS14-CFP only or G<sub>iÎ±1</sub>-YFP only were acquired to correct for cross talk between channels. FRET efficiency was calculated as follows: FRETeff = B â b Ã A â (c â a Ã b) Ã C/C where A represents the fluorescence intensity of channel 1 (donor excitation/donor emission); B represents the fluorescence intensity of channel 2 (donor excitation/FRET emission); C represents the fluorescence intensity of channel 3 (acceptor excitation/acceptor emission); a represents the correction factor of acceptor only measurement (donor emission Ã excitation for the donor/acceptor emission Ã excitation for the acceptor); b represents the correction factor of donor only measurement (acceptor emission Ã excitation for the donor/donor emission Ã excitation for the donor); and c represents the correction factor of acceptor only measurement (acceptor emission Ã excitation for the donor/acceptor emission Ã excitation for the acceptor). The Leica sensitized emission module used 12-bit images (gray scale 0â4,096). Therefore, any fluorescent intensity &lt;200 in all three channels was regarded as background, as these were at the limit of detection.</p>

        <title>Time-lapse videomicroscopy and flow cytometry</title>
        <p>A microscope (DMIRBE; Leica) equipped with a 1,376 Ã 1,040 cooled charge-coupled device camera (Sensicam QE; Cooke) was used to capture time-lapse images. Microscope settings such as exposure time and magnification of objective (20Ã) were kept constant. This microscope was also equipped with Pe-Con environmental chamber (PeCon GmbH) that maintained temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>, and humidity levels for long-term imaging. DIC and fluorescence images were captured using ImagePro (Media Cybernetics) or IpLab (BD Biosciences). The collected images were processed using the Imaris (Bitplane, Inc.) and reconstructed into videos using QuickTime software.</p>
        <p>For cell cycle analysis, live cells were stained with the viable DNA dye Hoechst 33342 and subjected to flow cytometry using LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo 6.2.1 (Tree Star, Inc.) were used for data acquisition and analysis, respectively.</p>
