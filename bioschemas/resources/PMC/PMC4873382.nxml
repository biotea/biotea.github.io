        <p id="P1">Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) regulate tissue inflammation and repair following activation by cell-extrinsic factors including host-derived cytokines. However, the cell-intrinsic metabolic pathways that control ILC2 function are undefined. Here we demonstrate that expression of the enzyme Arginase 1 (Arg1) is a conserved trait of murine and human ILC2s during acute or chronic lung inflammation. Deletion of murine ILC-intrinsic Arg1 abrogated type 2 lung inflammation by restraining ILC2 proliferation and dampening cytokine production. Mechanistically, inhibition of Arg1 enzymatic activity disrupted multiple components of ILC2 metabolic programming by altering arginine catabolism, impairing polyamine biosynthesis and reducing aerobic glycolysis. These data identify Arg1 as a key regulator of ILC2 bioenergetics, controlling proliferative capacity and pro-inflammatory functions that promote type 2 inflammation.</p>

    <p id="P2">The innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family orchestrates immunity, inflammation, metabolic homeostasis and tissue repair in multiple tissues including the intestine, liver, adipose, skin and lung<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) are the dominant ILC population in the human and murine lung where they act as key initiators of allergen and non-allergen-induced type 2 inflammation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> as well as promoting airway tissue repair<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. ILC2s are activated by cell-extrinsic environmental cues including the cytokines interleukin-25 (IL-25), IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopioetin (TSLP)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However, the cell-intrinsic pathways that regulate ILC2 effector function remain poorly characterized. In particular, regulation of cell metabolism is a critical determinant of adaptive lymphocyte development and function<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, although whether cell-intrinsic metabolic signals influence ILC biology is unknown. The enzyme Arginase 1 (Arg1) was identified as a marker of ILC fetal intestinal precursors and adult lung ILC2s<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, although the functional significance of Arg1 enzymatic activity in ILCs remains unclear.</p>
    <p id="P3">Arg1 metabolizes the amino acid L-arginine to generate urea and ornithine, whose downstream metabolites proline and polyamines drive collagen synthesis and bioenergetic pathways critical for cell proliferation<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Although homeostatic L-arginine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver to complete the urea cycle, immune cells can serve as critical extra-hepatic sites of Arg1 activity during infection and tissue inflammation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Particularly in the context of cancer or type 2 cytokine-driven inflammation in the intestine, liver and skin, Arg1 activity is a key signature of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMacs)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. AAMac-derived Arg1 primarily acts extrinsically, promoting wound healing and tissue fibrosis through eliciting collagen synthesis by fibroblasts or by limiting T cell responses via nutrient deprivation of L-arginine<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In contrast, in the lung, evidence supporting the functional significance of AAMac-derived Arg1 enzymatic activity remains controversial. For example, models targeting macrophage-specific Arg1 have failed to recapitulate the effects observed in studies using global inhibition of Arg1 to dampen airway inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that other cell populations may be responsible for the ability of Arg1 to promote development of lung disease. We demonstrate here that Arg1 has a critical cell-intrinsic role in regulating ILC2 metabolism and the development of type 2 inflammation.</p>

        <title>Constitutive Arg1 expression in precursor and mature ILC2</title>
        <p id="P4">Arg1 expression has been reported in a population of ILC precursors in the fetal intestine and in mature ILC2s in the lung<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Whether Arg1 is differentially expressed in distinct adult ILC precursors or mature ILC populations and how this is influenced by the tissue microenvironment remains poorly characterized. Examination of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and the common innate lymphoid progenitor (CHILP) in reporter mice that express yellow fluorescent protein under control of the Arg1 promoter (<italic>Arg1</italic><sup>YFP</sup>) did not reveal any expression of Arg1-YFP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), suggesting that upregulation of Arg1 in the adult bone marrow occurs at a later developmental checkpoint during subset differentiation of the ILC lineages. Consistent with this, analysis of Arg1-YFP expression in lineage-specified ILC2 bone marrow precursors that lack KLRG1 (termed âILC2Psâ)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> revealed high expression of Arg1-YFP equivalent to that observed in mature KLRG1<sup>+</sup> ILC2s (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Taken together, these data identify Arg1 as a marker of ILC2 lineage-committed precursors in the adult bone marrow.</p>
        <p id="P5">To investigate whether Arg1 expression in mature ILC2s is influenced by their distinct tissue microenvironment, we examined Arg1 expression in ILC2s isolated from multiple lymphoid, mucosal and adipose tissues. ILC2s in the lung expressed high amounts of Arg1 protein, as measured both by intracellular staining and by expression of Arg1-YFP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Further flow cytometric profiling of mature KLRG1<sup>+</sup> ILC2s isolated from multiple tissues of <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>YFP</sup> mice including spleen (SPL), mesenteric lymph node (mLN), small intestine (SI), large intestine (LI) and epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) revealed that constitutive Arg1 expression represents a conserved trait of mature ILC2s across lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues.</p>

        <title>Murine ILC2s express Arg1 in the inflamed lung</title>
        <p id="P6">In contrast to lymphoid tissues and barrier surfaces such as the intestine that contain all three subsets of ILCs, the murine lung is dominated by ILC2s<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Given the role of Arg1 in regulating lung homeostasis in the context of infection and inflammation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, we sought to examine which cell populations are the dominant sources of Arg1. Unbiased flow cytometric analysis of total Arg1-YFP-expressing cells in lungs of naive <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>YFP</sup> mice revealed that the majority of Arg1 was expressed by lineage negative (Lin<sup>â</sup>) cells that expressed CD90, CD25, CD127 and IL-33R, identifying them as ILC2s (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Comprehensive examination of multiple innate and adaptive immune cell lineages in the lungs of <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>YFP</sup> mice confirmed that ILC2s are the dominant cellular source of Arg1 under homeostatic conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">ILC2s can promote type 2 inflammation in the lung in response to a variety of allergic and non-allergic stimuli<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, although the cell-intrinsic factors regulating their pro-inflammatory functions remain poorly characterized. To investigate whether ILC2-intrinsic Arg1 influences lung inflammation, we employed a murine model of acute allergen-induced airway inflammation. Intranasal instillation of papain into <italic>Arg1</italic><sup>YFP</sup> mice resulted in elevated <italic>Arg1</italic> mRNA expression in the lung compared to PBS-treated controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), correlating with increased frequencies of ILC2s in the lung parenchyma (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). These ILC2s retained high expression of Arg1-YFP following allergen exposure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), resulting in elevated frequencies and total cell numbers of Arg1-expressing ILC2s compared to PBS-treated control mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Further, unbiased analysis of total Arg1-YFP<sup>+</sup> cells revealed that ILC2s constituted a major source of Arg1 expression in the inflamed lung (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f,g</xref>). These data suggest that ILC-intrinsic expression of Arg1 influences development or progression of lung inflammation.</p>

Using primary lung tissue obtained from patients diagnosed with COPD or IPF, we next sought to test whether Arg1 is expressed by ILCs during human inflammatory lung disease. Flow cytometric analysis of lineage negative Lin<sup>â</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> ILCs identified all ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 populations in human explant tissues (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) although total ILC frequency and subset distribution did not appear to differ significantly between disease states (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). However, examination of intracellular Arg1 expression revealed a pattern of differential expression among ILC subsets in which IL-33R<sup>+</sup> ILC2s expressed Arg1 and this expression was comparable with CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Within ILC2s, Arg1 expression did not differ significantly between patients diagnosed with COPD versus IPF (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that Arg1 expression may be a more generalized signature of these innate cells during inflammatory conditions and could represent a novel target for clinical therapies modulating arginine metabolism.</p>

We hypothesized that the failure of Arg1-deficient ILC2s to proliferate may be associated with an imbalance in these metabolic substrates due to the disruption of Arg1 activity and potential compensation by the other enzymatic pathways to catabolize the excess arginine in its absence. To examine this, we first cultured IL-33-activated ILC2s in the presence or absence of the Arg1 inhibitor nor-NOHA and measured the relative abundance of metabolites using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>).

Although DMSO-treated cells exhibited high abundance of the immediate downstream products ornithine and proline, amounts of these metabolites were severely diminished by Arg1 inhibition (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). We did not observe any corresponding increase in metabolites associated with two other main arginine catabolic pathways that would generate either citrulline-argininosuccinate via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>) or creatine-creatinine biosynthesis via L-Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>), suggesting that excess arginine is likely not diverted through these pathways to compensate for the absence of Arg1.</p>

This upregulation of Arg1 expression in ILC2Ps occurred before the cells express transcripts for effector cytokines IL-5 and IL-13<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which may provide a rationale for why a previous study using IL-5 promoter-driven Cre to delete Arg1 observed no significant effects on ILC2 responses<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.

      <p id="P25">Until the identification of ILC2s as a constitutive source of Arg1, expression of this enzyme was thought to be a defining trait of the myeloid lineage, particularly AAMacs where it serves to regulate wound healing, fibrosis and suppression of T cell responses<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.

Although the reasons for this cellular compartmentalization of Arg1 function require further analysis, it may provide a rationale for reconciling paradoxical reports of the role of Arg1 during type 2 lung inflammation. Previous studies using deletion of myeloid cell-restricted Arg1 have failed to recapitulate the effects observed when global chemical inhibition or absence of hematopoietic cell-restricted Arg1 can dampen airway inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The data presented here demonstrate that deletion of ILC-intrinsic Arg1 acts to limit the magnitude of the ILC2 response itself, thereby diminishing their pro-inflammatory capacity and preventing the development of acute and chronic type 2 inflammation in the lung. Notably, myeloid cell-intrinsic Arg1 expression must be induced via AAMac polarization, a process that is partially dependent on ILC2-derived type 2 cytokines<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, thus revealing an additional indirect mechanism by which ILC2s control Arg1 metabolism during inflammatory conditions.</p>

Further, the identities of the sources of human Arg1 are controversial and incompletely defined.

Although the significance of this restricted expression pattern is not yet clear, IL-33R expression is strongly enhanced on human ILC2s in response to cytokine signals<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and therefore may represent a more activated state ILC2s gain in inflamed tissue. Taken together with the murine mechanistic data, our studies suggest that Arg1 metabolic control of ILC2 function is a critical determinant of both acute and chronic type 2 inflammation in the lung and thus represents a previously unrecognized axis for targeted therapeutics.</p>
      <p id="P27">Despite constitutive expression of Arg1 in ILC2 bone marrow progenitors, the absence of Arg1 did not appear to affect ILC2 development or maturation. Instead, Arg1 activity influenced the ability of these cells to proliferate and exert their pro-inflammatory function upon activation. This suggests a clear demarcation in the role of this enzyme in regulating the inflammatory but not homeostatic state of ILC2s, perhaps due to the differential metabolic requirements of proliferating cells versus those at rest.

Although the effects of Arg1 on arginine and glucose metabolism may not be directly linked and likely involve a complex imbalance of many metabolic intermediates, it is remarkable that disruption of a single urea cycle enzyme profoundly influences such distinct metabolic pathways and may offer a new understanding of the importance of this enzyme beyond the classical urea cycle. As both a constitutive and inflammatory source of arginase, ILC2s appear to occupy a unique functional niche mimicking both Arg1-dependent homeostatic hepatocyte function and inflammation-induced myeloid cell function. Critically however, mammalian survival depends on hepatocyte-intrinsic Arg1 expression above any hematopoietic source<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, perhaps reflecting an evolutionary compartmentalization of arginase activity that fulfills the primary biological need of mammals for urea production while also limiting the pro-inflammatory consequences of Arg1-driven ILC2 activation. Understanding how Arg1 metabolism integrates into the broader metabolic networks that govern the ability of ILCs and other innate immune cells to meet the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands created during tissue inflammation may reveal new therapeutic targets for the treatment of multiple human inflammatory and metabolic diseases.</p>
