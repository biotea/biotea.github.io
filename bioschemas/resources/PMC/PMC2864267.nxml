          <p>Inhibition of macrophage apoptosis by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> has been proposed as one of the virulence mechanisms whereby the pathogen avoids the host defense.

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>The screening of a transposon mutant bank identified several mutants, which, in contrast to the wild-type bacterium, had impaired ability to inhibit apoptosis of macrophages. Among the identified genes, <italic>Rv3659c</italic> (31G12 mutant) belongs to an operon reminiscent of type IV pili. The Rv3654c and Rv3655c putative proteins in a seven-gene operon are secreted into the macrophage cytoplasm and suppress apoptosis by blocking the extrinsic pathway. The operon is highly expressed when the bacterium is within macrophages, compared to the expression level in the extracellular environment. Rv3654c recognizes the polypyrimidine tract binding Protein-associated Splicing Factor (PSF) and cleaves it, diminishing the availability of caspase-8. While <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inhibits apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway, the pathogen does not appear to affect the intrinsic pathway. Inactivation of the intrinsic pathway by pharmacologic agents afftects <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and induces cell necrosis. Likewise, inactivation of PSF by siRNA significantly decreased the level of caspase-8 in macrophages.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is an intracellular pathogen infecting primarily mononuclear phagocytes. The bacterium has developed intricate strategies to evade killing mechanisms of phagocytes <xref rid="pone.0010474-Ting1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Once <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is inhaled and deposited in the alveolar space, it infects alveolar macrophages, prevents phagosome acidification and subsequent fusion of the vacuole with lysosomes <xref rid="pone.0010474-SturgillKoszycki1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Via1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Macrophages control bacterial growth by a number of mechanisms, including the production of reactive oxygen intermediaries and nitric oxide (NO) <xref rid="pone.0010474-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> blocks the delivery of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to the vacuole membrane and consequently avoids the toxic effects of NO <xref rid="pone.0010474-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; although NO still has some impact on the bacterial viability, as evidenced by the increase in bacterial survival in iNOS knockout mice <xref rid="pone.0010474-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Autophagy, a repair mechanism of eukaryotic cells, frequently associated with cell starvation, has also recently been shown to eliminate intracellular bacteria through the delivery of ubiquitin-derived peptide to the mycobacterial vacuoles <xref rid="pone.0010474-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A number of reviews have explored the role of autophagy in host defense against infectious agents <xref rid="pone.0010474-Deretic1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Autophagy is connected through several possible pathways with apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-Deretic1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is plausible to assume that, when infected macrophages fail to kill <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> by autophagy, the alternative host strategy, apoptosis, is used to eliminate the intracellular bacteria <xref rid="pone.0010474-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has the ability to suppress macrophage apoptosis using active mechanisms, with the aim of blocking the expression of apoptosis-associated genes or stimulating anti-apoptosis pathways <xref rid="pone.0010474-Danelishvili1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The importance of apoptosis as a host-defense strategy has also been studied <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0010474-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In one of these studies, while macrophages isolated from mice with resistant <italic>sst1</italic> (super-susceptibility to tuberculosis-1) locus undergo apoptosis in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, macrophages of <italic>sst1</italic>-susceptible mice die after infection and show widespread necrosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A recent study suggested that both H37Rv and H37Ra strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> disrupt the mitochondrial outer membrane, but only the virulent H37Rv induces significant mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss <xref rid="pone.0010474-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Other studies have concentrated their observations on focused aspects of the pathways <xref rid="pone.0010474-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but none thus far have used gene knockout mutants to dissect the possible mechanisms involved. Only recently, a report by Velmurugan and colleagues attempted to investigate a H37Rv mutant clone deficient in suppression of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-Velmurugan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The underlying mechanisms by which virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inhibits apoptosis in macrophages remain largely unknown. Macrophages undergo apoptosis by at least two different pathways. The extrinsic pathway, in which released tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), activates caspase-8. The adaptor proteins TRADD, RIP-1 or FAAD (TRADD in the case of TNF-Î± stimulus), stimulate the downstream caspases, through the type I (extrinsic) or type II (intrinsic) pathways <xref rid="pone.0010474-Boldin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Muppidi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recent work by Kundu and colleagues showed that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced apoptosis is mediated by p38 and ASK-1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), and that the pathogen also induces degradation of FLiPS, which, when ubiquitinated, blocks TNF-Î±-mediated apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-Kundu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In contrast, Chen and colleagues described that the virulent H37Rv strain stimulates LxA4, which inhibits PGE<sub>2</sub> production . PGE<sub>2</sub> protects mitochondrial membranes from damage and inhibits necrosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The discordant findings in the literature, regarding <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> inducing or inhibiting apoptosis, may be related to a large variety of factors, such as cell types, strain phenotype and phases of infection when the studies are carried out. Because of the inconsistency, we decided to investigate the ability and mechanism by which virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv strain suppresses apoptosis and escapes killing by human macrophages, by using the screening of a transposon library to identify mutant(s) that do not inhibited the apoptosis. Previous studies establish that inhibition of apoptosis by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is seen in U937, THP-1 and human monocyte-cleaved macrophages <xref rid="pone.0010474-Danelishvili1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrate that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is capable of blocking the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by secreting effector proteins that interfere with caspases' post-transcriptional events.</p>

        <p>Mouse-passed, virulent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strain H37Rv (ATCC 25618) was cultured for 3 weeks in liquid Middlebrook 7H9 medium or Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates supplemented with 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose and catalase (OADC) enrichment (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). Bacteria were harvested at mid-log phase and adjusted to 1Ã10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen). Kanamycin sulfate was added to all media at a final concentration of 200 Âµg/ml, where appropriate. Human monocytic cell line U937 (ATCC CRL-1593.2) was used for all assays and was grown in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO Laboratories) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were seeded at 80% confluence into 75 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks, in 96-well plates or chamber glass slides, as needed. U937 macrophage monolayers were treated with 500 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 8 h to promote maturation and adherence and then monolayers were replenished with a new medium. After additional 24 h incubation, cells were infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv or transposon mutants at MOI of 10. Infected and uninfected macrophages were collected at different time points for cytotoxicity assay, caspase activity or microarray assays. The percentage of phagocytized bacterium (wild-type or mutants) was calculated from controls grown under identical culture conditions for 3 h and 24 h in 24-well plates.</p>

<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transposon library construction, screening and sequencing</title>
        <p>The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transposon library was generated using the plasmid pTNGJC containing a temperature-sensitive origin of replication, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0010474-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Approximately 5,000 clones were stored in the library, in 50% glycerol at â80Â°C, and used for screening of clones for an increase of macrophage apoptosis compared to wild-type bacterium. U937 cells were treated with Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA, Sigma) and seeded at 1Ã10<sup>5</sup> mononuclear cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. Monolayers were infected with mutants and wild-type at a ratio of 10 bacteriaâ¶1 cell and incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The wells were washed three times with HBSS to remove extracellular bacteria and incubated at 37Â°C. After 5 days of infection, individual wells were visually screened for detached macrophages compare with control. Selected wells were processed for ELISA to confirm changes during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mutant infection. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genes interrupted by the Tn5367 transposon were identified using nonspecific nested suppression PCR method, previously reported by R. Tamme <xref rid="pone.0010474-Tamme1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and sequenced at the Central Service laboratories (CSL), Center for Gene Research and Biotechnology (CGRB), Oregon State University, Corvallis. Database search of the sequenced fragments was performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nih.gov</ext-link>), using BLAST network service.</p>

        <p>The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transposon bank was partially screened (5,000 mutants) for the lack of ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis. The initial selection was performed based on the observation that infected U937 phagocytes would become apoptotic after 4â5 days and detach from the tissue culture wells. TUNEL and ELISA assays confirmed that 99% of detached cells were, in fact, undergoing apoptosis. We visually identified 54 clones in which the number of detached cells in the tissue culture wells differed significantly from monolayers infected with the wild-type bacterium. The selected clones were further evaluated by TUNEL and ELISA assays. Thirty-two of the 54 clones lacked the ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis.

        <p>Identified mutants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0010474-t002">Table 2</xref>. The sequencing of 31G12 mutant demonstrated that the <italic>Rv3659c</italic> gene was inactivated. The gene belongs to an operon of seven genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010474-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The operon is part of the same transcriptional unit, as evidenced by RT-PCR. In this operon the genes <italic>Rv3657c</italic> to <italic>Rv3660c</italic> have significant homology to many bacterial type IV pili and to <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic> pilus assembly <italic>tad</italic> genes. The inactivated <italic>Rv3659c</italic> is part of the pili assembly genes, and has homology to <italic>VirB11</italic>. The downstream genes in the operon are a putative transmembrane protein (Rv3656c) and two secreted proteins (Rv3654 and Rv3655c). The <italic>Rv3654câRv3659c</italic> genes are significantly induced in the intracellular environment, compared with the gene expression in bacteria exposed to RPMI-1640 supplemented by 10% FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010474-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effects of 31G12 complementation</title>
        <p>In order to identify whether the observed phenotype was due to the inactivation of <italic>Rv3659c</italic> or other downstream genes, we created three constructs covering genes encoding for the structural, transmembrane and secreted proteins in the region. Macrophages were infected with complemented 31G12 clones, and monitored for five days for apoptotic changes by the TUNEL assay. In parallel experiments, apoptosis was induced in wild-type infected and uninfected control cells by TNF-Î± (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0010474-t003">Table 3</xref>). While <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv infected macrophages triggered a 24% greater level of apoptosis than uninfected macrophages after five days, infection with the 31G12 mutant led to an increase of apoptosis, 66% compared with uninfected controls. The 31G12 mutant, complemented with pLD31G12-3, a clone containing all six downstream genes of the operon, was able to inhibit apoptosis in a similar fashion to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. In contrast, complementation of 31G12 with pLD31G12-1 or pLD31G12-2 plasmid did not revert the phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0010474-t003">Table 3</xref>). In addition, we observed that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv infection of macrophages was associated with suppression of TNF-Î±-induced macrophage apoptosis as shown on the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0010474-t003">Table 3</xref>.</p>

        <title>Intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and macrophage necrosis</title>
        <p>Since <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is known to exit macrophages by inducing cell necrosis, we decided to examine whether pharmacological inhibition of macrophage apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway could have any impact on the phagocytic cell necrosis induced by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
        <p>In agreement with previously published data, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv infection was associated with reduced macrophage necrosis after 1 and 3 days of infection compared with the level of apoptosis at the same time points (data not shown); however, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> triggered a greater level of necrosis than apoptosis at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010474-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). To identify weather <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced necrosis of macrophages is related to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, host cells were treated with irreversible caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK.TFA (Sigma) and levels of cytotoxicity were determined by 3, 5, 7 and 9 days post-infection. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv-infected macrophages did not undergo necrosis after blocking the intrinsic pathway with the caspase-9 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0010474-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The data indicate that inhibition of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis at later time points had direct correlation to increased levels of necrosis during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of U937 cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>
<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is a pathogen that evolved several different strategies to survive within host cells. Among them are the ability to impair nitric oxide delivery to the phagosome <xref rid="pone.0010474-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the prevention of phagosome-lysosome fusion <xref rid="pone.0010474-SturgillKoszycki1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Via1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and the capacity to interfere with autophagy <xref rid="pone.0010474-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Macrophage apoptosis is a host mechanism of innate immunity that has been shown to eliminate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0010474-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A number of studies, however, have suggested that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of macrophages either induces or blocks apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-Danelishvili1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Velmurugan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which apparently correlates with strain virulence and microbial burden and certainly reflects the different models used. We have evaluated apoptosis and necrosis caused by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv in two cell lines (U937 and THP-1) and in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages <xref rid="pone.0010474-Danelishvili1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In our hands, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of the three macrophages above was associated with inhibition of apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway but did not interfere in a significant manner with the intrinsic pathway. In the current work, by screening a transposon mutant library, we identified two <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> proteins (Rv3654c, Rv3655c) that are exported outside of the bacterial phagosome by a putative secretion apparatus. The choice of these mutants, from among all others, was due to the interesting nature of the chromosomal region containing the inactivated Rv3659c gene. Of note, the âtype IV piliâ operon that contains Rv3654c and Rv3655c is only upregulated when the bacterium is within macrophages. The type II/IV secretion system identified in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is well conserved in many microorganisms, and in some cases, it has been associated with bacterial attachment to epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0010474-Kachlany1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In the majority of the bacteria, however, the function of this chromosomal region is currently unknown. Our findings suggest a novel function for the region that contains genes encoding for four secretion apparatus structural proteins, one transmembrane protein, and two secreted proteins, which interfere with macrophage apoptosis.</p>
      <p>The secreted proteins Rv3654c and Rv3655c interact with host PSF and ALO17, respectively, and as consequence, interfere with extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, as demonstrated by transfecting macrophages with the bacterial proteins. PSF is a factor essential for pre-mRNA splicing <xref rid="pone.0010474-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. PSF has been shown to regulate apoptosis by influencing caspase activity at the translational level. During cell apoptosis, PSF remains intact and phosphorylated, which is not expected of a splicing factor, suggesting a possible secondary function. In fact, we were able to demonstrate that inactivation of PSF leads to significant decrease of caspase-8 expression. Our study also shows that the wild-type bacterium cleaves PSF after 48 h of infection, in contrast with the 31G12 mutant, making it the probable mechanism of inactivation. In fact, the work by Shav-Tal and colleagues suggests that PSF is sensitive to proteolysis and can be degraded <xref rid="pone.0010474-ShavTal1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Alternative explanation for the decrease of PSF would be related to the phosphorylation of PSF, which occurs following macrophage apoptosis. It could make at least some of the protein undetected by antibodies.</p>
      <p>Rv3655c recognizes AL017, a protein usually associated with ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) <xref rid="pone.0010474-Cools1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Various fusion partners of ALK and AL017 have been described, all of them with anti-apoptotic function of cells <xref rid="pone.0010474-Ouyang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Once ALK is activated in the cytoplasm, it migrates into the nucleus and phosphorylates NIPA (nuclear interacting partner of ALK) protein. NIPA protein has been found to inhibit PI3-kinase/AKT anti-apoptotic signaling pathway and then inhibit caspases. Although we could not show the ALK-AL017 interaction, we demonstrated that the ALO17 gene is highly expressed in macrophages, after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv.</p>
      <p>Apoptosis is now considered as one of the host mechanisms of innate immunity. Intracellular pathogens, which overcome many of the killing strategies of phagocytic cells, such as reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen products, antimicrobial peptides and autophagy, had to evolve strategies to survive the apoptosis of the host cell. Because host cells have many triggering mechanisms for apoptosis, and at least three apoptotic pathways are currently known, we can assume that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> had to adapt to all in order to remain viable within macrophages. By screening a transposon mutant library, we identified several deficient mutants that very likely have different or complementary mechanisms to suppress apoptosis. The overlapping functions of bacterial genes point to the importance of the strategy, which, in addition, influence the outcome of infection. Our results also unveil a plausible important strategy of the pathogen. By inhibiting the translation phase of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, other proteins co-expressed with caspases may remain intact to perform potentially significant functions, some of them still unknown. In addition, the level of inhibition is the most efficacious one, not depending on gene regulation, which can be complex. The fact that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> does not seem to significantly suppress apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway is one of the reasons for much of the diverse results in the field. In fact, if one does not use mutants to understand the effect on the pathway, conflicting results are very likely. Our findings suggest that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> acts in different ways to manipulate apoptosis in macrophages. Suppression and, possibly, stimulation of apoptotic pathways by the pathogen depend on the phase of the host cell infection and have important roles in the outcome of the condition, as demonstrated in this study and elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0010474-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This complex interaction can also be responsible for some of the discrepancies among the published results. Data from <italic>in vivo</italic> observation supports that clinical strains capable of inhibiting apoptosis are more virulent <xref rid="pone.0010474-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The finding that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> uses the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as a strategy to induce macrophage necrosis explains, at least in part, the fact that the pathogen appears to inhibit apoptosis selectively through the extrinsic pathway. It is interesting that the bacterium uses the activation of the intrinsic pathway during a very defined phase of infection to induce necrosis. One can propose that there is some advantage to following this particular strategy, although we currently cannot understand it. We do know that the proteins ESAT-6 and CFP-10 appear to participate in the process of macrophage necrosis <xref rid="pone.0010474-MacGurn1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0010474-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is now accepted as a pathogen that escapes the macrophage during a phase of the intracellular life, probably infecting other cells. All the evidence thus far supports the idea that the pathogen triggers necrosis or some lesion of the macrophage surface <xref rid="pone.0010474-vanderWel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The genes linked to this process and the mechanisms are still under investigation. Other pathogens, such as <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, inhibit macrophage apoptosis by targeting pro-death members of the Bcl-2 protein family <xref rid="pone.0010474-Banga1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this case, SidF, a <italic>Legionella</italic> protein, binds to Bcl-rambo and BNIP-3, interfering with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.</p>
      <p>Our model agrees with the model described by Chen and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0010474-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> that the suppressive effect of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections on apoptosis occurs in the extrinsic but not in the intrinsic pathway. We also found that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> uses the intrinsic pathway to trigger necrosis. Future investigation will attempt to enhance our understanding of the complex interaction of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with different apoptotic pathways.</p>
