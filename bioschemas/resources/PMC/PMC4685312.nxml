      <abstract>
        <p><italic>PCGF1</italic> encodes one of six human Polycomb RING finger homologs that are linked to transcriptional repression and developmental gene regulation. Individual PCGF proteins define discrete Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) multi-protein complexes with diverse subunit composition whose functions are incompletely understood. PCGF1 is a component of a variant PRC1 complex that also contains the BCL6 co-repressor BCOR and the histone demethylase KDM2B. To further investigate the role of PCGF1, we mapped the physical interactions of the protein under endogenous conditions in a cell model of neuronal differentiation. Using stringent statistical cut-offs, 83 highly enriched interacting proteins were identified, including all previously reported members of the variant PRC1 complex containing PCGF1, as well as proteins linked to diverse cellular pathways such as chromatin and cell cycle regulation. Notably, a sub-network of proteins associated with the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency (NANOG, OCT4, PATZ1, and the developmental regulator DPPA4) were found to independently interact with PCGF1 in a subsequent round of physical interaction mapping experiments. Furthermore, knockdown of PCGF1 results in reduced expression of DPPA4 and other subunits of the variant PRC1 complex at both mRNA and protein levels. Thus, PCGF1 represents a physical and functional link between Polycomb function and pluripotency.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The regulation of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms operates at several levels. These include modification of DNA itself, modification of the histone proteins in contact with DNA, as well as higher order regulation involving âremodellingâ and three-dimensional rearrangement of chromosomes to increase or decrease accessibility to the DNA by transcription factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Many of these changes are mediated by large heteromeric protein complexes possessing multiple activities that ensure that specific epigenetic changes occur at particular genes at the correct time.</p>
    <p>One family of such complexes are known as Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The genes encoding components of these complexes were originally isolated in genetic screens of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where mutants display a variety of developmental phenotypes, suggesting a critical role for Polycomb genes in the regulating of genes involved in cell fate determination and differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Later biochemical work established that Polycomb function was mediated by two classes of multi-protein enzymatic complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) whose central catalytic functions include histone post-translational modification activities (i.e. ubiquitin ligase and methyltransferase activity respectively). The catalytic core of PRC1 in humans is a heterodimer comprising either of two related E3 ubiquitin ligases, RING1 (RING1A) or RNF2 (RING1B) and one of six PCGF orthologs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
    <p>Additional core components include a chromodomain-containing protein (CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7 or CBX8) and a Polyhomeotic protein (PHC1, PHC2, or PHC3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. To date only PCGF2 and PCGF4 among the six PCGF orthologs have been found in this canonical form of PRC1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. An alternative complex, termed ânon-canonicalâ or âvariantâ PRC1 (vPRC1), was isolated by Gearhart and coworkers and contains PCGF1, RING1, RNF2, RYBP, BCOR, SKP1, and KDM2B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Notably, this variant complex houses proteins capable of both H2BK119 ubiquitination and H3K36 demethylation, suggesting a multifunctional role for vPRC1 linked to gene silencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>The mechanism by which PCGF1/PRC1 is recruited to target genes is not fully understood, but one component, KDM2B (also called FBXL10) houses a Zf-CxxC domain that has affinity for CpG-rich DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments with KDM2B found that it localizes to CpG islands and is often co-located with RNF2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. A subset of all PRC1 targets are reported to be occupied by PCGF1/PRC1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and recently, Blackledge and coworkers showed that recruitment of PCGF1/PRC1 results in H2A K119 ubiquitylation which is required for subsequent recruitment of PRC2 and deposition of H3K27me3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> They also showed that the KDM2B-mediated targeting activity was required for normal mouse development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Transcription factors can also contribute to the recruitment of vPRC1. In mature B cells, BCL6 was shown to play a role in recruiting the PCGF1/BCOR/PRC1 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p>
    <p>The combination of affinity purification and high resolution/high mass accuracy mass spectrometry has significantly increased the power of protein interaction mapping experiments in recent years. Exogenously expressed affinity-tagged proteins can be captured using reagents that recognize tags such as FLAG, HA, and poly-histidine. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to the target protein can be used, with the advantage that the endogenous protein is sampled in its native molecular environment. Affinity tagging approaches were used to identify interactors of PCGF1 and the five other PCGF homologs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These experiments yielded important insights into the composition of PCGF-containing complexes (including the role of the RYBP or YAF2 subunits in defining variant complexes that do not contain CBX SCM-like and PHC proteins) and linked alternative PRC1-related complexes to distinct epigenetic functions. The authors employed exogenous expression of the target protein that may not completely reflect native conditions. Here we used Î±-PCGF1 antibody that is efficient as an immunoprecipitation reagent to purify PCGF1 from NT2 embryonic carcinoma cells, yielding all known components of the variant PCGF1-PRC1 complex, as well as many new potential interactors. Notably, the approach identified a sub-network of pluripotency-associated proteins that interact with PCGF1, including DPPA4, which we found to be under PCGF1 regulatory control.</p>

        <title>A physical interaction screen for PCGF1 under endogenous conditions</title>
        <p>We optimized the experimental conditions needed to purify PCGF1-interacting proteins from undifferentiated NT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). NT2 is a human teratocarcinoma cell line capable of differentiation to neuron and glia phenotype upon treatment with all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. These cells express PCGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and are a good model of Polycomb regulation of neuronal differentiation genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Briefly, nuclear lysates were prepared from undifferentiated NT2 cells, PCGF1 and its interacting partners were immunoprecipitated, and digested using trypsin <italic>in situ</italic> on agarose beads to yield soluble peptides. The peptides were desalted, adsorbed onto C18 zip tips, eluted in high acetonitrile, and separated online by nano-chromatography interfaced with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Î±-PCGF1 but not IgG immunopurified lysates contained PCGF1 and the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex components BCOR, RNF2, and RYBP, indicating efficient immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Notably, the canonical PRC1 component PCGF4 (BMI1), and the PRC2 methyltransferase EZH2 were not detected in the purified lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). High peptide coverage of known members of the variant PRC1 complex showed that the mass spectrometry experiments were sufficiently sensitive to reliably detect PCGF1 and its interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

        <title>PCGF1 co-purifies with members of the variant PCGF1-PRC1 complex, as well as additional proteins linked to diverse cellular processes</title>
        <p>Protein abundance was determined by label-free mass spectrometry and used to compare samples immunoprecipitated using Î±-PCGF1 from samples immunoprecipitated in parallel experiments using mouse agarose beads (IgG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) as a negative control. Volcano plots project data describing the enrichment of proteins in an immunoprecipitated sample, and the statistical significance of that enrichment (t-test P-value), onto two dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). To confirm these results, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments on PCGF1 precipitates using antibodies to PCGF1, BCOR, and a newly detected interactor, DPPA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). None of the precipitated proteins were found to interact with the canonical PRC1 component PCGF4, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. These MS data confirmed strong recovery of PCGF1 itself, all previously reported members of the PCGF1/PRC1 complex and 74 additional proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The set of PCGF1 interacting proteins was analysed for enrichment in annotated functional properties using the BiNGO Gene Ontology network tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and the functional categories are summarized in a network representation of the interacting proteins centred on PCGF1/PRC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These potential interactors include members of other epigenetic regulatory assemblies such as SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodelling Complex (SMARCC2, ARID1B), normally considered to interact antagonistically with Polycomb proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, cell cycle related proteins (SASS6, LETMD1), DNA replication and repair proteins (MRE11A, DDB1), as well as proteins linked generally to protein and RNA binding. Interestingly, the well-known pluripotency factor NANOG was found to interact with PCGF1 in our experiments, as well as other proteins linked to pluripotency such as DPPA4 and PATZ1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Although the functional interdependency of Polycomb genes and regulators of pluripotency is well known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and it was recently shown that PCGF1 can regulate expression of OCT4 through binding of its promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, we are unaware of earlier reports of a physical association between a PCGF protein and NANOG, DPPA4 or PATZ1. In summary, our experiments confirmed that PCGF1 interacts with the variant PRC1 complex component BCOR. In contrast, DPPA4 interacted with PCGF1, but not BCOR, suggesting that it is not a member of either canonical or variant forms of the PRC1 complex.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Analysis of molecular mass and relative stoichiometry of PCGF1-containing complexes</title>
        <p>We next focused on describing the physical PCGF1-containing complex(es). We estimated the relative subunit stoichiometry of PCGF1 to its interaction partners using mass spectrometry ion signal, and we used size exclusion chromatography to attempt to resolve complexes of differing size. Ion signal intensity can serve as a semi-quantitative measure of relative protein content by summing the intensities recorded for peptides unique to parent proteins, adjusting for protein size and the presence of computationally predicted ionizable peptides, and normalizing the data to the targeted protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This analysis suggests that the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex is the main location for PCGF1 in undifferentiated NT2 cells since it purifies in high ratios with KDM2B, BCOR, and other PRC1 components. Lower amounts of co-purifying DPPA4, NANOG, and SKP1 were observed, suggesting sub-stoichiometric but significant interactions. Pairs of proteins that interact at low stoichiometry can indicate that an interaction is transient or of low affinity (e.g. enzymes and substrates), or that the two proteins are present together in a complex of low abundance. In an attempt to investigate these alternatives, total protein lysate from NT2 cells was separated by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the fractions probed using antibodies for PCGF1, BCOR, RING1, DPPA4, PCGF4, CBX8, and EZH2. All these proteins were found to be present in high mass complexes with slight differences in distribution profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In our experiment, DPPA4 showed an elution pattern distinct from that of PCGF1. DPPA4 appeared to be present in a high mass complex of ~2âMDa, a smaller complex of ~300âKDa, and in a low mass form (~50â100âKDa). The high mass complex containing DPPA4 may be similar or identical to variant PCGF1/PRC1, since it has a similar elution profile to BCOR, and is similar to the PCGF1-containing vPRC1 described by others, for example those observed when affinity-tagged PCGF proteins were stably expressed in 293TREx cells by Gao and coworkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In other words, in this scenario DPPA4 would represent a new member of the vPRC1 complex. However, this seems not to be the case, since DPPA4 and BCOR did not co-precipitate with each other, raising the possibility that DPPA4 co-purifies with PCGF1 in a high mass complex distinct from variant PRC1. The total mass of a complex containing single copies of PCGF1, BCOR, KDM2B, RNF2, and RYBP (30, 192, 152, 38, 25âKDa respectively) would be approximately 440âKDa. The size exclusion experiments do not formally prove that the high mass complexes that contain PCFG1 and DPPA4 are in fact overlapping. The stoichiometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>) argue that &lt;50% molar proportion of PCGF1 is associated with DPPA4. Furthermore, antibody to DPPA4 weakly stained eluate from Fraction 35, where protein markers of molecular mass 60âKDa eluted. Therefore, DPPA4 may participate in multiple assemblies, some very large, but also a small complex that could represent a dimeric form of DPPA4 (2âÃâ33KDa), or potentially a heterodimer with PCGF1 (30â+â33âKDa). Additional biophysical experiments will be needed to investigate further.</p>

        <title>A pluripotency-associated sub-network linked to PCGF1</title>
        <p>Since the NT2 cell model displays a partial pluripotency phenotype (for example the expression of high levels of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> and the repression of differentiation genes such as <italic>HOXA9</italic>), we reasoned that the sub-network of proteins linked to maintenance of pluripotency (NANOG, DPPA4, PATZ1) may share interaction partners with PCGF1. Although we did not detect it in our initial PCGF1 physical interaction screen, the pluripotency gene <italic>OCT4</italic> has also been functionally linked to Polycomb function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Therefore we carried out four physical interaction mapping experiments identical to the PCGF1 immunoprecipitation/MS experiment but this time using antibodies to NANOG, OCT4, DPPA4, and BCOR (a component of the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex). In all four immunoprecipitation/MS experiments, PCGF1 was found to be present using high stringency volcano plot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Although neither PCGF1, nor NANOG, nor DPPA4, co-purified with OCT4 when those proteins were immunoprecipitated, the opposite was not the case â PCGF1, DPPA4 and NANOG were all detected in OCT4 immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry, although the interaction of OCT4 with DPPA4 was below the FDR cut-off.</p>
        <p>PCGF1, BCOR, DPPA4 and NANOG showed distinct patterns of association with the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As expected, PCGF1 and BCOR shared an association with multiple members of the complex (KDM2B, RYBP, RNF2, USP7, SKP1). NANOG also co-purified with variant PRC1 members KDM2B, RNF2, USP7, as well as proteins linked to canonical PRC1 complexes such as PCGF2, PCGF4, CSNK2A1, PHC1 and PHC2. This suggests that NANOG physically associates with multiple distinct Polycomb complexes in undifferentiated NT2 cells. Notably, apart from PCGF1 itself, known subunits of the PCGF1/PRC1 complex were absent from DPPA4 and OCT4 immunoprecipitation experiments. The interactions of PCGF1 with BCOR, RNF2, DPPA4, NANOG and OCT4 were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis using Î±-PCGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The signal from this co-immunoprecipitation experiment was noticeably weak (and in the case of DPPA4 associated with a doublet band, possibly due to a gel effect). For this reason, we confirmed the interaction between PCGF1 and DPPA4 by exogenously expressing a FLAG-tagged PCGF1 in NT2 cells and western blotting for using antibody to DPPA4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Investigation of the PCGF1 pluripotency sub-network in a neuronal differentiation model</title>
        <p>In order to investigate potential functional links between PCGF1 and the pluripotency factors DPPA4, NANOG, and OCT4, we used the NT2 model of cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We confirmed that the model displays a differentiation phenotype by showing down-regulation of the pluripotency factor OCT4 (POU5F1), and up-regulation of the neuronal Polycomb target gene differentiation markers such as <italic>MEIS1</italic>, <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>HOX</italic> genes following addition of retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Moreover, the differentiated cells show an elongated morphology distinct from that of undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In order to confirm that DPPA4, NANOG, OCT4 and BCOR were differentially expressed, nuclear lysates were analyzed using western blotting with relevant antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). These experiments confirmed that DPPA4, OCT4 and NANOG were all strongly or completely down-regulated following differentiation, at the level of both protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>) and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). In contrast, neither the canonical PRC1 subunit PCGF4, nor the PRC2 subunit EZH2, were down-regulated, suggesting that PCGF1 plays a specific role in NT2 cell differentiation that is distinct from the roles of other PCGF homologs or that of the PRC2 complex. Global levels of the PRC1 substrate histone lysine 119 ubiquitination (H2AK119Ub) were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

        <title>PCGF1 expression correlates with DPPA4 expression in NT2 cells</title>
        <p>Since PCGF1 shows similar expression patterns to DPPA4 and NANOG, and physically associates with them, we asked whether PCGF1 might serve as a regulator of DPPA4 or NANOG in NT2 cells. Knock-down of <italic>PCGF1</italic> resulted in reduced levels of NANOG and DPPA4 (but not OCT4) protein, raising the possibility of involvement of PCGF1 in the regulation of these pluripotency factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Reduced <italic>PCGF1</italic> also led to reduced protein levels of the variant PRC1 subunit BCOR, but not of the RNF2 subunit. BCOR that is affinity purified from HeLa cells primarily co-purifies with a complex very similar to the variant PCGF1/PRC1 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In contrast, RNF2 has been purified in the context of several different multi-protein complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, perhaps explaining why these two proteins show different behaviour following knockdown of PCGF1. Interestingly, knockdown of PCGF1 also resulted in reduced levels of PCGF4 but not of PRC2 subunit EZH2, suggesting a level of auto-regulatory activity among PCGF genes. Furthermore, even though levels of RNF2 were not reduced following knockdown of PCGF1, we noted a small but detectable decrease in the levels of global H2AK119ub. This could arise from reduced levels of either variant PCGF1/PRC1 or of canonical PCGF4/PRC1, both of which mediate H2A K119 ubiquitination.</p>
        <p>The reduced NANOG and DPPA4 that we observed could originate from: a) reduced mRNA expression because PCGF1 is a direct or indirect regulator of the downstream genes, or b) increased degradation of NANOG and DPPA4 protein in the absence of a (direct or indirect) stabilizing interaction with PCGF1. In order to investigate these possibilities, we used qPCR to measure the expression of mRNA following knockdown of <italic>PCGF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>) and found gene expression levels to broadly correlate with protein levels. mRNA of the variant PCGF1/PRC1 subunits <italic>BCOR</italic>, <italic>KDM2B</italic>, and <italic>RYBP</italic> were significantly down-regulated, but <italic>RNF2</italic> mRNA was only modestly down-regulated. The pluripotency factors NANOG and DPPA4 were down-regulated at the protein level, as was PCGF4 to a lesser degree. For NANOG and DPPA4 the reduction in protein expression appeared to be more profound than the reduction in mRNA levels (one of the shRNAs used for PCGF1 was incompletely effective). This raises the possibility that PCGF1 is involved in the regulation of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>DPPA4</italic> at the level of transcription. However, ChIP experiments designed to investigate this did not perform in our hands using this antibody.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In order to map the physical interactome of PCGF1 in a context as close as possible to its native environment, we used an endogenous immunoprecipitation approach in a cell line with neural progenitor cell properties. We detected an interaction between PCGF1 and DPPA4 that seems to be independent of other members of the vPRC1 complex. Both DPPA4 and a related family member, DPPA2 (35% amino acid sequence identity), encode SAP (Scaffold attachment factor â Acinus â Protein inhibitor of activated STATs) domains, are close together on chromosome 16, and are expressed in pluripotent cells and developing germ lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. One or both of these genes have been detected repeatedly in screens for pluripotent activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. To our knowledge, DPPA4 has not previously been described in connection with Polycomb biology, apart from a potential physical interaction between the DPPA4 and the Polycomb protein L3MBTL2 listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary material</xref> of a large-scale screen of human protein-protein interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Although we did not detect this protein among PCGF1 interactors, L3MBTL2 was recently found to be a component of a PRC1-related complex isolated from stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Taken together, our mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation experiments argue that a modest fraction (perhaps 5â10% based on stoichiometry analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>) of PCGF1 is complexed with DPPA4 and NANOG in cultured NT2 cells, but that conversely, the majority of DPPA4 and NANOG is present independently of PCGF1. This is consistent with a regulatory relationship between PCGF1 and the pluripotency factors, whereby the interaction is either transient, or is present in a subset of loci occupied by PCGF1-PRC1.</p>
      <p>Knockdown of <italic>DPPA4</italic> using shRNA was previously found to decrease expression of pluripotency markers like <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>REX-1</italic> in differentiating ES cells, and this result (along with a finding that DPPA4 binds the promoter regions of <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic>) was interpreted as indicating a role for DPPA4 in ES cell renewal and inhibition of differentiation markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, later work using ES cell lines and homozygous mutant mice found no change in expression of pluripotency markers arising from loss of <italic>DPPA4</italic>, nor evidence for an essential role in self-renewal or pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. These authors did find that <italic>DPPA4</italic> null mice died late embryonically/perinatally and displayed defects in the skeletal development, which suggests that DPPA4 plays an important developmental role. However as the allele was not conditional so they were unable to test for a maternal effects which could manifest at a very early developmental stages. Interestingly, <italic>DPPA4</italic> was also recently found in a screen for oncogenic foci-inducing genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The authors confirmed the finding in transformation assays in NIH3T3 cells and immortalized fibroblasts, and in an immunodeficient mouse tumor model. The mechanism of enhanced proliferation appeared to involve regulation of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, since overexpression of <italic>DPPA4</italic> led to up-regulation of transcripts for genes such as <italic>CCNB1</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>E2F1</italic>, and <italic>MTBP</italic>. Variant PRC1 itself has been implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation. The variant PRC1 protein KDM2B was found to influence the regulation of proliferation and senescence through regulation of the <italic>INK4A</italic> and <italic>INK4B</italic> loci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Although the details of how the function of variant PRC1 or DPPA4 influence cellular proliferation pathways are unclear, both hESCs and iPSCs have tumor promotion properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, while the importance of cancer stem cells in both solid and liquid tumors is now well recognized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>
      <p>A notable outcome of our work is the finding that disruption of PCGF1 expression leads to decreased expression of: a) some, but not all, members of the variant PRC1 complex; b) at least one other PCGF ortholog (and component of a canonical PRC1 complex); and c) pluripotency factors including DPPA4 and NANOG. The presence of PCGF1 is associated with active expression of NANOG and DPPA4. It is unclear if our data indicates that PCGF1 directly stimulates transcription of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>DPPA4</italic>, or acts indirectly, for example by repressing expression of a negative regulator of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>DPPA4</italic>. The observations raise the possibility of the presence of a network of interrelated feedback loops that serve to regulate gene expression among the network. In this context, the recent finding that over- and under-expression of PCGF1 correlates with expression of pluripotency factors NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells is of interest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The nature and dynamics of such auto-regulatory loops are currently unknown, however evidence from computational modelling approaches suggest an important role for feedback loops in Polycomb biology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Although Polycomb complexes are generally associated with repression of gene expression, the presence of multiple interconnected regulatory feedback loops may explain the counter-intuitive observation that decreased PCGF1 leads to reduced expression of its ortholog <italic>PCGF4</italic> at the level of mRNA expression. For example, PCGF2 as been shown to repress <italic>PCGF4</italic> in human fibroblast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p>
      <p>If such a mechanism operates in NT2 cells, then decreased PCGF2 expression arising from PCGF1/PRC1-mediated repression could plausibly lead to increased <italic>PCGF4</italic> expression. By corollary, disruption of <italic>PCGF1</italic> activity in our shRNA experiment could lead to increased <italic>PCGF2</italic> and therefore reduced <italic>PCGF4</italic> expression. Further genetic and biochemical studies will hopefully shed light on the direction and reciprocity of Polycomb-Polycomb and Polycomb-Target regulatory mechanisms within pluripotency networks, the mechanisms by which they operate (i.e. direct or indirect), and the nature of the PRC1-related complexes involved.</p>
