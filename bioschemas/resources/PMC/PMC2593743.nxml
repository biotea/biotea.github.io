      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">The ESCRT machinery, including ESCRT-III, localizes to the midbody and participates in the membrane abscission step of cytokinesis. The ESCRT-III protein CHMP1B is required for recruitment of the MIT domain-containing protein spastin, a microtubule severing enzyme, to the midbody. The 2.5 Ã structure of the C-terminal tail of CHMP1B with the MIT domain of spastin reveals a specific, high-affinity complex involving a non-canonical binding site between the first and third helices of the MIT domain. The structural interface is twice as large as that of the MIT domain of VPS4-CHMP complex, consistent with the high affinity of the interaction. A series of unique hydrogen bonding interactions and close packing of small side-chains discriminate against the other ten human ESCRT-III subunits. Point mutants in the CHMP1B binding site of spastin block recruitment of spastin to the midbody.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">The ESCRT (<underline>e</underline>ndosomal <underline>s</underline>orting <underline>c</underline>omplex <underline>r</underline>equired for <underline>t</underline>ransport) machinery is best known for its role in membrane cleavage events during the inward budding of intralumenal vesicles into endosomes <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, and in the budding of enveloped viruses such as HIV-1 from the plasma membrane <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. However, two key components of the ESCRT machinery, ESCRT-I and ALIX, were recently found to localize to the midbody, where they carry out essential roles in membrane abscission during cell division <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P3">Cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, is the final step of the M phase of the cell cycle, and the key events in cytokinesis are coordinated by the microtubule-based central spindle <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Cytokinesis begins with the formation of the contractile ring, which drives the growth of the cleavage furrow. When the furrow extension ends, the contractile ring disassembles, and a structure known as the midbody remains as the final tether between the two daughter cells. The midbody consists of tightly packed microtubules and associated proteins. Much recent attention has centered on the recruitment of membrane trafficking machinery to the midbody in order to carry out the cleavage of the membrane neck, a process known as abscission <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In addition to ESCRT-I and ALIX, ESCRT-III has emerged as an intriguing player in cytokinesis. ESCRT-III proteins form circular arrays <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> or tubes <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> that suggest a possible means for their putative membrane scission activity<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In fact, ESCRT-III subunits that have been shown to localize to midbodies and have been implicated in cytokinesis include CHMP2A, 4A, 5 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">ref 5</xref>) and 3 (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">ref 12</xref>)(Human ESCRT-III subunits and corresponding yeast orthologs: CHMP1 = DID2; CHMP2 = VPS2; CHMP3 = VPS24; CHMP4 = SNF7; CHMP5 = VPS60; CHMP6 = VPS20).</p>
    <p id="P4">MIT (present in <underline>m</underline>icrotubule-<underline>i</underline>nteracting and <underline>t</underline>rafficking molecules) domains are a divergent group of three-helix bundles that in many cases bind to C-terminal motifs in ESCRT-III proteins<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Indeed, the MIT domain of the AAA ATPase VPS4 binds to CHMP1B, and the structure of the complex has been determined <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. CHMP1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B comprise a subset of ESCRT-III proteins that contains a âMIT-interacting motifâ (MIM) that binds to the VPS4 MIT domain <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. VPS4 disassembles membrane-bound ESCRT-III aggregates, and the MIT domain-MIM interaction is the main mechanism by which VPS4 binds its substrate.</p>
    <p id="P5">The N-terminal region of microtubule-severing protein spastin, another AAA ATPase, also harbors a MIT domain that binds to the ESCRT-III protein CHMP1B <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Spastin is encoded by <italic>SPG4</italic>, which is mutated in the most common form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. The hereditary spastic paraplegias comprise a group of inherited neurological disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs due to a length-dependent axonopathy of upper motor neurons. Although nearly 40 distinct genetic loci have been described (<italic>SPG1-38</italic>), up to 40% of the cases are caused by autosomal dominant <italic>SPG4</italic> mutations <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The C-terminal AAA ATPase domain of spastin forms a hexamer around a central pore, while the N-terminal regions project from the central core and bind to tubulin subunits <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Spastin orthologs are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and it is widely expressed in human tissues and cell types throughout the body. Although spastin has been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement and dynamics, its functional roles within the cell remain unclear. Spastin has been shown to localize prominently to the midbody <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. In light of recent findings that ESCRT participates in membrane abscission in cytokinesis and that many ESCRT components localize to the midbody, the demonstrated midbody localization of spastin, and the ability of spastin to bind to CHMP1B, we decided to explore whether CHMP1B and spastin might recruit or regulate one another at the midbody.</p>
    <p id="P6">We found that CHMP1B and spastin colocalize at midbodies in dividing HeLa cells, and that knockdown of CHMP1B reduced the amount of spastin at midbodies. Biochemical analysis showed that spastin interacted with CHMP1B with a higher affinity than other previously characterized MIT domain-ESCRT-III interactions. We went on to determine the crystal structure of the complex between the C-terminal â¼40% of CHMP1B (CHMP1B-CTR) and the MIT domain of spastin, and characterized their binding interaction. The structure manifested an interface nearly twice as large as the previously described MIT domain-ESCRT-III interactions, and it contained many hydrogen bonds consistent with a highly specific mode of interaction. On the basis of the crystal structure, we engineered a mutant form of spastin incapable of binding to CHMP1B. This mutant spastin does not localize to midbodies. These results show that spastin and CHMP1B interact in a highly specific manner and that CHMP1B recruits spastin to the midbody, suggesting that spastin could play a role in cytokinesis.</p>

        <title>Depletion of CHMP1B impairs spastin localization</title>
        <p id="P7">Spastin localizes prominently to the midbody in dividing cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 19</xref>), and we examined the localization of HA-tagged CHMP1B as well as endogenous CHMP1B in HeLa cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Notably, CHMP1B was enriched at midbodies in dividing cells, where it colocalized prominently with endogenous and Myc-tagged spastin as well as endogenous CEP55 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and CHMP5 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). CHMP1B was also present diffusely throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In most cells, both spastin and CHMP1B appeared localized at the periphery of the Flemming body, as identified using phase contrast imaging (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Immunostaining appeared centrally as well in some cells, particularly when proteins were overexpressed, but spastin and CHMP1B were consistently more enriched peripherally (data not shown). Together, these data support a more peripheral midbody localization for both CHMP1B and spastin, and this co-localization prefigured an important cellular context for the functional interaction of spastin and CHMP1B.</p>
        <p id="P8">We investigated whether the CHMP1B-spastin interaction was important for protein targeting. After knocking down CHMP1B expression using siRNA, we found that nearly all CHMP1B staining was specifically depleted at the midbody and elsewhere throughout the cell, confirming the specificity of the antibody (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). In cells expressing Myc-spastin, CHMP1B depletion by siRNA resulted in the disappearance of Myc-spastin from the midbody in most cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Spastin was present at midbodies in 82.3 Â± 3.5% of control siRNA-treated cells, but only in 39.0 Â± 2.7% of CHMP1B siRNA-treated cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), indicating that CHMP1B has a role in the recruitment of spastin to the midbody.</p>
        <p id="P9">Recent studies have indicated that depletion of ESCRT-III proteins can alter midbody structure and morphology <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and in fact we saw evidence of that in cells lacking CHMP1B. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, in some cases the characteristic dark zones of the midbodies did not appear to be present. To establish that the lack of spastin at midbodies in CHMP1B siRNA cells did not simply reflect loss of midbodies, we depleted another midbody ESCRT-III subunit, CHMP5, using siRNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In CHMP5-depleted cells, which exhibited similar effects on midbodies, spastin localized to midbodies in 73.7 Â± 17.4% of cells, compared with 94.4 Â± % in the control siRNA-treated cells (<italic>p</italic>=0.23), indicating the specificity of CHMP1B among ESCRT-III subunits in spastin recruitment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). In fact, even the minimal decrease in spastin recruitment in CHMP5-depleted cells might be fully explained by the decreased presence of CHMP1B at midbodies in these cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p>

        <title>The spastin-CHMP1B interaction</title>
        <p id="P10">To establish further the role of CHMP1B in recruitment of spastin to midbodies, we investigated the specificity of spastin interactions with ESCRT-III proteins, employing yeast two-hybrid assays to study interactions of the spastin MIT domain with the 11 known human CHMP proteins. The MIT domain of spastin (comprising residues 110-195) interacted robustly with CHMP1B (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), but not with any other CHMP proteins tested, including CHMP1A. The C-terminus of CHMP1B (residues 174-199) was necessary and sufficient for this interaction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, the number of CHMP1B residues required for the interaction was greater than that predicted from the published CHMP1B-VPS4 MIM interaction. Interestingly, C-terminal domains of CHMP proteins function as autoinhibitory switches <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, and indeed removal of the C-terminal spastin-binding domain of CHMP1B markedly increased its ability to self-associate (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). To determine whether isolated C-termini of other CHMPs might uncover weaker interactions with the spastin MIT domain, we tested all CHMP C-termini against the spastin MIT domain in yeast two hybrid tests. We found that CHMP1B interaction with spastin was highly specific whether assayed with the full-length proteins or the C-terminal tails (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">To corroborate the unique preference of the spastin MIT domain for CHMP1B as opposed to all other CHMP isoforms, the binding of purified C-terminal tails of CHMP1B and its closest homologue CHMP1A (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) were compared. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, no binding of the spastin MIT domain was observed to the CHMP1A tail. The affinity of the spastin MIT domain-CHMP1B interaction was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and found to have a K<sub>d</sub>=12 Î¼M, substantially higher than the 33 Î¼M for VPS4 MIT domain binding to CHMP1B (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>) <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the spastin MIT domain is highly specific for interaction with CHMP1B and binds to it more tightly than other characterized MIT domain-ESCRT-III interactions.</p>

      <sec id="S4">
        <title>Structure of the spastin-CHMP1B complex</title>
        <p id="P12">To investigate the structural basis for this specificity, the crystal structure of the spastin MIT domain bound to the CHMP1B-CTR was determined and refined at 2.5 Ã resolution (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.3</xref>). There are six copies of a 1:1 spastin MIT-CHMP1B-CTR complex in the asymmetric unit (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The C-terminal helix of CHMP1B, comprising residues 174-196, fills a 30 Ã-long groove between helices Î±1 and Î±3 that runs the entire length of the spastin MIT domain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). A second helical fragment from CHMP1B, spanning residues 148-163, was also visualized in the structure. This helix folds against the back side of the CHMP1B C-terminal helix (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and has minimal contact with the MIT domain. The total surface area buried upon complex formation is 1946 Ã<sup>2</sup>. Of this area, the C-terminal helix alone is responsible for the burial of 1836 Ã<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p id="P13">The C-terminal three turns of the CHMP1B C-terminal helix contain the MIM, the same region previously found to be responsible for binding to the MIT domain of VPS4. Leu188 and Leu192, the first two Leu residues of the MIM, are completely buried in hydrophobic pockets in the spastin MIT domain groove (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The third Leu of the MIM, Leu195, is partially buried. Spastin residues Phe124, Leu127, and Ile131 of Î±1, and Met187 of Î±3, are the major hydrophobic residues in contact with the MIM Leu residues. The remaining Leu binding sites are contributed by aliphatic portions of polar side chains. The C-terminal half of the CHMP1B C-terminal helix makes just two polar contacts with the MIT domain; CHMP1B Arg191 makes a salt-bridge with spastin Glu135, while CHMP1B Ser189 forms a hydrogen bond with spastin Asn184 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P14">In contrast to the C-terminal half of the CHMP1B helix described above, the three turns of the N-terminal half lack large hydrophobic side chains (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, e, f</xref>). The residues in this region diverge from the sequences of all other ESCRT-III proteins (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Of the seven residues within this region that make direct contact with the spastin MIT domain, only one is identical in CHMP1A (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). These interactions include hydrogen bonds between CHMP1B Ser175 and Ser179 with spastin Arg173; CHMP1B Thr178 with spastin Arg117; and CHMP1B Asp186 with spastin Lys180 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). CHMP1B Glu184 and Gln185 form a hydrogen bond relay with spastin His120 and Asn184. Spastin His120 is sandwiched between the two CHMP1B side-chains, while CHMP1B Gln184 is sandwiched between the two spastin side-chains (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Hydrophobic contacts are made between spastin and the small side chains of Val180, Ala181, and Ala183 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e, f</xref>). The restricted packing around these small side chains precludes the presence of any larger residues at these positions. As described in more detail below, mutation of small amino acids in this region to larger ones abrogates binding to spastin, but not VPS4 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The combination of hydrogen bonding and steric packing restrictions imposes strict constraints on the nature of sequences capable of binding to this half of the Î±1-Î±3 groove.</p>

        <title>Specificity determinants</title>
        <p id="P15">The spastin MIT domain binding site for CHMP1B lies between helices Î±1 and Î±3. This is in sharp and unexpected contrast to the Vps4 MIT domain, which uses a site between Î±2 and Î±3 to bind to MIMs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). In a second major contrast, the spastin MIT-CHMP1B interface is nearly twice as extensive as the VPS4A MIT interface. The VPS4A-CHMP1A complex <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> buries 1013 Ã<sup>2</sup> of surface area, just half of the area buried in the spastin-CHMP1B complex. The C-terminal CHMP1B helix bound to spastin is twice as long as the CHMP1A helix bound to VPS4A, fully accounting for the difference in buried surface area. To highlight the similarities and differences, we constructed a model for the CHMP1B-VPS4A MIT domain complex by overlaying the crystallized CHMP1B C-terminal helix with the CHMP1A MIM as seen in the solution structure of its complex with VPS4A (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Despite the major differences in the location and extent of the binding site described above, all three key Leu residues of the CHMP1B helix bind to hydrophobic pockets on both of the MIT domains (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). The character of the pockets is similar, even though they are made up of completely different residues on two different faces of the MIT domain. Arg191, part of the MIM consensus, forms a salt bridge in both contexts, again with acidic residues in completely different positions on the MIT domain. Thus, the conserved MIM region is bifunctional in CHMP1B in that it binds to both VPS4 and spastin MIT domains. The dual function of the MIM Leu residues confers on CHMP1B its ability to bind to both spastin and VPS4, but not both at the same time. This structural observation was tested using an <italic>in vitro</italic> competition assay (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). We found that the spastin and VPS4 MIT domains compete for the same site, consistent with the overlapping binding site observed in the structures.</p>
        <p id="P16">The unique determinants for spastin binding are almost all located in the N-terminal half of the CHMP1B helix. Within the N-terminal portion (residues 174-185), eight CHMP1B residues form hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions with the spastin MIT domain. Of these, only Ser179 is identical in CHMP1A. Of the remaining seven, a number of sequence differences in CHMP1A vs. CHMP1B give rise to changes in charge, loss of hydrogen bonds, and predicted steric clashes. For example, the tightly packed Thr178 and Ala181 in CHMP1B are replaced by the larger Glu and Val residues in CHMP1A. While none of these sequence changes between CHMP1A and 1B seem likely to completely abrogate binding on their own, in aggregate they explain how spastin discriminates against even the most closely-related CHMP1B homologs, such as CHMP1A.</p>

The mutations F124A and F124D drastically reduce the affinity of the complex as assessed by SPR, consistent with the structure. Mutations of two polar MIT domain residues tested, Arg117 and Arg173, produced either no effect on affinity or increased the affinity slightly (data not shown).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P20">The goal of this study was to explore the interaction between spastin and the ESCRT protein CHMP1B <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. We replicated and extended the previously reported yeast two-hybrid analysis of Reid et al. <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and found that the MIT domain of spastin interacted robustly with CHMP1B, but with none of the other 10 known human CHMP proteins. Furthermore, the interaction with the C-terminal CHMP1B fragment was stronger than the interaction with the full-length protein. This is consistent with the concept that monomeric full length ESCRT-III proteins are in an autoinhibited conformation in which the C-terminal helix folds back over the rest of the protein, blocking its access to potential binding partners <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Finally, the crystal structure of the complex indicates an interaction interface twice as large and a much more extensive involvement of hydrogen bonds than observed in other MIT domain-ESCRT-III complexes <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The predominance of hydrogen bonds in this complex is important because these interactions have a directional dependence that demands exquisite specificity, in contrast to hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the functional importance of these interactions was validated by mutational analysis. These factors taken together pointed unequivocally to a highly specific interaction, and therefore one likely to be physiologically relevant.</p>
      <p id="P21">The structural results highlight the complexity of ESCRT recognition by MIT domains. The C-terminal helices of yeast Vps2 and Did2, and their respective human orthologs CHMP2 and CHMP1 contain (D/E/Q)xxLxx(Q/R)LxxL(K/R) sequences, now known as âMIT interacting motifsâ (MIMs), that are responsible for binding to the Vps4 MIT domain <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. However, MIT domains are a divergent family, and indeed many MIT domains are difficult to identify on the basis of sequence similarity in the absence of three-dimensional structures. For example, Vta1 contains two divergent MIT domains, identified on the basis of three-dimensional structure <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The second Vta1 MIT domain binds to Did2 and Vps60, the yeast ortholog of human CHMP5 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The human ortholog of Vta1 binds tightly to CHMP5, and also to CHMP1B, CHMP2A, and CHMP3 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. The MIT domains of AMSH and UBPY bind to distinct but overlapping subsets of ESCRT-III subunits <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, most of which do not contain the putative MIM consensus sequence. While the spastin MIT domain is more closely related to that of VPS4 than some of the others mentioned above, structural analysis shows that it uses a completely different read-out mechanism than VPS4. While this paper was under review, the structure of an extended motif from CHMP6 now designated âMIM2â was determined in complex with the MIT domain of VPS4<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, and shown to bind between helices 1 and 3, as seen also in the CHMP1B-spastin MIT complex. However, the CHMP6-MIM2 is extended in conformation, rather than helical, and the molecular contacts are not conserved between these complexes. It now appears that an elaborate recognition code embedded at distinct but overlapping sites in ESCRT-III C-termini, as opposed to a single consensus sequence, is read out by a divergent collection of MIT domains. The high density of regulatory information packed into the C-termini of ESCRT-III subunits is reminiscent of other biologically critical tails sequences, such as the N-terminal regions of histones.</p>
      <p id="P22">The main biological finding in this study is that CHMP1B recruits spastin to the midbody, since knock down of CHMP1B results in a diminution of Myc-tagged spastin localization to midbodies. The observation that some spastin remains at midbodies in these cells might be indicative of multiple interactions between spastin and other midbody proteins such as NA14 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, the presence of residual CHMP1B in some cells due to incomplete knockdown, or both. Because the reduction in spastin localization at midbodies was not complete, it is not surprising that cytokinesis was not markedly impaired in the CHMP1B knock down cells (see also the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). The finding that CHMP5 knockdown did not have a substantial effect on spastin recruitment suggests that spastin recruitment results from a specific action of CHMP1B rather than a generic role of CHMP1B in midbody morphology.</p>
      <p id="P23">In an effort to resolve the functional role of the CHMP1B-spastin interaction in recruitment more definitively, a mutant spastin was engineered with an inactivated CHMP1B binding site. The double mutation H120D/F124D was selected on the basis of the crystal structure, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding analysis, and yeast two-hybrid studies. This site was chosen to engineer a selective knockout of CHMP1B binding because of the extraordinarily high specificity of this binding site. In contrast to wild-type spastin, the spastin<sup>H120D/F124D</sup> mutant was rarely observed at midbodies. The mutant was probably more effective than the CHMP1B siRNA knockdown at blocking midbody localization of spastin, because the mutations, even singly, are such potent disruptors of CHMP1B binding.</p>
      <p id="P24">Expression of spastin<sup>H120D/F124D</sup> introduced a cytokinesis defect, while no such effect was observed upon expression of wild-type spastin. Spastin functions as a hexamer and is presumably targeted to midbodies through high-avidity interactions with oligomeric CHMP1B. We speculate the overexpressed spastin<sup>H120D/F124D</sup> mutant acts as a dominant-negative, inactivating endogenous spastin, which is diluted into hexamers consisting primarily of mutant monomers incapable of binding CHMP1B. The localization of spastin to the midbody via the ESCRTs, and the observed defect in cytokinesis, suggest to us that spastin plays a role in cytokinesis. Given the centrality of microtubules in cell division, the possibility that a microtubule severing enzyme has such a role should not be surprising. In a reasonable working model incorporating the results reported here and those of others, CEP55 recruits ALIX and ESCRT-I <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, which recruit the ESCRT-III subunits CHMP4 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and CHMP6, respectively. CHMP4 and 6 recruit CHMP2 and 3, which in turn recruit CHMP1 and 5 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, and finally, through CHMP1B, spastin. These results suggest that microtubule severing and membrane abscission could be coordinated through the spastin-ESCRT connection (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The precise mechanistic basis for the cytokinesis defect, and its relationship to other cellular functions of spastin, will be an important topic for further analysis.</p>

        <title>Speculative model for the role of the spastin-ESCRT-III interaction in cytokinesis</title>
        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) The assembly of CEP55, ESCRT-I, and Alix at the midbody is postulated to recruit ESCRT-III (green spheres indicate generic ESCRT-III subunits). Co-assembly of CHMP1B (orange sphere) into the ESCRT-III array leads to allosteric activation of CHMP1B, exposing its C-terminal helix, and thereby to the recruitment of spastin (blue hexagon). The circular array of ESCRT-III proteins is depicted schematically as inspired by observations of their formation of spiral or helical arrays <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Two CEP55-ESCRT-spastin assemblies are shown in accord with the double cluster visible in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. (<bold>b</bold>) Cleavage of the microtubules (red tubes) by spastin opens a path for ESCRT-III to sever the membrane neck. Direct proof that ESCRT-III severs membrane necks is lacking, but it is widely believed to have such activity, perhaps in conjunction with other ESCRT components <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. (<bold>c</bold>) Midbody resolution can occur on both sides leaving behind a free midbody fragment that is sometimes observed in cell culture, or it may occur stochastically on one side or the other.</p>
