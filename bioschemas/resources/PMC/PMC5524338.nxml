      <abstract>
        <p>Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant inheritable skeletal disorder characterized by cranial dysplasia, clavicle hypoplasia and dental abnormalities. This disease is mainly caused by heterozygous mutations in <italic>RUNX2</italic>, a gene that encodes an osteoblast-specific transcription factor. In the present study, mutational analyses of <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene were performed on four unrelated Chinese patients with CCD. Four different <italic>RUNX2</italic> mutations were detected in these patients, including one nonsense mutation (c.199C&gt;T p.Q67X) and three missense mutations (c.338T&gt;G p.L113R, c.557G&gt;C p.R186T and c.673C&gt;T p.R225W). Among them, two mutations (c.199C&gt;T p.Q67X and c.557G&gt;C p.R186T) were novel and the other two had been reported in previous literatures. Except for Q67X mutation located in the Q/A domain, other three mutations were clustered within the highly conserved Runt domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and RUNX2 fusion protein analyses <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein was disturbed by Q67X mutation, while the other two mutations (c.338T&gt;G p.L113R and c.557G&gt;C p.R186T) had no effects on the subcellular distribution of RUNX2. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that all the three novel <italic>RUNX2</italic> mutations significantly reduced the transactivation activity of RUNX2 on <italic>osteocalcin</italic> promoter. Our findings enrich the evidence of molecular genetics that the mutations of <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene are responsible for CCD.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD, OMIM 119600) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited skeletal disorder, which is characterized by persistently open or delayed closure of cranial sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, and many dental abnormalities, including delayed eruption of secondary teeth accompanied by retained primary teeth, and multiple supernumerary teeth [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, hand abnormalities could also be observed in some patients, such as brachydactyly, tapering fingers, and short, broad thumbs [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Individuals with CCD are shorter than their unaffected sibs and are more likely to have other skeletal/orthopedic problems such as pes planus, genu valgum, and scoliosis [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The spectrum of phenotypes is dramatically variable even within families, ranging from only mildly affected patients with dental abnormalities to severely affected ones with severe defects in skeletal system [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Runt-related transcription factor 2 (<italic>RUNX2</italic>, also known as <italic>CBFA1</italic>) has been identified as the causing gene for CCD [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The human <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene is mapped to chromosome 6p21, consisting of eight coding exons [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is revealed that the osteoblast-specific transcription factor RUNX2 promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts in the cartilage anlagen [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Homozygous <italic>Runx2</italic> knockout mice (<italic>RUNX2</italic><sup><bold>-/-</bold></sup>) will die of respiratory failure soon after birth and shows failure in both intramembranous and endochondral ossification, whilst heterozygous <italic>Runx2</italic> knockout mice (<italic>RUNX2</italic><sup><bold>+/-</bold></sup>) displays similar phenotype with CCD patients in hypoplastic clavicles and defective skull formation [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>The RUNX2 protein contains an N-terminal stretch of consecutive ployglutamine and polyalanime repeats (the Q/A domain), a Runt domain and a C-terminal proline/serine/threomine-rich (PST) activation domain [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Runt domain is a characteristic and highly conserved motif homologous to pair-rule <italic>runt</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation and can be detected in all the three members of the RUNX family [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Runt domain of <italic>RUNX2</italic> is mainly responsible for DNA-binding to a specific motif and heterodimerization with core-binding factor Î² (CBFÎ²), a non-DNA-binding subunit [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The resulting complex binds to cis-acting elements of its targets and regulates the expression of skeletal formation-related genes, such as <italic>osteocalcin</italic> and <italic>osteopontin</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) is located on the carboxyl-terminal border of the Runt domain, and regulates the accumulation of the RUNX2 protein into nuclei [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The PST domain is necessary for RUNX2-mediated transcriptional regulation and is involved in functional interactions with a number of other transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is reported that the Q/A domain is also involved in the regulation of the transactivation activity of RUNX2 target genes [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Up to the present, at least 177 heterozygous mutations in the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene have been identified in CCD patients, majority of which were missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181653.s001">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Chromosomal translocations, splicing mutation, and intragenic deletions / duplications were also found and they were scattered throughout the entire <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>Previously, our research group had reported six unrelated Chinese patients with classic CCD phenotype and identified five mutations in the coding region of the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present study aims to investigate potentially novel mutations of the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene and their impacts on the functions of the RUNX2 protein in patients with CCD, and to explore the genotype-phenotype correlation of this syndrome.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the participants using TIANamp Blood DNA mini kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, PR China) according to the manufacturerâs instruction. The exons (0â7) and exon-intron boundaries of the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers used for both genomic PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing were according to previous literature [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In brief, the PCR reactions was carried out using the following program: an initial denaturation at 94Â°C for 5 min, then 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 20 sec, 62Â°C for 30 sec, and 72Â°C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72Â°C for 7 min. Each reaction of PCR contained 50 ng genomic DNA. DNA Polymerase was purchased from Takara Technologies. Dimethyl sulphoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the Exon1 amplifying system at a final concentration of 10%. After purification, the products of amplification were bi-directionally sequenced in ABI 3730 XL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). DNA sequences were analyzed using all the databases of NCBI and the BLASTN (BLAST nucleotide) program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). The exons are numbered according to GenBank entries AF001443âAF001450. Each mutation was confirmed in at least two independent experiments by nucleotide sequencing.</p>

        <p>Four unrelated Chinese patients were included in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181653.t001">Table 1</xref>). Among them, 2 families were familial cases, and the other two were sporadic ones. All the patients showed typical features of CCD, such as hypoplastic clavicles, patent fontanelles and multiple dental anomalies, including retained deciduous teeth, delayed eruption of permanent teeth. Notably, supernumerary teeth were existed in all the patients, while the number of supernumerary teeth showed moderate variation between patients. Furthermore, stature was found to be significantly short in male patients with CCD compared to the average level of the Chinese population.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of the Runx2 mutants</title>
        <p>As a transcription factor, in physiological conditions RUNX2 was located in the nucleus under the guidance of NLS, which was at the C-terminal border of the Runt domain. Therefore, it was hypothesized that mutations affecting NLS could interfere with the subcellular distribution of RUNX2.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, a RUNX2 reporter with green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag at the C-terminus of pEGFP-N1 vector was constructed. All the detected novel mutations were introduced into wild-type pEGFPN1-RUNX2 construct by mutagenesis, then the constructs were transiently transfected into MC3TC-E1 cells. In contrast to GFP control which was located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181653.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), wild-type RUNX2-GFP fusion protein was predominantly distributed in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181653.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

As expected, Q67X mutant was equi-distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181653.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) which was quite different from the wild-type RUNX2. On the contrary, the other two mutants (L113R, R186T) showed a similar subcellular distribution with the wild-type RUNX2 as a result of the mutations had no effects on NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181653.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, four different heterozygous mutations in the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene were identified in four unrelated Chinese CCD families, including one nonsense mutation and three missense mutations. Among these mutations, two were novel, and the other two had been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All the detected mutations were clustered in the Runt domain except for the nonsense mutation, which was located in the Q/A domain. This is consistent with previous literatures that most of the missense mutations in CCD patients were located within the DNA-binding region of the Runt domain [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This indicated that the Runt domain, which had highly conserved sequence, was very susceptible to amino acid substitution [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, missense mutations were rarely detected in the Q/A and PST domains [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our patient cohort, though all the patients displayed classic CCD phenotypes with hypoplastic clavicles, delayed closure of the fontanelle and dental abnormalities, there is a moderate range of clinical expressivity of phenotype. In this study, short stature was found only in male patients, but we cannot relate it to altered Runt domain as suggested elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This finding was agreed with previous reports published by our group and others [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Supernumerary teeth are usually considered to be a diagnostic feature of CCD. However, the number of supernumerary teeth had a clear variation among patients in the present study. From our previous clinical observations, sometimes the number of supernumerary teeth can be age-dependent in CCD patients, and exact quantification is only possible in adult patients considering all surgical interventions. Therefore, we could not definitely correlate the quantity of supernumerary teeth or body height with altered Runt domain as reported by Yoshida et al [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>The <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene is one of the three mammalian genes encoding the Î± subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor PEBP2/CBF [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PEBP2/CBF is made of two structurally unrelated subunits, Î± and Î² [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The other two Î± encoding genes are RUNX1 [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and RUNX3 [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, only one gene is known to encode the mammalian Î² subunit, termed PEBP2Î²/CBFÎ² [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which has been demonstrated to be essential for both hematopoiesis [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and osteogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Î± subunit is characterized by a highly conserved 128-amino acid region termed the Runt domain, which is responsible for DNA- binding and heterodimerization with the Î² subunit [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Functional studies performed on RUNX1 verified the important role of Runt domain. One study found that R135 and R174 in the Runt domain of RUNX1, which corresponded to R186 and R225 in the Runt domain of RUNX2, directly interacted with DNA but not CBFÎ² [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. And the functional assays found that DNA-binding abilities in R135G, R135A and R174W mutants of RUNX1 were diminished, while the capability of heterodimerization with CBFÎ² still remained [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the R186T and R225W mutants found in RUNX2 were predicted to abolish the DNA-binding ability of the transcription factor, but not the capability of heterodimerization with CBFÎ², though we did not test this functionally. The L113 amino acid residue in the Runt domain of RUNX2, which was homologous to L62 in the Runt domain of RUNX1, was involved in stabilizing the domain structure [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, functional analyses indicated that this mutation in this leucine was defective for both DNA-binding ability and heterodimerization with CBFÎ² [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As the amino acid sequences of the Runt domain exhibited more than 90% identity among the RUNX family, it is suggested that the similar mechanisms in governing the functions of DNA-binding ability and heterodimierzation among the entire family of the RUNX family [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>The NLS of the RUNX2 protein was first delineated as a stretch of nine amino acids (PRRHRQKLD) on the carboxyl-terminal border of the Runt domain in the RUNX2 protein [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As the NLS was responsible for the nuclear localization of the RUNX2 protein, we hypothesized that mutations affecting the NLS region may interfered with the subcellular distribution of RUNX2. To confirm this, the RUNX2-GFP fusion protein reporter was constructed and transient transfection assay was performed. Our GFP reporter assay showed that the Q67X mutation interfered with subcellular localization of RUNX2. This is expectable since the Q67X mutation produced a premature protein truncated at the Q/A domain with only 67 amino acid residues, leading to the absence of other key domains, including the Runt domain, the NLS and the PST domain. This is consistent with our previous study that 172fs and 214fs mutations caused the mutant RUNX2 proteins unable to accumulate in the nucleus as a result of the lack of NLS (4). Other studies also found that <italic>RUNX2</italic> mutations could cause NLS deletion or amino acid changes which would interfere with the subcellular distribution of RUNX2 (12, 22, 25). In contrast, L113R, R186T mutants were missense mutations located in the Runt domain and outside of NLS. Consistently, our GFP reporter assay showed these mutations had no effects on subcellular distribution of RUNX2, which was also reported in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, our transactivation assay revealed that both direct substitution of conserved amino acid residues (L113R, R186T) and truncated protein (Q67X) could result in a significant reduction of the transactivation ability of RUNX2 on <italic>osteocalcin</italic>. These findings are consistent with previous studies by our research group and other researchers [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These results are predictable regarding the crucial role of the Runt domain on RUNX2 functions. Q67X mutation would result in the deletion of the Runt domain, whilst the other two missense mutations (L113R, R186T) were happened in the Runt domain. It is widely known that the Runt domain was essential for RUNX2 to form heterodimerization with CBFÎ² and bind to the promoters of its downstream target genes [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>RUNX2</italic> mutations could impair the Runt domain in both the DNA-binding ability and subsequent transactivation [<xref rid="pone.0181653.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181653.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, all the four CCD patients showed typical manifestations of CCD clinically with similar phenotypes. Thus, for the three patients with missense mutations in the Runt domain, impaired transactivation activities of RUNX2 might be one potential reason of why this kind of patients showed typical manifestations of CCD though their subcellular distribution of RUNX2 was not affected.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, four CCD patients were included in this study and four different heterozygous mutations in the <italic>RUNX2</italic> gene were identified. The c.199C&gt;T p.Q67X mutation not only interfered with the subcellular distribution of RUNX2, but also reduced the transactivation activity of RUNX2 on its downstream target genes. Other two missense mutations (c.338T&gt;G p.L113R and c.557G&gt;C p.R186T) located in the Runt domain severely impaired the transactivation activity of RUNX2 on its downstream target genes, though they had no effects on the subcellular distribution. From these findings, it is expected that the impaired transactivation activity of RUNX2 on its downstream target genes would be responsible for the cause of haploinsufficiency in these cases with CCD.</p>
