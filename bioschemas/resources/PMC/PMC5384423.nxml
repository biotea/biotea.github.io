          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME), a disease with a devastating prognosis, is characterised by neonatal onset of seizures and massive myoclonus accompanied by a continuous suppression-burst EEG pattern. Three genes are associated with EMEs that have metabolic features. Here, we report a pathogenic mutation of an ion channel as a cause of EME for the first time.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Sequencing was performed for 214 patients with epileptic seizures using a gene panel with 109 genes that are known or suspected to cause epileptic seizures. Functional assessments were demonstrated by using electrophysiological experiments and immunostaining for mutant Î³-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor subunits in HEK293T cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We discovered a <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous missense mutation (c.859A&gt;C [p.Thr287Pro]) in the <italic>GABRB2</italic>-encoded Î²2 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in an infant with EME. No <italic>GABRB2</italic> mutations were found in three other EME cases or in 166 patients with infantile spasms. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors bearing the mutant Î²2 subunit were poorly trafficked to the cell membrane and prevented Î³2 subunits from trafficking to the cell surface. The peak amplitudes of currents from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing only mutant Î²2 subunits were smaller than that of those from receptors containing only wild-type Î²2 subunits. The decrease in peak current amplitude (96.4% reduction) associated with the mutant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor was greater than expected, based on the degree to which cell surface expression was reduced (66% reduction).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This mutation has complex functional effects on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, including reduction of cell surface expression and attenuation of channel function, which would significantly perturb GABAergic inhibition in the brain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME) is an epileptic encephalopathy (EE) that, owing to its unique seizure phenotypes and EEG traces, is distinct from other early infantile EEs or Ohtahara syndrome (OS).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> EME is characterised by the onset of fragmentary erratic myoclonic seizures that are seen within the first 10âdays of life and a suppression-burst (SB) pattern in EEGs during all sleep and wakefulness states that is precipitated by deep sleep. Over 50% of children with EME die within the first or second year of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> EME phenotypes are also seen mostly in metabolic disorders (eg, non-ketonic hyperglycaemia, amino and organic acidopathies, urea cycle disorders, mitochondrial disorders and pyridoxine or pyridoxal-5-phosphate disorders); thus, most EMEs are syndromic. In contrast, a minority of patients are ânon-syndromicâ, as they present with sporadic EME in the absence of metabolic disorders. The genetic aetiologies of non-syndromic EME are largely unknown.</p>
      <p>To date, three genes (<italic>ERBB4</italic> [MIM: 600543], <italic>SIK1</italic> [MIM: 605705] and <italic>SLC25A22</italic> [MIM: 609302]) have been associated with EME.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â5</xref>
<italic>ERBB4</italic> and <italic>SIK1</italic> are documented oncogenes, while <italic>SLC25A22</italic> encodes a mitochondrial solute carrier. None of three genes, therefore, has obvious direct associations with neuronal excitability or inhibition. This is in contrast with findings that most EE-causing mutations are in proteins that are closely associated with excitatory or inhibitory synaptic functions, such as ion channels including the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors.</p>
      <p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are ligand-gated chloride ion (Cl<sup>â</sup>) channels and function as pentamers. Though there are multiple subtypes of each subunit (ie, Î±1â6, Î²1â3, Î³1â3, Î´, Îµ, Ï, Î¸ and Ï1â3), a combination of Î±1, Î²2 and Î³2 subunits is the predominant form of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in the mammalian central nervous system. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors play a cardinal role in controlling neural excitability in the central nervous system. Accordingly, mutations in genes encoding Î±1, Î²1, Î²3 and Î³2 subunits (<italic>GABRA1</italic>, <italic>GABRB1</italic>, <italic>GABRB3</italic> and <italic>GABRG2</italic>, respectively) have been found in EEs.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, no mutations of the Î²2 subunit have yet been reported in EEs.</p>
      <p>Here, we report the discovery of a <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous missense mutation in the <italic>GABRB2</italic> gene that encodes the Î²2 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that this mutation causes EME via disruption of GABAergic inhibition in the brain.</p>

        <title>Genetic analysis</title>
        <p>Gene panel sequencing was performed in 214 patients with epileptic disorders using a customised HaloPlex Target Enrichment System (Agilent, Santa Clara, California, USA) for 109 genes that are known or suspected to cause epileptic seizures. The target coverage was 98.78% (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1</xref>). Samples were sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). SureCall software (Agilent) was used for mapping the hg19 and for trimming and aligning of fragments. The frequency of each variant was estimated in several publicly available databases, including 1000 Genomes, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) browser, human genetic variation database, ESP6500 and database SNP142. Pathogenicity of each variant was predicted using SIFT, PolyPhen2 hvar, Mutation Taster, CADD and PhyloP100way vertebrate using the ANNOVAR software. Variants with a frequency &gt;0.005 were classified as polymorphic. Inheritance was confirmed by PCR-Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA from the parents. Follow-up sequencing was performed for all exons and the intron-exon boundaries of <italic>GABRB2</italic> (RefSeq accession number NM_021911) in three patients with EME and 166 patients with infantile spasms (ISs) by PCR-Sanger sequencing.</p>

For mock or single subunit expression, empty pcDNA3.1 vector was added to make a final cDNA transfection amount to 3âÎ¼g. The transfected HEK293T cells were removed from the dishes by trypsinisation and then re-suspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% sodium azide). Following washes with FACS buffer and permeabilisation with Cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences, California, USA) for 15âmin, cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Î²2/3 antibody (1:200) for 2âhours and then incubated with fluorophore Alexa-647-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1âhour at 4Â°C.

There was no history of epilepsy, developmental disorders or other neurological disorders in his parents, an elder sister, or other relatives. Immediately after birth, the boy presented with poor feeding, lethargy and weak crying. Subtle eyelid and limb myoclonus was also noted. He had generalised tonic clonic convulsions (GTCCs) lasting 5â10âmin at the age of 2âmonths and was admitted to the children medical centre of Fukuoka University. Neurological examinations on admission identified drowsy consciousness, poor response to stimulation and hypotonicity. Laboratory results of blood and urine examinations, including evaluation of amino acids, organic acids or lipid metabolism, were all normal and a brain MRI was normal. However, an interictal EEG recording showed a SB pattern during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F1">figure 1</xref>A). Sleep EEG also displayed the SB pattern, of which the suppression components consisted of slow waves with approximately 150âÂµV amplitude continuing for 4â12âs, with an average of 6.5; the burst components indicated multiple focal lesions. During recording of sleep video EEG, we observed myoclonus in the eyelids, which corresponded to the bursts. During the EEG recording, intravenous injection of pyridoxine did not affect the clinical or EEG findings. Myoclonus in the eyelid and limbs was seen frequently every day thereafter and GTCC with apneic spells was seen approximately once a day. These clinical findings suggested a diagnosis of early onset EE, specifically EME. As possible causes of EME, we first considered endocrine disorders, such as hyperthyroidism, and metabolic disorders, such as non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, amino and organic acidopathies, urea cycle disorders, mitochondrial disorders, pyridoxine and pyridoxal-5-phosphate disorders, molybdenum cofactor deficiency, sulfite oxidase deficiency, Menkes syndrome, Zellweger syndrome and other disorders, because of the appearance of a normal brain structure in MRI analysis. General serum biochemistry tests, including ammonia, lactic acid, pyruvic acid and copper levels, were normal. Urine tests, including the qualitative reaction of sulfurous acid, were normal. Serum free T3, T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were in the normal range. Mass spectrometry and amino acid analyses for serum, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed normal concentrations of glycine in the serum and urine, low CSF:serum ratios and normal levels of taurine, cystatin, citrulline, ornithine, arginine and other amino acids. Acylcarnitine analysis by tandem mass spectrometry also did not identify any abnormalities. Examination of the ocular fundus, abdominal ultrasonography and cardiac ultrasound did not identify any abnormalities. Although we also screened for methamphetamine, benzodiazepine, cocaine, phencyclidine, opioids, cannabis, barbiturates and tricyclic antidepressants by simple urine examination, all of these tests were negative. These results excluded hyperthyroidism and metabolic disorders. Chromosome G banding analysis showed a normal 46, XY karyotype.</p>

        <p>Although phenobarbital and levetiracetam treatments were initiated for seizure control, there were no remarkable improvements. Epileptic spasms forming a series without hypsarrhythmia emerged at the age of 3âmonths as the frequency of GTCC decreased. Frequent myoclonus in the boy's eyelids and limbs continued and the SB pattern on EEG remained at the age of 1âyear and 11âmonths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F1">figure 1</xref>B). Together with the fact that the seizures were not triggered by fever, a diagnosis of EME was made.

        <title>Mutation analysis</title>
        <p>Gene panel sequencing was performed for the baby boy suffering from EME (coverage: 93.57%). This identified a heterozygous missense variant in exon 9 of <italic>GABRB2</italic> (RefSeq accession number NM_021911: c.859A&gt;C [p.Thr287Pro]), which fulfilled the condition of âmoderateâ with regard to pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This variant was absent in controls in population databases including the Exome sequencing project, 1000 Genomes project, ExAC and SNP142. Predictive algorithms of SIFT, Polyphen-2 and MutationTaster estimated the variant as deleterious and CADD and phyloP returned very high scores (24.3 and 7.911, respectively). PCR-Sanger sequencing also confirmed the c.859A&gt;C variant in the patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F2">figure 2</xref>B). We investigated co-segregation of the variant with phenotypes among family members, namely his asymptomatic parents and an elder sister. None of them harboured the variant and hence this heterozygous missense variant was considered <italic>de novo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F2">figure 2</xref>A, B). Since it was classified as a very strong pathogenic variant, we labelled this as a mutant genotype. The Thr287 residue is highly conserved among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F2">figure 2</xref>C and online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary figure S1</xref>). We sought pathogenic variants in <italic>GABRB2</italic> of three additional patients with EME, including the GM13078 line purchased from Coriell Institute (Camden, New Jersey, USA); all cases were negative. Similar mutations in the same gene may exhibit different types of EEs.

To elucidate whether mutations in <italic>GABRB2</italic> were shared between EME and IS, we also looked for changes at this locus in 166 individuals with IS. However, no mutations were found.

        <p>On the other hand, the ExAC browser indicates 297 missense variants at 95 distinct sites in the <italic>GABRB2</italic> locus (accessed 28 March 2016). These findings suggested two possibilities: (1) <italic>GABRB2</italic> mutations may not directly cause IS but may cause other phenotypes and (2) such mutations are extremely rare and may result in more severe, lethal or rare phenotypes. To understand the extent to which the missense mutation p.Thr287Pro is deleterious, we examined the distribution of 297 missense benign variants from the ExAC browser. These fell within the coding sequence (1539âbp) of <italic>GABRB2</italic>, which encodes 10 regions of signal peptides, four transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM4), the N/C-termini and three loops (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">figure S3</xref>). Benign missense variants were not distributed evenly throughout the nucleotide sequence (Fisher's exact test, p value=0.0004998) (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table S2</xref>). We then tested the distribution of benign variants in the amino acid sequence of each region. Two loop regions, between TM1âTM2 and TM3âTM4, appeared to accumulate benign variants more frequently (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary figure S3</xref>). The mutation rate was statistically significant at the loop between TM1 and TM2 (Fisher's exact test, p value=0.0468 and two-sample proportion test, p value=0, respectively). We then compared the fraction of benign variants in each of the above four regions with the fraction of 296 benign variants along the remaining 433 amino acids length. This revealed a statistically significant reduced accumulation of benign variants (Fisher's exact test, p value=0, respectively) in four regions (TM1, TM2 (where p.Thr287Pro is located), TM3 and the loop TM2âTM3). This result suggests that amino acid substitutions in TM2 are not tolerated and cause severe phenotypes such as EME.</p>

        <title>Reduced total and surface protein expression of the Thr287Pro-mutant Î²2 subunit</title>
        <p>The Î²2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor consists of four transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM4) connected by loops and extracellular N and C termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F3">figure 3</xref>A). TM2, where the mutation resides, forms Clâ ion pore of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F3">figure 3</xref>B, C). The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the central nervous system are pentamers consisting of two each of the Î±1 and Î²2 subunits and one Î³2 subunit, which are encoded by <italic>GABRA1</italic>, <italic>GABRB2</italic> and <italic>GABRG2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F3">figure 3</xref>B). We asked whether the p.Thr287Pro mutation might impair Clâ ion channel function of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which might in turn hamper GABAergic neuronal inhibition. Furthermore, since we have demonstrated that trafficking deficiency is a major defect caused by <italic>GABRG2</italic> mutations,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> we also examined trafficking of the mutant Î²2 (Thr287Pro) subunits. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Î±1 and Î³2 subunits and either wild-type Î²2 only, mixed wild-type Î²2 and the mutant Î²2 (Thr287Pro) subunits or the mutant Î²2 (Thr287Pro) subunits only (mut). Total and surface protein expression of the wild-type and mutant Î²2 subunits were then compared. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot to determine total Î²2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F4">figure 4</xref>A). Compared with the total Î²2 subunits in the âwild type receptor onlyâ condition, both the mixed and the mutant Î²2 subunits (0.61Â±0.02 for mixed, 0.35Â±0.04 for mutant Î²2 (Thr287Pro) subunits vs 1 for wild type, n=4) were reduced when co-expressed with Î±1 and Î³2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F4">figure 4</xref>B). Reduced total Î²2 subunit expression could result in the reduced expression of surface Î²2 subunit. We next determined surface protein expression of the mutant Î²2 (Thr287Pro) subunit. We used the high-throughput flow cytometry to quantify the amount of surface wild-type or mutant Î²2 subunit when co-expressed with the Î±1 and Î³2 subunits; this is because pre-assembled pentameric receptors are trafficked to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F4">figure 4</xref>C). Similar to the total protein expression levels, surface Î²2 subunits for both the mixed and mutant receptors were reduced (0.54Â±0.045 for mixed, 0.34Â±0.042 for mutant Î²2 (Thr287Pro) subunits vs 1 for wild type, n=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F4">figure 4</xref>D).</p>

Because the Î²2 subunit is required for Î±1Î²2 or Î±1Î²2Î³2 subunit assembly, mutant Î²2 subunits may prevent trafficking of these partners to the cell surface. We thus performed co-staining experiments to determine whether mutant Î²2(T287P) subunits affected the localisation of the partnering wild-type subunits like Î±1 and Î³2 subunits.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have shown for the first time that <italic>GABRB2</italic> is associated with EME, which is one of the most severe EE forms encountered in the clinic. We believe that this is also the first report that a pathogenic mutation in a neuronal ion channel can cause EME.</p>
      <p>We excluded the possibility of metabolic disorders and made a diagnosis of non-syndromic EME, although this case showed some overlap with OS both in EEG findings and in the seizure type, that is, generalised tonic-clonic seizure. However, in this case, video EEG revealed myoclonus during the burst stage of the SB pattern, hyposthenia in the suppression stage during sleep and movement of limbs in the suppression stage during awakeness. At the age of 1âyear and 11âmonths, the predominant seizure type was myoclonus and the SB pattern was still present on EEG. Video EEG findings and continuous myoclonus, regardless of age, were distinctly different from OS.</p>
      <p>In addition to <italic>GABRB2</italic>, three other genes (<italic>ERBB4, SLC25A22</italic> and <italic>SIK1</italic>) are associated with non-metabolic EME. A genetic abnormality of <italic>ERBB4</italic> was found in a patient with EME because of a <italic>de novo</italic> reciprocal translocation t(2;6)(q34;p25.3).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This was not a single nucleotide variation (SNV) or indel and the patient had some dysmorphic features. A homozygous mutation of <italic>SLC25A22</italic> was found in two siblings born to their consanguineous parents.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Currently, <italic>SIK1</italic> is the only gene of which heterozygous SNVs (including missense and nonsense mutations) have been identified as the cause of sporadic EME cases;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> several similar <italic>SIK1</italic> mutations have also been found in IS and OS. All three genes have been implicated in cell metabolism and growth. To ask whether there were any relationships between <italic>GABRB2</italic> and these three genes, we examined protein-protein interactions using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (accessed 11 March 2016) (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary figure S2</xref>). However, we did not find any direct relationships between GABRB2 and ERBB4, SLC25A22 or SIK1, suggesting that there is significant heterogeneity for the aetiology of EME.</p>
      <p>Another <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous missense mutation (c.236T&gt;C; p.Met79Thr) of <italic>GABRB2</italic> was found in a sporadic case with mild intellectual disability and epilepsy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The patient was a 12-year-old girl who had her first seizure evoked by fever at the age of 9âmonths; this was followed by non-febrile GTCC in subsequent years. Her seizures responded to clobazam. Although her development slowed over the years, she was still able to attend regular school. Thus, the clinical symptoms of this patient harbouring the p.Met79Thr mutation were much milder and quite different from those of individuals with EME. The actual functional consequence of the p.Met79Thr mutation has not been evaluated. It is located in the N terminus of the Î²2 subunit, which is one of the regions prone to accumulation of benign variants (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary figure S3</xref>). However, the p.Thr287Pro mutation identified in the present case seems more deleterious than the p.Met79Thr variant, as it resides in TM2, which forms part of the Clâ pore. This likely explains the milder clinical phenotype associated with Met79Thr variants.</p>
      <p>As follow-up study, we screened three patients with EME. This is too small a population to analyse the relationships between mutations and phenotypes. However, no <italic>GABRB2</italic> mutations were found in any of the 315 cases with IS (this number includes cases in the Epi4K study)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, suggesting that the <italic>GABRB2</italic> mutations may be more likely to be involved in the aetiology of EME than IS. According to the distribution of <italic>GABRB2</italic> benign variants we have analysed, the chances that TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM2âTM3 loop have benign variants are significantly lower than other regions (Fisher's exact test, p value=0, respectively). These regions are considered âcoldâ spots for benign variants. In addition, since <italic>GABRB2</italic> is a small gene of 1539 nucleotides that encodes only 522 amino acids, the rate at which <italic>de novo</italic> variants emerge is low given that they arise randomly. Considering the low incidence of benign variants in such âcoldâ regions, it is likely that most mutations in these regions would have a negative impact and thus cause rare, severe or even lethal phenotypes. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that non-syndromic EME is one of rarest and most severe forms of EE.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the severe phenotype of the present case, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors bearing the mutated Î²2 subunit had several aberrant properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. For example, cell surface expression of p.Thr287Pro Î²2 subunits was significantly reduced compared with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with the wild-type subunit; this was most evident in the homozygous mutant state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F4">figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F5">5</xref>A). We also showed that Î³2 subunits and mutant Î²2(Thr287Pro) subunits were co-localised in cells, suggesting that they oligomerised as protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F5">figure 5</xref>B). These findings can explain why Î±1Î²2Î³2 receptors containing mutant Î²2(Thr287Pro) subunits are retained inside cells. Because of the Î²2 subunit's essential role in Î±1Î²2 or Î±1Î²2Î³2 receptor assembly, it is likely that cell surface expression of all the wild-type partnering subunits, including Î±1 and Î³2, is also reduced. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing the mutant Î²2 subunits exhibited a much smaller peak current amplitude than those containing wild-type Î²2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104083F6">figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, however, the reduction of peak current amplitude was not proportional to the reduction in cell surface expression. Indeed, reduction in peak current amplitude was much greater than would have been expected based on the levels of mutant present at the cell surface. This discrepancy suggests that, in addition to compromising subunit protein trafficking, the p.Thr287Pro mutation also functionally impairs the mutant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that do reach the surface. This impaired channel function may be due to a dominant negative effect of p.Thr287Pro mutation in TM2, a domain that contributes to the pore of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors along with corresponding domains of other subunits. Such deficiencies in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor functions likely undermine the activity of inhibitory neuronal networks and are consistent with the severe phenotype of EME.</p>
      <p>Mutations in different of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, such as Î±1, Î²1, Î²3, Î³2 and Î´, have been identified in various epilepsy phenotypes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

Functional studies have examined why mutations in these genes cause various phenotypes. Recently, Janve <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> published <italic>in vitro</italic> functional studies of LGS-associated <italic>GABRB3</italic> (p.D120N, p.E180G, p.Y302C), IS-associated <italic>GABRB3</italic> (p.N110D) and <italic>GABRB1</italic> (p.F246S) mutations. The mutations were identified in the Epi4K consortium study. The LGS-associated <italic>GABRB3</italic> (p.D120N, p.E180G and p.Y302C) mutations reduced whole-cell currents by decreasing the probability of single channel opening; cell surface receptor expression was normal in these cases. In contrast, the IS-associated <italic>GABRB3</italic> (p.N110D) and <italic>GABRB1</italic> (p.F246S) mutations caused subtle changes in whole-cell current peak amplitude, but altered current deactivation by decreasing or increasing single channel burst duration, respectively. These molecular and cellular perturbations brought about by these mutations are different from those engendered by the p.Thr287Pro mutant we describe here. These findings suggest that although the diverse phenotypes of patients with epilepsy-associated diseases may depend on the specific GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit mutation, the heterogeneous clinical consequences of each mutant cannot necessarily be anticipated by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.</p>
      <p>Although our discovery of a <italic>de novo</italic> missense mutation of <italic>GABRB2</italic> in a child with non-syndromic EME confirms the heterogeneity of EME aetiology, it remains unclear why different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit mutations cause a variety of phenotypes, even though they all trigger the same receptor dysfunction (eg, reduction of Clâ current in GABAergic synapses). Perhaps the effect of the mutation is dictated by the precise combination of subunits in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor; this may effectively alter the configuration of GABA receptors in the brain and thus affect the neuronal network. To address these questions, animal models should be used to test the phenotypic effect of novel mutations that are discovered in subunits of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.</p>
