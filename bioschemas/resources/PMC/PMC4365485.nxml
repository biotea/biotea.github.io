        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>The interaction between TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled coil protein 3) and the microtubule polymerase ch-TOG (colonic, hepatic tumor overexpressed gene) is evolutionarily conserved. Loading of TACC3âch-TOG onto mitotic spindle microtubules requires the phosphorylation of TACC3 by Aurora-A kinase and the subsequent interaction of TACC3 with clathrin to form a microtubule-binding surface. Recent work indicates that TACC3 can track the plus-ends of microtubules and modulate microtubule dynamics in non-dividing cells via its interaction with ch-TOG. Whether there is a pool of TACC3âch-TOG that is independent of clathrin in human cells, and what is the function of this pool, are open questions. Here, we describe the molecular interaction between TACC3 and ch-TOG that permits TACC3 recruitment to the plus-ends of microtubules. This TACC3âch-TOG pool is independent of EB1, EB3, Aurora-A phosphorylation and binding to clathrin. We also describe the distinct combinatorial subcellular pools of TACC3, ch-TOG and clathrin. TACC3 is often described as a centrosomal protein, but we show that there is no significant population of TACC3 at centrosomes. The delineation of distinct protein pools reveals a simplified view of how these proteins are organized and controlled by post-translational modification.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic polymers of Î±/Î²-tubulin that are involved in numerous cellular processes, including intracellular transport, chromosome segregation and control of cell shape and migration. Each MT is polarized, having a fast-growing plus-end and a minus-end that grows more slowly. The plus-ends swap between episodes of growth and shrinkage, powered by GTP hydrolysis (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). MT plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) bind the plus-ends of MTs, typically during episodes of growth (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Among the best-known +TIPs are the end-binding (EB) proteins (EB1-3) and proteins with TOG or TOG-like domains, e.g. ch-TOG/XMAP215 (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">van der Vaart et al., 2011</xref>). EB proteins can recruit a plethora of proteins, mainly via [ST]X[IL]P motifs, to induce their plus-end tracking behavior (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>). An exception is ch-TOG/XMAP215 which contains no [ST]X[IL]P motifs (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>) and tracks MT plus-ends <italic>ahead</italic> of EB proteins (<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Zanic et al., 2013</xref>). EB proteins and ch-TOG have different modes of MT binding. EB proteins bind growing ends of MTs, but do not select between plus- and minus-ends, whereas ch-TOG/XMAP215 only binds the plus-ends but does not distinguish between growing and shrinking ends (<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Zanic et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3) is a cancer-associated protein that binds ch-TOG (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2013</xref>). The interaction is evolutionarily conserved and occurs via a break in the coiled-coil (TACC) domain of TACC3 and a region C-terminal to the TOG6 domain on ch-TOG (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Mortuza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2014</xref>). The focus on these two proteins has centered on their roles in mitosis. TACC3âch-TOG complexes were originally proposed to antagonize the function of the MT depolymerase KIF2C/MCAK at spindle poles (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>) and stimulate MT assembly independently of MCAK (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Barr and Gergely, 2008</xref>). TACC3 is a substrate of Aurora-A kinase, which phosphorylates TACC3 on serine 558 (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">LeRoy et al., 2007</xref>). This phosphorylation permits TACC3 to bind clathrin heavy chain, whereupon the TACC3âclathrin can bind MTs in concert (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). The ternary complex of TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin is involved in stabilizing kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle by inter-MT bridging (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). This information, and the observation that removal of clathrin by knocksideways removes all TACC3 from the spindle cast doubt on whether a pool of TACC3âch-TOG binary complex is present in mitotic cells (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Nwagbara et al. described a +TIP function for xTACC3âXMAP215 in non-dividing <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells and reported an effect of xTACC3 on MT dynamics in neuronal growth cones (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Nwagbara et al., 2014</xref>). This echoed work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where the TACC3âch-TOG homologs D-TACC and mini spindles (Msps) were originally proposed to track the plus ends of MTs (<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). These studies raise several questions. For example, is TACC3 a +TIP in human cells? Does +TIP activity occur during mitosis and/or interphase? Is it dependent on interaction with clathrin and/or ch-TOG? What is the cell biological function of the TACC3 +TIP activity?</p><p>We set out to investigate these issues and define the subcellular locations of each protein, beginning by examining the dynamics of TACC3 on MTs. We discovered that a fraction of TACC3 behaves as a +TIP in human cells, with ch-TOG mediating the association of TACC3 with the MT plus-end. This subcomplex is distinct from the Aurora-A-phosphorylated form of TACC3 that associates with clathrin in the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin complex on K-fibers during mitosis. Using this information, we describe the pools of TACC3, ch-TOG and clathrin, alone and in combination at different stages of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells (HPA/ECACC #93021013) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100âU/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

HeLa and RPE1 cells were transfected using GeneJuice (Novagen) and FuGENE 6 (Promega) respectively and Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) was used for transfection of siRNA. Transfections were carried out according to manufacturer's instructions in all cases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Most plasmids were available from previous work (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">Royle et al., 2005</xref>). To deplete endogenous ch-TOG and re-express ch-TOG-GFP, an existing plasmid (pBrain-GFP-ch-TOGKDP-shch-TOG) was modified to move the GFP from the N-terminus of ch-TOG to the C-terminus. This plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to introduce LL1939,1942AA mutations. The target sequence for TACC3 siRNA was 5â²-CAGTTTGGAACTTCCTCGT-3â² (SASI_Hs01_00156991 MISSION pre-designed siRNA). Constructs for recombinant expression of TACC3(629-838) and ch-TOG truncates were produced as previously described (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2013</xref>). Point mutations were introduced in pETM6T1 ch-TOG(1517-1957) by the Quikchange procedure (Stratagene).

Imaging was performed using a 100Ã â¼1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens. Cells were typically imaged every second for 1âminute. Cells were excited at 488ânm and 561ânm and images captured simultaneously with two cameras (Hamamatsu C10600-10B ORCA-R2). On each day of imaging, camera alignment was performed using 0.5âÂµm diameter fluorescent beads.</p><p>To analyse the intensity of EB3-tdTomato and GFP-TACC3 a 3 pixel-wide line was drawn over the MT end and the intensities for both channels exported. The intensity of each profile was normalised so that the minimum value was zero and the maximum value was 1 (ÎF/F<sub>max</sub>). The position of maximum intensity in the EB3 channel was used to offset the EB3 and TACC3 traces, such that this position was 0.</p><p>For knocksideways experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with pBrain-GFP-FKBP-TACC3KDP-shTACC3 (depletes endogenous TACC3 and re-expresses tagged TACC3 Addgene 59354) and pMito-PAGFP-FRB (âinvisibleâ MitoTrap Addgene 60005).

In mitotic cells, the +TIP behavior of TACC3 was most clear on the astral MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1A</xref>). At metaphase, these signals were often difficult to discern against the fluorescence on the K-fibers of the spindle. Plus-end tracking of TACC3 was much clearer at anaphase on astral and interpolar MTs in either HeLa or RPE1 cells (see below).</p><fig id="f01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><title>TACC3 is a +TIP that tracks plus-ends of microtubules ahead of EB3.</title><p>(A) Single frames from live-cell imaging experiments of RPE1 cells expressing GFP-TACC3 (green) in interphase and mitosis.

Moreover, since +TIP activity for TACC3 was observed in interphase, a time when 1) Aurora-A activity is low and 2) clathrin is not known to interact with TACC3, the +TIP activity of TACC3 is independent of clathrin-binding and phosphorylation by Aurora-A.</p><p>Can ch-TOG track MT plus-ends independently of TACC3? To address this question, we sought a ch-TOG mutant that cannot bind to the TACC domain of TACC3 and tested whether this mutant can track MT plus-ends. To do this, we first narrowed down the TACC3-binding region within ch-TOG by testing for co-precipitation of recombinant ch-TOG fragments with a His-NusA tagged TACC3 fragment (629-838) using His-NusA as a control. Binding of ch-TOG(1517-1957) but not of ch-TOG(1517-1932) was observed, suggesting that the region of ch-TOG that mediates binding is residues 1932-1957 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.â4A</xref>). Alignment of these regions from ch-TOG orthologs highlighted a conserved patch including a pair of leucines which we targeted for mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.â4B</xref>). Mutation of either L1939 or L1942 to either alanine or arginine blocked the ability of ch-TOG(1517-1957) to co-precipitate TACC3(629-838) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.â4C</xref>). Circular dichroism spectra of the L1939A and L1942A mutant proteins were similar to that of wild type ch-TOG(1517-1957) suggesting that these mutations had no significant effect on folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.â4D</xref>).</p><fig id="f04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><title>A ch-TOG mutant deficient in TACC binding localizes to centrosomes and kinetochores and tracks the plus-ends of MTs.</title><p>(A) Co-precipitation assay between His-NusA-TACC3(629-838) and fragments of the C-terminal region of ch-TOG.

Analysis of this novel population of TACC3 was not possible during mitosis, because depleting or mutating TACC3 interferes with its role in stabilizing K-fibers as part of the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin complex. During interphase however, this complex is not formed and no mitotic spindle is present; we therefore reasoned that this stage of the cell cycle was the best time to investigate the cellular function of TACC3 +TIP activity. Previous work suggested that TACC3 may influence cell migration (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al., 2013</xref>). If this is correct, then any changes in cell migration might be due to altered MT dynamics. We began by testing a role for TACC3 in interphase cell migration.</p><p>RPE1 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting GL2 (control) or TACC3 were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes and imaged over 6 hour and their 2D migration observed (see Materials and Methods).

Aligning the individual migration tracks so that their end position was along the same axis, gave the impression that growth was more directed after TACC3 depletion, and that the cells made fewer turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5C</xref>). However, this apparent effect could be explained by the lower migration speed in TACC3-depleted cells because the directionality ratio between distance migrated and displacement (d/D) was not significantly different from the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5D</xref>). Mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis also showed that the directional persistence was similar between TACC3-depleted cells and control cells and that differences in migration were due to a lower migration speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5E</xref>). Over three experiments, the migration speed for TACC3-depleted cells was â¼30% lower than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5F</xref>).

This MT lattice-binding mode is occupies the rest of the MT, away from the EB zone and the distal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig.â8C</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that TACC3 binds ch-TOG via an interaction between a break in the coiled-coil of the TACC domain and two leucine residues in the 4Î± domain of ch-TOG. Structural information from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is now available for xTACC3 (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Mortuza et al., 2014</xref>), which proposes that the TACC domain is a bundle of four alpha helices. The ch-TOG-binding region on TACC3 that we identified sits in Î±2 in the xTACC3 structural model, and mutations in this region abrogate binding to XMAP215 (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Mortuza et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, they identified a different region at the extreme C-terminus of XMAP215 that interacts with xTACC3 (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Mortuza et al., 2014</xref>). Note that their <italic>in vitro</italic> work used a 60-residue peptide, whereas we used full-length proteins in cells and longer, folded domains for our biochemical work. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to determine if multiple contacts between these two molecules are made.</p><p>The expression of TACC3 is altered in different human cancer types (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Lauffart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work explored the possibility that overexpression of TACC3 increases cell invasiveness and promotes a more aggressive cancer phenotype (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al., 2013</xref>). The authors proposed that TACC3 promotes EMT via alteration of signaling pathways. We wondered if altered microtubule dynamics may explain the changes in cell migration. Our experiments confirmed that depletion of TACC3 reduces migration speed. However, we found that altering TACC3 expression during interphase did not detectably change MT dynamics. This was disappointing, because other +TIP proteins have been shown to be involved in cell migration, e.g. GTSE1 (<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">Scolz et al., 2012</xref>) a protein reported to bind TACC3 (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that the decrease in cell migration speed in TACC3-depleted cells is via a change in cell adhesion, since ENAH and VASP have previously been identified as TACC3 binding partners (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>What is the function of TACC3 as a +TIP? We could see no clear effect of TACC3 on MT dynamics, but it is possible that we have overlooked a role for TACC3 in modulating MT dynamics via TACC3âch-TOG. For example, it was not possible for us to assess the function of TACC3 as a +TIP during mitosis, since TACC3 participates in a different function with ch-TOG and clathrin during this time. If the +TIP activity in mitosis is important for modulating MT growth it may be involved in acentrosomal MT assembly during prometaphase (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). The other recently described role for TACC3 in anaphase MT sliding (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Lioutas and Vernos, 2013</xref>) is dependent on Aurora-A kinase activity and so likely involves the TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin pool rather than the TACC3âch-TOG +TIP activity. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> neuronal growth cones, only minor changes (â¼11%) in MT dynamics were caused by xTACC3 depletion or overexpression (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Nwagbara et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that TACC3 may not significantly influence ch-TOG activity at plus-ends. However, a bigger effect was observed in neural crest cells, but only for TACC3 depletion (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Nwagbara et al., 2014</xref>). Other groups have shown that TACC3 influences MT regrowth after depolymerization (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), although this may be unrelated to the +TIP function of TACC3. The observation of TACC3 piggybacking on ch-TOG at MT plus-ends is tantalizing, but firm evidence of a functional correlate of TACC3 +TIP behavior is lacking.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig.â8</xref> shows the subcellular pools of TACC3, ch-TOG and clathrin that can be detected alone and in combination in human cells. We do not place TACC3 at the centrosome in this scheme. TACC3 is often described as a centrosomal protein (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2013</xref>). The evidence that TACC3 is present at centrosomes comes from two studies. First, TACC3 was observed at spindle poles in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2000a</xref>). However, this treatment leaves MT remnants that TACC3âch-TOGâclathrin may bind to, rather than directly at the centrosome. Second, an antibody raised against TACC3 phosphorylated at S558 recognized centrosomes (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>). However, later work showed that this antibody simply detects centrosomes and not TACC3 (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). The signal for TACC3 pS558 detected with a new antibody was found over the K-fibers and not at the centrosomes (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Although we note that a recent paper indicates that TACC3 may interact Î³-tubulin complex components (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). One further reason that TACC3 is known as a centrosomal protein is historical. Initial work on TACC3 focused on potential similarities with the TACC homologs of lower species, where the relevant cell biology had originally been investigated, and in which TACC homologs are clearly found at the centrosomes or spindle pole body (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">Peset et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2004</xref>). More recently however, multiple studies including the present work have failed to show obvious localization of TACC3 at the centrosome in mitotic higher eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Hood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Since growing plus-ends of MTs continually emerge from the centrosome/spindle pole, this might explain apparent localization of TACC3 at the centrosome that may have been previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1</xref>). Note that EB3 also has a âcentrosomalâ appearance, presumably for the same reason (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, it is clear that ch-TOG has a centrosomal distribution in interphase and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Fig.â7</xref>) (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Charrasse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Foraker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>). This localization persists following knockdown of TACC3 or in the absence of an interaction with TACC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.â3</xref>) (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). The situation is slightly different in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the centrosomal localization of Msps is perturbed in <italic>d-tacc</italic> mutants, although it is not abolished (<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that D-TACC is not required for centrosomal targeting of Msps but targets the protein to MT minus ends. In support of this, in fly oocyte spindles D-TACC localizes Msps to acentriolar poles via kinesin-14 transport (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Cullen and Ohkura, 2001</xref>). Finally, phosphorylation of D-TACC by Aurora-A is required to target it to MT minus ends (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Barros et al., 2005</xref>), which led to the idea that D-TACC influences the ability of ch-TOG/Msps to stabilize MT minus ends.</p><p>The kinetochore localization of ch-TOG that we describe is new, however an earlier paper described this pool as at âthe tip of polar microtubulesâ (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Conte et al., 2003</xref>). Alp14, an <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of ch-TOG, localizes at kinetochores (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2004</xref>) as does Msps, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Buster et al., 2007</xref>). The pool of ch-TOG at kinetochores is not readily detected by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Charrasse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that it is inaccessible to antibodies directed against the C-terminus of ch-TOG. It is unclear why TACC3 is unable to bind the ch-TOG that is localized at centrosomes and kinetochores in human cells. It could be that TACC3 is prevented from doing so because ch-TOG is in a different conformation or that it is bound to another protein. These are interesting questions for future study.</p><p>The scheme of TACC3, ch-TOG and clathrin pools that we describe here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">Fig.â8</xref>) represents a current, consolidated view of these fascinating proteins. It highlights how the switch from three pools (in interphase) to four (in mitosis) is achieved by a simple phosphorylation event mediated by Aurora-A kinase. We hope this will be a useful framework for interpreting and understanding future research in this area.</p></sec>
