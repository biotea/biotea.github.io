        <p>Humans with mutations in either <italic>DCX</italic> or <italic>LIS1</italic> display nearly identical neuronal migration defects, known as lissencephaly. To define subcellular mechanisms, we have combined in vitro neuronal migration assays with retroviral transduction. Overexpression of wild-type Dcx or Lis1, but not patient-related mutant versions, increased migration rates. Dcx overexpression rescued the migration defect in <italic>Lis1</italic>
<sup>+/â</sup> neurons. Lis1 localized predominantly to the centrosome, and after disruption of microtubules, redistributed to the perinuclear region. Dcx outlined microtubules extending from the perinuclear âcageâ to the centrosome. <italic>Lis1</italic>
<sup>+/â</sup> neurons displayed increased and more variable separation between the nucleus and the preceding centrosome during migration. Dynein inhibition resulted in similar defects in both nucleusâcentrosome (N-C) coupling and neuronal migration. These N-C coupling defects were rescued by Dcx overexpression, and Dcx was found to complex with dynein. These data indicate Lis1 and Dcx function with dynein to mediate N-C coupling during migration, and suggest defects in this coupling may contribute to migration defects in lissencephaly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the most distinctive features in mammalian brain development is that newly born postmitotic neurons migrate hundreds of cell body distances from their sites of origin to reach their final destination (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hatten, 2002</xref>). Hemizygous mutations in <italic>DCX</italic> or heterozygous mutations in <italic>LIS1</italic> lead to nearly identical neuronal migration defects in humans known as lissencephaly (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dobyns and Truwit, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dobyns et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lo Nigro et al., 1997</xref>), which is characterized by a smooth surface of the brain, four abnormal cortical layers, and a variably hypoplastic cerebellum, associated with intractable epilepsy, hypotonia, and profound mental retardation from infancy.</p>
      <p>
<italic>LIS1</italic>, located on chromosome 17p13.3, encodes the LIS1 protein. LIS1 functions on an evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating microtubule (MT) function and dynein motor activity. In <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, the <italic>LIS1</italic> homologue <italic>nudF</italic> is required for proper nuclear transport into and within hyphal processes (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 1995</xref>), and other <italic>nud</italic> (nuclear distribution defect) genes such as <italic>nudA</italic>, <italic>nudG</italic>, and <italic>nudK</italic> encode for dynein components (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The mammalian orthologues of NUD proteins bind to LIS1 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Niethammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that the fungal nuclear migration pathway may be conserved in mammals to mediate nuclear translocation. The fact that the main defect observed in cultured <italic>Lis1</italic>
<sup>+/â</sup> mouse neurons is in nuclear movement within the limits of the cell membrane, but not in neurite length (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hirotsune et al., 1998</xref>; unpublished data), also supports the recapitulation of LIS1 in mammalian nuclear translocation.</p>
      <p>
<italic>DCX</italic>, located on Xq22.3-q23, encodes for an MT-associated protein, doublecortin (DCX). DCX directly polymerizes purified tubulin into MTs, and misexpression in heterologous cells leads to the formation of depolymerization-resistant MTs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Francis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Gleeson et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Horesh et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, DCX has evolutionarily conserved orthologues, where in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> mutations in <italic>zyg-8</italic> result in defects in MT stability and karyokinesis during asymmetric division at the one-cell stage (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">GÃ¶nczy et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that DCX also functions in migration on an evolutionarily conserved pathway. Although <italic>Dcx</italic> knockout mice do not display a major disruption in migration, acute inactivation in rodents produces significant migration defects (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Corbo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recent data suggest that Lis1 and Dcx display overlapping localization and may interact. In fixed cells of various types, Lis1 localizes to the centrosome (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), the perinuclear region (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Coquelle et al., 2002</xref>), kinetochores (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>), the plus end of MTs (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Coquelle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Xiang, 2003</xref>), and the leading cell cortex (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Swan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Dujardin et al., 2003</xref>). Evidence suggests Dcx localizes to MT structures in both the leading process (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Friocourt et al., 2003</xref>) and the perinuclear region (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Gleeson et al., 1999a</xref>). Dcx and Lis1 coimmunoprecipitate from brain lysate, and purified Dcx and Lis1 bind cooperatively to MTs (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Caspi et al., 2000</xref>). These data suggest that they may share functionality during migration. However, their roles have not thus far been tested in mammalian migrating neurons, the cells directly affected in lissencephaly. Here, we use mouse cerebellar granule neurons and demonstrate that Lis1 and Dcx function with dynein to mediate nucleusâcentrosome (N-C) coupling in neuronal migration. We propose that proper N-C coupling may be critical in neuronal migration.</p>

        <title>A genetically modifiable neuronal migration system</title>
        <p>To define the mechanistic roles of Dcx and Lis1 in mammalian neuronal migration, we used mouse cerebellar granule neurons in an in vitro migration assay combined with retroviral-mediated transgene expression (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hatten, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bix and Clark, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hirotsune et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gambello et al., 2003</xref>). The rationale to use this system is: (1) there is a clear cerebellar migration defect in humans with <italic>LIS1</italic> or <italic>DCX</italic> mutations (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Berg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Dobyns et al., 1999</xref>), being the most commonly mutated genes in individuals with lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Ross et al., 2001</xref>); (2) migration is robust, quantifiable, and reproducible; (3) as glia are removed during the purification steps, granule neurons migrate along the neurites of other neurons in a nonglial guided fashion (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lois et al., 1996</xref>), thus ensuring the analysis of a single mode of migration (i.e., elimination of glial-based migration); and (4) this assay was used previously to demonstrate a cell-autonomous migration defect in Lis1-deficient neurons (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hirotsune et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gambello et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>Cerebellar granule neurons were dissociated from postnatal d 5 mice and cultured with retrovirus, resulting in spherical cellular reaggregates that were transferred to poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysineâ and laminin-coated slides (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Liang and Crutcher, 1992</xref>). A fraction of neurons migrated radially from each. After 12 h of migration, the distance between transduced cell bodies and the edge of the reaggregate was measured, allowing for an integrated estimate of the migration rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Overexpression of Dcx or Lis1 leads to an increase in neuronal migration</title>
        <p>Neuronal migration is suggested to be sensitive to LIS1 dosage, as heterozygous mutation leads to lissencephaly in humans, and graded reduction of <italic>Lis1</italic> results in graded migration defects in mice (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hirotsune et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gambello et al., 2003</xref>). Patients with hypomorphic <italic>DCX</italic> missense mutations display a less severe phenotype than those with truncation mutations (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gleeson et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). These dose-dependent negative effects of <italic>LIS1</italic> or <italic>DCX</italic> on migration when mutated or deleted suggested that overexpression may have positive regulatory effects on migration. Therefore, we determined if neuronal migration is enhanced by overexpression of either protein.</p>
        <p>To quantitate the amount of retrovirally transduced proteins, lysates were collected from infected cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting for the presence of endogenous and epitope-tagged Dcx or Lis1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Quantitation of band intensity and correction for percentage of transduced cells indicated the epitope-tagged Dcx and Lis1 proteins were produced at â¼85% of the endogenous level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, see table), meaning transduction increased protein levels a little less than twofold.</p>

<bold>Dcx or Lis1 overexpression increases neuronal migration.</bold> (A) Retroviral transduction nearly doubles the amount of Dcx or Lis1. Lysates from neurons transduced with RFP-tagged Dcx or Lis1 show bands corresponding to endogenous protein (E) and transduced tagged protein (T). From the ratio of band intensity (T/E) and percentage of transduced cells, transduced protein was â¼85% of the endogenous level. (BâD) Transduction of either Dcx or Lis1 into WT neurons results in an increase in net neuronal migration. The migration distance of each GFP-positive neuron in 12 h is binned. Neurons transduced with either Dcx;GFP or Lis1;GFP display a shift in the bin distribution toward the right. Migration distances are represented in Î¼m along the x axis, and percentage of total neuron number in each bin is represented along the y axis. <italic>n</italic> = number of neurons measured for each variable. Representative images for each condition are shown. (E) Mean migration distance for neurons overexpressing either Dcx or Lis1 is increased 40â50% compared with GFP alone. **, differs from GFP control; P &lt; 0.01, SNK test. Similar results were obtained on three separate experimental trials. Error bars represent SEM. Bars, 100 Î¼m.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Wild-type (WT) granule neurons were transduced with either retrovirus encoding GFP alone, Dcx in the first cistron and GFP in the second cistron (herein referred to as Dcx;GFP), or Lis1 in the first cistron and GFP in the second cistron (Lis1;GFP). Migration distances in 12 h were binned. Neurons transduced with GFP alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B) were positioned indistinguishably from untransduced neurons, suggesting that retroviral transduction itself had no effect on migration. Dcx- or Lis1-overexpressing neurons displayed a rightward shift in bin distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, BâD). Mean migration distance for each increased by â¼50% compared with GFP control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E). These data suggest that neuronal migration can be positively regulated by Dcx or Lis1 expression.</p>

        <title>Patient mutations abrogate the effect of overexpression on migration</title>
        <p>Intragenic <italic>LIS1</italic> or <italic>DCX</italic> mutations in patients with lissencephaly include missense amino acid changes and truncations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cardoso et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Gleeson et al., 2000</xref>). The mutant proteins are either incorrectly folded (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sapir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Caspi et al., 2003</xref>) and fail to associate with binding partners (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2000</xref>) or fail to bind MTs (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>), but no data exist on the effect of these mutations on migration. To assess the function of the mutant proteins quantitatively, patient-related mutant Dcx (R89G, T203R, 303stop; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Gleeson et al., 1998</xref>) or Lis1 (H149R, S169R, D317H; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lo Nigro et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pilz et al., 1999</xref>) was overexpressed. Neurons transduced with single amino acid substitution mutations in either Dcx or Lis1 displayed a mean migration slightly above GFP control, but were not statistically different (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). There were slight differences in the bin distribution for each mutation, but the overall migration distances were not significantly different from one another. Truncated Dcx showed no increase in migration over the control level. Thus, patient mutations abrogate the effect of overexpression of Dcx and Lis1 on migration and appear to function as null or hypomorphic alleles.</p>

        <title>Lis1 is localized at the centrosome in migrating neurons</title>
        <p>In fixed cells of various types, Lis1 has been reported to overlap in localization with several structures. To test the localization in live migrating neurons, RFP-tagged Lis1 (Lis1-RFP) was transduced in granule neurons. Localization of Lis1-RFP was nearly identical with native Lis1 visualized by immunostaining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A), suggesting that it reports the localization of the native protein.</p>

        <p>Using time-lapse deconvolution microscopy, neurons transduced with Lis1-RFP displayed a concentrated RFP signal just ahead of the nucleus in the direction of migration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). There were occasionally less intense, additional foci or spread of Lis1, but a major focus remained throughout each recording. This focus suggested the likely position of the centrosome, based on its reported location in neurons (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rakic, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gregory et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rivas and Hatten, 1995</xref>). To test this, a GFP-tagged constitutive centrosomal protein, centrin 2 (CETN2; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2000</xref>), was retrovirally transduced, producing intense GFP signal at the pair of centrioles. Cotransduction of Lis1-RFP and GFP-CETN2 revealed that the focus of Lis1 localized at the GFP-CETN2 signal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C). There were occasional frames with more than one Lis1 focus that were less or similarly intense; in all of these a major focus remained throughout each recording and was consistently colocalized with GFP-CETN2 signal. These data suggest that Lis1 predominantly localizes to centrosomal or pericentrosomal structures during migration.</p>

        <title>Lis1 localizes prominently to the nuclear membrane after MT disruption</title>
        <p>A previous report has found that treatment with the MT-depolymerizing drug nocodazole led to some Lis1 localized to the nuclear membrane in fixed nonneuronal cells (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that some fraction of Lis1 may be localized to the nuclear membrane and that an intact MT cytoskeleton is required for Lis1 localization to the centrosome. We tested this in migrating neurons using nocodazole. In approximately half of the cells analyzed at 5 and 50 Î¼g/ml nocodazole concentration, there was redistribution of Lis1 to the perinuclear region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D). There continued to be some localization of Lis1 to the region of the presumed centrosome, although it was less intense than in untreated cells. The half of the cells not showing perinuclear distribution also displayed less intense centrosomal Lis1 localization. Therefore, a fraction of Lis1 is redistributed to the nuclear membrane after MT disruption.</p>
        <p>Because there is very little perinuclear cytoplasm in neurons, the previous experiment could not easily distinguish between perinuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of Lis1. Therefore, nuclei were isolated from granule neurons in the presence of nocodazole and immunostained for Lis1. Nucleoporin, a constitutive nuclear pore complex protein (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Blobel, 1986</xref>), outlined the nuclear membrane, whereas Lis1 was detected as punctate signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> E). Together, these data suggest that some Lis1 is associated with the nuclear membrane and that intact MT structures may be required in localizing Lis1 to the centrosome.</p>

The localization of Dcx-RFP was nearly identical to endogenous Dcx (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> F). Dual transduction with Dcx-RFP and GFP-CETN2 displayed a bright fibrillar bundle-like signal of Dcx encapsulating the nucleus and converging to the centrosome ahead of the nucleus throughout migration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> G). Cotransduction with Dcx-RFP and GFP-tubulin indicated that the fibrillar signal represented MTs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> H), thus Dcx outlined the perinuclear cage-like MT structures previously described in migrating neurons (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rivas and Hatten, 1995</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Lis1 and Dcx display distinct but adjacent localization during migration.</p>

        <title>Coupling of the nucleus to the centrosome is defective in Lis1-deficient neurons</title>
        <p>Our time-lapse recording of migrating neurons using GFP-CETN2 demonstrated that in essentially every cell that was observed moving, the centrosome precedes the nucleus in the direction of migration. According to the reported MT organization in neurons (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aumais et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hatten, 2002</xref>), MTs would couple (1) the leading process to the centrosome and (2) the centrosome to the nucleus, in order to translocate the nucleus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Our data on subcellular localization in migrating neurons, together with the known role of Lis1 in mediating dynein motor function, suggests that Lis1 and Dcx might be involved in coupling the nucleus to the preceding centrosome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B).</p>

        <title>Dynein inhibition results in defects in N-C coupling and neuronal migration</title>
        <p>Previous works demonstrated the direct and functional interaction between Lis1 and cytoplasmic dynein (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), so we reasoned that inhibiting dynein function may recapitulate the defects due to Lis1 deficiency. To test this, dynamitin overexpression, which disassembles the cytoplasmic dynein component dynactin (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>), was used to disrupt dynein function in migrating neurons.</p>
        <p>WT neurons were transduced with RFP-tagged CETN2 (CETN2-RFP) and GFP-dynamitin, nuclei were labeled with Hoechst stain, and the N-C distance was measured in each dual-transduced neuron (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). Dynamitin overexpression led to a 63% increase in the mean N-C distance with greater variability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> E; mean 1.09 Î¼m, SD 0.77 Î¼m, <italic>n</italic> = 46, control vs. mean 1.78 Î¼m, SD 1.33 Î¼m, <italic>n</italic> = 21, GFP-dynamitin; P &lt; 0.01). Thus, N-C coupling in migrating neurons is defective with disruption of dynein function.</p>
        <p>To test the effect of dynein inhibition on neuronal migration, the migration assay was performed on granule neurons overexpressing GFP-dynamitin. This resulted in a shift in a migration bin distribution similar to <italic>Lis1</italic>
<sup>+/â</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> F), and led to a 30% decrease in mean migration distance (47 Î¼m, <italic>n</italic> = 356, GFP-dynamitin vs. 65 Î¼m, <italic>n</italic> = 704, GFP control; P &lt; 0.01, <italic>t</italic> test). Thus, dynein motor function is required for proper N-C coupling and neuronal migration.

WT neurons were transduced with CETN2-RFP and GFP-dynamitin, and some were additionally transduced with Dcx-RFP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> G). Although both CETN2 and Dcx are labeled with the same fluorophore, localization of these two is distinct, and dual-transduced cells were easily identifiable.

Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using specific antisera. Before immunoprecipitation, whole brain lysates from postnatal d 5 mice were incubated at 4Â°C in order to depolymerize MTs, and were then centrifuged to remove MT-bound proteins. In this way, proteins complexed through MT bridges alone should be largely removed. Dcx immunoprecipitated with both dynein heavy chain (DHC) and dynein intermediate chain (DIC) antibodies in a fashion similar to Lis1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

        <title>Dosage-sensitive roles of Dcx and Lis1 regulating neuronal migration</title>
        <p>We demonstrated that overexpression of Dcx or Lis1 led to enhanced neuronal migration. Together with the loss-of-function phenotypes, these data suggest that both Dcx and Lis1 play dosage-sensitive roles in migration.</p>
        <p>Previous reports showed that LIS1 overexpression in COS-7 or MDCK cells resulted in altered organization and distribution of MTs, cytoplasmic dynein, dynactin, and the Golgi complex (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), increase in mitotic index, a variety of spindle defects, unattached chromosomes, and irregular cell shapes (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>). These analyses were performed in nonneuronal cells in which the physiological LIS1 levels were lower than neuronal cells (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), and used adenoviral or cytomegalovirus promoters in which expression levels are much higher than with the retroviral 5â² long terminal repeats promoter used here. The resultant nonphysiological changes in LIS1 dosage might be responsible for the toxic effect on these cells. In our work, the level of Lis1 or Dcx after retroviral transduction was a little less than twice the WT level. In this range, overexpression of Dcx or Lis1 appears to be capable of increasing neuronal migration without obvious detrimental or toxic effects. It remains to be seen if even higher levels of expression would produce yet further enhancement in migration.</p>

        <title>Patient-related mutations of Dcx or Lis1 abrogate the effects on migration</title>
        <p>Overexpression of patient-related mutant proteins had little to no obvious effects on migration. This is the first demonstration of a system that can be used to test the effect of patient mutations on neuronal migration. Previous reports have demonstrated that Lis1 with introduced patient mutations is either unstable (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sapir et al., 1999</xref>), displays abnormal folding (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Caspi et al., 2003</xref>), or cannot properly bind to ligands such as mNudE (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2000</xref>). Dcx with introduced patient mutations leads to impaired MT polymerizing ability (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sapir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>) or cannot bind to the FIGQY-phosphotyrosine motif in neurofascin (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kizhatil et al., 2002</xref>). Our data clearly indicate these patient-related mutations abrogate their ability to positively regulate migration rate, suggesting the mutant proteins are non- or hypo-functional, and lead to the migration defects that result in the lissencephaly phenotype in humans.</p>

        <title>N-C coupling requires normal levels of Lis1 and is regulated by Dcx and dynein</title>
        <p>We confirmed that in live migrating neurons the centrosome is nearly uniformly positioned ahead of the nucleus, as previously reported in fixed cells (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rakic, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gregory et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rivas and Hatten, 1995</xref>). In migrating neurons, Lis1 localized at the centrosome and after MT disruption redistributed to the perinuclear region, suggesting that Lis1 translocates from the perinuclear region toward the centrosome via MT structures in physiological conditions, or that at least its localization elsewhere requires MTs. Dcx localized to a perinuclear cage-like MT structure intersecting the centrosome. In Lis1-deficient neurons, we identified defective N-C coupling. Based on our evidence, the known effects of Dcx on MT polymerization, the minus end of MTs being located at the centrosome, and association of Lis1 with the dynein motor complex, we speculate that Dcx is required for proper formation of the perinuclear MT structure, and that the Lis1âdynein complex may move in an MT minus end direction, attached to the nuclear membrane, to displace the nucleus toward the centrosome (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). Our preliminary data suggest a possible defect in perinuclear MT structure in Dcx null migrating neurons, but more work is needed.</p>
        <p>There is almost nothing known about N-C coupling during neuronal migration. We demonstrated that in WT migrating neurons, the N-C distance measured 0.8â1.1 Î¼m on average, and that manipulation of Lis1, Dcx, dynein, or MTs significantly changed this distance. We measured the distance projected in a single horizontal plane in which migration occurred. Any differences in the z axis should have been randomly distributed and should not interfere with these analyses. All our analyses were done on deconvolved images that had clear contours, assuring accuracy in measurement. Our findings are consistent: (1) the increase in N-C distance by Lis1 deficiency was rescued by Lis1-forced expression or Dcx overexpression, which also rescued migration defects; (2) N-C distance was increased by disruption of MTs as well as dynein inhibition; and (3) the differences detected between experimental conditions were highly reproducible, and although this distance was dynamic as neurons move, measurements were collected from several hundred neurons and so these internal variations due to the phases of migration should be captured in our dataset. Therefore, we conclude that the N-C distances collectively measured in live neurons reflect the N-C coupling states and pertain to migration.</p>

        <title>Dcx, Lis1, and dynein pathways in nuclear translocation</title>
        <p>Previous data indicated Lis1-deficient cells display a defect of dynein function (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). Our data show that Lis1 deficiency and dynein inhibition display the same effect on N-C coupling and neuronal migration, suggesting that Lis1 deficiency affects N-C coupling by impairment of dynein function. Dcx overexpression rescued the coupling defects caused by Lis1 deficiency and dynein inhibition. Additionally, we showed coimmunoprecipitation between Dcx and dynein subunits, which may be mediated by Lis1. These data suggest that the mechanism by which Dcx overexpression rescues Lis1 deficiency might be through restoration of dynein function. However, other possible mechanisms of rescue exist, including a modulation of the MT cytoskeleton by Dcx, which might compensate for less efficient Lis1-mediated N-C coupling. Further genetic and cell biological evidence for this rescue will be necessary.</p>
        <p>How these proteins function to mediate N-C coupling remains to be determined. There is a growing body of evidence that the dyneinâdynactin complex associates with nuclear membranes in many cell types, and these complexes coupled to the nucleus may move in a minus endâdirected fashion toward the centrosome. Synthetic nuclei assembled from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts move along MTs toward their minus ends, the movement required both dynein and the nuclear membrane, and female pronuclear movement is suggested to use this mechanism (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Reinsch and Karsenti, 1997</xref>). Dynein is required for positioning or nuclear attachment of centrosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">GÃ¶nczy et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 1999</xref>), and localizes to the nuclear envelope of mammalian cells and <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos before nuclear envelope breakdown (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Busson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">GÃ¶nczy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Salina et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, compelling evidence of a dynein-dependent N-C coupling mechanism has emerged from the study of the Hook protein ZYG-12 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Malone et al., 2003</xref>), which localizes to both the nuclear envelope and the centrosome, binds dynein light intermediate chain, and is proposed to move the centrosome toward the nucleus.</p>
        <p>Together, these data suggest an evolutionarily conserved pathway using dynein in centrosomeânuclear interactions. Mammalian neurons may use this mechanism to translocate the nucleus during migration, where we propose the centrosome is fixed in location by MT structures so that the nucleus moves toward the centrosome. Molecular mechanisms of capture and translocation of the nucleus toward the centrosome and the role of dynein should be further investigated.</p>
