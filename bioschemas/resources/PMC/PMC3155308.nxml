      <abstract>
        <p>Myosin-X is an important unconventional myosin that is critical for cargo transportation to filopodia tips and is also utilized in spindle assembly by interacting with microtubules. We present a series of structural and biochemical studies of the myosin-X tail domain cassette, consisting of myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) and FERM domains in complex with its specific cargo, a netrin receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). The MyTH4 domain is folded into a helical VHS-like structure and is associated with the FERM domain. We found an unexpected binding mode of the DCC peptide to the subdomain C groove of the FERM domain, which is distinct from previously reported Î²âÎ² associations found in radixinâadhesion molecule complexes. We also revealed direct interactions between the MyTH4âFERM cassette and tubulin C-terminal acidic tails, and identified a positively charged patch of the MyTH4 domain, which is involved in tubulin binding. We demonstrated that both DCC and integrin bindings interfere with microtubule binding and that DCC binding interferes with integrin binding. Our results provide the molecular basis by which myosin-X facilitates alternative dual binding to cargos and microtubules.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A large number of unconventional myosins appeared early in eukaryotic evolution and these have vital roles in diverse cellular processes including intracellular transport, organization of F-actin, mitotic spindle regulation and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Berg et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Richards and Cavalier-Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Foth et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Woolner and Bement, 2009</xref>). Myosins consist of three distinct regions, a head, neck and tail. The heads contain actin-based motor domains that display homology among different myosins and these structures have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">O'Connell et al, 2007</xref>). In sharp contrast to the motor domains, the tails display diversity by combination of a variety of functional domains that mediate cargo recognition, which determine the individual cellular functions of myosins. However, little is known about the tail domain structures and their specific cargo recognition.</p>
      <p>Myosin-X (Myo-X, myosin-10, Myo10) is an unconventional myosin implicated in elongation of filopodia, which function as tentacles that explore and interact with cell surroundings to determine the direction of cell movement and to establish cell adhesion such as in the case of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sousa and Cheney, 2005</xref>). Myosin-X is localized at filopodia tips containing a âfilopodial-tip complex', which act as fingertips and sensors in processes such as signal perception, cell signalling, actin polymerization inside of filopodia and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Berg et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>). Elucidating the molecular nature of the filopodial-tip complex is key for understanding filopodia functions, but has remained a mystery for over 30 years. The manner by which myosin-X discriminates between cargos for transportation to the tip and how these cargos contribute to filopodial processes at the tip remains unknown. Myosin-X contains myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) and 4.1 and ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domains for cargo recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The tandem comprising the MyTH4 and FERM domains frequently appears in related myosins (myosin-IV, VII, X, XII, XIV and XV), and is referred to as the MyTH4âFERM cassette. Interestingly, this cassette is found in one of three ancestral myosins in the earliest eukaryotes, and myosin-X is conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Richards and Cavalier-Smith, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>One of the most exciting processes involving myosin-X relates to the axon pathfinding of neurons, which is essential for proper wiring in the brain. During neural development, axons are navigated by extracellular guidance cues such as those provided by netrins. Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and neogenin are membrane proteins that function as netrin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Chan et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Keino-Masu et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kolodziej et al, 1996</xref>). Myosin-X recognizes these receptors as cargos and redistributes to the cell periphery or to the tips of neurites, where growth cones dynamically develop filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Zhu et al, 2007</xref>). Moreover, of particular interest is that myosin-X interacts with integrin through its FERM domain and mediates relocalization of integrin to filopodial tips and thereby promotes filopodial extension by serving to form adhesive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Zhang et al, 2004</xref>). A very recent report has shown that DCC is also important as a cargo adaptor that mediates local translation events in neurons by anchoring components of the translational machinery such as ribosome subunits at the plasma membrane of growth cones and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tcherkezian et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to mediating the biological function of selective cargo transportation on actin cables, myosin-X directly interacts with microtubules and has a key role in spindle assembly during meiosis to ensure faithful delivery of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells following cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Weber et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Woolner et al, 2008</xref>). This surprising myosin-X function is mediated by a direct interaction between microtubules and the MyTH4âFERM cassette. However, the manner by which myosin-X recognizes microtubules has remained unclear. Interestingly, myosin-X has a role in integrin-dependent spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Toyoshima and Nishida, 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we report on a series of structural and biochemical/biophysical studies concerning DCC recognition by the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette. We reveal the presence of a VHS-like fold within the MyTH4 domain. Our 1.9 Ã resolution structure clarifies details of an unexpected binding mode of DCC to the myosin-X FERM domain, which is distinct from those found in the FERM domain of radixin that links membrane protein/plasma membrane and actin cytoskeletons. We also show that the cassette binds the C-terminal acidic tails of tubulins and that this binding is obstructed by DCC binding. Moreover, we show that the cassette binds the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin Î²5-subunit and that this binding is obstructed by DCC binding. Like DCC, integrin Î²5 binding also interferes with microtubule binding. Our results reveal the structural mechanism that underlies cargo recognition by the cassette and provide the molecular basis for further structural and functional investigations of biologically and medically important myosin-X, as well as of the related unconventional myosins containing MyTH4âFERM cassette.</p>

        <p>DCC possesses a long (â¼340 residues) cytoplasmic tail that contains three highly conserved regions designated as P1, P2 and P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kolodziej et al, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). C-terminal regions containing the P3 region (residues 1424â1447) were shown to bind myosin-X by a two-hybrid system binding assay, and the MyTH4âFERM cassette was found to be sufficient for DCC and neogenin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Zhu et al, 2007</xref>). We prepared a peptide encompassing the C-terminal 58 residues (1390â1447) of human DCC for our studies, hereafter referred to as the DCC P3 peptide.</p>
        <p>We performed the screening of protein expression constructs of human myosin-X and found that a construct encoding 573 residues (1486â2058) containing the MyTH4âFERM cassette expressed a soluble protein in bacteria, although the protein has propensity for degradation during purification. We set out to find a major degradation site(s) in our sample and identified two fragments, Frag-1 (â¼48 kDa) and Frag-2 (â¼18 kDa), which appeared at an early stage of the purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, inset). Our TOF-MS spectra and N-terminal analysis suggested that these fragments correspond to two halves produced from the full-length cassette (66 kDa), and that Frag-1 encompasses residues 1486â1888 and Frag-2 the C-terminal 156 residues from Phe1893 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). We found that the myosin-X FERM domain contains a poorly conserved insertion spanning residues 1851â1917 when compared with a prototypic FERM domain such as the radixin FERM domain, whose structure is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hamada et al, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We observed that Frag-1 and Frag-2 were co-purified and still able to bind the DCC P3 peptide. Since these data implied that the insertion was not critical, we attempted to suppress degradation by modifying the insertion. We found that our deletion constructs yielded proteins, which were not degraded during the purification and had their binding affinity to the DCC P3 peptide preserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). For the present structural study, we used the construct containing the Î20 deletion (residues 1872â1891). We also used this construct, referred to as the MyTH4âFERM cassette, in further biochemical studies. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed a relatively strong affinity with a dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of 0.53 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The purified myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette exists as a monomer in solution as suggested by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) analysis, which showed a mono-modal peak corresponding to a monomer (62.7 kDa) close to the calculated (63.3 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Our MyTH4âFERM cassette and the DCC P3 peptide form a stable complex, which could be purified using conventional gel filtration. Gel filtration and AUC showed a mono-modal peak corresponding to a 1:1 complex (data not shown). Contrary to the cargo-loaded dimerization of myosin VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Yu et al, 2009</xref>), no cargo-mediated dimerization was observed for myosin-X through the MyTH4âFERM cassette.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Structure determination and overall structure</title>
        <p>The crystal structure of the complex between the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette and the DCC C-terminal P3 peptide was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) methods and was refined to 1.9 Ã resolution. The current model contains 524 residues (1501â2046) of the MyTH4âFERM cassette and 32 residues (1414â1445) of the DCC P3 peptide encompassing the conserved P3 region: 15 N- and 12 C-terminal residues of the cassette and 24 N- and 2 C-terminal residues of the DCC peptide were not observed in the current map. The free form structure of the MyTH4âFERM cassette was determined by the molecular replacement method using the cassette model of the complex structure and refined at 2.55 Ã.</p>
        <p>The myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette displays a rather elongated shape with multiple globular domains. The overall fold of the FERM domain is preserved, comprising three subdomains A, B and C (also referred to as F1, F2 and F3 lobes), which display a ubiquitin fold, a helix bundle and a PTB-like fold, respectively, as observed in the FERM domains of ERM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hamada et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Pearson et al, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). The MyTH4 domain is a globular domain comprising Î±-helices and sits on subdomain A of the FERM domain without direct contacts with subdomain B or C. Our MyTH4âFERM cassette construct contains the linker region (residues 1488â1556) between the upstream PH domain and the MyTH4 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Excepting its N-terminal 13 residues, this linker region is well defined in our map and forms two Î±-helices (Î±1x and Î±2x) and one short 3<sub>10</sub> helix (Î·x). We refer to this linker as the MyTH4 extension (MyTH4 Ex), which is closely associated with the MyTH4 domain. The DCC P3 peptide forms two helices, one shorter N-terminal Î±-helix (Î±P3â²) followed by a longer 5-turn Î±-helix (Î±P3), and binds subdomain C of the FERM domain.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>MyTH4 domain is folded into a VHS-like structure</title>
        <p>The myosin-X MyTH4 domain forms a helix bundle structure containing eight Î±-helices (Î±1â²M, Î±1MâÎ±4M, Î±6MâÎ±8M), which resembles the Vps27p/Hrs/STAM (VHS) domain composed of â¼140 residues that mediates proteinâprotein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mao et al, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). VHS domains belong to the superfamily of superhelical structures including HEAT and armadillo (ARM) repeat domains and are generally found at the very N-terminus of adaptor proteins that participate in vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Lohi et al, 2002</xref>), whereas MyTH4 domains are found in the middle of proteins. Our MyTH4 domain superimposed upon VHS domains with root-mean-squares (r.m.s.) deviations of &lt;3 Ã, although the sequence identity is extremely poor (â¼10%). Typical VHS domains have eight conserved Î±-helices (Î±1âÎ±8) forming a right-handed superhelix, and six of these overlapped well with the MyTH4 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The most prominent difference between the MyTH4 and VHS domains is found in the last Î±8M helix, which is displaced from the groove between Î±6M and Î±7M helices to the groove between Î±2M and Î±4M helices (indicated with an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), and has a key role in formation of the interface with the FERM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, the MyTH4 domain lacks the VHS Î±5 helix, but has an additional N-terminal Î±1â²M helix. The displacement of Î±8M contrasts the MyTH4 and VHS domain functions. First, the VHS domains of Golgi-localization/Î³-ear-containing/ADP-ribosylation-factor-binding (GGA) adaptor proteins provide the groove formed by Î±6 and Î±8 helices for binding of the acidic-cluster dileucine sorting signals to the compartments of the endosomalâlysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Misra et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Shiba et al, 2002</xref>), whereas the MyTH4 domain lacks the groove due to the displacement of Î±8M. Second, the VHS domain of STAM has the ubiquitin-binding surface formed by Î±2 and Î±4 helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Mizuno et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Ren and Hurley, 2010</xref>), whereas the corresponding surface of the MyTH4 domain is occupied by the displaced Î±8M helix. The MyTH4 extension comprising Î±1x and Î±2x helices are packed on the surface formed by Î±1M, Î±3M and Î±6M helices, which seems to interfere with the binding of GGA VHS domains to the acidic-cluster dileucine sorting signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the MyTH4 domain possesses a positively charged patch on the domain surface facing the FERM domain (indicated with an yellow oval in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). This patch, which will be examined for a microtubule-binding site below, contains several Arg and Lys residues from Î±2MâÎ±3M and Î±6MâÎ±7M helices and connecting loops surrounding nonpolar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, the MyTH4 domain is folded into a VHS domain-like structure but possesses unique molecular surfaces formed by the rearrangement of helices and the presence of a charged surface patch, which probably serve as a proteinâprotein recognition site distinct from that of VHS domains.</p>

        <p>The myosin-X FERM domain is distantly related to the prototype FERM domains found in ERM proteins with low (â¼20%) sequence identity. This poor homology is reflected in the structural deviations from the prototype FERM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hamada et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Pearson et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Edwards and Keep, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Shimizu et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Smith et al, 2003</xref>). The closest structural match to the myosin-X FERM domain occurs in the radixin FERM domain, whose subdomain A, B or C superimposes with the corresponding subdomains (r.m.s. deviations of 2.3, 2.1 or 1.4 Ã, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Compared with the radixin FERM domain, a 10-residue insertion exists between the Î²4A and Î²5A strands of subdomain A, and results in a longer Î±2A helix, which has a central role in forming the interface with the MyTH4 domain. Subdomain B also contains a long insertion (41 residues), of which 20 C-terminal residues are deleted in the current construct as mentioned above. The insertion exists between Î±2B and Î±3B helices and forms two additional helices (Î±2â²iB and Î±2â³iB) followed by a long loop. These inserted elements are remote from the DCC-binding site. In contrast to subdomains A and B, subdomain C has no additional insertion but exhibits a change in orientation relative to subdomains A and B with an â¼10Â° rotation, such that the C-terminal end of Î±1C helix is lifted up away from subdomain B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). The shift is induced by changes in nonpolar side-chain packing at the inter-subdomain interfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3C and D</xref>).</p>
        <p>FERM domains of ERM proteins form a positively charged cleft between subdomains A and C, which is involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), and is essential for localization and activation of ERM proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hamada et al, 2000</xref>). The myosin-X FERM domain does not possess this positively charged cleft and lacks the conserved PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-interacting residues (radixin Lys60, Asn62, Lys63 and Lys278) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Myosin-X interacts with PI3K products such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> through the second PH domain of the PH domain cluster rather than the FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Isakoff et al, 1998</xref>).</p>

        <title>The interface between the MyTH4 and FERM domains</title>
        <p>The myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette displays a close association between the MyTH4 domain and subdomain A of the FERM domain with the interface that buries the total accessible surface area of 1117 Ã<sup>2</sup>, comprising the Î±8M helix and Î±7MâÎ±8M loop of the MyTH4 domain and the long Î±2A helix of FERM subdomain A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). These secondary structural elements are unique to myosin-X MyTH4 and FERM domains as mentioned above. The conformation of the Î±7MâÎ±8M loop is stabilized by a salt bridge between Arg1682 and Glu1690 inside the loop, enabling polar and nonpolar contacts with the Î±2A helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). The tight association between MyTH4 and FERM domains was implied by the short inter-domain linker comprising a few residues, suggesting a similar tight inter-domain association of MyTH4âFERM cassettes of related myosins VII, XII and XV.</p>

        <title>Myosin-XâDCC interactions</title>
        <p>The DCC P3 peptide forms two Î±-helices, Î±P3â² and Î±P3, linked by three residues and kinked by â¼90Â° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). The longer Î±P3 helix almost encompasses the previously suggested P3 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kolodziej et al, 1996</xref>) and is docked into the hydrophobic groove between Î²5C strand and Î±1C helix of FERM subdomain C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). No direct interaction was observed with subdomains A and B or with the MyTH4 domain. The observed DCC binding to subdomain C in our crystal was supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding assay, which showed co-immunoprecipitation of DCC with myc-tagged myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette, indicating a DCCâMyTH4âFERM interaction in HEK239T cells, but no interaction with the MyTH4âFERM cassette lacking subdomain C, mycâMyTH4âFERM(ÎC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In our structure, the Î±P3 helix runs in an anti-parallel direction against the Î±1C helix of subdomain C, with the helical axis inclined by â¼20Â° and allowing nonpolar residues to fill up this groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of these nonpolar residues, three Leu residues (Leu1425, Leu1432 and Leu1439) occupy the heptad position of the helix and, together with five nonpolar residues (Met1429, Leu1435âMet1436 and Ile1442âThr1443) at the off-heptad positions, are packed into the groove in a knobs-into-holes manner. Our binding assay showed that mutations of these nonpolar residues abolished binding to myosin-X, suggesting that the nonpolar interactions are critical for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to these intimate nonpolar interactions, some polar residues contribute to define the register of the Î±P3 helix on the groove. Notably, DCC Gln1438 forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain of Phe2002 of the Î²5C strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). At the C-terminal end of the Î±P3 helix, three residues (ThrâGlyâSer) are folded back and form the C-terminal cap of the helix and the hydrogen bonding network involving Lys2034 from the Î±1C helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). This Lys residue forms a salt bridge with Glu1756 from subdomain A so as to bridge the cleft between subdomains A and C. In addition, Lys2031 of the Î±1C helix forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain of the Î²4A strand of subdomain A. These inter-subdomain interactions result in stabilization of the mutual position and orientation of the two subdomains and the side-chain conformation of Lys2034. In contrast to the wealth of interactions involving the Î±P3 helix, the Î±P3â² helix does not participate in direct interactions with the myosin-X FERM domain. In fact, mutation of two conserved residues (Tyr1420 and Glu1421) of the Î±P3â² helix does not affect myosin-X binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, DCC binding to the myosin-X FERM domain is predominantly mediated by nonpolar interactions with some critical polar interactions, and the nonpolar and polar residues that participate in the interaction are conserved in DCC and neogenin, indicating similar binding of myosin-X to the neogenin P3 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Local induced-fit structural changes in myosin-X</title>
        <p>It would be of interest to determine if structural changes are induced in the MyTH4âFERM cassette with cargo binding. Our crystal structure of the free form contains two crystallographically independent MyTH4âFERM cassettes. These two cassettes display essentially the same structure with a small overall r.m.s. deviation (1.1 Ã). Superimposition of the DCC-bound structure on the free MyTH4âFERM cassette structure shows a similar small overall r.m.s. deviation (1.1 Ã) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Thus, DCC binding induces no significant changes to the overall conformation of the cassette. However, a notable local conformational change was found in subdomain C that directly binds to the DCC peptide. Compared with the free form, the Î²5C strand is lifted from the Î±1C helix so as to enlarge the groove width to accommodate the DCC Î±P3 helix by â¼2 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). This induced-fit conformational change is induced by three key cooperative events; formation of a direct hydrogen bond between DCC Gln1438 and the main chain of Phe2002, flipping over of the Phe2002 side chain by â¼90Â°, which results in it being sandwiched between two nonpolar residues (Leu1435 and Leu1439) from the DCC Î±P3 helix, and a shift of the Î²5C strand to produce a nonpolar hole to accommodate the DCC Ile1442 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The side-chain rotamer transition of Phe2002 may be correlated to the rotamer transition of Val1980, which is relatively remote (â¼5.3 Ã) from Phe2002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). These observations imply that subdomain C possesses conformational pliability given its intra-domain network of side-chain packing and atomic contacts.</p>

        <title>Myosin-Xâmicrotubule interactions</title>
        <p>Our microtubule co-sedimentation analyses showed significant co-pelleting of the MyTH4âFERM cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies, which showed that the MyTH4âFERM cassette is sufficient to confer microtubule association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Weber et al, 2004</xref>). Microtubules possess negatively charged surfaces, predominantly due to â¼20 residues of the C-terminal acidic tail, which contains glutamic acid clusters. As our structure reveals a positively charged patch on the MyTH4 domain surface, we supposed that the negatively charged C-terminal tails of tubulin may have a key role in the binding to myosin-X. Using tubulin peptides encompassing the C-terminal acidic tails, our pull-down assays indeed showed that the MyTH4âFERM cassette binds both the C-terminal acidic tail peptides of Î±- and Î²-tubulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Next, we examined the effect of mutations introduced into the positively charged patch of the MyTH4 domain on binding to tubulin acidic tails. MyTH4 Lys1647 and Lys1650 are located at the centre of the positively charged patch and are expected to have a key role in tubulin binding. Charge-reversal double mutation (K1647D/K1650D) of these basic residues abolished binding to the Î²2B-tubulin C-terminal tail peptide, while mutation (F2002K) of nonpolar residue Phe2002 of the groove of FERM subdomain C to a polar residue (Lys) had no effect on binding to the tubulin tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). Unlike tubulin tail binding, the F2002K mutation of subdomain C abolished DCC binding, but the K1647D/K1650D mutation exhibited only a slight reduction in DCC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). Co-sedimentation experiments also supported this notion that the K1647D/K1650D mutation interferes with co-pelleting of the MyTH4âFERM domain with microtubules but the F2002K mutation causes no interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, DCC- and tubulin tail-binding sites are present at different locations within the MyTH4 and FERM domains.</p>
        <p>Since these two binding sites are relatively close and positioned at the same side of the molecular surface, we speculated that binding at one site may interfere with binding at the other site. Interestingly, our competition binding assay showed that binding to the tubulin acidic tail peptide is reduced by addition of the DCC P3 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E</xref>), and co-sedimentation experiments showed that DCC peptide interferes with co-pelleting of the MyTH4âFERM domain with microtubules in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F</xref>). This dose-dependent competition was not observed if we employed the mutated (F2002K) MyTH4âFERM cassette that fails to bind the DCC peptide (data not shown). All these results suggest interference between microtubule- and DCC-binding events.</p>

        <title>Myosin-Xâintegrin <italic>Î²</italic> interactions</title>
        <p>Our pull-down assays with the integrin Î²5 cytoplasmic peptide (residues 743â799) showed binding to the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G</xref>), which is consistent with the previous study which shows that the FERM domain is sufficient to confer binding to the integrin Î²5 cytoplasmic peptide and mutation of the integrin Î²5 NPXY motif blocks binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Zhang et al, 2004</xref>). This binding is obstructed by addition of the DCC P3 peptide in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5G</xref>), which is coincident with an assumption that the integrin Î²5 peptide containing the NPXY motif binds the subdomain C groove formed by the Î±1C helix and the Î²5C strand in a similar manner to its binding to the talin FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Wegener et al, 2007</xref>). Like DCC, integrin Î²5 interferes microtubule binding, whereas the interference is relatively weaker than DCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have provided the first structures of the MyTH4âFERM cassette in the free and cargo-bound forms. These structures together with the biochemical analyses allow us to delineate the mechanisms that account for the two modes of cargo and microtubule recognition. Of the 37 different types of myosins identified displaying different domain combinations, MyTH4âFERM-containing myosins appear in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Richards and Cavalier-Smith, 2005</xref>). Vertebrates possess three conserved MyTH4âFERM-containing myosins, VII, X and XV. Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> is thought to lack myosin-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Berg et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Foth et al, 2006</xref>), the DCC P3 helix is well conserved in frazzled, which encodes a <italic>Drosophila</italic> member of the DCC immunoglobulin subfamily and is required for CNS and motor axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kolodziej et al, 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). The myosin assigned as myosin-XV may function as myosin-X.</p>
      <p>Recently, DCC has been suggested to mediate local translation in neurons by anchoring components of the translational machinery such as ribosome subunits at growth cones and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Tcherkezian et al, 2010</xref>). The machinery-binding site of DCC is located at the juxtamembrane P1 region, which is separated from the C-terminal P3 helix by more than 250 residues thought to form a random coil. In fact, the P3 region also exists as a random coil in the free state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The DCC cytoplasmic long tail may function as a molecular glue for secondary cargo binding.</p>
      <p>In our structure, the MyTH4 domain has no direct contacts with the DCC peptide, in spite of the yeast two-hybrid assay which demonstrated full DCC-binding affinity to the complete MyTH4âFERM cassette but weaker binding affinity to the isolated FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Zhu et al, 2007</xref>). We speculated that the MyTH4 domain is necessary for folding and/or maintaining the stable structure of the FERM domain. In fact, we experienced difficulties in expressing isolated MyTH4 or FERM domains in a stable form in bacteria as previously mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Weber et al, 2004</xref>). This seems to be in line with our observation of rigidity in the overall structure of the MyTH4âFERM cassette, which exhibits no significant conformational changes in the free and DCC-bound states or in different crystal packing environments.</p>
      <p>An unexpected finding related to the DCC Î±P3 helix that was docked into the groove between the Î²5C strand and the Î±1C helix of subdomain C of the myosin-X FERM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). In sharp contrast to this Î±-helix groove docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>), binding partners of ERM proteins have been shown to bind this groove of FERM domains by forming an additional anti-parallel Î²âÎ² association with the Î²5C strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hamada et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Takai et al, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Terawaki et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mori et al, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). In these structures, binding partners such as adhesion molecule ICAM-2, CD43 and PSGL-1 form a short Î² strand for association with the Î²5C strand and a 1-turn 3<sub>10</sub> helix for docking into the groove, and preserve the sequence motif Motif-1Î± (RxxTYxVxxA, where x stands for any amino-acid residue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hamada et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Takai et al, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B and E</xref>). Another adhesion molecule CD44 and a membrane-associated protease NEP preserve the Motif-1Î² conserved sequence Ile-Asn (IN), and form a short Î² strand followed by a reverse turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Terawaki et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mori et al, 2008</xref>). These binding motifs differ from the DCC/neogenin motif that forms the P3 Î±-helix. Compared with radixin subdomain C, myosin-X possesses a shorter Î²5C strand (4 residues versus 6 residues of radixin) and shorter Î±1C helix (5 turns versus 6 turns of radixin), and these are loosely associated to form a larger groove for Î±-helix accommodation, given the absence of bulky nonpolar residues at the groove surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
      <p>ERM proteins bind the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger regulatory factor-1, 2 (NHERF-1 and -2), which are key cytoplasmic proteins involved in the anchoring of ion channels and receptors to the actin cytoskeleton through binding to ERM proteins. These adaptor proteins preserve FERM-binding Motif-2 (MDWxxxxx(L/I)Fxx(L/F)) and form an Î±-helix that docks into the groove formed by the Î²-sandwich loops of subdomain C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Terawaki et al, 2006</xref>), which displays no similarity to the DCC/neogenin P3 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). The myosin-X FERM domain lacks the PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding site found in the radixin FERM domain as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
      <p>It was one of the most exciting findings in cell biology of cytoskeletons that myosin-X has the ability to function as a motorized link between actin filaments and microtubules in spindle assembly during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Weber et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Toyoshima and Nishida, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Woolner et al, 2008</xref>). However, to date, only a single report of <italic>Xenopus</italic> myosin-X has shown the direct binding of myosin-X to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Weber et al, 2004</xref>). Our present studies confirmed that result in a mammalian myosin-X but also revealed that at least the major part of the novel myosin-Xâmicrotubule interaction is mediated by the MyTH4 domain and the C-terminal acidic tails of tubulins. Interestingly, these acidic tails of Î±Î²-tubulins are also collectively referred to as E-hooks, which interact with the kinesin K-loop for processive motor movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Okada and Hirokawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hirokawa et al, 2009</xref>). It is well known that Î±-tubulin acidic tails possess a terminal tyrosine residue at the C-terminus, which is recognized by the CAP-Gly domains of microtubule-binding proteins such as CLIP-170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Honnappa et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mishima et al, 2007</xref>). The MyTH4âFERM cassette has no homologous region to the CAP-Gly domain and binds both Î±- and Î²-tubulin acidic tails.</p>
      <p>We showed that the interactions of the MyTH4âFERM domain with microtubules and DCC are mutually exclusive, in spite of the fact that the binding sites are not overlapping. This is particularly important as myosin-X is now reported to have several different binding partners, implying that under different cellular conditions, a different subset of proteins may be associated with myosin-X. It is noteworthy that integrin binding also interferes microtubule binding. We speculate that the primary motor function carrying cargos and the linker function linking an actin filament and a microtubule are two alternative functions of myosin-X.</p>
      <p>At present, it is unclear how the interference between tubulin tail and DCC P3 binding occurs, although the C-terminal flexible region of the DCC Î±P3 helix may interfere with tubulin tail binding to the MyTH4 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Our present data suggest no significant changes in the overall structure of the MyTH4âFERM cassette on DCC binding. However, it is possible that the acidic tail or microtubule bindings may cause some induced-fit changes in the overall structure. We also speculated that negatively charged residues of the N-terminal flanking region of the DCC P3 peptide may cause electrostatic repulsion with the tubulin acidic tails and the negatively charged surfaces of microtubules.</p>
      <p>Recently, the crystal structure of a fusion protein of the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette (human residues 1503â2047) and the DCC P3 peptide (rat 1409â1445) at 2.5 Ã resolution has appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wei et al, 2011</xref>). The fusion protein contains an artificial covalent link between the C-terminus of the subdomain C Î±1C helix and the N-terminus of the DCC peptide. Compared with our structure, the MyTH4âFERM cassette fused to the DCC P3 peptide displays a relatively large r.m.s. deviation (1.9 Ã) of the overall structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>). This unexpectedly large deviation is due to a change in orientation of subdomain C relative to subdomains A and B with an â¼5Â° rotation. Contrary to the overall structures, each FERM subdomain and the MyTH4 domain exhibit relatively small r.m.s. deviations (â¼1 Ã). Like our structure, the fused DCC peptide binds subdomain C with the DCC Î±P3 helix docked into the subdomain C groove. Side-chain packing at the groove involving conserved nonpolar residues is similar in the two complexes. Nevertheless, superimposition of subdomain C reveals notable local conformational deviations in this subdomain and the bound DCC peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>). Compared with our DCC peptide, the Î±P3â² helix of the fused DCC peptide is moved by 4.5 Ã away from the Î±1C helix, while the C-terminal region of the Î±1C helix is shifted away from the DCC Î±P3â² helix. These movements seem to be induced by the artificial covalent link, which exhibits high mobility with high-temperature factors and seems to push these helices away from each other. These movements result in looser helix packing between the N-terminal region of the Î±1C helix and the C-terminal region of the Î±P3 helix of the fused protein.</p>
      <p>The most prominent differences are found in polar interactions. In our complex, Lys2034 from the Î±1C helix has a central role in forming the hydrogen bonding network involving DCC residues (Asn1440, Thr1443 and Ser1445) from the C-terminal end of the Î±P3 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). This network is absent in the fused protein and, instead, Lys2031 forms a single hydrogen bond with Ser1445 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>). This difference is caused by side-chains rearrangement, which is induced by reorientation of subdomain C, which shifts away from subdomain A with breaking the inter-subdomain salt bridge between Lys2034 and Glu1756 and the hydrogen bond between Lys2031 and the Î²4A strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Lack of these inter-subdomain interactions destabilizes the hydrogen bonding network, resulting in side-chain rearrangement with destruction of the network. In addition to these movements, the Î²5CâÎ²6C loop of subdomain C is also moved away from the fused DCC P3 helix and the hydrogen bond involving DCC Gln1438 is missing or neglected probably because of the marginal value (3.4 Ã) of the distance. All these differences imply that the DCC binding found in the fused protein may be in a metastable state of binding.</p>
      <p>The MyTH4âFERM cassette structure displays a sharp contrast to the recently reported structure of the myosin-VIIa MyTH4âFERM-SH3 cassette bound to cargos the central domain (CEN) of Sans determined at 2.8 Ã resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Wu et al, 2011</xref>). The myosin-VIIa MyTH4âFERM cassette is distantly related to the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette with low (â¼14%) sequence identity, which is reflected in relatively large deviations of pairwise superimpositions of each subdomains AâC and the MyTH4 domain (r.m.s. deviations ranging from 1.9 to 2.4 Ã). Remarkably, superimposition of the overall structures of MyTH4âFERM cassettes of these myosins exhibits a large r.m.s. deviation (6.2 Ã for 432 residues) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). This large deviation is due to reorientations of subdomains B and C, in addition to no structural similarity between the MyTH4 extensions of two myosins. These reorientations could be induced by Sans CEN binding to all three inter-subdomain interfaces formed by subdomains A, B and C. This binding site that is distinct from our DCC-binding site reflects versatility in proteinâprotein interactions of the FERM domain. Despite these deviations, the MyTH4 domain and subdomain A display a relatively better overlap (the r.m.s. deviation of 2.8 Ã), indicating rigidity of the interface between the MyTH4 domain and subdomain C as we discussed with our myosin-X MyTH4âFERM structure. Subdomain arrangements in FERM domains may be more flexibly than we expected before. In fact, the recent structure of the talin FERM domain shows a novel extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Elliott et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to netrin receptors, integrins and microtubules, several reports have suggested other binding partners of myosin-X such as bone morphogenetic protein 6 receptor ALK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pi et al, 2007</xref>), adhesion molecules such as VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Almagro et al, 2010</xref>), regulators of actin polymerization such as Mena/VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Tokuo and Ikebe, 2004</xref>) and spindle-pole assembly factor TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Woolner et al, 2008</xref>). The fact that Mena/VASP is a cargo of myosin-X may be related to the reported observation that both the MyTH4 domain and motor function of myosin-X are crucial for actin organization at the leading edge and the promotion of filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bohil et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Tokuo et al, 2007</xref>). At present, our sequence analysis failed to detect candidates for myosin-X-binding regions that resemble our DCC P3 peptide or tubulin acidic tails. Lack of sequence similarity between the integrin Î²5 cytoplasmic peptide and the DCC P3 peptide implies that the myosin-X subdomain C is a protein-binding module of dual or multiple modes. It should be noted that the MyTH4âFERM cassette may possess uncovered binding sites for these binding partners or that these bind other domains of myosin-X.</p>

        <p>A DNA fragment encoding the MyTH4âFERM cassette (residues 1486â2058) of human myosin-X was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the pET47b [+] vector (Novagen). To prevent degradation, nucleotides encoding residues 1872â1891 of the extra loop were deleted from the plasmid using inverse PCR. The PCR-amplified nucleotides encoding human DCC (residues 1390â1447), Î±1A-tubulin (399â451), Î²2B-tubulin (390â445) and integrin Î²5 cytoplasmic tail (743â799) were cloned into the pET49b [+] vectors (Novagen). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing and transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) cells for protein expression.</p>
        <p>Protein expression was performed at 20Â°C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mM isopropyl-Î²-<sc>D</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells expressing the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette were harvested, suspended in 20 mM TrisâHCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 150 mM NaCl and disrupted by sonication. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and treated with HRV3C protease to remove the N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Eluted proteins were further purified by cation exchange (HiTrap SP HP, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex 200 pg, GE healthcare) chromatography. For preparation of the DCC P3, tubulin tail and integrin peptides, wet cells expressing proteins were suspended in 20 mM TrisâHCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl and disrupted by sonication. Following ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare), anion exchange (HiTrap Q HP, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex 75 pg, GE Healthcare) chromatography. For crystallization, the GST-fused DCC P3 peptide was treated with HRV3C protease to remove the N-terminal GST tag. Separately purified myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette and DCC P3 peptide were mixed and the 1:1 complex was purified using gel filtration chromatography.</p>
        <p>For structure determination, protein expression of the selenomethione (SeMet)-labelled MyTH4âFERM cassette was performed in M9 medium containing SeMet under conditions inhibiting the methionine biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">DoubliÃ©, 1997</xref>). The expression conditions and purification procedures were the same as those used for the native protein. The purified proteins were verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDIâTOF-MS; Bruker Daltonics).</p>

        <p>Initial crystallization conditions were screened using a Hydra II Plus One crystallization robot (Matrix Technology) with commercial crystallization-solution kits, JCSG Core Suite IâIV and PACT Suite (Qiagen). The best crystals of the complex between myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette and DCC P3 peptide were obtained from solutions containing 5 mg/ml of the complex and reservoir solution containing 100 mM malic acid-MES-Tris (MMT) buffer (pH 8.0) and 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500 at 20Â°C. Crystals of the free myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette were obtained using reservoir solution containing 10% PEG 8000, 5% MPD and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5) from protein solutions containing the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette and Î²-tubulin (390â445) in an equimolar ratio (112 Î¼M). These crystals appeared to contain no Î²-tubulin within the crystals. The crystals obtained were transferred stepwise into a cryoprotective solution containing 30% glycerol (for the MyTH4âFERM/DCC complex) or 25% ethylene glycol (for the MyTH4âFERM cassette) and flash cooled at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a BL41XU or BL44XU beamline at SPring-8.

The MyTH4âFERM cassette contains the MyTH4 extension (yellow), and MyTH4 (green) and FERM (cyan) domains. The FERM domain consists of subdomains A, B and C. The DCC P3 peptide (orange) binds subdomain C. (<bold>B</bold>) Electrostatic surface potentials of the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette. The electrostatic surface potentials are shaded blue in positively and red in negatively charged regions, respectively. The bound DCC P3 peptide is shown as a ribbon model (orange). The yellow oval indicates the positively charged patch, which was identified as the microtubule-binding site in this study. (<bold>C</bold>) Comparison of MyTH4 and VHS domains. The myosin-X MyTH4 domain (green) superimposed on the STAM2 VHS domain (grey) bound to ubiquitin (Ub, pink) (3LDZ). Six helices (Î±1âÎ±4, Î±6âÎ±7) out of the eight conserved helices of the VHS domain are overlapped with corresponding helices. The MyTH4 domain lacks the Î±5 helix of the VHS domain. A large flipping over of the Î±8M helix of the MyTH4 domain relative to the corresponding Î±8 helix of the VHS domain is indicated with a blue arrow. The acidic-cluster dileucine sorting signal peptide (ACLL, pink) of the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor bound to the GGA3 VHS domain (1JUQ) is modelled on the STAM VHS domain structure to show the peptide-binding site. (<bold>D</bold>) The positively charged patch on the MyTH4 domain. A cluster of basic residues (yellow) surrounds nonpolar residues. The basic residues include the C-terminal part of the Î±2M helix (His1597) and the N-terminal part of Î±3M helix (Arg1600 and Arg1603), the N-terminal part of the Î±6M helix (Arg1643, Lys1647 and Lys1650), the C-terminal part of the Î±7M helix and the flanking loop (Lys1677, Lys1678 and Arg1682).

In our current model of the human DCC P3 peptide, 24 N-terminal residues (1390â1413) and 2 C-terminal residues (1446â1447) are missing (indicated with dotted lines) due to poor electron density. (<bold>C</bold>) Direct interactions between the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette and DCC in cells. Co-immunoprecipitation of myosin-X and DCC from HEK293T cells in a manner dependent on subdomain C of the FERM domain. MycâMyo-X (residues 1486â2058) contains the myc-tagged full-length MyTH4âFERM cassette and mycâMyo-X(ÎC) (residues 1486â1954) lacks subdomain C of the FERM domain. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-myc antibodies to immunoprecipitate the mycâMyo-XâDCC complex, resolved on SDSâPAGE and then immunoblotted with antibodies against myc or DCC. One percent of the input was included in the blot to indicate the amount of relevant proteins. (<bold>D</bold>) Effect of mutations of the DCC P3 peptide on myosin-X binding. Pull-down binding assays of mutated DCC P3 peptides with the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette (Myo-X) were performed with mutations of the Î±P3â² helix (Tyr1420 and Glu1421) and Î±P3 helix (Leu1432, Glu1433, Leu1435, Met1436 and Leu1439).

(<bold>C</bold>) Tubulin tail binding to the MyTH4 domain and the DCC P3 peptide binding to the FERM domain. Pull-down assay with the wild-type myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette (Myo-X (wt)) shows binding to the GST-fused C-terminal acidic tail peptide of Î²2B-tubulin (GST-tubulin tail) but the K1647D/K1650D mutation abolished binding (Myo-X (K1647D/K1650D)). The F2002K mutation had no effect on tubulin tail binding (Myo-X (F2002K)). On the other hand, the charge-reversal mutation only weakly affected binding to the GST-DCC P3 peptide and the nonpolar to polar mutation of subdomain C abolished the binding. (<bold>D</bold>) Microtubules bind the MyTH4 but not the FERM domain. Microtubule co-sedimentation experiments with wild-type and mutated myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassettes used in (<bold>C</bold>).

Pull-down assay of the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette (Myo-X, 30 Î¼M) with the GST-fused Î²2B-tubulin peptide was performed in the presence of the DCC P3 peptide (0, 30, 60, 120 and 300 Î¼M). The relative amount of myosin-X pulled down with GST-tubulin in the absence of DCC is shown at the bottom. In this assay, the 30 Î¼M DCC P3 (the 1:1 molar ratio of DCC to MyTH4âFERM) completely abolished tubulin binding.

Microtubule co-sedimentation experiments with the myosin-X MyTH4âFERM cassette (Myo-X, 4 Î¼M) were performed in the presence of the DCC P3 peptide (0, 4, 20 and 40 Î¼M).
