    <p id="P1">Large-scale genomic studies have shown that half of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) have alterations in genes regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Loss of HR accounts for the genomic instability of EOCs and for their cellular hyper-dependence on alternative poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA repair mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Previous studies have implicated the DNA polymerase POLQ<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in a pathway required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, referred to as the error-prone microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Whether POLQ interacts with canonical DNA repair pathways to prevent genomic instability remains unknown. Here we report an inverse correlation between HR activity and POLQ expression in EOCs. While knockdown of POLQ in HR-proficient cells up-regulates HR activity and RAD51 nucleofilament assembly, knockdown of POLQ in HR-deficient EOCs enhances cell death. Consistent with these results, genetic inactivation of an HR gene (<italic>Fancd2</italic>) and <italic>Polq</italic> in mice results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, POLQ contains RAD51 binding motifs, and it blocks RAD51-mediated recombination. Our results reveal a synthetic lethal relationship between the HR pathway and POLQ-mediated repair in EOCs, and identify POLQ as a novel druggable target for cancer therapy.</p>
    <p id="P2">To examine changes in polymerase activity between tumors and normal tissues, we screened polymerase gene expression profiles in a broad number of cancers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed specific and recurrent overexpression of POLQ in EOCs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a-c</xref>). POLQ was up-regulated in a grade-dependent manner and its expression positively correlated with numerous mediators of HR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d-j</xref>). Since POLQ has been suggested to play a role in DNA repair<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we investigated a potential role for POLQ in HR repair.</p>
    <p id="P3">To test the relationship between POLQ expression and HR, we used a cell-based assay which measures the efficiency of recombination of two GFP alleles (DR-GFP)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Knockdown of POLQ with siRNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>) resulted in an increase in HR efficiency, similar to that observed by depleting the anti-recombinases PARI or BLM<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Depletion of POLQ caused a significant increase in basal and radiation (IR)-induced RAD51 foci (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b-d</xref>), and depletion of POLQ in 293T cells conferred cellular hypersensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC) and an increase in MMC-induced chromosomal aberrations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2e, f</xref>). These findings suggest that human POLQ inhibits HR and participates in the maintenance of genome stability.</p>
    <p id="P4">Given that POLQ shares structural homology with coexpressed RAD51-binding ATPases (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1k, l</xref>), we hypothesized that POLQ might regulate HR through an interaction with RAD51. Indeed, RAD51 was detected in Flag-tagged POLQ immunoprecipitates, and purified full-length Flag-POLQ bound recombinant human RAD51 (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). Pull-down assays with recombinant GST-RAD51 and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated POLQ truncation mutants defined a region of POLQ binding to RAD51 spanning amino acid 847-894 (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e, f</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2g, h</xref>). Sequence homology of POLQ with the RAD51 binding domain of <italic>C. elegans</italic> RFS-1<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> identified a second binding region (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2i</xref>). Peptides arrays narrowed down the RAD51 binding activity of POLQ to three distinct motifs (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2j</xref>). Substitution arrays confirmed the interaction and highlighted the importance of the 847â894 POLQ region as both necessary and sufficient for RAD51 binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that POLQ is a RAD51-interacting protein that regulates HR.</p>
    <p id="P5">In order to address the role of POLQ in HR regulation, we assessed the ability of wild-type (WT) or mutant POLQ to complement the siPOLQ-dependent increase in RAD51 foci. Full-length wild-type POLQ fully reduced IR-induced RAD51 foci, unlike POLQ mutated at ATPase catalytic residues (A-dead) or POLQ lacking interaction with RAD51 (ÎRAD51) (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). Expression of a POLQ mutant lacking the polymerase domain (ÎPol1) was sufficient to decrease IR-induced RAD51 foci, suggesting that the N-terminal half of POLQ is sufficient to disrupt RAD51 foci (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c, d</xref>). We next measured the ability of wild-type or mutant POLQ to complement the siPOLQ-dependent increase in HR efficiency. Again, expression of full-length POLQ or ÎPol1 decreased the recombination frequency when compared to cells expressing other POLQ constructs, suggesting that the N-terminal half of POLQ containing the RAD51 binding domain and the ATPase domain is needed to inhibit HR (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">A purified recombinant POLQ fragment (ÎPol2) from insect cells exhibited low levels of basal ATPase activity, as previously reported<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref>). POLQ ATPase activity was selectively stimulated by the addition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or fork DNA (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) showed specific binding of POLQ to ssDNA (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). We incubated ÎPol2 with ssDNA and measured RAD51-ssDNA nucleofilament assembly. Interestingly, RAD51-ssDNA assembly was reduced by wild-type ÎPol2 but not by A-dead or ÎRAD51, indicating that POLQ negatively affects RAD51-ssDNA assembly through its RAD51 binding and ATPase activities (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c-f</xref>). Furthermore, POLQ decreased the efficiency of D-loop formation, confirming that POLQ is a negative regulator of HR (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4g-j</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Since POLQ is up-regulated in subgroups of cancers associated with HR deficiency (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and POLQ activity shows specificity for replicative stress-mediated structures (ss and fork DNA) (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e, f</xref>), we examined the cellular functions of POLQ under replicative stress. Subcellular fractionation revealed that POLQ is enriched in chromatin in response to ultraviolet (UV) light; and RAD51 binding by POLQ was enhanced by UV exposure, suggesting that POLQ regulates HR in cells under replicative stress (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a, b</xref>). POLQ-depleted cells were hypersensitive to cellular stress and DNA damage along with an exacerbated checkpoint activation and increased Î³H2AX phosphorylation (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Furthermore, the cell cycle progression of POLQ-depleted cells was impaired after DNA damage (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). To determine the role of POLQ in replication dynamics, single-molecule analyses were performed on extended DNA fibers<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Abnormalities in replication fork progression were observed in POLQ-depleted cells (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f, g</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c, d</xref>). These results suggest that POLQ maintains genomic stability at stalled or collapsed replication forks by promoting fork restart.</p>
    <p id="P8">To examine the regulation of POLQ, we quantified POLQ expression by RT-qPCR. POLQ was selectively up-regulated in HR-deficient ovarian cancer cell lines. Complementation of a BRCA1 or FANCD2-deficient cell lines, restored normal HR function and reduced POLQ expression to normal levels. Conversely, siRNA-mediated inhibition of HR genes increased POLQ expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5e, f</xref>). POLQ expression was significantly higher in subgroups of cancers with HR deficiency and a high genomic instability pattern<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref>). Patients with high POLQ expression had a better response to platinum chemotherapy, a surrogate for HR deficiency, suggesting that POLQ expression inversely correlates with HR activity and may be useful as a biomarker for platinium sensitivity (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5h, i</xref>). Together, these data indicate that increased POLQ expression is driven by HR deficiency.</p>
    <p id="P9">To assess the possible synthetic lethality between HR genes and POLQ, we generated an HR-deficient ovarian tumor cell line, A2780-shFANCD2 cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a-c</xref>). These cells, and the parental A2780 cells, were subjected to POLQ depletion, and survival following exposure to cytotoxic drugs was measured. POLQ depletion reduced the survival of HR-deficient cells exposed to inhibitors of PARP (PARPi), cisplatin (CDDP), or MMC (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6d-f</xref>). POLQ inhibition impaired the survival of BRCA1-deficient tumors (MDA-MB-436) after PARPi treatment but had no effect on the complemented line (MDA-MB-436 + BRCA1) (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). POLQ-depleted cells were hypersensitive to ATM inhibition, known to create an HR defect phenotype<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Chromosomal breakage, checkpoint activation, and Î³H2AX phosphorylation in response to MMC were exacerbated by POLQ depletion (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6g, h</xref>). Furthermore, a whole-genome shRNA screen performed on HR-deficient (FANCA<sup>-/-</sup>) fibroblasts showed that shRNAs targeting POLQ impair cell survival in MMC (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6i</xref>), suggesting that HR-deficient cells cannot survive in the absence of POLQ.</p>
    <p id="P10">Next, we investigated the interaction between the HR and POLQ pathways <italic>in vivo</italic> by interbreeding <italic>Fancd2<sup>+/â</sup></italic> and <italic>Polq<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice. Although <italic>Fancd2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Polq<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are viable and exhibit subtle phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, viable <italic>Fancd2<sup>â/â</sup>Polq<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice were uncommon from these matings (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). The only surviving <italic>Fancd2<sup>â/â</sup>Polq<sup>â/â</sup></italic> pups exhibited severe congenital malformations and were either found dead or died prematurely. <italic>Fancd2<sup>â/â</sup>Polq<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos showed severe congenital malformations, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from <italic>Fancd2<sup>â/â</sup>Polq<sup>â/â</sup></italic> embryos showed hypersensitivity to PARPi (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b-e</xref>). These data suggest that loss of the HR and POLQ repair pathways <italic>in vivo</italic> results in embryonic lethality.</p>
    <p id="P11">Since xenografts of tumors cells expressing shRNAs against both FANCD2 and POLQ did not stably propagate in mice (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>), we xenotransplanted A2780-shFANCD2 cells expressing either doxycycline-inducible POLQ or Scr shRNA in athymic nude mice. POLQ depletion significantly impaired tumor growth after PARPi treatment (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7g, h</xref>). Moreover, mice bearing POLQ-depleted tumors had a survival advantage following PARPi treatment compared to control mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). POLQ-depleted HR-deficient tumor cells also exhibited decreased survival in <italic>in vivo</italic> dual-colour competition experiments (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7i-l</xref>). Collectively, these data confirm that HR-deficient tumors are hypersensitive to inhibition of POLQ-mediated repair.</p>
    <p id="P12">To understand which functions of POLQ are required for resistance to DNA-damaging agents, we performed a series of complementation studies in HR-deficient cells. Expression of full-length POLQ or ÎPol1, but not ÎRAD51, in HR-deficient POLQ-depleted cells treated with PARPi or MMC was able to rescue toxicity, suggesting that the anti-recombinase activity of POLQ maintains the genomic stability of HR-deficient cells (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g, h</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a, b</xref>). Moreover, the toxicity induced by loss of POLQ in HR-deficient cells was rescued by depletion of RAD51 showing that, in the absence of POLQ, RAD51 is toxic to HR-deficient cells (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). These results suggest a role for POLQ in limiting toxic HR events<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c-f</xref>) and may explain why HR-deficient cells overexpress and depend on an anti-recombinase for survival.</p>
    <p id="P13">High mutation rates have been observed in HR-deficient tumors<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that POLQ is an error-prone polymerase<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> that participates in alternative end-joining (alt-EJ)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, we assessed the role of POLQ in error-prone DNA repair in human cancer cells. POLQ inhibition reduced alt-EJ efficiency in U2OS cells, similar to the reduction observed following depletion of PARP1, another critical factor in end-joining<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). Expression of full-length POLQ, ÎRAD51, or A-dead, but not the ÎPol1 mutant, complemented the cells, suggesting that the polymerase domain of POLQ is required for end-joining (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). GFP-tagged full-length POLQ formed foci after UV treatment in a PARP-dependent manner (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). POLQ inhibition reduced the mutation frequency induced by UV light, and tumors with high POLQ expression harbored more somatic point mutations than those with lower POLQ levels (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9d, e</xref>). These results suggest that POLQ contributes to the mutational signature observed in some HR-deficient tumors<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P14">In human cancers, a deficiency in one DNA repair pathway can result in cellular hyper-dependence on a second compensatory DNA repair pathway<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

Cells were lysed by supplementation with Triton X-100 (0.2% final concentration), three freeze-thaw cycles and sonication (20 pulses at 40% efficiency). Soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation and incubated with 2 mL of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 1 hour at 4Â°C. After washing the resin with 100 mL of wash buffer (Buffer A supplemented with 1 M NaCl, final concentration) the salt concentration was brought down to 350 mM. His-SUMO-RAD51 was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 10 mM - 300 mM in Buffer A. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. His-SUMO-RAD51 containing fractions were pooled and supplemented with Ulp1 protease to cleave the His-SUMO tag and dialyzed overnight into Buffer B (50 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 350 mM NaCl, 25% Sucrose, 10% Glycerol, 5 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole and 0.05% Triton X-100). The dialyzed fraction was incubated with Ni-NTA resin for 1 hour at 4Â°C and the RAD51 containing flow-through fraction was collected and dialyzed overnight into Buffer C (100 mM Potassium phosphate [pH 6.8], 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.01% Triton-X). RAD51 was further purified by Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) chromatography. After washing with ten column volumes of Buffer C, RAD51 was eluted with a linear gradient of Potassium phosphate [pH 6.8] from 100 mM - 800 mM. RAD51 containing fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT). Purified protein was flash-frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80Â°C.</p>

        <title>Studies of xenograft-bearing CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu mice</title>
        <p id="P34">The Animal Resource Facility at The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute approved all housing situations, treatments and experiments using mice. No more than five mice were housed per air-filtered cage with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to standard diet and water, and were maintained in a temperature and light-controlled animal facility under pathogen-free conditions. All mice described in this text were drug and procedure naÃ¯ve before the start of the experiments. For every xenograft study, we subcutaneously implanted approximately 1.0 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> A2780 cells (1:1 in Matrigel Matrix, BD Biosciences) into both flanks of 6-8 week old female CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu mice (Taconic). Doxycycline (Sigma) was added to the food (625 PPM) and bi-weekly (Tuesday and Friday) to the water (200 Î¼g/ml) for mice bearing tumors that reached 100-200 mm<sup>3</sup>. Roughly one week (5-6 days) after the addition of Doxycycline to the diet, mice were randomized to twice daily treatment schedules with vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or PARPi (ABT-888; 50 mg per kg body weight) by oral gavage administration for the indicated number of weeks. Overall survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier analyses performed with <italic>Log-Rank</italic> tests to assess differences in median survival for each shRNA condition (shScr or shPOLQ) and each treatment condition (vehicle or PARPi) (GraphPad Prism 6 Software). For competition assays, A2780 cells expressing FANCD2-GFP shRNA (GFP cells) or a combination of FANCD2-GFP shRNA with (doxycycline inducible) Scr-RFP or POLQ-RFP shRNA (GFP-RFP cells) were mixed at an equal ratio of GFP to GFP-RFP cells, and thereafter injected into nude mice given doxycycline-containing diets and treated with either vehicle or PARPi or CDDP. For competition assays, mice received identical doxycycline and PARPi drug treatment. For the Cisplatin competition assay, mice were randomized into semi-weekly treatment regimens with vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or CDDP (5 mg per kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection. After three to four weeks of treatment, mice were euthanized and tumors were grown <italic>in vitro</italic>, in the presence of doxycycline (2 Î¼g/ml for 4 days). The relative ratio of GFP to GFP-RFP cells was determined by FACS analysis. Tumor volumes were calculated bi-weekly using caliper measurements (length Ã width<sup>2</sup>)/2. Growth curves were plotted as the mean tumor volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) for each treatment group; relative tumor volume (RTV) indicates change in tumor volume at a given time point relative to that at the day before initial dosing (=1). Mice were unbiasedly assigned into different treatment groups. Drug treatment and outcome assessment was performed in a blinded manner. Mice were monitored every day and euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation when tumor size (â¥2 cm), tumor status (necrosis/ulceration) or body weight loss (â¥20%) reached ethical endpoint, according to the rules of the Animal Resource Facility at The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.</p>

          <p id="P46"><bold>a,</bold> Mechanistic model for how POLQ limits RAD51-ssDNA filament assembly. According to this model, the ATPase domain of POLQ may prevent the assembly of RAD51 monomers into RAD51 polymers, perhaps by depleting local ATP concentrations. The RAD51 binding domains in the central region of POLQ may then sequester the RAD51 monomers, preventing filament assembly. <bold>b, I.</bold> Under physiological conditions, POLQ expression is low and its impact on repqir of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is limited. <bold>II.</bold> When HR deficiency occurs, POLQ is then highly expressed and channels DSB repair toward alt-EJ. <bold>III</bold>. In the case of an HR-defect, the loss of POLQ leads to cell death through the persistence of toxic RAD51 intermediates and inhibition of alt-EJ.</p>
