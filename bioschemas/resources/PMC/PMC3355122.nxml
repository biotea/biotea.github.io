      <abstract>
        <p>S-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification important for controlling the membrane targeting and function of numerous membrane proteins with diverse roles in signalling, scaffolding, and trafficking. We sought to identify novel palmitoylated proteins in B lymphocytes using acyl-biotin exchange chemistry, coupled with differential analysis by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In total, we identified 57 novel palmitoylated protein candidates from human EBV-transformed lymphoid cells. Two of them, namely CD20 and CD23 (low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor), are immune regulators that are effective/potential therapeutic targets for haematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases and allergic disorders. Palmitoylation of CD20 and CD23 was confirmed by heterologous expression of alanine mutants coupled with bioorthogonal metabolic labeling. This study demonstrates a new subset of palmitoylated proteins in B cells, illustrating the ubiquitous role of protein palmitoylation in immune regulation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein S-acylation (or S-palmitoylation, hereafter referred to as palmitoylation) is a common post-translational modification covalently linking long-chain fatty acids (especially 16-carbon palmitic acid) to cysteine thiols in proteins via a labile thioester bond, which can be highly dynamic <xref rid="pone.0037187-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Protein acyltransferases and protein acylthioesterases regulate enzymatic cycling of palmitoylation of many proteins <xref rid="pone.0037187-Resh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Smotrys1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, providing a distinct pathway for precise regulation of membrane association. Palmitoylation facilitates membrane association of numerous soluble proteins, yet many palmitoylated proteins like ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, G-protein coupled receptors, and immune receptors are integral membrane proteins. For these transmembrane proteins, palmitoylation may act as more than a simple membrane tether. Indeed, palmitoylation has been shown to spatiotemporally regulate many cellular processes, including targeting to specific subcellular compartments or membrane subdomains, trafficking, protein-protein interactions, protein function and protein stability (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0037187-Resh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Resh2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Linder1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>). For many proteins, palmitoylation mediates lipid raft association <xref rid="pone.0037187-Levental1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which describes membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and signaling proteins <xref rid="pone.0037187-Lingwood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recently, Freeman and coworkers <xref rid="pone.0037187-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> provided proteomic evidence suggesting lipid rafts and tetraspanin-rich microdomains are enriched in specific palmitoylated proteins.</p>
      <p>The recent development of palmitoyl-protein enrichment methods has significantly advanced the study of palmitoylated proteins. Acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) <xref rid="pone.0037187-Drisdel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> is based on hydroxylamine selective cleavage of thioester bonds, followed by free thiol capture via a biotinylated thiol reagent. Biotinylated proteins are then purified by affinity on immobilized streptavidin. Using this approach, Roth <italic>et al.</italic> identified and validated 35 proteins out of 58 novel candidate yeast palmitoylated proteins <xref rid="pone.0037187-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Kang <italic>et al.</italic> extended this method to study whole rat brain, embryonic rat neurons or rat synaptosomes, confirming 21 novel palmitoylated proteins out of &gt;200 candidates <xref rid="pone.0037187-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Others have recently reported similar studies in african trypanosomes <xref rid="pone.0037187-Emmer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, human platelets <xref rid="pone.0037187-Dowal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and macrophages <xref rid="pone.0037187-Merrick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This approach was recently optimized to eliminate several manipulations by capturing hydroxylamine-sensitive cysteines using a thiol-reactive resin <xref rid="pone.0037187-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A second method utilizes the metabolic incorporation of a bioorthogonal palmitate analog into endogenous sites of palmitoylation, which may be subsequently conjugated <italic>in vitro</italic> with a tag such as biotin <xref rid="pone.0037187-Hang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Charron1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Recently, we used this technique to purify palmitoylated proteins from Jurkat T cells, identifying 125 high confidence and about 200 medium confidence potentially palmitoylated proteins <xref rid="pone.0037187-Martin2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Other studies by Hang's group used a similar approach to identify palmitoylated proteins in dendritic cells, identifying IFITM3 as an important palmitoylated protein involved in viral infection <xref rid="pone.0037187-Yount1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the diversity of palmitoylated proteins identified in each of these experiments, and the growing understanding of protein palmitoylation in immune regulation, we sought to identify novel palmitoylated proteins in B lymphocytes. Palmitoylated proteins from immortalized B lymphoid cells were enriched using ABE chemistry, and samples prepared with or without hydroxylamine treatment were compared by a semi-quantitative differential proteomic analysis based on spectral counting <xref rid="pone.0037187-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This analysis method sums the number of tandem mass (MS2) spectra for a protein, which has been demonstrated to be correlated with the relative protein abundance, and is widely accepted for the relative quantification of proteins between samples <xref rid="pone.0037187-Kislinger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Ferro1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This strategy led to the identification of 53 previously confirmed palmitoylated proteins and 95 candidate palmitoylated proteins, including numerous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Among these candidates, we focused on the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 and the low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor (CD23). These two surface proteins are important immune regulators with effective and/or potential therapeutic benefits when used as markers to deplete B lymphocytes in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, such as follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, or allergic disorders such as allergic asthma <xref rid="pone.0037187-Rosenwasser1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Barcellini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This study validates CD20 and CD23 as novel, B cell palmitoylated proteins.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>In order to identify potentially novel palmitoylated proteins from human B lymphoid cells, ABE experiments were performed following the protocol described by Drisdel and Green <xref rid="pone.0037187-Drisdel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thioester-containing proteins were distinguished from non-specifically enriched proteins by comparing samples treated in parallel with (HA+) or without (HAâ) hydroxylamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Three independent pairs of samples were prepared and analyzed by mass spectrometry. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> from all samples were merged, and this led to the identification of 493 non-redundant proteins identified by at least 2 unique peptides, 452 of which were present in the specific HA+ sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037187.s001">Table S1</xref>). Fifty-nine of the identified proteins were isoforms of MHC class I or class II proteins, which have in some cases been described as palmitoylated <xref rid="pone.0037187-Gruda1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Fifty-three previously confirmed palmitoylated proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037187.s001">Table S1</xref>), including the transferrin receptor, the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, flotillins 1 and 2, vesicular trafficking proteins (syntaxins 6, 7, 8 and 12, SNAP23), heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, and several members of the small GTPases ras family. All proteins present in the HA+ samples were plotted by their averaged normalized spectral count in HA+ (x-axis) and HAâ (y-axis) samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, most of the known palmitoylated proteins clustered along the x-axis (grey squares), as did the proteins later identified as palmitoylated candidates (see below; black circles).</p>

        <title>Identification of potentially novel palmitoylated proteins</title>
        <p>Putative palmitoylated proteins were partitioned into two groups: proteins exclusively identified in specific (HA+) samples, and proteins common to both control (HAâ) and HA+ samples.

Statistical analysis showed that proteins displaying a SpI higher than 0.54, representing most proteins from the right peak, were significantly enriched (p&lt;0.05) in the HA+ sample over the HAâ sample, and consequently annotated as putative thioester-containing proteins. As expected, the SpI distribution of previously confirmed palmitoylated proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0037187.s003">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g003">Figure 3</xref>, black bars) demonstrated a strong tendency to score high SpIs (close to +1).

        <p>In order to validate the palmitoylation of CD20 and CD23, we developed a heterologous expression system, where palmitoylation of these specific candidates was assessed by transient transfection of plasmids encoding CD20 and CD23 tagged with a C-terminal (His)<sub>6</sub> epitope. Additionally, in order to identify the palmitoylated cysteines in CD20 and CD23, we generated single point mutations in CD20 (C81A, C111A, C220A) and CD23 (C17A and C18A). As aberrant palmitoylation frequently occurs after mutating a cysteine in a context of neighbouring cysteines <xref rid="pone.0037187-Charollais1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Abrami1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, the corresponding CD20 and CD23 double mutations (C111A/C220A for CD20 and C17A/C18A for CD23) were also analyzed. The predicted topology of CD20 led us to build only the C111A/C220A CD20 double mutant <xref rid="pone.0037187-Ernst1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to unambiguously annotate CD20 and CD23 as novel palmitoylated proteins, transfected HEK-293T cells were metabolically labeled with 17-ODYA for palmitoylation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This orthogonal labeling approach uses metabolic labeling to attach a fatty acid analogue in native cells, providing an additional validation of protein palmitoylation. Flotillin-1, a well-established palmitoylated protein <xref rid="pone.0037187-Morrow1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, was used as a positive control. After labeling with 17-ODYA for 6 hours, cell membranes were mixed with rhodamine-azide, TCEP, TBTA, and copper sulphate under standard click chemistry conditions. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a fluorescent scanner to detect 17-ODYA labeled proteins. For each transfected protein, a hydroxylamine-sensitive fluorescent band appeared in the transfected samples, indicative of protein palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left panels). The identity of the fluorescent species was finally checked by western blot using an anti-His antibody, demonstrating alignment between unique fluorescent 17-ODYA labeled bands and the (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037187-g006">Figure 6</xref>, upper right panel). For all three proteins, one band only was detected at the expected size for the complete tagged protein, <italic>i.e.</italic> 51 kDa for flotillin-1, 37 kDa for CD20 and 43 kDa for CD23. Based on these results, we conclude that CD20 and CD23, like flotillin-1, are valid palmitoylated proteins measured by two distinct palmitoylation detection schemes.</p>

        <p>Mutational analysis also demonstrated that the C81A and C111A mutants of CD20, but not the C220A mutant, incorporated equivalent amounts of 17-ODYA, relative to their expression levels. The double mutant C111A/C220A completely eliminated 17-ODYA incorporation. Accordingly, CD20 is palmitoylated on its intracytoplasmic cysteines Cys<sup>111</sup> and/or Cys<sup>220</sup>. Single mutants (C17A, C18A) of CD23 did not reduce the incorporation of 17-ODYA, but the double mutant (C17A/C18A) completely abrogated the observed labeling. Therefore, CD23 is palmitoylated on either Cys<sup>17</sup> and/or Cys<sup>18</sup>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In order to identify novel palmitoylated proteins in human B lymphocytes, we used the ABE method <xref rid="pone.0037187-Drisdel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> followed by a semi-quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. The analysis of three independent purifications allowed us to identify 493 proteins from human B lymphoid cells, among which 53 were known palmitoylated proteins. These included flotillins-1 and -2, vesicular trafficking proteins, Ras-family GTPases, G-Î± subunits, kinases and receptors, similarly to previous proteomic studies <xref rid="pone.0037187-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Dowal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Merrick1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Candidate palmitoylated proteins were identified by semi-quantitative analysis using spectral counting approaches <xref rid="pone.0037187-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and comparison between samples prepared with or without hydroxylamine treatment. The calculation of a spectral index <xref rid="pone.0037187-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> led to the identification of 95 candidate palmitoylated proteins.</p>
      <p>Given the overlap with previous efforts to profile palmitoylated proteins in immune cells, we focused our interest on two proteins involved in the immune response, CD20 and CD23, which were both identified unambiguously as candidate palmitoylated proteins in the present study. Interestingly, CD20 and CD23 are both effective or promising targets for immunotherapy of haematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases or allergy disorders <xref rid="pone.0037187-Rosenwasser1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Barcellini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. CD20 expression is restricted to pre-B and mature B cells and regulates B cell activation and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0037187-Tedder1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. CD23, also known as the low affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E, is a transmembrane receptor expressed by various haematopoietic and epithelial cells that participates in tuning the immune response by regulating IgE production <xref rid="pone.0037187-Conrad1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CD20 and CD23 palmitoylation was validated by heterologous expression and metabolic labeling with the palmitate analog 17-ODYA. CD20 and CD23 palmitoylation sites were also assessed by systematic mutational analysis of intracytoplasmic or membrane-embedded cysteines <xref rid="pone.0037187-Charollais1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Bijlmakers1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Although the single mutations had no or only a limited effect on the protein palmitoylation, both double mutations C111A/C220A (in CD20) and C17A/C18A (in CD23) completely prevented this modification. This implies that the palmitoylation site in CD20 or in CD23 actually resides in the pairs of cysteines tested. It has been previously observed that single mutants in neighbouring cysteines could be palmitoylated because of aberrant modification of the remaining cysteines <xref rid="pone.0037187-Charollais1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Abrami1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. CD23 is clearly in this configuration of vicinal cysteines. Concerning CD20, Cys<sup>111</sup> belongs to the intracellular loop between the second and the third transmembrane domains, while Cys<sup>220</sup> is located in the C-terminal tail. Despite their distance in the primary sequence, they could nevertheless be in close proximity in the folded protein and behave like vicinal cysteines in these palmitoylation experiments. Our observation that the C220A mutation was more effective in reducing CD20 palmitoylation than did the C111A one, indicative of Cys<sup>220</sup> modification, was corroborated by previously published data. Indeed, the presence of post-translational modifications in the C-terminal region, such as phosphorylation or acylation, had been proposed, as the observed molecular weight of a CD20 C-terminal fragment resulting from protease digestion of intact cells was found to significantly exceed its expected size (21 kDa instead of 14; <xref rid="pone.0037187-Polyak1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>). Besides, Cys<sup>111</sup> is the only CD20 cysteine that is unique to humans and not conserved in the mouse CD20 sequence <xref rid="pone.0037187-Ernst1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, suggesting that palmitoylation of this residue is unlikely to be essential for CD20 function.</p>
      <p>Protein palmitoylation is a key regulatory mechanism for numerous cellular processes that include membrane targeting, segregation to membrane microdomains (<italic>i.e.</italic> lipid rafts), protein stability, protein-protein interactions or cellular signaling <xref rid="pone.0037187-Resh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Resh2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Linder1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Because CD20 and CD23 are both associated to cellular signaling cascades and display multiple interactions with immune actors such as the B cell receptor or the complement receptor CD21 <xref rid="pone.0037187-Conrad1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037187-Aubry1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0037187-Acharya1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, their respective palmitoylation might be one of the switches involved in the tuning of CD20 or CD23 immune activity and in the cell response to anti-CD20 or anti-CD23 immunotherapy.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our analysis of the B lymphocyte palmitoyl-proteome led to the selection and validation of the two immune regulators CD20 and CD23 as B cell novel palmitoylated proteins. These results open the way to future studies aiming at deciphering the role of CD20 and CD23 palmitoylation in immune activation and in cellular responses to B cell directed immuno-, radioimuno- or chemoimmunotherapies.</p>

Then, proteins were extracted by methanol-chloroform precipitation. Resolubilized proteins were incubated successively with NEM for blockade of free thiols, and with hydroxylamine (HA+ sample) to release the thioester-linked palmitate and restore the modified cysteines to thiols. Formerly thioester-containing (mainly palmitoylated) proteins were biotinylated using a thiol-reactive biotinylation reagent (EZ-Link biotin-HPDP) and finally captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin). Specifically bound proteins were eluted by Î²-mercaptoethanol reduction of the protein-biotin disulfide linkage. An essential control of non-specific biotinylation and binding to the streptavidin matrix consisted in replacing hydroxylamine by 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, in half of the NEM-treated sample (HAâ sample).</p>
