      <abstract>
        <p>Centrosomes together with the mitotic spindle ensure the faithful distribution of chromosomes between daughter cells, and spindle orientation is a major determinant of cell fate during tissue regeneration. Spindle defects are not only an impetus of chromosome instability but are also a cause of developmental disorders involving defective asymmetric cell division. In this work, we demonstrate BCCIP, especially BCCIPÎ±, as a previously unidentified component of the mitotic spindle pole and the centrosome. We demonstrate that BCCIP localizes proximal to the mother centriole and participates in microtubule organization and then redistributes to the spindle pole to ensure faithful spindle architecture. We find that BCCIP depletion leads to morphological defects, disoriented mitotic spindles, chromosome congression defects and delayed mitotic progression. Our study identifies BCCIP as a novel factor critical for microtubule regulation and explicates a mechanism utilized by BCCIP in tumor suppression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During mitosis, both the faultless segregation of newly duplicated chromosomes and the proper positioning of daughter cells require an elegant mitotic apparatus, a complex microtubule-based protein machine organized in a bipolar fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The assembly of the mitotic apparatus occurs <italic>de novo</italic> once, and only once, per cell cycle and requires a high level of cooperation between microtubules, centrosomes, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Factors that compromise the reliability of the mitotic apparatus cause aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer and the rate-limiting step in tumorigenic transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Faithful spindle assembly is critical not only for chromosome distribution but also for the three-dimensional orientation of the spindle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Mitotic spindle orientation is regulated by the interplay between centrosomes, microtubules and molecular motors, and it is critical for stem cell polarity and tissue regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> This pathway also plays a pivotal role in cell division-directed differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> In addition, a link between the fidelity of spindle orientation and tumor formation has been recognized in the context of cancer stem cell renewal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Thus, the characterization of factors, which destabilize the mitotic apparatus, is not only of importance to understand the nature of aneuploid diseases, such as cancer, but also for stem cell renewal, tissue development and regeneration.</p>
      <p>The principal microtubule organizing center of the cell is known as the centrosome. It consists of an orthogonal pair of centrioles enveloped by a mesh of an electron-dense material known as the pericentriolar matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>One centriole, known as the mother centriole, is one full cell cycle older than its counterpart and contains unique protein complexes responsible for organizing the cellâs microtubule network into a single point-like focus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> This function, known as microtubule anchoring, is strictly associated with the mother centriole and is paramount for directing cell polarity, shape and motility as well as orienting the cell axis during division.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> During mitosis, centrosomes play an integral role in chromosome capture by nucleating soluble tubulin subunits into the polymeric microtubules that comprise the spindle. Following microtubule nucleation, centrosomes are focused by a series of motor proteins into two distinct spindle poles containing a meshwork of microtubule regulators. The focusing of each centrosome into a distinct spindle pole matrix is thought to increase spindle tension and chromosome segregation fidelity by transducing negative-end motor force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Among these constituents, the minus-end directed motor dynein, is vital for pole establishment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Dynein activities are regulated through its processivity factor, dynactin, a component also found in the mother centriole that regulates the centrosomeâs microtubule anchoring and stabilizing capabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Dynein/dynactin also cooperate with minus-end MAPs, such as NuMa, which sequester, stabilize and bundle microtubules at the poles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Thus, the interplay between centrosomes, molecular motors and MAPs is intimately linked to ensure faithfulness of mitosis.</p>
      <p>BCCIP was initially identified as a BRCA2 and p21 interacting protein and is essential for cell viability in mice and budding yeast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Despite a high degree of evolutionary conservation across all eukaryotes, the structure and function of the BCCIP gene is not fully understood. Canonically, BCCIP is thought to regulate DNA damage response, suppress spontaneous DNA damage and modulate the G1/S transition through the cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Concurrently, this view of BCCIP has also been expanded to include roles in cytoskeletal rearrangement, ribosome biogenesis and nuclear export.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> In <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, two major BCCIP isoforms that result from alternative splicing exist, designated as BCCIPÎ± (322 amino acids) and BCCIPÎ² (314aa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> These two isoforms share an identical conserved domain spanning ~258aa but are diversified by unique C termini.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Thus, it is likely that in humans BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ² have evolved to further specify the function of the sole BCCIP gene present in other eukaryotes. BCCIP loss has been implicated in numerical chromosome instability and polyploidization, and partial and non-permanent loss of BCCIP can spur tumorigenesis in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In this work we demonstrate that BCCIP, especially BCCIPÎ±, associates with centrosomes, spindle poles and the mitotic cell cortex. We identify BCCIP as a new component of the centrosome and the mitotic spindle pole, and functions in regulating microtubule anchoring, microtubule stability, spindle architecture and spindle orientation. These newly identified functions appear to be independent of BCCIPâs role in DNA damage response. Our work not only identifies a critical component of the mother centriole that plays a role in interphase microtubule organization but also in dynein/dynactin-mediated spindle assembly. These data suggest an additional mechanism by which BCCIP contributes to not only genomic stability but also to organismal development.</p>

        <title>Preferential localization of BCCIP to the mother centriole</title>
        <p>BRCA2 and BRCA1 are <italic>bona-fide</italic> components of the microtubule-organizing center, and BCCIP has been demonstrated to interact with BRCA2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> In HT1080 cells, we observed a clear localization of BCCIP in both the interphase centrosome and the mitotic spindle poles as judged by BCCIP colocalization with Î³-tubulin or Î±-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Interestingly, during late prophase, immunofluorescent staining revealed that the concentration of centrosomal BCCIP was enhanced relative to interphase cells and that BCCIP appeared to expand its presence to the crescent-shaped spindle pole matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The specificity of the BCCIP antibody was fully validated by western blots, antigen absorption followed by immunofluorescent staining (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1a and b</xref>), and the localization of BCCIP to centrosomes was confirmed with several independent antibodies in different human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1c-e</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm these observations, we first purified centrosomes through use of sucrose gradient centrifugation. Following ultracentrifugation, gradient fractions were collected and the centrosome-enriched fraction was verified by immunoblotting for the centrosome markers Î³-tubulin, Aurora-A and CDC2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, the centrosome fractions were devoid of the cytosolic and nuclear markers (GAPDH and PCNA), but enriched with several centrosome components (Î³-tubulin, Aurora-A and CDC2), as well as BCCIP. Furthermore, when the centrosome fraction was centrifuged through a glycerol cushion onto a coverslip and stained for the centrosome markers PLK1 and Î³-tubulin, we observed that BCCIP, but not CoxIV (a non-centrosome protein), was retained within the centrosome complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p>
        <p>In interphase cells, we noticed that BCCIP tended to be co-enriched with EB1 within one centriole, and was relatively reduced within its cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In order to quantitate this phenomenon, we acquired 0.2 micron centrosome Z-stacks and measured the fluorescent intensities of Î³-tubulin, BCCIP or EB1 within each centriole. We then calculated the protein fluorescent intensity ratio between the paired EB1-high (mother) and EB1-low (daughter) centrioles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, the distribution of Î³-tubulin between the paired centrioles was relatively identical, with an average ratio and standard error values of 1.05Â±0.02 (<italic>n</italic>=46). However, the EB1 and BCCIP ratios between the same centriole pairs demonstrated values of 1.56Â±0.08 and 1.78Â±0.17, respectively,both significantly higher than that of Î³-tubulin (<italic>P</italic>=6.8E-08, 8.5E-05, respectively, Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test). These results suggest that BCCIP exhibits a localization bias within EB1-enriched mother centrioles. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the centrosome complex revealed that BCCIP sheathed, but did not overlap the appendage marker EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movie M1</xref>), which suggests that BCCIP is not a subdistal appendage component, but is more likely a physical tether between the microtubule minus-end and the subdistal appendages. Altogether, these data firmly establish that BCCIP is a component of the centrosome and mitotic spindle pole, and that most of BCCIP is confined proximal to, but not within, the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole in interphase.</p>

        <title>The human-specific BCCIPÎ± is the dominant centrosome and spindle pole-associated isoform, but this association is mediated through a shared domain between BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ²</title>
        <p>Human cells express two isoforms of BCCIP created by alternative splicing, designated as BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ².<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> These two isoforms are largely identical with the exception of a variable C terminus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> This discrepancy led us to ask the question whether human cells exhibited isoform-specific localization patterns. To address this question we expressed YFP-BCCIPÎ± or YFP-BCCIPÎ² in cells, and were surprised to notice that BCCIPÎ± clearly associated with spindle poles and fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), while BCCIPÎ² only weakly appeared on spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Next, we examined the distribution and retention of BCCIP isoforms in the centrosome complex after treatments with buffers of increasing ionic strength (see Materials and Methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, BCCIPÎ± was more abundant than BCCIPÎ² in the centrosome preparation. Although both isoforms could be removed from the centrosome complex with weak detergents, BCCIPÎ± appeared to be more resistant to extraction than BCCIPÎ². In contrast, core centrosome components, such as Î³-tubulin and HSP90, could only be removed with harsher chaotropic reagents, as previously demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Taken together, these results demonstrate that in human cells both isoforms of BCCIP are capable of associating with the centrosome and the spindle pole, but BCCIPÎ± is the more dominant isoform. Intriguingly, the sole BCCIP isoform in mice, which resembles human BCCIPÎ², can fully localize to spindle poles endogenously in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1d</xref>), and when transiently expressed in human cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1e</xref>). These findings suggest that humans have likely evolved a preferred spindle pole-associated BCCIP isoform but in the absence of BCCIPÎ±, BCCIPÎ² (or BCCIPÎ²-like homologs) demonstrates a comparable localization to centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles.</p>
        <p>Next, we sought to determine the domain that mediated the localization of BCCIP to the spindle pole. To answer this question, we transiently expressed a panel of shRNA-resistant YFP-BCCIP fragments in BCCIP knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>). We observed that the smallest fragment capable of binding to the spindle pole spanned amino acids 111â257, which contains a putative and conserved coiled coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Deletion of either the coiled coil (BCCIP-SR3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) or the region upstream of the coiled coil (BCCIP-Î2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) markedly reduced the association of BCCIP with the spindle pole. Interestingly, although BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ² have distinct C termini,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> loss of the C terminus of BCCIPÎ± had no effect on spindle pole localization. These data imply that the unique C terminal of BCCIPÎ± does not promote its association with the spindle pole, but rather it is likely that C-terminus elements found in BCCIPÎ² restrict its binding, consistent with the finding that the sole mouse BCCIP isoform is able to localize to the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1d and e</xref>).</p>

        <title>BCCIP is recruited to the spindle pole matrix and centrosome by microtubules and dynein/dynactin activity</title>
        <p>The spindle pole matrix consists of a meshwork of microtubules, centrosomes, MAPs and molecular motors and depends on an intact microtubule network together with retrograde motor transport for assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Conversely, centrosome core components are associated with the centrosome constitutively and do not depend on microtubule flux.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> The observation that BCCIP localized to both interphase centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) prompted us to determine whether the localization of BCCIP was dependent on microtubules. To answer this question, we first challenged cells with nocodoazole, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, or taxol, a drug that inhibits the disassembly of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We observed that nocodazole completely disassembled the spindle, reducing centrosomes to their respective centrioles, and eliminated most but not all of the endogenous BCCIP signal at the centrosome as visualized by colocalization with either Î±-tubulin or Î³-tubulin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, middle row). Alternatively, taxol induced the formation of multiple psuedo-asters and abolished the tight association of the centrosomes with the minus-end of the spindle. We observed that in this condition BCCIP was strongly recruited to the taxol-stabilized microtubule bundles, but largely lost from the centrosomes (lower panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Identical results were reproduced by YFP-tagged BCCIPÎ± (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). Next, we recapitulated these results biochemically by precipitating microtubules from mitotic lysates with taxol and observed that both BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ² were enriched in the taxol-treated microtubule pellet fraction, but not in the nocodazole-treated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, transiently expressed YFP-BCCIPÎ± and YFP-BCCIP (aa111-257), but not YFP alone, had equal affinity to microtubules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>), confirming a requirement for this domain to associate with the spindle pole.</p>
        <p>We then reasoned that because the deposition of BCCIP to the poles required an intact microtubule network, BCCIP might be localized through the activities of the major minus-end motor protein dynein/dynactin, a multiprotein complex comprised of at least seven subunits, including p150 glued and Arp-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> In order to test this hypothesis, we performed a GST pulldown of mitotic cell lysates with BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ², and GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Intriguingly, BCCIPÎ±, but not BCCIPÎ² or GST itself, was sufficient to pull down the dynactin components, p150 glued and Arp-1, and dynactin and BCCIP were associated with a complex that contained centrosomal Î³-tubulin and Î±/Î²-tubulin dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In addition, BCCIP and p150 glued colocalized proximal to the mother centriole during interphase, as well as the spindle pole and cortex during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>
        <p>Last, to determine whether dynein activity was required for proper BCCIP targeting during mitosis, we incubated cells with the dynein-specific inhibitor Ciliobrevin-D. In this condition we observed that the normally compact focus of BCCIP at the spindle poles was broadened and increased compared to the control, suggesting that dynein motility plays a critical role in deposition of BCCIP in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3e and f</xref>). To recapitulate this finding genetically we overexpressed the p50/dynamitin subunit of dynactin, which results in a well-characterized dominant-negative dispersion of the dynactin complex and subsequent inhibition of the retrograde transport of dynactin cargo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> We found that transient overexpression of the dynactin subunit p50/dynamitin markedly disrupted the spindle pole-associated BCCIP fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3g and h</xref>), suggesting a model where BCCIP associates with dynein/dynactin in a microtubule-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>BCCIP is required for the microtubule organization at the spindle pole and centrosome</title>
        <p>The formation of the microtubule array is comprised of the following three independent but interconnected steps: first the nucleation of nascent tubulin by Î³-tubulin complexes, second the elongation, stabilization and minus-end capping of the microtubule polymer by minus-end-associated MAPs, and third the anchoring of the growing microtubule to the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> We then hypothesized that constitutively associated centrosome fraction of BCCIP might be involved in the regulation of minus-end microtubule dynamics, given that BCCIP also associates with microtubules. In order to test this hypothesis, a microtubule regrowth experiment was performed. We first treated mitotic cells with nocodazole over ice to depolymerize microtubules followed by washout with prewarmed media to promote microtubule regrowth. We observed no remarkable difference in the microtubule nucleation stage of regrowth (5-min recovery) in BCCIP-deficient cells. Consistent with this finding, levels of the microtubule nucleating factors Î³-tubulin and pericentrin were identical at the poles in control and BCCIP knockdown cells (data not shown). Despite this result, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">b</xref>, after 30âmin of recovery, while most of the control cells were able to form a well-focused bipolar spindle, BCCIP-deficient spindles remained unorganized and contained a diminished amount of spindle microtubules. To further confirm this finding, we then filmed GFP-tubulin expressing control and BCCIP knockdown cells after overnight treatment with nocodazole and a 1-h cold shock. We observed that following recovery, a bipolar spindle was re-established at roughly 40âmin in control cells, whereas this number was increased to 70âmin (<italic>P</italic>=0.033) in BCCIP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). These data strongly demonstrate that BCCIP deficiency compromises spindle assembly independent of microtubule nucleation.</p>
        <p>Next, because BCCIP is localized to proximal to the mother centriole and binds dynactin, a microtubule-anchoring factor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> we hypothesized that the interphase centrosomal fraction of BCCIP might be involved in microtubule organization. In order to test this hypothesis, we then seeded a mixture of GFP-tagged BCCIP knockdown and wild-type (GFP negative) cells onto the same coverslip, and verified that the BCCIP normal and BCCIP knockdown cells could be readily distinguished based on the GFP signals on the same slide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Cells were then treated identically to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>. This approach was adapted to eliminate potential sampling bias due to the fast nature of microtubule regrowth in interphase cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4e and f</xref>, asters of roughly equal intensity formed in both control and BCCIP-deficient cells at 2âmin, demonstrating that BCCIP depletion does not impact centrosome nucleation, mirroring our findings during mitosis. However, at 5âmin after recovery, the microtubule intensity around each centrosome was significantly reduced in BCCIP-deficient cells. This delayed reformation of microtubule was recovered by 20 minutes, but in this state we observed that a significant portion of BCCIP-deficient cells exhibited abnormal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, 20âmin), and lacked a sharply focused radial array of centrosome microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4g and h</xref>). These data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4dâh</xref>) suggest that interphasic BCCIP-deficient cells are defective in organizing microtubules, and suggest that BCCIP fulfills a role in the regulation of microtubule anchorage/organization.</p>

        <title>BCCIP deficiency reduces tubulin acetylation</title>
        <p>Microtubule growth from the centrosome is a multistep process that involves the coordination of nucleating complexes, minus-end-associated MAPs and centrosomal anchoring proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Because the organization of centrosomal microtubules was affected by BCCIP depletion, we theorized that BCCIP might also have a microtubule stabilizing role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Such a case has previously been observed in the p150 subunit of dynactin, an anchoring factor that also regulates microtubule stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> K-40 acetyl-tubulin has been regarded as a surrogate marker for stable microtubules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> and thus we chose to examine the K-40 acetylation status in control and BCCIP-deficient cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, BCCIP loss resulted in a loss of K-40 acetyl-tubulin in both BCCIP knockdown HeLa cells and in MEF cells where BCCIP had been deleted. To verify the reduction of acetyl-tubulin in BCCIP knockdown cells, control and BCCIP knockdown HeLa cells were mixed at 1:1 ratio and costained with acetyl-tubulin and BCCIP on the same slide. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, the BCCIP-deficient cells (with weak green signals) had a significantly lower level of acetyl-tubulin (red signal) than the BCCIP-proficient cells (with strong green signals and arrowed) had in the same field.</p>
        <p>To further address which specific isoform of BCCIP resulted in a loss of acetyl-tubulin, we then expressed shRNA-resistant YFP-BCCIPÎ±, YFP-BCCIPÎ² or YFP in BCCIP knockdown cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> for representative images), and compared the relative intensity of acetyl-tubulin with the knockdown or control cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, the BCCIP knockdown cells demonstrated reduced levels of acetyl-tubulin compared to wild-type cells. YFP-BCCIPÎ±, but not YFP-BCCIPÎ² or YFP, was capable of recovering this marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These data suggest that BCCIP, particularly BCCIPÎ±, confers microtubule stability.</p>

        <title>Spindle defects in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>Dynein, dynactin and spindle pole auxiliary proteins, such as NuMa, play an essential role in mitosis by regulating spindle length, architecture and positioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> The association between BCCIP and dynactin components, together with the spindle pole localization of BCCIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), led us to ask the question whether BCCIP loss resulted in mitotic spindle defects. First we investigated the architecture of the mitotic spindle in BCCIP-deficient cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, the spindles in BCCIP-deficient HeLa cells appeared bipolar, but collapsed, leading to a reduced pole-to-pole distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Close examination of the minus end of BCCIP-deficient spindles revealed a broadening at the poles, and the normally sharp focus at the minus end of the spindle was stretched in BCCIP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Additionally the spindle arc angle (see orange arc in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> cartoon), or the angle between the distal points of the spindle microtubules, was significantly widened at the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and c</xref>) and spindle pole components were stretched and splayed in BCCIP-deficient cells (see green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> cartoon, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). These defects were also observed in BCCIP knockout MEF cells, which displayed a similar spindle pole broadening phenotype and exhibited extreme spindle pole fragmentation (bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). These abnormalities canonically match defects in microtubule focusing and the phenotype that results from loss of dynein/dynactin/NuMa-associated activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup></p>

        <title>Disorientation of spindles in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>Dynein/dynactin cooperates with spindle pole components such as NuMa to direct motor force from the spindle pole to the cell cortex, which in turn properly orients the spindle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> This process plays a critical role in the fate of nascent cells during tissue regeneration and maintains stemness during asymmetric cell division.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> We hypothesized that, because the dynein network plays an essential role in spindle orientation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> BCCIP silencing might confer similar defects. In order to test this hypothesis, we immunostained cells for pericentrin and analyzed 0.2 micron Z-stacks of the spindle poles with respect to the Petri dish plane. Next, we calculated the three-dimensional tilt of mitotic spindles using the geometrics illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>. We observed that control metaphase cells typically exhibited a small spindle angle, and cells were oriented so that division occurred completely parallel to the culture dish surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). As demonstrated in the representative images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), the two spindle poles (pericentrin foci) of control cells reached maximum intensity within the same confocal plane, indicating that both poles exhibited a limited angle between them. In stark contrast to the control cells, the BCCIP-deficient cells exhibited pericentrin foci that resided in two distant confocal planes. Representative 3D images of spindle orientation can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movies M3 and M4</xref>. As quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, the spindle angles of BCCIP-deficient spindles were significantly increased in comparison to those in the control, suggesting that the BCCIP deficiency imparts spindle orientation defects. In order to determine whether this phenotype was specifically induced by loss of BCCIPÎ±, we then performed a rescue experiment by re-expressing shBCCIP-resistant flag-BCCIPÎ±, BCCIPÎ² or empty vector in BCCIP knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, bottom three rows). We observed that the defect in spindle orientation was largely rescued by BCCIPÎ± expression but not by BCCIPÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movies M5âM7</xref>), confirming that it is the BCCIPÎ± isoform that is required for maintaining proper spindle orientation. These spindle orientation defects were further verified by time-lapse imaging, which revealed that a significant portion of BCCIP-deficient cells completed division in a manner in which one daughter cell tended to reside outside the focal plane of its cohort (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6a</xref>).</p>
        <p>A fraction of mitotic dynein/dynactin is deposited to the cell cortex, and this deposition is essential to produce the motor force that buttresses and orients the spindle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The abnormal organization of the mitotic spindle in BCCIP-deficient cells together with the cortical localization of BCCIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) led us to ask the question whether cortical dynactin was mislocalized in BCCIP-deficient mitotic cells. We first observed that BCCIP-deficient spindles were often severely displaced from their normal central distribution within the mitotic cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S6b and c</xref>), which is indicative of astral microtubule defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Next, we investigated whether this phenotype was concomitant with misdistribution of cortical dynactin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, BCCIP-deficient cells demonstrated a decreased level of dynactin at the cell cortex. Thus, it is likely that the disorganization of the microtubule network in BCCIP-deficient cells also results in aberrant trafficking of dynein/dynactin and displaces it from the cortex, which in turn leads to spindle orientation defects.</p>

        <title>Lagging chromosomes and reduced kinetochore tension in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>Mitotic chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate before the onset of anaphase. This alignment is critical for ensuring the equivalent distribution of sister chromatids into two identical daughter cells. Spindle pole focusing defects have been demonstrated to impair chromosome congression as a result of displacing pole-directed motor force, and silencing of the dynein epistasis group leads to decreased spindle tension, chromosome congression defects and delayed mitotic completion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> Inspection of the mitotic chromosomes in BCCIP-deficient metaphase cells demonstrated that 24% (10 out of 41) knockdown cells contained lagging chromosomes; chromatin bodies completely disassociated from the metaphase plate. These lagging chromosomes were undetected among the control cells (0 out of 52). Next, in order to quantify chromosome alignment, we measured the chromosome congression indexâa representation of the cellâs ability to capture and move chromosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> We found that BCCIP knockdown significantly increased the congression index, indicating poor metaphase chromosome alignment. These chromosome congression defects were rescued by re-expression of RNAi-resistant BCCIP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8a and b</xref>). We then reasoned that these defects could be resultant from two distinct possibilitiesâdefective poleward pulling forces or defective kinetochore microtubule attachments. We first measured spindle tension, which represents the ability of the cell to generate the robust poleward pulling forces necessary to move chromosomes. Spindleâkinetochore tension can be represented by the distance between sister kinetochore pairs; the greater the distance between sister kinetochore foci the greater the amount of tension transduced by the spindle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Therefore, we utilized the distance between sister kinetochores as a surrogate for spindle tension, using the well-established method of Waters <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> We observed a significant decrease in the distance between sister chromatid CREST foci in BCCIP knockdown HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8c and d</xref>) and U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S7a and b</xref>), demonstrating that BCCIP deficiency compromises robust pulling forces, which is consistent with the notion that BCCIP functions in coordination with dynein/dynactin/NuMa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> We then challenged BCCIP-deficient and control cells with a 10-min cold shock using the reported procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> This procedure is sufficient to destabilize all microtubules except kinetochore-associated microtubules (stable k-fibers), unless these attachments were rendered unstable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> This assay revealed no change to k-fiber stability in BCCIP-deficient cells (data not shown), indicating that microtubuleâkinetochore attachments occur normally during BCCIP silencing.

        <title>Delayed completion of mitosis in BCCIP-deficient cells</title>
        <p>We then predicted that the defects in spindle and chromosome geometry in BCCIP-deficient cells might lead to impaired mitotic progression. To verify this, we utilized the reversible CDK-1 inhibitor RO-3306 to synchronize BCCIP-deficient and BCCIP-competent cells at the G2/M boundary overnight. Following incubation, cells were released from the block, and fixed stepwise at different time points following the release. Mitotic cells were judged by staining with the pre-anaphase marker pH3-T11, which is rapidly dephosphorylated upon anaphase onset. We observed that BCCIP deficient and control cells entered mitosis at roughly the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>), suggesting that mitotic entry is not impeded by BCCIP loss, which is consistent with a previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> However, at the 90- and 120-min time points following release from the block, control cells roughly returned to their baseline levels of mitosis while BCCIP knockdown cells remained in M-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). These data demonstrate that BCCIP-deficient cells have a delay in mitosis, and that this delay occurs during metaphase. To verify this finding, we performed a similar experiment, but substituted RO-3306 by nocodazole to block cells in mitosis, collected lysates from control and knockdown cells after drug washout and subjected the lysates to western blot for cyclin-B, another mitotic marker that is rapidly degraded upon anaphase onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>, levels of cyclin-B level peaked at 0â30âmin and thereafter sharply decreased in control cells, whereas in knockdown cells the peak cyclin B fractions shifted between 30 and 60âmin and reduced at a slower rate. We then used live-cell imaging to determine the precise defects observed in BCCIP-depleted cells. We generated stably expressing GFP-tubulin cell lines and observed the duration of mitosis from nuclear envelope breakdown to the formation of a visible mid-body. Cells were then transduced with empty control lentiviral particles or particles expressing shRNAs specific to BCCIP. We observed that the mitotic time was significantly extended in knockdown cells, and re-expression of BCCIPÎ±, but not BCCIPÎ² or empty vector, could largely rescue the extended mitotic time in the BCCIP knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). Representative time-lapse images for mitosis are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Movies M8A, B and M9A, B</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further confirm that the mitotic delay experienced by BCCIP-deficient cells was specifically due to improper spindle assembly, we disassembled spindle microtubules with nocodazole treatment and cold shock, washed the drug away with warm media and immediately began filming cells at 37âÂ°C. Again, we found that BCCIP-deficient cells took longer time than the control to complete mitosis after recovery from disassembly of the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e</xref>). Therefore, the mitotic delay experienced by BCCIP-deficient cells is dependent on proper spindle assembly.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we identify BCCIP, especially BCCIPÎ±, as a novel MAP that localizes to the interphase centrosome and the mitotic spindle poles. We conclude that BCCIP is critical for microtubule organizing and anchoring activities during interphase, and this function is later co-opted to organize and stabilize the spindle pole during mitosis. In the absence of BCCIP, the interphasic microtubule network fails to maintain its normal association with the centrosome, leading to a general disorganization and destabilization of microtubule arrays, concomitant with an increase of morphologically abnormal cells and decreased acetyl-tubulin. This observation is consistent with BCCIPâs association with p150 glued/dynactin and localization to the mother centriole. During mitosis, the microtubule-binding abilities of BCCIP are directed by the minus-end motor dynein to coordinate the microtubuleâs minus end with the centrosome in order to generate spindle tension. These observations are consistent with the collapsed, defocused spindles observed during BCCIP silencing, which display decreased bivalent distance and are sequestered in mitosis. It is important to note that these defects are a phenocopy silencing of the dynein/dynactin/NuMa epistasis group. The totality of this evidence coupled with the physical association of BCCIP with dynactin suggests that these proteins lie within the same pathway.</p>
      <p>The coordinated activity of molecular motors with minus-end MAPs is required to focus microtubule minus ends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Silencing of dynein, dynactin, as well as spindle pole MAPs, such as NuMA, results in spindle splaying, lagging chromosomes and delayed mitotic progression in cultured cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Genetic deletion of these factors in vertebrates results in embryonic lethality and/or aneuploidy, suggesting that this network is essential for both the rapid cell divisions that characterize embryonic development and for the maintenance of genome integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> We suggest that the microtubule organizing function of BCCIP acts as a safeguard against tumorigenesis and its loss is another root cause of the excessive level of aneuploidy observed in BCCIP-deficient cells by previous works.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup></p>
      <p>During development, cell division is critical for regulating not only cell number but also cell diversity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Although symmetric cell division facilitates rapid clonal expansion, asymmetric division is responsible for cell lineage diversification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> For example, vertebrate neurogenesis is heralded by a sequence of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions exquisitely orchestrated to generate the remarkable cellular diversity and complex tissue architecture of the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Consequently, defects in genes that regulate the orientation of the mitotic spindle and the fidelity of the centrosome are endemic to human brain diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Among the most prominent is primary microcephaly, a condition that results in an abnormally small brain and other neurological disorders. Remarkably, all identified microcephaly genes are centrosome and mitotic spindle regulators, and their knockdown in both cultured cells and in mice induces abnormal organization of interphase microtubule arrays and mitotic defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> We have previously observed that BCCIP knockdown leads to microcephaly and altered cell differentiation in the neural cortex in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> and therefore the propose that the microcephaly experienced in BCCIP-deficient mice may be related in part to defective asymmetric division.</p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that of two BCCIP isoforms, BCCIPÎ± is the predominant centrosome and microtubule-associated isoform. Despite this observation, the recruitment of BCCIPÎ± to spindle poles is dependent on amino acids 111â257, a region shared by both BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ². It is of note that this domain predicts a highly conserved coiled coil, a major structural motif responsible for pericentriolar matrix anchoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> We demonstrate that BCCIPÎ± is the predominant isoform that associates with the spindle and centrosome <italic>in vivo</italic>, yet the C-terminal domains that diversify BCCIPÎ± from BCCIPÎ² have little role in spindle targeting. This is consistent with the observation that in mouse cells where BCCIPÎ± is not available, the BCCIPÎ²-like isoform of BCCIP localizes to the centrosome and spindle poles in an identical manner to human BCCIPÎ±. Despite this observation, in nearly all of our biochemical experiments, we were able to detect an association of human BCCIPÎ² with spindle components following cell lysis, which supports the notion that the inhibition of targeting of BCCIPÎ² to the centrosome may only be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>, and is possibly influenced by transacting elements that are lost after the cell lysis during biochemical manipulation.</p>
      <p>In summary, our study has established BCCIP as a previously unidentified regulator of spindle assembly that cooperates with the dynein epistatic group to ensure the fidelity of mitosis. Our data not only describe a new functional aspect of the BCCIP gene but also expand the list of factors critical for mitotic progression, spindle orientation and microtubule organizing.</p>

The resulting double-stranded nucleotide was cloned into the vectors through the XbaI and EcoRI sites, resulting in H1P-shBCCIP552-GFP and H1P-shBCCIP552-Pur. In this construct, the BCCIP shRNA expression is under the control of the hH1P promoter, and the expressed shRNA targets the common region of 5â²GGCCUUCUCCUAAGUGAAAGA3â² starting at location 552nt in the BCCIPÎ± and BCCIPÎ² RNAs.

        <p>Because the shRNA expressed from the lentivirus was designed to target the BCCIP mRNA at the following site: GGGCCUUCUCCUAAGUGAAAGA, transgenic RNAi-resistant constructs were created by mutating four nucleotides in the shRNA-targeted region of BCCIP cDNA to 5â²-GGGCTTCTGCTCAGCGAAAGA-3â². This produces silent point mutations in the BCCIP cDNAs (designated BCCIPÎ±<sup>M4</sup>, and BCCIPÎ²<sup>M4</sup>), which codes for exogenous BCCIP that is resistant to shRNA targeted at the same site of the endogenous BCCIP. In this study, we express these shBCCIP552-resistant BCCIPÎ±<sup>M4</sup> and BCCIPÎ²<sup>M4</sup> variants in BCCIP knockdown cells in order to test which BCCIP isoform can rescue the defects caused by BCCIP knockdown and to rule out off-target effect.</p>

        <p>In order to reliably and quantitatively compare the intensity of fluorescent signals between cells of two different genotypes, we co-seeded cells of two different genotypes at a 1:1 ratio, and proceeded with immunofluorescent staining. For example, in order to quantitatively compare acetyl-tubulin intensity between BCCIP knockdown and knockdown cells complemented with exogenous YFP-BCCIPÎ±, YFP-BCCIPÎ± expressing cells (green cells) were mixed with BCCIP knockdown cells (no color). The mixed cells were grown to 80% confluency, extracted with T-BRB80 and fixed in fresh paraformaldehyde. Microscope fields containing both YFP-expressing (complemented) and YFP-negative cells were imaged for acetyl-tubulin intensity, using the Ã 60 objective of a Nikon eclipse TS100 microscope. Only images containing both cell types (as confirmed by BCCIP staining or GFP markers) were scored. This procedure uses stringent internal control within the same individual slides and allows us to eliminate any potential discrepancy that may be associated with variation of staining and image acquisition procedures. On each image, the polygon tool in Image-J was utilized to measure the fluorescent intensity in the cells containing high levels of BCCIP to cells where BCCIP staining was not visible. Fluorescent intensity was calculated using the following formula (Fluorescent intensity=Integrated Density â (Area of selected Ã Mean fluorescence of background readings). Intensities of &gt;100 cells were quantified for each cell type, the fluorescent intensity of all slides was pooled, and subjected to Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test to determine the statistical significance.

        <p>HT1080 or U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-tubulin were transduced with H1P-shBCCIP522-Pur lentiviral particles or control lentivirus. Cells were transferred to an incubated microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M) and filmed every 5âmin using the Ã 20 objective overnight. The duration of mitosis was quantified by the disappearance of the nuclear envelope to the presence of a visible mid-body. In some experiments, cells were challenged by 1âmg/ml nocodazole overnight, chilled on ice for 1âh the next day, and mitotic cells were filmed following three washes in prewarmed media. Spindle bipolarity onset was quantified by measuring the amount of time cells took to assemble a well-defined metaphase spindle.</p>

        <p>BCCIP binds to microtubules and is recruited to spindle poles by dynein/dynactin activity. (<bold>a</bold>) The localization of BCCIP to spindle poles requires microtubules. U2OS cells were treated with nocodazole or taxol and were co-stained with BCCIP and Î³-tubulin (left group) or with BCCIP and Î±-tubulin (right group). When the spindle is depolymerized by nocodazole, Î±-tubulin stains the nocodazole-resistant centriole microtubules. The arrows indicate the small fraction of BCCIP that remains stably associated with centrosomes following treatments. (<bold>b</bold>) BCCIP co-precipitates with polymerized microtubules. Mitotic cell lysates were precleared by ultracentrifugation. The soluble lysates were then treated with taxol (Tax) to repolymerize microtubules or nocodazole (Noc) to prevent repolymerization. Following ultracentrifugation, microtubules are in the pellet (P), and soluble tubulin is retained in the supernatant (S). Equal portion of supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to western blot and with the indicated antibodies. Sup: supernatant; WCE: whole cell extract; N: Nocodazole treated; T: Taxol treated. (<bold>c</bold>) BCCIP complexes with microtubules, centrosomes and dynactin. HeLa mitotic extract was incubated with GST-BCCIPÎ±, GST-BCCIPÎ² or GST and subjected to glutathione-bead pulldown. 1% of the input and 5% of the pulldown was subjected to western blot and probed with the indicated antibodies. (<bold>d</bold>) BCCIP co-localizes with dynactin at the mother centriole, spindle pole and cell cortex.

        <p>BCCIP deficiency decreases levels of stable, acetylated microtubules. (<bold>a</bold>) BCCIP knockdown reduces microtubule acetylation. Control and BCCIP knockdown HeLa cells or MEF control and MEF BCCIP knockout cells were lysed and blotted for the stable microtubule marker, acetyl-tubulin. (<bold>b</bold>) Levels of acetylated-tubulin in control and BCCIP knockdown cells. HeLa cells expressing BCCIP-shRNA (weak green, un-arrowed) were mixed with control cells (strong green, arrowed), and stained for BCCIP and acetyl-tubulin. (<bold>c</bold>) The reduced acetyl-tubulin in BCCIP-deficient cell can be rescued by RNAi-resistant BCCIPÎ±. RNAi-resistant YFP-BCCIPÎ±, YFP-BCCIPÎ² and YFP were re-expressed in BCCIP knockdown cells. These YFP-positive cells were mixed with non-transfected knockdown or control cells (YFP-negative cells). Total fluorescent intensity of acetyl-tubulin in BCCIP knockdown (YFP-negative) and BCCIP re-expressed (YFP-positive) cells on the same staining slide was quantified. Shown are relative intensities of acetyl-tubulin in wild-type cells (first column from left), BCCIP knockdown cells (second column from left) and the knockdown cells expressing different YFP-tagged proteins. Representative images of rescue can be viewed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>.</p>

        <p>Abnormal spindle architecture in BCCIP-deficient cells. BCCIP knockdown HeLa or BCCIP knockout MEF cells were immunostained with Î±-tubulin and pericentrin and analyzed at metaphase. The distance between the paired centrosomes, the angles of spindle arcs and the width of the spindle poles were assessed. Representative image sets and a cartoon illustration of the assessed geometric measurements are shown in (<bold>a</bold>). The distributions and averages of the spindle length, arc angles and the width of the spindle poles are shown in (<bold>b</bold>â<bold>d</bold>), respectively.</p>

        <p>BCCIP loss induces spindle orientation defects. (<bold>a</bold>) Measurement of spindle angles. Image stacks of mitotic HeLa cells grown parallel to the culture surface were obtained by confocal imaging. The Z-planes containing maximal spindle pole intensities were recorded as Z1 and Z2, and the Z-distance between Z1 and Z2 was used to measure the depth (or the vertical distance) between the spindle poles (ÎZ shown in illustration). Maximal projections were utilized to determine the horizontal distance between the spindle poles (x-value as illustrated). Consequently, the spindle angles relative to the culture surface can be determined as Î±=Sin<sup>â1</sup>(ÎZ/x). (<bold>b</bold>) Representative images of spindle pole planes (Z1 &amp; Z2). Spindle poles (pericentrin foci) reside in the same Z-planes in control cells but often reside in two different confocal planes (Z1 or Z2) for BCCIP-deficient cells, reflecting an increase in the spindle angle. (<bold>c</bold>) The distribution of spindle angles is increased by BCCIP depletion. The spindle angles from control (i), BCCIP knockdown (ii) and knockdown cells expressing RNAi resistant BCCIPÎ± (iii) or BCCIPÎ² (iv) or control vector (v) were assessed. Plotted are the distributions of the spindle angles among indicated cells. The <italic>P</italic>-values of <italic>t</italic>-test between the two indicated pairs are shown in the table. (<bold>d</bold>) Reduced levels of cortical dynactin in BCCIP-deficient cells. Control and BCCIP-deficient HeLa cells were co-seeded to coverslips, arrested in metaphase with MG-132 and co-stained with p150 glued (green) and BCCIP (red). Shown are the representative images of BCCIP normal (up right corner) and BCCIP knockdown (lower left corner) cells on the same staining field, and the zoomed images demonstrating the p150 staining at the spindle pole and the cortex. Yellow arrows indicate the presence (control) or lack (BCCIP knockdown) of cortex p150 staining in the control and BCCIP-deficient cells.</p>

        <p>Delayed mitotic completion in BCCIP-deficient cells. (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b)</bold> BCCIP loss delays anaphase onset. HCT116 cells were blocked at the G2/M boundary by RO-3306 treatment, released and immunostained with pH3-T11. (<bold>a</bold>) shows the percentages of mitotic cells at different times after the release from the G2/M block.

NT: untreated asynchronized cells used as a loading reference. (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>) Delayed completion of mitosis in BCCIP-deficient cells. U2OS cells were filmed overnight in an incubated live cell microscope. Frames were acquired every 5âmin, and the length of mitosis was quantified from the onset of nuclear envelope breakdown to the formation of a visible mid-body. Shown in (<bold>c</bold>) is mitotic time in control (i), BCCIP knockdown (ii), and knockdown cells rescued with RNAi-resistant BCCIPÎ± (iii) or BCCIPÎ² (iv) or control vector (v). The <italic>P</italic>-values of <italic>t</italic>-test between the indicated cells are shown. Verification of the re-expression of exogenous BCCIP in the BCCIP knockdown cells is shown in (<bold>d</bold>). (<bold>e</bold>) BCCIP deficiency synergizes with spindle poison to delay in mitotic completion. Control and BCCIP knockdown HT1080 cells were treated with nocodazole over ice to completely depolymerize the mitotic spindle. The cells were then washed rapidly three times with warm media and filmed until mitosis was completed.</p>
