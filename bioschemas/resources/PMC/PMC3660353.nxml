      <abstract>
        <p>The transmembrane domain proteins of the claudin superfamily are the major structural components of cellular tight junctions. One family member, claudin-1, also associates with tetraspanin CD81 as part of a receptor complex that is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of the liver. To understand the molecular basis of claudin-1/CD81 association we previously produced and purified milligram quantities of functional, full-length CD81, which binds a soluble form of HCV E2 glycoprotein (sE2). Here we report the production, purification and characterization of claudin-1. Both yeast membrane-bound and detergent-extracted, purified claudin-1 were antigenic and recognized by specific antibodies. Analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that extraction with n-octyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside yielded monodispersed, dimeric pools of claudin-1 while extraction with profoldin-8 or n-decylphosphocholine yielded a dynamic mixture of claudin-1 oligomers. Neither form bound sE2 in line with literature expectations, while further functional analysis was hampered by the finding that incorporation of claudin-1 into proteoliposomes rendered them intractable to study. Dynamic light scattering demonstrated that claudin-1 oligomers associate with CD81 <italic>in vitro</italic> in a defined molar ratio of 1â¶2 and that complex formation was enhanced by the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate. Attempts to assay the complex biologically were limited by our finding that claudin-1 affects the properties of proteoliposomes. We conclude that recombinant, correctly-folded, full-length claudin-1 can be produced in yeast membranes, that it can be extracted in different oligomeric forms that do not bind sE2 and that a dynamic preparation can form a specific complex with CD81 <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of any other cellular components. These findings pave the way for the structural characterization of claudin-1 alone and in complex with CD81.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. This important human pathogen specifically infects the liver. At present there is no HCV vaccine and although a number of drugs targeting HCV replicase enzymes are in development, recent trials have shown a rapid appearance of drug-resistant viruses <xref rid="pone.0064517-Asselah1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064517-Pawlotsky1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The conserved nature of HCV entry into host cells offers an alternative and attractive target for therapeutic intervention.</p>
      <p>HCV initiates infection by attaching to the cell surface followed by clathrin-dependent internalization of virus particles; current evidence supports a role for scavenger receptor class B member I (SR-BI), tetraspanin CD81 and tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin in coordinating this process (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0064517-Meredith1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). SR-BI and CD81 bind HCV-encoded E1E2 glycoproteins with high affinity and have been reported to play a role in particle attachment to the cell <xref rid="pone.0064517-Scarselli1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064517-Pileri1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In contrast, there is limited information on whether claudin-1 or occludin interacts directly with HCV. The essential role of claudin-1 in the late stages of HCV entry <xref rid="pone.0064517-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> suggests that there may be a requirement for the virus to bind receptor proteins in a defined sequence or that claudin-1 has another, as yet undetermined, function.</p>
      <p>The claudin superfamily of four transmembrane domain (4TM) proteins oligomerize to form strands that comprise cellular tight junctions <xref rid="pone.0064517-Furuse1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, thereby generating the seal required to maintain cellular homeostasis. Interactions between the first and second claudin extracellular loops (EC1 and EC2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064517-g001">
<bold>Fig. 1A</bold>
</xref>) allow protein associations both within the plasma membrane of a single cell and between adjacent cells (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0064517-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>); FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between tagged molecules suggests that protein dimers are the primary building block(s) of claudin strands <xref rid="pone.0064517-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We <xref rid="pone.0064517-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064517-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064517-Harris2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and others <xref rid="pone.0064517-Kovalenko1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> have reported that claudin-1 associates with tetraspanin CD81; this receptor complex is present at the basolateral membrane of hepatoma cells <xref rid="pone.0064517-Mee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and is essential for HCV entry <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064517-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Inhibiting protein kinase A <xref rid="pone.0064517-Farquhar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or activating epidermal growth factor accessory protein <xref rid="pone.0064517-Lupberger1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> limits claudin-1/CD81 complex formation and HCV entry. Furthermore, anti-claudin-1 antibodies inhibit HCV infection by reducing claudin-1 association with CD81 without perturbing tight junction integrity <xref rid="pone.0064517-Fofana1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>

          <p>(A) A schematic representation of the claudin-1 protein produced in this study. The membrane is represented in grey (the extra- and intracellular sides are labeled), the extracellular loops, EC1 and EC2, are marked and the His<sub>6</sub> tag is indicated in the carboxy-terminal tail. The predicted molecular mass is 23.7 kDa. (B) Recombinant claudin-1 in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> membranes forms monomers, dimers and trimers as determined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (1 Âµg protein loaded per well). Endogenous claudin-1 in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells was analyzed for comparison (5 Âµg protein loaded per well) showing monomers and oligomers. Protein concentrations in the two cell types are different because the yeast cells overexpress recombinant claudin-1; this does not affect the antigenicity of the protein, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064517-g003">Fig. 3</xref>. Molecular size markers are indicated in the intervening lane.</p>

      <p>Having established the biological relevance of claudin-1 interaction with CD81, our aim is to characterize these proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since primary human hepatocytes and the majority of human hepatoma cells express all four receptor proteins, and siRNA silencing approaches are frequently partial, it is difficult to study the role of claudin-1 in the HCV internalisation process in mammalian cells. We have therefore focused on purifying recombinant, full-length protein components of the HCV receptor complex; studies on CD81 have highlighted important differences in the interaction of HCV with full-length, cell-expressed forms of CD81 and recombinant truncated forms of the soluble second extracellular loop (EC2) <xref rid="pone.0064517-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For example a soluble, mutant form of EC2 (F150S) does not interact with HCV sE2, while mutation of the same residue in full-length, cell-expressed CD81 has minimal effects on HCV sE2 binding <xref rid="pone.0064517-Drummer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These results suggest that EC2 has a more robust structure in the full-length tetraspanin and, together with other data, indicate that regions in EC1 or the transmembrane domains may play a role in CD81 dimerisation <xref rid="pone.0064517-Kovalenko2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously reported the purification of recombinant, full-length human CD81 from the methylotrophic yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064517-Jamshad1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>: monomers, dimers and higher oligomers of CD81 were observed in recombinant <italic>P. pastoris</italic> membranes comparable with endogenous protein in mammalian membranes. Immunofluorescent and flow cytometric staining of <italic>P. pastoris</italic> protoplasts with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD81 EC2 demonstrated comparable conformation of the recombinant and native molecules. Recombinant CD81 isolated in a monodispersed form using n-octyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (Î²OG), as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), was shown to interact with HCV sE2, representing the first biophysical characterization of a functional, full-length, recombinant tetraspanin <xref rid="pone.0064517-Jamshad1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we report the production of milligram quantities of recombinant human claudin-1 using the yeast, <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. Yeast protoplasts expressing claudin-1 bound an antibody specific for a conformation-dependent epitope expressed on human hepatocytes, suggesting a native protein conformation. Claudin-1 could be isolated from yeast membranes in various oligomeric forms, dependent upon the detergent used. When isolated with Î²OG, it was monodispersed and dimeric, while isolation with profoldin-8 or n-decylphosphocholine (foscholine-10) resulted in dynamic mixtures of oligomers. When oligomeric preparations were reconstituted into liposomes, the resulting proteoliposomes inhibited HCV infection of hepatoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Claudin-1-containing proteoliposomes also inhibited the infectivity of lentiviral pseudotypes expressing HCV E1E2 glycoproteins (HCVpp) and, unexpectedly, vesicular stomatitis virus expressing glycoprotein G (VSV-Gpp). In contrast, CD82-containing proteoliposomes had no effect on HCVpp or VSV-Gpp, indicating that proteoliposomes are not tractable to study the biological function of claudin-1. In the absence of a suitable biological assay, the known interaction of claudin-1 with CD81 was therefore examined <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p>Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), dynamic preparations of claudin-1 (in foscholine-10) were demonstrated to associate with CD81 in a defined molar ratio (1â¶2) of claudin-1â¶CD81 and in the absence of any other cellular components. In contrast, monodispersed claudin-1 (in Î²OG) failed to associate with CD81. Claudin-1/CD81 complexes were stabilized by the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) consistent with literature reports that cholesterol promotes complex formation in mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0064517-Meredith1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In summary, this study represents the first in-depth characterization of recombinant, full-length claudin-1; the data presented here should accelerate the structural analysis of the claudin superfamily and promote structure-aided design of therapeutic agents that target the early entry step of the HCV lifecycle.</p>

Profoldin-8, a proprietary detergent formulation, most efficiently extracted oligomeric claudin-1 from yeast membranes.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Since no high resolution crystal structure of any full-length HCV receptor component has been published, new approaches to facilitate their biophysical characterization are required. In this study we demonstrate that recombinant, correctly-folded, full-length claudin-1 can be produced in yeast membranes, that it can be extracted in different oligomeric forms that do not bind HCV sE2 and that a dynamic preparation can complex with CD81 <italic>in vitro</italic> at a defined molar ratio of 1â¶2. This event does not require any other cellular component(s) and complexes are stabilized in cholesteryl-enriched membranes.</p>
      <p>Previous biophysical studies (using AUC and light scattering) suggest that recombinant claudin-4 is in a dynamic equilibrium of hexamers and other oligomers <xref rid="pone.0064517-Mitic1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A hexameric structure aligns with the low resolution structural analysis of the tetraspanin uroplakins (UPs) Ia and Ib, which have been shown to comprise a hexamer of heterodimers that form a crystalline 2D array <italic>in vivo</italic> of approximately 16 nm particles (R<sub>H</sub>â8 nm) <xref rid="pone.0064517-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This dynamic behavior is consistent with tight junction strand breakage and reformation, which is important for barrier function. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data for purified recombinant claudin-1 in detergent micelles suggest that dynamic populations of claudin-1 are capable of rapidly forming complexes with CD81 that are stabilized in a cholesteryl-enriched environment. Cholesterol is crucial for HCV entry <xref rid="pone.0064517-Kapadia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and a 3D model of CD81 reveals an aromatic amino acid cluster in the membrane that is typical of two cholesterol binding sites <xref rid="pone.0064517-Seigneuret1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Notably, tetraspanins are stabilized by the cholesterol enrichment of microdomains <xref rid="pone.0064517-Hemler2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and mammalian cells depleted of cholesterol show lower claudin-1/CD81 interaction by FRET that is restored by cholesterol addition <xref rid="pone.0064517-Meredith1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We previously reported a 1â¶1 stoichiometry of the claudin-1/CD81 complex in mammalian cells using FRET. To rationalise this observation with our DLS data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064517-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>), the tetraspanin uroplakin model <xref rid="pone.0064517-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and evidence that the fundamental structural unit of CD81 <xref rid="pone.0064517-Kovalenko2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and claudins <xref rid="pone.0064517-VanItallie1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> is a dimer, we propose the schematic representation of a possible claudin-1/CD81 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064517-g008">
<bold>Fig. 8</bold>
</xref>). This scheme is based on stoichiometry derived from low resolution cryo-electron crystallography data <xref rid="pone.0064517-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and is therefore speculative: seven uroplakin-like CD81 complexes (black), each containing six homodimers, are arranged with 24 claudin-1 homodimers (red) to generate a symmetrical particle, which fits with our data (R<sub>H</sub>â=â30 nm; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064517-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). The resulting molar ratio of 24â¶42 claudin-1â¶CD81 is close to the observed 1â¶2 ratio observed in our DLS experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0064517-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). At the center of the complex, 6 claudin-1 dimers are packed near 6 CD81 dimers, an arrangement that would account for our previous FRET data <xref rid="pone.0064517-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> for dimers packed within approximately 10 nm of each other; at larger distances the FRET signal decreases sharply as it has an inverse sixth power dependence on distance. This hypothetical complex is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that in mouse liver tissue, claudin-2 can be isolated as a component of a high molecular weight protein complex with claudin-1 and occludin <xref rid="pone.0064517-VanItallie1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and that claudin-2 has been reported to dimerize via transmembrane interactions <xref rid="pone.0064517-VanItallie1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p>

The data presented here support a model whereby CD81 diffuses through the membrane and is able to complex with claudin-1 on account of its ability to exist in a dynamic equilibrium of homo-oligomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064517-g003">

      <p>To analyze the biological function of claudin-1 (and its complexes), we generated proteoliposomes; recent advances in the use of polymers to isolate membrane proteins and their complexes in a biocompatible format may also offer a future solution for studies of biological function <xref rid="pone.0064517-Jamshad2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Unexpectedly, we found that the presence of claudin-1 in proteoliposomes altered pseudoparticle uptake into hepatoma cells and that this modulation was not specific to HCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0064517-g005">
<bold>Fig. 5</bold>
</xref>). Polyunsaturated ER-targeting liposomes (PERLs) have also been demonstrated to be anti-viral, affecting both the secretion and infectivity of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses <xref rid="pone.0064517-Bertaux1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane of the host cell and the membrane of the secreted virus were disrupted by PERLs <xref rid="pone.0064517-Bertaux1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Claudin-1-containing proteoliposomes, like PERLs, also appear to inhibit HCV entry; since claudin-1 is required in the late stages of HCV cell entry <xref rid="pone.0064517-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, it is possible that the internalization of claudin-1-containing proteoliposomes causes this inhibition, although this remains to be determined <xref rid="pone.0064517-Kapadia1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both structural and functional analyses of recombinant claudin-1 with CD81 and HCV are now required to identify the critical amino acids defining HCV receptor form and function <xref rid="pone.0064517-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The data presented here pave the way for the structural characterization of wild-type and mutant forms of claudin-1, alone and in complex with CD81, which may ultimately enable structure-aided design of new therapeutic agents targeted at viral entry.</p>

        <p>Yeast membranes were prepared from 20 g wet cells suspended in 40 mL sterile ice-cold breaking buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol (w/v), pH 7.4) and protease inhibitors (cocktail set IV, Calbiochem). Cells were passed through an Emulsiflex-C3 cell disrupter until &gt;90% breakage was observed under a light microscope. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (10,000Ã g, 30 min, 4Â°C) and the supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged (100,000Ã g, 90 min, 4Â°C) to isolate the total membrane fraction. The yeast membrane pellet was suspended in sterile ice-cold buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7) using a glass homogenizer. Membrane fractions were kept on ice if used for immediate analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C. For reducing SDS-PAGE total membrane samples were heated at 98Â°C for 10 min in sample buffer (50% distilled water, 12.5% 0.5M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% Î²-mercaptoethanol and 0.001% bromophenol blue). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE samples were prepared using the same buffer without the addition of Î²-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated using a 12% Tris-HCl gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane before immunoblotting with a primary monoclonal antibody (anti-His<sub>6</sub>, Clontech) followed by an anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). EZ-ECL chemiluminescence (Geneflow) was used to detect protein bands.</p>

Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (20,000Ã g, 30 min) and the protein concentration determined using Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantified protein lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Sigma, UK) for incubation with anti-claudin-1 (MH25, Invitrogen). Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Geneflow, UK).</p>

Lipids were mixed with protein at a molar ratio of 5,000â¶1 at room temperature in the presence of 1.6% Î²-OG in 1 mL 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Proteoliposomes were recovered by flotation in an OptiPrep gradient. Dialyzed and pooled proteoliposomes were used for subsequent viral assays. SDS-PAGE and silver staining confirmed they contained protein; the lipid composition of the proteoliposomes was 30% cholesterol, 55% sphingomyelin, 15% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. For viral infection assays, HCV J6/JFH was generated as previously described <xref rid="pone.0064517-Lindenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Briefly RNA was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> from full-length genomes (RiboMax T7 kit, Promega) and electroporated into Huh-7.5 cells. Viral stocks were generated by two sequential passages through Huh-7.5 cells. Supernatants were collected, pooled, and stored at â80Â°C. Infected cells were detected by methanol fixation and staining for HCV encoded NS5A using monoclonal antibody, 9E10 (a gift of Charles Rice and Tim Tellinghuisen Rockefeller University, USA); bound antibody was detected with anti-mouse IgG Alexa-488 and quantified by enumerating NS5A expressing cells. Pseudoviruses expressing a luciferase reporter were generated as previously described <xref rid="pone.0064517-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with a 1â¶1 ratio of plasmids encoding HIV provirus expressing luciferase and HCV strain H77 E1E2 envelope glycoproteins (HCVpp), vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-Gpp) or empty vector (Env-pp). Supernatants were harvested 48 h post transfection. Infection was quantified by measuring luciferase activity (relative lights units, RLU) and specific infectivity determined by subtracting the mean Env-pp signal from the HCVpp, or VSV-Gpp values. HCVcc or HCVpp were allowed to infect Huh-7.5 cells in the presence or absence of proteoliposome preparations for 6 h and unbound virus removed by washing and the cells fed with 3% FBS/DMEM. Infections were allowed to proceed for 72 h and enumerated by counting NS5A expressing cells or luciferase activity, respectively.</p>

        <title>Analysis of complex formation by size exclusion chromatography and DLS</title>
        <p>Initial analysis of complex formation was done by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S200 10/300 GL; column volume 24 mL) on solubilized proteins alone and after incubation together. Subsequently, DLS measurements were used to assess whether complexes had formed. Prior to mixing, to avoid disturbances to the DLS measurements, aggregates and dust particles were removed from the purified protein solutions (0.3â0.4 mg mL<sup>â1</sup>) by filtration through a 0.1 mm filter, followed by clarification at 14,000Ã g. Proteins were then transferred to an MRC crystallization plate (96-well SBS format, Swissci AG, Switzerland) at 1 ÂµL/well. Five different molar ratios of claudin-1/CD81, claudin-1/CD82 and claudin-1/claudin-1 (9â¶1; 2â¶1; 1â¶1; 1â¶2; 1â¶9) were analyzed with and without the addition of 0.1 ÂµL CHEMS (2.2 mg mL<sup>â1</sup> in 20 mM MOPS, pH 8, 1% beta-OG) to the drop. As controls, claudin-1, CD81 and CD82 were analyzed alone, with and without addition of 0.1 ÂµL CHEMS (2.2 mg/mL in 20 mM MOPS, pH 8, 1% Î²OG) to the drop, as well as the same buffer without protein. The reservoirs were filled with 35 ÂµL protein buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 8, 1% beta-OG) and the plate was sealed with SmartSeal (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Germany) to avoid evaporation during the measurements. DLS measurements within these droplets were carried out at 20Â°C using a <italic>Spectro</italic> Light 500 instrument (XtalConcepts GmbH, Germany), a plate reader for UV/visible-imaging and <italic>in situ</italic> DLS <xref rid="pone.0064517-Dierks1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.

To obtain data on the time-dependent change of the hydrodynamic radius (R<sub>H</sub>) distribution of the respective protein mixtures, DLS measurements were recorded for 23â36 h in all wells. From each well a series of 130 measurements at 30 s per measurement was recorded, with an interval of approximately 10 min between each measurement.</p>
