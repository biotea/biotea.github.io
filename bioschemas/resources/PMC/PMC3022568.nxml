        <p>Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are important regulators of cell proliferation. Here we identified a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, ovarian tumor domain-containing 6B (OTUD-6B). Mutation of the conserved Cys residue abolished its deubiquitinating activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Otud-6b expression was induced with cytokine stimulation in both mouse Ba/F3 cells and primary B lymphocytes followed a rapid decrease. This rapid decrease was partially facilitated by tristetraprolin (TTP) destabilization of Otud-6b mRNA through AU-rich motifs. Enforced expression of OTUD-6B in Ba/F3 cells could block cell proliferation by arresting cells in G1 phase. In addition, cyclin D2 level was down-regulated when OTUD-6B WT was overexpressed. Therefore, down-regulation of Otud-6b expression after prolonged cytokine stimulation may be required for cell proliferation in B lymphocytes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway is involved in multiple cellular processes including cell cycle regulation <xref rid="pone.0014514-DeSalle1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, transcriptional activation <xref rid="pone.0014514-Muratani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and antigen presentation <xref rid="pone.0014514-Loureiro1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition to ubiquitination, the importance of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) has been demonstrated recently <xref rid="pone.0014514-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Burrows1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. DUBs can either recycle ubiquitin as components of the 26S proteasome <xref rid="pone.0014514-Amerik1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> or rescue proteins from the degradation pathway by deubiquitination <xref rid="pone.0014514-Amerik1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Hanna1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. There are five sub-families of DUBs classified by their sequence diversity: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), the ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs/UBPs), the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain proteins, the Josephin or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) proteins, and the JAMM (Jab1/MPN domain-associated metalloisopeptidase) domain proteins. The JAMM proteins are zinc metalloisopeptidases, while the other four families are cysteine peptidases <xref rid="pone.0014514-Komander1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>B cell fate is essentially associated with the adaptive immune system <xref rid="pone.0014514-CaligarisCappio1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and B cell fate is modulated by cytokines during its maturation, homeostasis, and proliferation through target genes expression <xref rid="pone.0014514-Milne1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-AcostaRodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recently, mouse Dub-1, Dub-1a, Dub-2, and Dub-2a were reported to be hematopoietic-specific DUBs in B lymphocytes. Their expression levels were rapidly induced upon cytokine stimulation, which is probably due to the cytokine-inducible enhancer in the 5â²-UTR <xref rid="pone.0014514-Baek1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, the expression levels of those DUBs were sharply down-regulated following the fast induction and little is known about this fast down-regulation. These four DUBs belong to the USP17 gene family, members of which form part of highly polymorphic tandem repeat sequences on mouse chromosome 7 <xref rid="pone.0014514-Burrows2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. There is no other DUB reported to present this induction-decline expression pattern. More recently, microarray data have shown that many OTU family members were rapidly up-regulated or down-regulated in human esophageal epithelial cells and lymphocytes when stimulated by different cytokines, such as ovarian tumor domain containing 6B (OTUD-6B), a novel DUB of the OTU family members. OTUD-6B was originally named as CGI-77 and has deubiquitinating enzyme activity <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0014514-Catic1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It was up-regulated on human esophageal epithelial cells after interleukin-13 (IL-13) stimulation <xref rid="pone.0014514-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. BAFF, a B cell-activating factor of the TNF family, could also induce Otud-6b expression on mouse B cells after 4 hours stimulation <xref rid="pone.0014514-Patke1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) could effectively down-regulate OTUD-6B expression when human leukocytes were stimulated for 16 hours <xref rid="pone.0014514-Buzzeo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Although these experiments showed that OTU family members were regulated by cytokines, little is known about the mechanism and function of such regulations.</p>
      <p>Here we report that Otud-6b, a functional DUB of the OTU family, can be induced by IL-3, IL-4, IL-13 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation in B lymphocytes. However, prolonged stimulation with these cytokines effectively decreased the expression of Otud-6b. This is the first OTU family member to be reported to have such cytokines response. To further investigate the down-regulation mechanism, we knocked down several proteins involved in mRNA regulation and found that tristetraprolin (TTP) was responsible for Otud-6b mRNA rapid degradation. Enforced expression of OTUD-6B could block cell growth and arrest cells in G1 phase. Apoptosis assays showed that overexpression of OTUD-6B in Ba/F3 cells increased the number of cells in subG1 and pro-apoptotic stages. In addition, cyclin D2 expression level was down-regulated when OTUD-6B WT was overexpressed in Hela and Ba/F3 cells, while overexpression of OTUD-6B C188S, which abolished its deubiquitinating activity, had no effect on cyclin D2 level. Therefore, OTUD-6B may participate in cell cycle regulation in B lymphocytes after cytokine stimulation.</p>

        <title>OTUD-6B is a Functional Deubiquitinating Enzyme</title>
        <p>Human OTUD-6B, also named as DUBA5 and CGI-77, is located on Chr8: 92151719-92168498 <xref rid="pone.0014514-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Specific primers were designed to amplify OTUD-6B cDNA from Raji cells by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g001">
<bold>Figure 1A</bold>
</xref>). The sequence of OTUD-6B cDNA clone was identical to GeneBank NM_016023. The full-length OTUD-6B cDNA is 3306 bp and contains a 972-bp ORF. The mouse homolog Otud-6b cDNA is 3311 bp long and consists of seven exons encoding a 325-amino acid mouse Otud-6b protein. The protein homology between human OTUD-6B and mouse Otud-6b is about 87% (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s002">Figure S1</xref></bold>). We analyzed the expression pattern of Otud-6b mRNA in mouse tissues by RT-PCR using the Otud-6b specific primers. RT-PCR results revealed that Otud-6b mRNA is expressed in various mouse tissues, including brain, heart, lung, kidney, ovary, spleen, and B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g001">

        <p>Next we investigated whether OTUD-6B is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme. Sequence alignment on human OTU family members indicated that the Cys<sub>188</sub> is the putative conserved Cys residue in OTUD-6B <xref rid="pone.0014514-Kayagaki1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we mutated this site into a Ser to generate an OTUD-6B C188S mutant. <italic>In vitro</italic> deubiquitinating enzyme assay showed that GST-OTUD-6B WT fusion protein could deubiquitinate Ub-Met-Î²-gal to an extent comparable to GST-CYLD, which is a reported functional DUB <xref rid="pone.0014514-Almeida1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, while the OTUD-6B C188S mutant failed to cleave the Ub-Met-Î²-gal substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g001">

</xref>). Immunoblot confirmed that all GST fusion proteins were synthesized effectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s003">Figure S2</xref></bold>). These results demonstrated that OTUD-6B is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <title>Cytokines could Induce Otud-6b Expression in B lymphocytes Followed by a Rapid Decline</title>
        <p>As microarray data have showed that OTUD-6B expression levels could be regulated upon cytokine stimulation <xref rid="pone.0014514-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Patke1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Buzzeo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Kimura1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To investigate the response of Otud-6b expression levels to cytokine stimulation in B lymphocytes, we first examined that in Ba/F3 cells, a mouse pro-B cell line. The mRNA levels of Otud-6b showed a dose-dependent response after 2 hours incubation with different concentrations of IL-3, IL-4, IL-13, and GM-CSF (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 pM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g002">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>). We also tested the time course response for Otud-6b mRNA expression in Ba/F3 cells under 10 pM IL-3, IL-4, IL-13, or GM-CSF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g002">
<bold>Figure 2B</bold>
</xref>). Our results showed that Otud-6b mRNA expression levels were increased from 0 to 2 hours but decreased rapidly after 4â6 hours with those cytokines stimulation. On the other hand, IL-2 could not induce Otud-6b expression in Ba/F3 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s004">Figure S3</xref></bold>). A rabbit polyclonal antibody for Otud-6b/OTUD-6B was developed to facilitate our studies on the endogenous protein (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s005">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Then endogenous Otud-6b expression changes were tested in similar time course experiments with 10 pM mouse IL-3 or IL-4. Immunoblot results showed that endogenous Otud-6b protein was induced after 1 hour IL-3 stimulation and declined after 4 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g002">
<bold>Figure 2C</bold>
</xref>), while the response with IL-4 stimulation was slower as endogenous Otud-6b protein expression could only be detected after 4 hours and declined after 6 hours of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g002">
<bold>Figure 2D</bold>
</xref>). Such difference on mRNA kinetics between IL-3 and IL-4 stimulation is probably due to different downstream signaling pathways induced by those two cytokines <xref rid="pone.0014514-Ihle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

Similar time course and concentration course experiments were performed on those primary B cells with IL-3 stimulation. The time course experiments showed that both Otud-6b mRNA and protein were induced after 1 hours' stimulation and declined after 3 hours' stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g002">

        <title>OTUD-6B Overexpression Slows Proliferation and Increases the Rate of Apoptosis</title>
        <p>During our cytokine stimulation experiments, we observed an interesting rapid down-regulation of Otud-6b after prolonged cytokine stimulation. We wanted to understand why Otud-6b is so rapidly down-regulated after prolonged stimulation. Therefore, we enforced OTUD-6B expression in Ba/F3 cells to overturn the down-regulation. Interestingly, overexpression of OTUD-6B could affect cell proliferation and cell cycle in Ba/F3 cells. While cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)and OTUD-6B C188S mutant vector doubled 2-3 times after 48 hours of culture, OTUD-6B WT vector transfected cells showed a substantial reduction in the proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g003">

        <title>TTP Destabilizes Otud-6b mRNA through its 3â²UTR</title>
        <p>Otud-6b mRNA was rapidly down-regulated after prolonged cytokine induction. In order to investigate the mechanism of such rapid decay, we investigated several possible regulation pathways for mRNA degradation. MicroRNAs are reported to be involved in directing mRNA degradation of the target genes <xref rid="pone.0014514-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Down-regulation of Dicer1, which is essential in processing small RNAs, had no effect on Otud-6b mRNA level (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s008">Figure S7</xref></bold>). This data indicated that microRNAs probably do not regulate Otud-6b mRNA stability under our conditions. Several RNA binding proteins including TTP, AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1), and butyrate response factor-1 (BRF1) have been shown to be able to regulate ARE-mRNAs stability <xref rid="pone.0014514-Stoecklin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Carballo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-DeMaria1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

<bold>Figure 5A</bold>

While there was no effect in Otud-6b mRNA levels with AUF1 and BRF1 knock-down (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s008">Figure S7</xref></bold>), the degradation of Otud-6b mRNA was delayed when TTP was effectively down-regulated by pSUPER siTTP-1 and siTTP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g005">

Otud-6b mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR from TTP-RNA complex immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g005">

To investigate which AU-rich elements on the 3â²-UTR of Otud-6b mRNA is involved in TTP regulation, we next constructed a series luciferase reporter with different Otud-6b-specific 3â²-UTR regions (1221â2950, 1221â2720, and 2721â2950 of mouse Otud-6b cDNA). As 293T cells have very low endogenous TTP expression <xref rid="pone.0014514-Emmons1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we co-transfected HA-TTP and those luciferase reporter constructs into 293T cells. Luciferase expression with Otud-6b 3â²-UTR (1221â2950) was significantly inhibited by co-transfection of wild-type TTP in 293T cells, while TTP Zn-FM (TTP zinc finger mutant), which lacks the ability to bind to mRNA, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g005">

Furthermore, truncation of Otud-6b 3â²-UTR showed that TTP probably binds to the end of Otud-6b 3â²-UTR as TTP could significantly reduce luciferase production with the 3â²UTR (2721â2950) and has no effect on luciferase expression with the 3â²-UTR (1221â2720) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g005">

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we firstly identified an OTU family member, Otud-6b, to be a functional deubiquitinating enzyme. After serum starvation, Otud-6b was induced by cytokines following a rapid decline in B lymphocytes. The induction of Otud-6b is probably due to robust response after serum starvation and cytokine stimulation, which is a less physiological condition. However, the rapid down-regulation of Otud-6b is probably required to maintain a normal cell cycle as enforced Otud-6b expression can cause cell cycle arrest in Ba/F3 cells. What is more, Otud-6b is not expressed (or not detectable) in Ba/F3 cells continually growing in 1 ng/ml IL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014514-g001">

        <title>Regulation of OTUD-6B mRNA stability</title>
        <p>Degradation of mRNA is important in the regulation of gene expression <xref rid="pone.0014514-Klug1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. MicroRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to complementary sequences in the 3â²UTR of target mRNAs, usually resulting in mRNA degradation and gene silencing <xref rid="pone.0014514-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Besides microRNAs, short-lived transcripts can also be controlled through RNA-binding proteins <xref rid="pone.0014514-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, such as TTP, AUF1, and BRF1, which can bind to the AREs in 3â²-UTR of many cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0014514-Carballo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. On the other hand, HuR, a ubiquitously expressed member of the Hu family, could stabilize ARE containing transcripts <xref rid="pone.0014514-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this study we found that TTP could regulate the post-transcriptional level of Otud-6b mRNA through the 3â²-UTR and the AU-rich sequences in the 3â²-UTR play vital roles in contributing the stability of Otud-6b mRNA. However, the mechanism of TTP mediated Otud-6b mRNA degradation is still unclear. TTP has been reported to bind to varieties of AU-rich sequences in the 3â²-UTR of short-lived transcripts, including TNF-alpha <xref rid="pone.0014514-Carballo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, GM-CSF <xref rid="pone.0014514-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and c-fos <xref rid="pone.0014514-Hau1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Many of these TTP binding sites are functional AREs with tandemly repeat copies of the AUUUA motif. Few exceptions have been reported such as MHC class I, which contains non-AU-rich element <xref rid="pone.0014514-Emmons1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although we identified TTP binds to Otud-6b mRNA and the AU-rich sequences in the 3â²UTR 2721â2950 region may contain the AU-rich element (ARE), which motifs (AREs or non-AREs) in the Otud-6b mRNA are responsible for TTP binding is unclear. Since TTP has some flexibility in its sequence requirements for binding, future detailed mutagenesis in the 3â²-UTR of Otud-6b mRNA, especially the AU-rich sequences in the 3â²UTR 2721â2950 regions, would be necessary to define the precise sequence requirements for TTP binding. On the other hand, TTP knock-down could not completely block the degradation of Otud-6b mRNA, other possible mechanisms involved in Otud-6b mRNA regulation will need further careful examination.</p>

        <p>Enforced expression of OTUD-6B causes Ba/F3 cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, while knockdown of Otud-6b showed no effect (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s006">Figure S5</xref></bold>). During the G1-S transition, cyclin D type protein is synthesized in response to mitogenic stimulation and cyclin D-CDK4 complex can phosphorylate pRb which can induce cyclin E synthesis. When there is more cyclin E than p27, the excess cyclin E triggers phosporylation of p27, which is then started to be degraded <xref rid="pone.0014514-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014514-Sherr1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. We re-checked cell cycle regulators in OTUD-6B overexpressed Ba/F3 cells and found that p27 level was up-regulated and cyclin E level was down-regulated (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s011">Figure S10</xref></bold>), which correlates with cell cycle progression. However, the effect on cyclin D2 levels was modest; and how OTUD-6B cause such down-regulation still need further investigation as cyclin D2 is unlikely a substrate of OTUD-6B because we also did not observe any deubiquitinating activity of OTUD-6B on cyclin D2. Nevertheless, OTUD-6B probably could directly affect either the synthesis or the degradation process of cyclin D2 as overexpressing OTUD-6B in Hela cells could also cause cyclin D2 expression level down-regulation even without affecting cell cycle (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014514.s011">Figure S10</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we also did not observe any effect on p27 and cyclin E in Hela cells overexpressing OTUD-6B. The lack of cell cycle arresting effect in Hela cells is probably due to deregulated cell cycle in cancer cell line <xref rid="pone.0014514-Whitfield1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it is important to further investigate which substrate(s) or pathway OTUD-6B regulates to control the level of cyclin D2. Many pathways have been reported to regulate cyclin D2 level in different tissues. For example, cyclin D2 is a direct target gene of Myc <xref rid="pone.0014514-Bouchard1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and PU.1 transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0014514-Vicari1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Its expression can also be induced by colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor through Src, MAPK/ERK kinase, and c-Myc pathways in macrophages <xref rid="pone.0014514-Dey1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. On the other hand, GSK3 beta can suppress cyclin D2 expression by tumor suppressor PTEN <xref rid="pone.0014514-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Due to the complexity of cyclin D2 signaling pathway, we had not found the direct substrate of OTUD-6B yet. While preparing this article, we noticed that recent work reported by Mathew E. Sowa et al. used a CompPASS method in a global proteomic analysis on DUBs, including OTUD-6B, and their associated protein complexes <xref rid="pone.0014514-Sowa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, likely because of the complexity of the substrate(s) and the transient nature of DUB-substrate interaction, they also failed to identify the right substrate(s) for OTUD-6B. However, further investigations on identifying OTUD-6B substrates will still be needed to understand the mechanism of cell cycle regulation by OTUD-6B.</p>
