      <abstract>
        <p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) reach their mature functional form through several steps of processing and modification. Some nucleotide modifications affect the proper folding of tRNAs, and they are crucial in case of the non-canonically structured animal mitochondrial tRNAs, as exemplified by the apparently ubiquitous methylation of purines at position 9. Here, we show that a subcomplex of human mitochondrial RNase P, the endonuclease removing tRNA 5â² extensions, is the methyltransferase responsible for m<sup>1</sup>G9 and m<sup>1</sup>A9 formation. The ability of the mitochondrial tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>R9 methyltransferase to modify both purines is uncommon among nucleic acid modification enzymes. In contrast to all the related methyltransferases, the human mitochondrial enzyme, moreover, requires a short-chain dehydrogenase as a partner protein. Human mitochondrial RNase P, thus, constitutes a multifunctional complex, whose subunits moonlight in cascade: a fatty and amino acid degradation enzyme in tRNA methylation and the methyltransferase, in turn, in tRNA 5â² end processing.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the essential adaptors in the decoding of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by the ribosome; thus, their faithful biogenesis is crucial for cell survival. tRNAs are transcribed as precursors and undergo several steps of nucleolytic processing, nucleotide addition, editing and nucleotide modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B1">1</xref>). tRNAs are the most extensively modified type of cellular RNA, and to date, â¼100 different modifications have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B3">3</xref>). The extent of resources invested by cells in maintaining and regulating all the pathways involved in tRNA modification highlights their importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B1">1</xref>). Modifications in the anticodon region expand the decoding capacity and improve translational fidelity and are often essential. In contrast, the effects of modifications in the tRNA core are less obvious and still poorly understood. Most core-modifications are pseudouridinylations and different kinds of methylations at several nucleotide positions, and they are thought to stabilize the 3D structure of tRNAs by favouring or impeding specific base interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B5">5</xref>). The lack of a single of these modifications often has unremarkable effects, but the removal of more than one can structurally and metabolically destabilize tRNAs, and thereby preclude cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondria of most Eukarya have a dedicated set of tRNAs encoded in the organellar genome. Mitochondrial tRNAs [(mt)tRNAs] of animals are peculiar in sequence and structure, and they are often referred to as âbizarreâ, to underline their deviation from the structural consensus conserved in other tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B8">8</xref>). The best studied mammalian (mt)tRNAs tend to have a lower structural stability resulting from a bias in nucleotide composition, non-canonical secondary structures and a lack of conserved tertiary interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B8 gks910-B9 gks910-B10 gks910-B11 gks910-B12">8â12</xref>). Modifications of these (mt)tRNAs, although less in number, seem to be more important and, in some cases, crucial to achieve correct folding, and the impairment of even single modifications was reported to cause mitochondrial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B12">12</xref>).</p><p>A modification with particularly strong effect on tRNA folding is the <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methylation of adenosine in position 9 (m<sup>1</sup>A9) of human (mt)tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Unmodified tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> folds into a non-functional extended stem-loop; methylation of A9 impedes its base pairing with U64, and thereby shifts the equilibrium to the cloverleaf structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B14">14</xref>). Position 9 is occupied by A or G in 19 of the 22 human (mt)tRNAs and, considering the modification pattern of all currently analysed animal (mt)tRNAs, it is probably modified to m<sup>1</sup>A or m<sup>1</sup>G in all 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B15">15</xref>). m<sup>1</sup>A9 is otherwise only found in some archaeal tRNAs, and m<sup>1</sup>G9 is restricted to a subset of the archaeal and eukaryal cytosolic tRNAs harbouring G9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B16">16</xref>). The ubiquitous occurrence of the two modifications in animal mitochondria suggests a more general, critical importance for the structural integrity of (mt)tRNAs. The enzyme(s) responsible for the methylation of A9 and G9 in (mt)tRNAs, however, has/have not been identified to date.

This is the endonuclease responsible for the formation of the 5â² ends of (mt)tRNAs and the concomitant release of 5â² flanking sequences from the polycistronic mitochondrial primary transcripts. Human mtRNase P comprises three proteins, one of which has the structural features of a metallonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B18">18</xref>). The other two proteins do not have any obvious relationship to nucleases, and their role for mtRNase P-function is unclear. However, one of them, originally termed mitochondrial RNase P protein 1 (MRPP1), now tRNA methyltransferase 10 C (TRMT10C) according to the recent official nomenclature (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks910/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> for nomenclature and synonyms of the proteins/genes studied in this article), is homologous to yeast Trm10p, a tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>G9 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B19">19</xref>). Vertebrate genomes encode two further homologues of <italic>TRM10</italic>, but those apparently have no mitochondrial targeting sequence. None of the three human Trm10p homologues has yet been shown to have methyltransferase activity. Still, TRMT10C is a candidate for being responsible for at least m<sup>1</sup>G9 in human (mt)tRNAs, and possibly for m<sup>1</sup>A9 too. The physical association of TRMT10C with mtRNase P, moreover, suggests that methylation and cleavage are possibly also functionally connected. With this work, we, thus, sought to not only identify and characterize a modification enzyme crucial for (mt)tRNA function but also to investigate whether mtRNase P is in fact a multifunctional complex, gathering different enzymatic activities involved in tRNA maturation at different levels, and to understand the relationship among the different subunits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>The plasmids for the expression of N-terminally His-tagged TRMT10C and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 5C1 (SDR5C1) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>).

The plasmid for the expression of yeast Trm10p was kindly provided by Jane Jackman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B19">19</xref>). The complete coding sequences (including the stop codon) of TRMT10A and TRMT10B were cloned into the <italic>Nde</italic>I/<italic>Xho</italic>I sites of pET-28b(+); recombinant proteins contain an N-terminal 6ÃHis-tag and a thrombin cleavage site.</p><p>Proteins were expressed in <italic>E</italic><italic>scherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3) or Rosetta2(DE3) (native TRMT10C) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>). Bacteria were broken by sonication, and His-tagged proteins were purified on HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) using an ÃKTA purifier chromatography system (GE Healthcare); buffer A [150 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisâCl pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)]. Proteins were lysed, loaded and washed with 25 mM imidazole in buffer A (50 mM in case of SDR5C1 and PRORP), then with 150 mM imidazole, then with 1 M NaCl in buffer A, again with buffer A and finally, eluted with 500 mM imidazole. In case of PRORP, all buffers were based on HEPESâNa instead of TrisâCl. Eluted PRORP was diluted 1:3 with buffer B (50 mM HEPESâNa pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT), loaded on a HiTrap SP XL column (GE Healthcare), washed with 150 mM NaCl in buffer B and eluted with 1 M NaCl.</p><p>Purified recombinant SDR5C1 was mixed with a crude bacterial lysate of native TRMT10C (50 mM imidazole in buffer A), and the TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complex was purified on a HisTrap HP column. The ratio of SDR5C1 to TRMT10C-lysate was determined empirically to yield a TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complex saturated with TRMT10C. The column was washed with 50 mM imidazole and then with 125 mM imidazole, and TRMT10CâSDR5C1 was eluted with 500 mM imidazole.</p><p>Mutations were introduced into the TRMT10C (untagged) and SDR5C1 expression plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis, using the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene). Mutant proteins were expressed, and TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complexes were purified in parallel with the wild-type using His-affinity-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) and the aforementioned lysis, washing and elution buffers. The ratio of the two proteins within the complex was identical for mutant and wild-type preparations.</p><p>The purity of all recombinant proteins and the ratio of TRMT10C to SDR5C1 in the complex were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE) and Coomassie brilliant blue staining (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks910/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Purified proteins were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at â80Â°C. Protein concentrations were calculated by the absorbance at 280 nm and the molar extinction coefficient and molecular weight; alternatively, the protein concentration was estimated by SDSâPAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining relative to bovine serum albumin standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of mitochondrial extracts</title><p>HeLa cell mitochondrial extracts were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA interference</title><p>Transfection of HeLa cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting TRMT10C, SDR5C1, or non-targeting control siRNAs, and RNA analysis by quantitative real-time reversed transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of tRNA substrates</title><p>(Mt)tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> was transcribed from a PCR product of the tRNA linked at its 5â² end to a hammerhead ribozyme and a T7 promoter, and terminating at the 3â² end with the CCA sequence. All position 9-labelled tRNA substrates were prepared by âsplint-guidedâ two-way ligation of a synthetic RNA corresponding to the first eight nucleotides of the respective tRNA (prepared by solid-phase synthesis) to a 5â² end-labelled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcript of tRNA position 9â76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B20">20</xref>). The transcripts were prepared from PCR products comprising a T7 promoter, some polylinker plasmid sequence and a hammerhead ribozyme fused to the tRNA sequence from position 9 to the terminal CCA sequence. All these hammerhead-tRNA cassettes were assembled by overlap extension PCR, cloned in pGEM-1 (Promega) and, subsequently, PCR-amplified with a T7 promoter primer and a reverse primer terminating with the 3â²-terminal CCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B21">21</xref>). To generate position 9-labelled pre-tRNA substrates for RNase P, a synthetic RNA corresponding to the first eight nucleotides of the respective tRNA plus 15 nucleotides of the natural 5â²-flanking sequence was ligated to the incomplete 5â² end-labelled tRNA transcript. The I9 containing (cyt)tRNA<sup>Arg-I9</sup> was prepared by âsplint-guidedâ three-way ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B20">20</xref>) of the first eight nucleotides of (cyt)tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> to nucleotides 9â17 (5â² end-labelled) and 18â76 (all three prepared by solid-phase synthesis). The precursor of (mt)tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>).

A 5â² leader sequence did not prevent the enzyme from transfering the methyl group to G9 or A9 of the tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B).

Nevertheless, it was intriguing to conjecture an actual coupling of the two reactions in the multifunctional complex. To test this hypothesis, a 5â²-extended tRNA substrate was partially (â¼30%) cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by incubation with an excess of mtRNase P holoenzyme in the presence of SAM. Uncleaved and cleaved RNA were separated by PAGE, isolated and were subsequently analysed for the presence of a methyl group at tRNA-position 9. The cleaved tRNAs, although productively contacted by the mtRNase P complex for processing, were only partially methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). Thus, even if allowed to proceed in association, the two reactions were not coupled. The incomplete methylation of the cleavage product, despite its obvious contact with the methyltransferase, is consistent with a slower kinetics of tRNA methylation compared with 5â²-end cleavage. Methylation of the uncleaved 5â²-extended fraction confirms that such tRNAs are substrate for the methyltransferase activity.</p><p>To test whether the functional integrity of the methyltransferase is required to sustain efficient tRNA precursor (pre-tRNA) processing by the mtRNase P holoenzyme, we generated a mutant variant of TRMT10C, in which the aspartate residue 314 was replaced by asparagine (D314N). D314 of TRMT10C is an invariant amino acid conserved throughout the TRM10 family and was proposed to be part of these enzymesâ active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B16">16</xref>). Substitution D314N indeed impaired the methyltransferase activity of the TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complex on A9 and G9 containing substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F4">Figure 4</xref>E and F). The pre-tRNA processing activity of an mtRNase P holoenzyme reconstituted with the D314N-mutant TRMT10C, nevertheless, was unaffected in its ability to remove the 5â² leader sequence from the same substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F4">Figure 4</xref>E and F). These experiments provide first experimental evidence for an aspartate residue apparently being part of the methyltransferaseâs active site and demonstrate that the different roles of TRMT10C are functionally independent from each other.</p></sec><sec><title>All three human TRM10 homologues have tRNA methyltransferase activity</title><p>Besides TRMT10C, vertebrate genomes encode two further homologues of yeast TRM10, TRMT10A and TRMT10B.

In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complex retarded the migration of (mt)pre-tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and (mt)pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup> in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F8">Figure 8</xref>A and B, lanes 9â12), and we derived dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of 88 Â± 8 and 143 Â± 21 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F8">Figure 8</xref>C and D). Similarly, TRMT10C was binding to both pre-tRNAs, yet, it was causing a smaller shift than the TRMT10CâSDR5C1-tRNA complex, consistent with its lower molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F8">Figure 8</xref>A and B, lanes 5â8). Compared with the TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complex, the pre-tRNA-binding affinity of TRMT10C alone was slightly lower, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 255 Â± 10 nM for (mt)tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and 203 Â± 15 nM for (mt)tRNA<sup>His</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F8">Figure 8</xref>C and D). SDR5C1 alone, however, did not bind to RNA even at micromolar concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F8">Figure 8</xref>). These results suggest that SDR5C1 has no direct role in substrate recognition by the TRMT10CâSDR5C1 complex, and TRMT10C is the subunit primarily interacting with the tRNA.

Here, we showed that a subcomplex of human mtRNase P has the required tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>G9 and tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>A9 methyltransferase activities and is the enzyme responsible for the methylation of (mt)tRNAs. The unprecedented and unanticipated nature of this methyltransferase, made up of two subunits, had apparently prevented the previous identification and characterization of this crucial mitochondrial enzyme. The integration of this bifunctional methyltransferase complex into mtRNase P, moreover, demonstrates a perplexing extent of moonlighting among mitochondrial proteins and indicates a level of organizational complexity so far not observed in tRNA maturation systems.</p><p>In the (cyt)tRNAs of Eukarya, A9 is not modified, and the methylation of G9 to m<sup>1</sup>G9 is restricted to a subset of (cyt)tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B15">15</xref>). In yeast, Trm10p, the eponymous member of the TRM10 family, is the sole tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>G9 methyltransferase, yet its function is not essential under standard growth conditions, pointing to a less stringent requirement of this modification in (cyt)tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B19">19</xref>). Here, we showed that the two non-mitochondrial human TRM10 homologues TRMT10A and TRMT10B have tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>G9 methyltransferase activity like yeast Trm10p and, thus, likely represent its orthologues. It is not known why vertebrates have two tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>G9 methyltransferases for their (cyt)tRNAs, whereas one is sufficient in all other eukarya; the two might have different developmental or tissue-specific functions or have distinct subcellular distribution or substrate specificities. Interestingly, Trm10p seems to be more promiscuous with respect to substrate selectivity than TRMT10A and TRMT10B, methylating all tested G9-containing substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F5">Figure 5</xref>), although <italic>in vivo</italic> it also selectively methylates only a specific set of (cyt)tRNAs. A more systematic study of the selectivity of cytosolic tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>G9 methyltransferases will be required to uncover the molecular basis of their substrate discrimination.</p><p>Animals are apparently the only eukaryal group encoding more than one <italic>TRM10</italic> homolog, that is, generally two and even three in vertebrates, and the animal homologue with the higher degree of sequence divergence from Trm10p typically carries an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B19">19</xref>). Consistently, methylation of tRNA position 9 is confined to animal mitochondria, whereas the (mt)tRNAs of all other eukaryal groups have remained bacterial-like with respect to the lack of this modification and tRNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B15">15</xref>). It seems plausible that a form of TRM10 and the associated methylation of G9 were recruited to mitochondria and extended to R9 during evolution to stabilize the fold of the otherwise unstable non-canonical animal (mt)tRNAs. The ability of the human mitochondrial enzyme to methylate guanosine and adenosine is unusual among tRNA modification enzymes, but not entirely unprecedented. A homologue of TRM10 in the Archaeon <italic>Thermococcus kodakaraensis</italic> was recently reported to be able to methylate A9 and G9 in tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B16">16</xref>). Moreover, the same authors observed that the TRM10 homologue of <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic> is able to methylate A9 but not G9, illustrating the flexibility of the TRM10 family to evolve towards different purine specificities.</p><p>Based on structural features, the TRM10 family belongs to the SpoU-TrmD (SPOUT) superfamily, a large class of methyltransferases characterized by an Î±/Î² knot fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B35">35</xref>). However, TRM10 is the most diverged among the SPOUT methyltransferases, and no crystal structure is available. The superfamily member functionally most closely related to TRM10 is bacterial TrmD, as it catalyses the methylation of <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> of G37 in tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B36">36</xref>) and may serve as a paradigm for the potential catalytic mechanism of m<sup>1</sup>G formation. In the active site of TrmD, an aspartate is proposed to act as a general base to deprotonate <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> of guanosine, whereas an arginine stabilizes the consequent <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup> negative charge and a glutamate interacts with <italic>N</italic><sup>2</sup>; the activated <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> may then make a direct nucleophilic attack on the reactive methyl group of SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B37">37</xref>). m<sup>1</sup>A, the other reaction product of the mitochondrial tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>R9 methyltransferase, is also found at tRNA positions 14, 22 and 58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B15">15</xref>), and the best characterized enzyme is the one responsible for m<sup>1</sup>A58 in Archaea, the two-subunit enzyme TrmI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B38">38</xref>). At physiological pH, <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> of adenosine is not protonated, and an aspartate deprotonates the exocyclic <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>, inducing the formation of the imino tautomer that activates the lone electron pair of <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup> for attack on the methyl group of SAM. TrmD and TrmI thereby exemplify the different mechanisms required for m<sup>1</sup>G and m<sup>1</sup>A formation. Without any information about the active site geometry of TRM10 methyltransferases, it seems currently impossible to understand how one catalytic domain achieves the methylation of the two differentially protonated purines or why different TRM10 family members have different base specificities.</p><p>TRMT10Cs dependence on another subunit for methyltransferase activity is unique within the TRM10 family. The second subunit of the mitochondrial tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>R9 methyltransferase, SDR5C1, belongs to the large family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B33">33</xref>). It was reported to act as a dehydrogenase on a wide range of substrates, such as fatty acids, alcohols and hydroxysteroids, and it was found to be essential for isoleucine degradation and short branched-chain fatty acid Î²-oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B39">39</xref>). None of these dehydrogenase activities has a direct connection with RNA metabolism, and we, moreover, showed that the integrity of SDR5C1s active site is not essential for its contribution to methyltransferase and RNase P activity (see K172A mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F6">Figure 6</xref>). SDR5C1 also has a typical Rossmann-fold NAD(H) dinucleotide-binding domain; this kind of domain was shown to mediate the binding of RNA by a number of metabolic enzymes and was proposed to be a common RNA-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B41">41</xref>). However, we did not observe any RNA binding by SDR5C1 alone, and it only slightly increased the tRNA affinity of TRMT10C in our electrophoretic mobility shift experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F8">Figure 8</xref>). Likewise, the bulky phenylalanine residue in the SDR5C1âS20F mutant blocked the dinucleotide-binding pocket to an extent that almost abolished its dehydrogenase activity, but did not affect the methyltransferase or RNase P activity of the reconstituted complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistently, an excess of NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH did not inhibit the tRNA:m<sup>1</sup>R9 methyltransferase or mtRNase P (data not shown). Thus, SDR5C1 has no direct role in tRNA binding. Moreover, all methyltransferase functions seem to reside in TRMT10C, based on its homology to other TRM10 family members and its vestigial catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks910-F7">Figure 7</xref>). The involvement of SDR5C1 in the methyltransferase complex remains enigmatic, and its essential contribution to the methyltransferase complex might in the end be a mere structural stabilization or remoulding of the actual catalytic component TRMT10C. Structural studies will be required to shed light on the dual-specific methyltransferase mechanism, the relationship between TRMT10C and SDR5C1 and on the actual role of the two subunits in tRNA methylation and 5â²-end processing.</p><p>SDR5C1 behaves like a prototypical moonlighting enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B42">42</xref>), a multifunctional protein performing multiple unrelated functions independent from each otherâfatty acid Î²-oxidation and tRNA methylation. In turn, the TRM10CâSDR5C1 methyltransferase complex moonlights in 5â² processing of pre-tRNAs, adding a further level of complexity. Human mtRNase P, thus, constitutes a multifunctional complex, gathering different enzymatic activities involved in tRNA maturation. Homologues of PRORP, the nucleolytic subunit of human mtRNase P, were recently shown to be active on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B43 gks910-B44 gks910-B45">43â45</xref>). The requirement of human PRORP for additional proteins is a peculiarity of mtRNAse P that is strikingly reminiscent of TRMT10C, which, unlike any other TRM10 family member, requires a partner protein. Moreover, the physical association of different functions, although not mirrored by a strict functional coupling, might suggest the existence of a higher-order association of related functions in human mitochondria. It is intriguing to speculate that more enzymes might be in association with human mtRNase P <italic>in vivo</italic>, constituting a sort of mitochondrial âRNA factoryâ, optimizing the handing of immature mitochondrial RNAs through the series of steps required for their maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks910/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figures 1â3 and Supplementary Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks910-B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF)</funding-source> [<award-id>LS09-032</award-id>]; <funding-source>Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</funding-source> [<award-id>P17453</award-id>].
