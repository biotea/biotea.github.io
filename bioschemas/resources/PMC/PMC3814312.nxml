      <abstract>
        <p>We describe a new syndrome of young onset diabetes, short stature and microcephaly with intellectual disability in a large consanguineous family with three affected children. Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were used to identify the causal nonsense mutation, which changed an arginine codon into a stop at position 127 of the tRNA methyltransferase homolog gene <italic>TRMT10A</italic> (also called <italic>RG9MTD2</italic>). TRMT10A mRNA and protein were absent in lymphoblasts from the affected siblings. TRMT10A is ubiquitously expressed but enriched in brain and pancreatic islets, consistent with the tissues affected in this syndrome. In situ hybridization studies showed that TRMT10A is expressed in human embryonic and fetal brain. <italic>TRMT10A</italic> is the mammalian ortholog of <italic>S. cerevisiae TRM10</italic>, previously shown to catalyze the methylation of guanine 9 (m<sup>1</sup>G<sub>9</sub>) in several tRNAs. Consistent with this putative function, in silico topology prediction indicated that TRMT10A has predominant nuclear localization, which we experimentally confirmed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. TRMT10A localizes to the nucleolus of Î²- and non-Î²-cells, where tRNA modifications occur. TRMT10A silencing induces rat and human Î²-cell apoptosis. Taken together, we propose that TRMT10A deficiency negatively affects Î²-cell mass and the pool of neurons in the developing brain. This is the first study describing the impact of TRMT10A deficiency in mammals, highlighting a role in the pathogenesis of microcephaly and early onset diabetes. In light of the recent report that the type 2 diabetes candidate gene <italic>CDKAL1</italic> is a tRNA methylthiotransferase, the findings in this family suggest broader relevance of tRNA methyltransferases in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The inherited predisposition to type 2 diabetes is attributed to common variants in over 60 loci. Among these risk variants is <italic>CDKAL1</italic>, which has recently been shown to be a tRNA modifying enzyme (methylthiotransferase). Genetic variants of different severity can generate a spectrum of monogenic and polygenic forms of diabetes. Here we describe a new syndrome of young onset diabetes, short stature and microcephaly (small brain size) with intellectual disability in a large consanguineous family. By linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing we identified a nonsense mutation in <italic>TRMT10A</italic>, a gene that has hitherto not been studied in mammals. The yeast homolog TRM10 has been shown to be a tRNA modifying enzyme with methyltransferase activity. We demonstrate that TRMT10A mRNA and protein are absent in cells from the affected siblings. TRMT10A localizes to the nucleolus, where tRNA modifications occur. TRMT10A silencing induces cell death in insulin-producing pancreatic Î²-cells, suggesting that TRMT10A deficiency may reduce Î²-cell mass and the pool of neurons in the brain. This is the first study describing the impact of TRMT10A deficiency in man. Our findings may have broader relevance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and microcephaly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous polygenic disease with dramatically increasing worldwide incidence as a consequence of the obesity epidemic <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Zimmet1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Environmental factors (energy dense diets rich in saturated fat and sedentary lifestyle <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Stumvoll1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Cnop1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>) and genetic predisposition contribute to its pathogenesis. T2D develops when Î²-cells fail to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Ferrannini1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Gerich1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> as a consequence of Î²-cell dysfunction and reduced Î²-cell mass. Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of loci where genetic polymorphisms associate with T2D <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Saxena1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Inherited mutations in genes at some of these loci have been shown to cause monogenic forms of diabetes, indicating that genetic variants of different severity can generate a spectrum of monogenic and polygenic forms of diabetes <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. An example of a T2D risk gene is <italic>CDK5</italic> regulatory associated protein 1-like 1 (<italic>CDKAL1</italic>). Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with T2D across ethnic populations <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Dehwah1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. <italic>CDKAL1</italic> encodes a transfer RNA (tRNA) methylthiotransferase that catalyzes the methylthiolation of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>(UUU) <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Cdkal1-deficient Î²-cells have impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion, and Cdkal1 knockout mice develop glucose intolerance due to aberrant insulin synthesis <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>tRNAs undergo modifications of their bases or sugar moieties that are crucial for proper cellular function. Mammalian cells have an average of 13â14 modifications per tRNA <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Sprinzl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1003888-Towns1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, methylation being the most common one <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Towns1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Chemical modifications of nucleotides surrounding anticodons of tRNAs are important to preserve translational efficiency and fidelity <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Urbonavicius1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, modifications in the main body of the tRNA affect its folding and stability, and other modifications at various positions influence tRNA identity <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Phizicky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Agris1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we identified a nonsense mutation in <italic>TRMT10A</italic> (also called <italic>RG9MTD2</italic>) in a new syndrome of young onset diabetes and microcephaly.

        <p>The proband was born to consanguineous parents of Moroccan origin, her paternal and maternal grandmothers being sisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Head circumference, weight and length at birth are unknown. At age 26 years she had short stature (143 cm), microcephaly (adult head circumference 49 cm, -5SD) and intellectual disability, with a history of petit mal epilepsy in adolescence. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed a small brain with no malformation or other abnormality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>). She had developed diabetes at the age of 22 years. At diagnosis her body mass index (BMI) was 26.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; plasma glucose was 176 mg/dl and HbA1c 11.3%. Other features were a short neck, wide nose, low hairline, buffalo hump, retraction of the right 5<sup>th</sup> toe, scoliosis, and joint laxity. She also had osteoporosis, with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry T-scores of -2.7 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively. A skeletal survey revealed no epiphyseal dysplasia or other bone abnormality (e.g. normal X-ray of the hands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Her sister had short stature (154 cm), microcephaly (adult head circumference 51 cm, -3SD) and intellectual disability (IQ 69). She developed diabetes at the age of 19 years, presenting with a fasting glucose of 365 mg/dl and HbA1c 13.2%. Her BMI was 21.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. A younger brother had short stature (141 cm at age 14 years and final height of 157 cm at 21 years), microcephaly (head circumference 51 cm, -3SD) and mental retardation (IQ 52). His head circumference at birth was reportedly normal (36 cm). He was diagnosed with diabetes at 14 years of age, with a plasma glucose of 251 mg/dl and HbA1c 11.1%. His BMI was 20.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. None of the patients had ketoacidosis and all three were treated with insulin at diagnosis. They were negative for anti-insulin, anti-GAD65, anti-IA2 and islet cell autoantibodies and had a HLA genotype that did not confer risk for type 1 diabetes. Endogenous insulin secretion persisted, shown by C-peptide measurements for up to 20 years of follow-up. The insulin requirements were moderate with an average insulin dose of 0.4â1.2 U/kg/day; glycemic control ranged from good to insufficient (HbA1c 6.5â8.5%). After 18 years of diabetes, the proband's ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral diabetic retinopathy and cortical cataract. The parents and non-affected siblings had normal size (parents 166 and 157 cm, siblings 160, 175, 183 and 159 cm) and head circumference (both parents 58 cm, P97). The parents developed diabetes at age 58 years (BMI 30.9 and 31.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, plasma glucose 124 and 169 mg/dl and HbA1c 8.3 and 7.6% in the mother and father, respectively) and were treated with metformin and a sulphonylurea. One grandfather and two aunts had adult onset diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>). One sister had gestational diabetes at the age of 22 years; her fasting plasma glucose was normal (90 mg/dl) at age 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of the mutation</title>
        <p>The GeneChip SNP array analysis identified only one large (&gt;3 cM) homozygous genomic region that was common to the three affected siblings. It was located on chromosome 4q22-23 and spanned 12.4 Mb between heterozygous SNPs rs4128340 and rs10516462. In this segment, we genotyped 15 microsatellite markers, which confirmed homozygosity and biparental inheritance of a haplotype shared by both parents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003888.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The multipoint LOD score was 3.0. Microsatellite analysis in the unaffected sister with a history of gestational diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>) showed inheritance of the non-mutated maternal haplotype and of the mutated paternal haplotype. In an additional unaffected brother with normal fasting plasma glucose (84 mg/dl) and HbA1c (5.1%) at age 23 years, we observed a critical meiotic recombination event, resulting in homozygosity for all disease-associated markers except those distal to microsatellite D4S1628. This recombinant chromosome reduced the critical linkage region to a 3.1 Mb segment at 4q23.</p>
        <p>We initially sequenced the following genes located in the 3.1 Mb segment and considered as candidates: H2AFZ (H2A histone family, member Z), LAMTOR3 (late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and MTOR activator 3), DDIT4L (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4-like), RAP1GDS1 (RAP1, GTP-GDP dissociation stimulator 1) and METAP1 (methionyl aminopeptidase 1), but no mutation was identified.</p>
        <p>Exonic sequences-enriched DNA (whole exome) sequencing was performed in one proband and results were analyzed for variants that were not found in: dbSNP135 database, the Thousand Genomes database, the Exome Variant Server, or in-house exome sequencing on 51 individuals. There was only a single candidate mutation in the 3.1 Mb critical linkage segment, a homozygous G to A transition in exon 4 of gene <italic>TRMT10A</italic> (tRNA methyltransferase 10 homolog A (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) at position 379 of the coding DNA sequence, predicted to replace an Arginine residue with a premature termination codon at position 127 of the polypeptide (c.379 G&gt;A; p.Arg127Stop). Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which was homozygous in the three affected patients and heterozygous in both parents as well as in the unaffected brother with the critical recombination event. A comparison across species shows that Arg127 and the surrounding region are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003888.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Outside the linkage region, exome analysis in the proband identified biallelic, potentially damaging mutations in the six following genes: BCLAF1; CES1; EVC2; PTPN22; ST13; ZNF626. As none were concordant in the three affected siblings, we rejected them as candidate mutations.</p>

        <p>To examine the outcome of the TRMT10A nonsense mutation on TRMT10A protein and mRNA expression, we performed Western blot and real-time PCR on lymphoblasts from two patients, a heterozygous carrier of the mutation, and three healthy controls.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In a large consanguineous family of Moroccan origin, we identified a new syndrome of severe insulinopenic young onset diabetes and microcephaly with intellectual disability. We used linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing to identify the causal mutation. We found only one region of homozygosity by descent shared by the three affected patients, and only one potentially damaging rare genetic variant in this region, located in the <italic>TRMT10A</italic> gene, changing an arginine codon at position 127 of the protein into a stop codon (Arg127Stop). In the rest of the patients' exome, we found no potentially damaging, rare biallelic variants shared by the three patients that might have qualified for a causal mutation.</p>
      <p>Among the family members, four were heterozygous carriers of a mutant allele. Of these, the parents developed diabetes in their fifties, one sister had gestational diabetes, and one brother had normal plasma glucose levels at the age of 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Other family members were not available for testing. It is possible that TRMT10A haploinsufficiency increases the risk for adult onset diabetes.</p>
      <p>
<italic>TRMT10A</italic> contains 8 exons, the first exon being non-protein coding. The mutated codon 127 is in exon 4. The protein environment of Arg127 is extremely conserved across species. Little is known about the role of TRMT10A in mammals. A single study suggested altered TRMT10A mRNA expression in colorectal cancer <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Blast analysis indicated that TRMT10A is the mammalian ortholog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TRM10, previously shown to be involved in guanine 9 tRNA methylation m<sup>1</sup>G<sub>9</sub>
<xref rid="pgen.1003888-Jackman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. TRMT10A has seven transcripts in the Vega database. Two of them are non-protein coding due to a retained intron, three contain 8 exons coding for identical proteins of 339 amino acids, and differ only in their untranslated regions. InterProScan analysis indicates that these three proteins have a tRNA (guanine 9-N1) methyltransferase domain as well as tRNA (guanine-N1) methyltransferase domain, both of them present in TRM10. The last two TRMT10A transcripts contain only 6 exons and code for shorter proteins of 200 and 206 amino acids. These two variants are truncated at the C-terminus and only have the tRNA (guanine-N1) methyltransferase domain. In rat only one isoform of TRMT10A containing both domains is found. Based on these analyses, we suggest that TRMT10A functions as a tRNA-modifying enzyme, but this remains to be experimentally confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Arg127Stop mutation is predicted to block the expression of the five coding human TRMT10A isoforms. The nonsense mutation abolished TRMT10A protein expression, and also significantly reduced its mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g002">Figure 2</xref>), probably by nonsense-mediated decay and/or transcriptional silencing <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Buhler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We show that TRMT10A is ubiquitously expressed but enriched in brain and pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g003">Figure 3</xref>), consistent with the tissues affected in this new syndrome of diabetes and microcephaly. In silico topology prediction indicates that the five human TRMT10A isoforms, as well as the rat enzyme, have predominant nuclear localization. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, with TRMT10A mainly localizing in the nucleolus of Î²- and non-Î²-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g005">Figure 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003888.s004">S4</xref>). tRNA transcription and early processing occurs in several subcellular compartments including the nucleus, cytoplasm and cytoplasmic surface of the mitochondria <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Phizicky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. tRNA genes are recruited to the nucleolus for transcription <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 5â² leader sequence removal and 3â² end modification, removal of the 3â² trailer and addition of the CCA, which is required for efficient tRNA nuclear export <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Mature tRNAs are exported to the cytosol for aminoacylation and function in translation. This transport is not unidirectional; cytosolic tRNAs can follow a retrograde transport to the nucleus (e.g. during nutrient deprivation), to be re-exported to the cytosol following nutrient availability <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Phizicky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Some tRNA modifications occur on initial tRNA transcripts, while others are introduced in end-matured tRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Melton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Since tRNA transcription and maturation occurs in the nucleus it is expected that the enzymes catalyzing these modifications have a nuclear localization. Studies in yeast confirmed that a subset of tRNA methyltransferases is located in the nucleus <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Simos1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, with distinct subnuclear distribution, i.e. nucleolus, nucleoplasm, or inner nuclear membrane; the reason for these different localizations is not known <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Phizicky1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The predominant nucleolar localization of TRMT10A is consistent with its proposed tRNA modifying activity.</p>
      <p>Alterations in tRNA modification are expected to affect protein translation. We showed that TRMT10A knockdown in rat Î²-cells enhances total protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g007">Figure 7</xref>). TRMT10A silencing does not impair glucose-induced insulin secretion or content in Î²-cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003888.s006">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting that TRMT10A deficiency has no major impact on Î²-cell function. TRMT10A knockdown sensitizes Î²-cells to apoptosis in control condition and after exposure to FFAs, high glucose or synthetic ER stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003888-g008">Figure 8</xref>), conditions related to T2D. It has been proposed that mammalian cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs prevent apoptosis by blocking the binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1, thus preventing the formation of the apoptosome <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Mei1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Hou1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It is not known whether tRNA modifications affect this tRNA-cytochrome c interaction.</p>
      <p>Primary microcephaly refers to a congenitally small but otherwise normally structured brain, with a head circumference later in life that remains 3 SD below the mean for age and gender. Primary microcephaly is a very rare disorder affecting approximately 1/100,000 live births, mainly inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, and is associated with a high rate of parental consanguinity <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Passemard1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Microcephaly and young onset diabetes co-segregate in the present family, as both features were present in the three affected siblings and absent in the six unaffected siblings, defining a new syndrome. Our linkage analysis identified a single region where all affected siblings were homozygous over a significant length of genomic DNA. It is hence likely that the whole phenotype results from pleiotropic effects of a single mutated gene.</p>
      <p>Microcephaly in our patients was associated with intellectual disability and no other neurological feature, except for a history of petit mal seizures in the proband. This clinical presentation fits with the phenotype of primary microcephaly <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Woods1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Primary microcephaly is vastly heterogeneous, and many genes that cause primary microcephaly play a role in mitotic spindle organization and/or DNA repair, presumably affecting the proliferation of neural progenitors and the generation of an adequate pool of neurons in the developing brain <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Genin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The expression pattern of TRMT10A in the ventricular zone of the developing cortex is consistent with its influence on neural progenitor properties, including control of survival that is known to affect brain size. In addition it may act in subsets of differentiated neurons, as suggested by its expression in cortical marginal zone and cerebellum.</p>
      <p>Early onset diabetes has been associated with microcephaly in other genetic disorders. Homozygous mutations in the <italic>IER3IP1</italic> gene encoding the immediate and early response 3 interacting protein 1 result in infantile diabetes and congenital microcephaly with simplified gyration, hypotonia, intractable seizures, and early death <xref rid="pgen.1003888-deWit1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Poulton1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Cases of microcephaly with severe neurological expression were also described in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, which includes permanent neonatal diabetes, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, osteoporosis and liver dysfunction. This syndrome is due to biallelic mutations in <italic>EIF2AK3</italic> encoding translation initiation factor 2-Î± kinase-3 <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Delepine1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. EIF2AK3 is activated upon the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER and inhibits protein translation initiation <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Harding1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Other human diseases are caused by mutations in genes encoding tRNAs and tRNA modifying enzymes. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia, characterized by hypoplasia and atrophy of ventral pons, cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, is caused by mutations in genes encoding tRNA splicing endonuclease subunits (<italic>TSEN</italic>) or mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase (<italic>RARS2</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Namavar1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes and in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases cause myopathies and neurodegenerative diseases, sometimes in association with diabetes. Recently, a syndrome of mental retardation, microcephaly and short stature was described, caused by mutations in <italic>NSUN2</italic>, encoding a methyltransferase that catalyzes the intron-dependent formation of 5-methylcytosine at C34 of tRNA-leu(CAA) <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003888-AbbasiMoheb1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. NSUN2 is the ortholog of yeast TRM4. Wild-type NSUN2 localized to the nucleolus, whereas mutant NSUN2 accumulated in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>; other <italic>NSUN2</italic> mutations resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay <xref rid="pgen.1003888-AbbasiMoheb1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Inactivation of the X-linked gene FTSJ1, another RNA methyltransferase and ortholog of yeast TRM7, gives rise to non-syndromic intellectual disability <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Najmabadi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to causing microcephaly and short stature, the <italic>TRMT10A</italic> mutation causes a severe form of diabetes, which was not reported for these other RNA methyltransferase mutations. This may be related to cell-specific requirements of RNA modifications. It is of particular interest that <italic>CDKAL1</italic> polymorphisms predispose to insulin secretion defects and T2D <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Dehwah1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. CDKAL1 was recently shown to methylthiolate tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>(UUU) <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Arragain1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The Î²-cell-specific Cdkal1 knockout mouse develops impaired glucose tolerance, due to misreading of Lys codons in proinsulin, defective insulin biosynthesis and increased susceptibility to ER stress and high fat diet <xref rid="pgen.1003888-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we describe a nonsense mutation in the <italic>TRMT10A</italic> gene in a new syndrome of young onset diabetes and microcephaly. Based on its cellular localization and by homology with its yeast counterpart, we propose that TRMT10A has methyltransferase activity. We show that TRMT10A is expressed in human fetal brain; TRMT10A silencing does not impair Î²-cell function but induces apoptosis, suggesting that TRMT10A deficiency may negatively affect Î²-cell mass and the pool of neurons in the developing brain. Our findings may have broader relevance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D and microcephaly.</p>
