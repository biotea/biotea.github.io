      <abstract>
        <p>The nuclear envelope (NE) LINC complex, in mammals comprised of SUN domain and nesprin proteins, provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular rigidity. SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A, but lamin A is only required for NE localization of SUN2, and it remains unclear how SUN1 is anchored. Here, we identify emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of SUN1/2. These have overlapping binding sites distinct from the lamin A binding site. However, we demonstrate that tight association of SUN1 with the nuclear lamina depends upon a short motif within residues 209â228, a region that does not interact significantly with known SUN1 binding partners. Moreover, SUN1 localizes correctly in cells lacking emerin. Importantly then, the major determinant of SUN1 NE localization has yet to be identified. We further find that a subset of lamin A mutations, associated with laminopathies Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), disrupt lamin A interaction with SUN1 and SUN2. Despite this, NE localization of SUN1 and SUN2 is not impaired in cell lines from either class of patients. Intriguingly, SUN1 expression at the NE is instead enhanced in a significant proportion of HGPS but not EDMD cells and strongly correlates with pre-lamin A accumulation due to preferential interaction of SUN1 with pre-lamin A. We propose that these different perturbations in lamin A-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SUN domain-containing proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that share a conserved C-terminal SUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Mammalian SUN1 and SUN2 are inner nuclear membrane (INM)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> proteins that play a major role in nuclear-cytoplasmic connection by formation of a âbridgeâ across the nuclear envelope (NE), known as the LINC complex (for review, see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), via interaction with the conserved lumenal KASH domain of nesprins located in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Whereas SUN proteins interact with the nuclear lamina component, lamin A, on the nucleoplasmic face of the NE, nesprins and their homologues in lower eukaryotes interact directly with components of the cytoskeleton via their cytoplasmic N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, the LINC complex provides a direct connection between the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton, which is believed to contribute to cellular rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and nuclear positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The genes encoding nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 are each composed of more than 100 exons, which undergo extensive alternative splicing to generate multiple isoforms that vary enormously in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Giant nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 isoforms localize to the ONM where they mediate connection with the actin cytoskeleton via an N-terminal actin binding domain. On the other hand, shorter isoforms such as nesprin-1Î± and nesprin-2Î± are thought to be located primarily on the nucleoplasmic face of the INM. Isoforms lacking the KASH domain, such as nesprin-2Î±ÎTM, may also reside within the nucleoplasm. In support of their INM localization, nesprin-1Î± and nesprin-2Î± both interact with lamin A/C and the INM protein emerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Several nuclear envelope proteins are associated with human inherited disease. The most prominent examples are lamins A and C, encoded by the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene, which are mutated in a range of disorders, termed laminopathies (for review, see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Laminopathies encompass apparently disparate phenotypes that primarily affect tissues of mesenchymal origin. Among these diseases are the fat-wasting disorder, familial partial lipodystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), and the devastating premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).</p><p>EDMD is also linked to mutations in the <italic>STA</italic> gene (encoding emerin) and the <italic>SYNE-1</italic> and <italic>SYNE-2</italic> genes (encoding nesprin-1 and nesprin-2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The fact that these proteins all interact with each other supports a common disease mechanism, which is likely to be related to weakening of the nucleoskeleton and its links with the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). On the other hand, HGPS and related progeroid phenotypes can also be caused by mutations in the <italic>ZMPSTE24</italic> gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing of pre-lamin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Findings from several studies suggest that it is persistence of a lamin A processing intermediate in HGPS that has a dominant-negative effect on nuclear structure and functions (for review, see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), the most noticeable defect being aberrant nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their role in nucleo-cytoskeletal connections, mammalian SUN proteins have more recently been implicated in chromatin binding and are reported to anchor telomeres at the nuclear periphery during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The importance of this tethering is indicated by the finding that SUN1 knock-out mice are infertile due to an inability to complete meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Similar findings have also been made in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). SUN proteins are, thus, likely to play important roles in nuclear architecture and chromatin dynamics.</p><p>Although the luminal C termini of SUN1 and SUN2 are highly conserved, the nucleoplasmic N termini are more divergent, and the SUN1 NTD is significantly larger than that of SUN2. RNAi studies have revealed that there is redundancy in SUN1/2 function with respect to anchoring of nesprins at the ONM, but other studies suggest that they also have distinct properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Both SUN1 and SUN2 have been shown to interact with lamin A, yet SUN1 remains localized at the NE in the absence of lamin A/C, whereas SUN2 largely does not. In addition, exogenously expressed SUN1 constructs can displace SUN2 from the NE, whereas the reverse is not true, suggesting that INM binding sites for SUN2 are more easily saturated than those for SUN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Together, this information indicates that SUN1 has additional nuclear binding partners, whereas SUN2 is dependent on the presence of lamin A. Here we have examined the mechanism by which SUN proteins are anchored at the NE in mammalian cells. We identify emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms as novel binding partners of both SUN1 and SUN2. Furthermore, we find that SUN protein interactions are perturbed in EDMD and HGPS, suggesting that SUN1 and SUN2 play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmid Constructs</title><p>pCI-mSUN1, pCMVTag3-mSUN1-(355â913), pCDNA3-emerin, pEGFP-nesprin-2, and pCI-LMNA mammalian expression constructs have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The mouse SUN2 cDNA (mSUN2Î30) was expressed from IMAGE clone 4951799. pCMVTag3-hSUN2 was generated by excision of the insert from pCDNA3.1 TOP/V5-His (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). pCI-LMNA mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange (Stratagene) or Genetailor (Invitrogen) site-directed mutagenesis kits. Additional pCMVTag3-mSUN1 deletion constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the relevant region of the cDNA using pCI-mSUN1 as template followed by ligation into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMVTag3B. SUN1-integrin Î²1 chimeric constructs were then generated by ligation of PCR-amplified integrin Î²1 cDNA, corresponding to residues 726â798, into the SalI and ApaI sites of the relevant pCMVTag3-mSUN1 plasmids. MBP-fused pMAL-SUN1-(1â355) and GST-fused emerin-(1â221) bacterial expression plasmids have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). GST-fused mSUN1 and mSUN2 constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the relevant regions using pCI-mSUN1 and IMAGE clone 6827666 as templates, respectively, and ligation into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T3.</p><p>pTnT-nesprin-2Î²ÎTM was generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification from human cDNA using the primers 5â²-GTGAACTCATATGGCCATGGAGCGGCGCATGGAAAT-3â² and 5â²-AGATCTATGGATCCCGCTGTGGCCGTGTGCTGCC-3â². These primers incorporated an NdeI site at the first methionine and a BamHI-stop-BglII restriction site at the 3â² end of the cDNA, allowing both C- and N-terminal histidine tagging at a later stage. The amplicon was âA-tailedâ and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Invitrogen), and the insert was verified by sequencing. To clone the nesprin-2Î² cDNA into the pTnT vector (Promega), the gene was amplified from pGEM-T Easy-Nesprin-2Î²ÎTM using 5â²-GGTACCGCCGCCACCATGGCCATGGAGCGGCGCAT-3â² and an SP6 primer. The product was then cloned into the KpnI-NotI sites in pTnT.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>AP8 emerin and mouse SUN1 affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).

Human SUN2 (2853) antibodies and mouse SUN2 (2294) antibodies were generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to residues 1â18 of human or mouse SUN2, respectively. Immunizations were performed by Cambridge Research Biochemicals.

For determining the effects of lamin A and emerin mutations on interactions with SUN1/2, pulldown assays were quantified by densitometry using Image J (National Institutes of Health), and values were normalized against the 10% input lane. Results for mutants were expressed as a percentage of the wild-type value, and the average Â± S.E. for 3â4 experiments was calculated. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transfections</title><p>HGPS fibroblasts carrying the G608G mutation (AG11513B) were obtained from the Coriell Repository, whereas those with the T623S mutation were provided by Louise Wilson (Great Ormond Street Hospital, London). Skin fibroblasts from EDMD patients were supplied by Manfred Wehnert (Institute for Human Genetics, Greifswald, Germany). NIH 3T3, U2OS, control human foreskin fibroblasts, and the patient skin fibroblast cells were all grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Human fibroblasts were used between passages 9 and 12. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells transfected with plasmids were incubated for 24â48 h post-transfection. siRNA-transfected cells were incubated for 48 h before analysis. Mouse SUN1 SMARTpool siRNAs and human and mouse lamin A/C control siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon.

This is highlighted by the gradient of the best-fit line. <italic>G</italic>, shown is an immunoblot analysis of total protein lysates from control (<italic>C</italic>) and G608G-carrying HGPS cells using lamin A/C, pre-lamin A, hSUN1 (2379), and hSUN2 (2853) antibodies. <italic>Scale bars</italic>, 10 Î¼m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0071003440007"/></fig><p>Interestingly, however, there was a noticeable variability in expression of SUN1 at the NE in cells from HGPS patients carrying the G608G and T623S mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>) that was not observed in control and partial lipodystrophy (R482W) cells. In contrast, SUN2 staining was uniform throughout (data not shown). Crisp <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) have shown that SUN1 binds more strongly to pre-lamin A than to mature lamin A; therefore, a potential explanation is that the higher levels of wild-type pre-lamin A expressed by a proportion of HGPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) lead to increased SUN1 recruitment to the NE. To test this possibility, we co-stained G608G-carrying HGPS cells with SUN1 and pre-lamin A antibodies and indeed found that SUN1 staining was more intense in cells expressing more pre-lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). In contrast, SUN2 staining was unchanged in cells expressing high or low levels of pre-lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). The results were quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of pre-lamin A together with SUN1 or SUN2 in 1000 cells, which confirmed a strong positive correlation between pre-lamin A and SUN1, but not SUN2, intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Immunoblotting confirmed increased pre-lamin A expression in HGPS fibroblasts carrying the G608G mutation. In contrast, total SUN1 and SUN2 levels were not increased but, rather, were decreased compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>G</italic>). Together, these findings suggest that increased recruitment of SUN1 to the nuclear envelope as a result of tight interaction with the accumulated pre-lamin A, contributes to the abnormalities in NE morphology and mechanical properties of HGPS cells.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Multiprotein Complexes Involving SUN Proteins at the Inner Nuclear Membrane</title><p>We have identified novel interactions between the nucleoplasmic N-terminal domains of SUN1/SUN2 and the equivalent nucleoplasmic domains of both emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms. Although emerin and some nesprin-2 isoforms have been shown to localize at least partially to the ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), with their N termini exposed to the cytoplasm, several groups have demonstrated that the SUN1 NTD is absent from the outer face of the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and we have now shown that this is also the case for SUN2. Thus, the interactions that we have identified here are highly likely to be occurring at the nucleoplasmic face of the NE. This creates an unusual situation where different domains of a single INM protein family (SUN1 and SUN2) are involved in anchoring different isoforms of the same protein (nesprin-2) on opposing faces of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). This may also explain the finding that multiple nesprin-2 isoforms, including those presumed to be located at the INM, are mislocalized from the NE in cells lacking SUN proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic model depicting SUN protein interaction networks at the nuclear envelope.</bold> The C termini of SUN1 and SUN2, residing in the NE lumen, interact with the KASH domains of giant nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 isoforms located at the ONM to connect the nucleus with the actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, the N termini of SUN1 and SUN2 form part of a four-way interaction network with the nuclear lamina, emerin, and short nesprin-2 isoforms located on the nucleoplasmic face of the NE. SUN1, emerin, and lamins also interact with chromatin-associated proteins or DNA itself. These extensive connections link the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton and are likely to be critical in maintaining both nuclear and cellular integrity. Emerin is also found at the ONM where it may be involved in centrosome attachment to the NE. Interactions between emerin and giant nesprin isoforms at the ONM cannot be ruled out.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0071003440008"/></fig><p>We found that the SUN1 binding sites for emerin and nesprin-2 map to the same region, within residues 209â302, at the distal end of the SUN1 NTD, whereas lamin A binds to a distinct site at the proximal end of the SUN1 NTD involving residues 1â138. It is currently not clear whether emerin and nesprin-2 are able to bind simultaneously to the same SUN1 molecule or whether there is competition for binding to the same site. However, because lamin A, emerin, and short nesprin isoforms are all reported to interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), it seems likely that, together with SUN proteins, they form a tight complex at the INM involving direct interactions between members of all four protein families. Given the forces exerted on the NE by the surrounding cytoskeleton in particular, this extensive network of interactions is likely to be critical for maintaining nuclear integrity and for hardwiring the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton.</p><p>Various studies have investigated how loss of individual proteins impacts on the NE localization of other components of this complex. Although carried out in several different systems, the findings indicate that lamin A/C is a core component as its absence causes mislocalization of emerin, various nesprin isoforms, and SUN2, although not SUN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). SUN1 and SUN2 have redundant roles in anchoring nesprins at the NE, whereby depletion of both proteins is necessary for nesprin mislocalization. In contrast, lamin A/C remains exclusively localized at the NE in the absence of SUN1 and SUN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Here, we have added to the picture by demonstrating in RNAi knockdown experiments that emerin is not dependent on SUN1 and SUN2 for NE localization in NIH 3T3 cells. Equally, in fibroblasts from emerin-null EDMD patients, SUN1 and SUN2 are not displaced. This confirms findings obtained using cells from a female X-EDMD carrier where SUN1 and SUN2 remained at the NE in those cells that lacked emerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Thus, the emerin-SUN interaction is not the critical factor in retaining either of these proteins at NE.</p></sec><sec><title>Does SUN1 Have Additional Binding Partners?</title><p>Importantly, the finding that SUN1 can localize to the NE in lamin A/C knock-out cells, where all other known components of the complex are mislocalized, suggests that SUN1 has completely independent means of NE anchoring. Using a range of deletion mutants, we further examined NE targeting of SUN1 and found that residues 1â208, including the lamin A binding site, are not required for NE localization of SUN1, yet fusion of just residues 1â229 of SUN1 to a heterologous transmembrane domain confers NE localization (by conferring entry to the ER and strengthening any weak NE targeting motif present). Furthermore, in pulldown experiments, we showed that residues 1â229 are not sufficient for strong interaction with emerin or nesprin-2. Together, these results strongly suggest that residues 209â228 contain the main NE targeting motif of SUN1 and that this involves binding to a currently unidentified nuclear component to retain it at the NE. Studies in both yeast and mammalian cells indicate that SUN domain proteins interact with chromatin via their N termini, and so it is possible that the main anchor for SUN1 at the INM is a chromatin-associated protein or even DNA itself.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that residues 209â228 are instead important for correct folding of the SUN1 N-terminal domain and that the binding site for the putative interactor lies outside this region. This could explain why the isolated SUN2 N-terminal domain, which lacks an equivalent sequence, was unable to interact with emerin and nesprin-2 in GST pulldown assays and was prone to cleavage when removed from its natural context in the full-length protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of SUN Protein Interactions in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy</title><p>Because mutations in lamin A, emerin, and nesprins are associated with human disease, we were interested to determine whether mutations in these proteins disrupt interactions with or localization of SUN1 and SUN2. We found that a subset of EDMD-associated <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations, namely R527P and L530P, abolish interaction of lamin A with both SUN1 and SUN2. Interestingly, these two mutations have also been shown to disrupt interaction of lamin A with emerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), again lending support to the existence of a multiprotein complex. Although these two residues are located close together within the immunoglobulin-fold of the lamin A C terminus, several other EDMD-associated mutations occur within this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) and are equally predicted to disrupt folding of the domain, including W520S, which we found to have increased binding to SUN1 and SUN2. However, this does not rule out specific localized effects of the R527P and L530P mutations.</p><p>We also found that the emerin mutation 1â169(208), which is associated with the X-linked form of EDMD, caused a reduction in interaction with the SUN proteins. This mutation involves a frameshift at residue 169 that results in the addition of a novel transmembrane region immediately followed by a premature stop codon at residue 208 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Interestingly, the same emerin mutation, which partially overlaps with the nesprin binding region in emerin, increases emerin binding to both nesprin-1Î± and nesprin-2Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Although, the emerin mutation P183T decreased binding to the SUN proteins, it was not statistically significant. However, it is interesting to note that mutations at emerin residue Pro-183 frequently perturb emerin binding partner interactions, pointing toward the importance of this region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56 B57">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Emerin constructs used in these experiments with mutations upstream of residue Gln-133 bound normally to the SUN proteins. We can, thus, speculate that the binding site of SUN1/2 to emerin lies between residues 134 and 221. Furthermore, because SUN1/2 and emerin retention at the NE is mutually independent and the emerin NE targeting motif includes residues 117â170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), which overlaps with the presumed SUN binding site, we can speculate that the SUN-emerin interaction only occurs once both proteins are at the NE.</p><p>We were unable to obtain cell lines from EDMD patients carrying mutations that perturb SUN protein interactions to determine whether they affected localization of SUN1 and SUN2 to the NE, but localization was not perturbed in cell lines carrying other EDMD-associated <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations. In keeping with our findings in emerin-null fibroblasts, this indicates that SUN protein mislocalization from the NE is not a common feature of EDMD. Nevertheless, weakening of the connections between components of the complex may have subtle yet significant effects on its overall strength and ability to resist mechanical strain, which is a favored model to explain how these mutations lead to muscle-specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). This is supported by studies on fibroblasts from lamin A/C and emerin knock-out mice and cells with disruption of the LINC complex, which exhibit nuclear fragility, reduced mechanical strength, and impaired mechanotransduction and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Furthermore, defects in emerin and SUN2 expression and localization to the NE have been observed in fibroblasts obtained from EDMD patients carrying mutations in nesprins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Increased Expression of SUN1 at the NE May Contribute to the HGPS Phenotype</title><p>We found that two HGPS-associated <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations, G608G and T623S, disrupt interaction of lamin A with SUN1 and SUN2. Both mutations generate cryptic splice sites that result in internal deletions of 50 and 35 residues, respectively, close to the C terminus of pre-lamin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), suggesting that these residues are required for binding of SUN 1 and SUN2 to lamin A. Unexpectedly, SUN1 expression at the NE appeared to be increased in a significant proportion of cells, whereas SUN2 expression was uniform. HGPS cells with the classical G608G mutation have been shown to accumulate wild-type pre-lamin A by an unknown mechanism, and expression correlates with the severity of nuclear deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). SUN1 has been reported to interact considerably more strongly with pre-lamin A than with mature lamin A, whereas SUN2 interacts relatively weakly with both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Indeed, quantification of fluorescence intensity in HGPS cells co-stained with pre-lamin A and either SUN1 or SUN2 demonstrated a striking correlation between pre-lamin A and SUN1 nuclear intensities. In contrast, SUN2 staining did not vary significantly and did not correlate with levels of pre-lamin A. In support of this, Crisp <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) found that a SUN1 deletion mutant encompassing residues 1â220 was recruited to the NE upon overexpression of pre-lamin A. These findings suggest that the increased pre-lamin A expression seen in HGPS cells leads to enhanced recruitment of SUN1 to the NE, due to their strong interaction.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that total expression levels of both SUN1 and SUN2 were reduced in HGPS cells compared with the control. This could be due to the G608G lamin A deletion mutant (LAÎ50) abolishing the interaction with SUN1 and SUN2, which may lead to a reduction in the efficiency of their recruitment to the NE and an enhancement of their degradation. However, the overexpression of pre-lamin A in a proportion of HGPS cells may compensate for the reduced interaction of SUN1 with LAÎ50, resulting in a relative increase of SUN1 NE recruitment in this population of cells.</p><p>It is interesting to note that classical HGPS cells are reported to have increased nuclear stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), which may be due to the reduced ability of the LAÎ50 mutant to fit into the lamina structure leading to loss of elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Our findings indicate that a further explanation may be the increased recruitment of SUN1 to the NE in cells overexpressing pre-lamin A, strengthening links both to the nuclear lamina and, via the LINC complex, to the cytoskeleton. In apparent conflict with this, Kandert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) found that nesprin-2 giant expression is significantly reduced in HGPS cells with aberrant nuclear morphology (a phenotype that correlates with increased pre-lamin A expression). Further studies will be required to confirm whether increased NE expression of SUN1 directly contributes to the defects in nuclear morphology and mechanical properties in HGPS.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec>
