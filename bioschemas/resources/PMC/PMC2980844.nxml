      <abstract>
        <p id="P3">Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pattern of kidney injury observed either as an idiopathic finding or as a consequence of underlying systemic conditions. Several genes have been identified which, when mutated, lead to inherited FSGS and/or the nephrotic syndrome. These findings have accelerated the understanding of glomerular podocyte function and disease, motivating our search for additional FSGS genes. Using linkage analysis, we identified a locus for autosomal dominant FSGS on a region of chromosome 14q. By sequencing multiple genes in this region, we detected nine independent non-conservative missense mutations in <italic>INF2</italic>, which encodes a member of the formin family of actin regulating proteins. These mutations, all within the diaphanous inhibitory domain, segregate with disease in 11 unrelated families and alter highly conserved amino acid residues. The observation that mutations in this podocyte-expressed formin cause FSGS highlights the importance of fine regulation of actin polymerization in podocyte function.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P4">We genotyped members of a large family with apparent autosomal dominant FSGS using a dense set of SNP markers (Affymetrix 250K SNPChip array) followed by focused microsatellite genotyping. We identified a locus for FSGS in this family on 14q32 (family FGJN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). This region overlapped with a larger locus that we previously identified by linkage analysis in another large family with a similar clinical course (family FGBR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We suspected that FSGS in both families was caused by a defect in the same gene. Under this assumption, the critical region was defined by flanking SNPs rs3783397 (at approximately 103 Mb on the Marshfield map) and rs6576201 (at approximately 106 Mb).</p>
    <p id="P5">We used public databases to identify genes in this region. We sequenced 15 genes in affected members of the FGBR and FGJN families. We found a sequence variant in each family within the same exon of <italic>INF2</italic> that segregated with disease and predicted a non-conservative amino-acid change (R218Q in FGJN and S186P in FGBR). We observed no significant sequence variants in the other genes analyzed. The R218Q variant found in family FGJN was a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation, as the first individual in the family carrying this R218Q variant shared the disease associated haplotype, but not this variant, with several unaffected siblings (not shown).</p>
    <p id="P6">We then sequenced <italic>INF2</italic> in 91 unrelated individuals with familial FSGS. In probands from nine additional families, we identified point mutations leading to non-conservative amino acid changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We typed these variants in available family members. We considered a family member to be affected if he/she had biopsy-proven FSGS, ESRD without other apparent cause, or significant albuminuria without other apparent cause (&gt; 250 mg albumin per gram creatinine). We found that these mutations segregated with disease in their respective families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In five families, some younger individuals carrying these point mutations had no increase in urine protein, consistent with reduced, age-related penetrance, similar to the phenotypes associated with <italic>TRPC6</italic> and <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. We found nucleotide variants in exons 8, 18, and 20, but these did not segregate with disease and were found in control individuals. All of the disease segregating mutations are located within the region of INF2 known as the diaphanous-inhibitory domain, or DID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), and most reside within exon 4<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P7">To be certain that these variants were not polymorphisms, and to be certain that the <italic>INF2</italic> gene is not a site of frequent but biologically insignificant variation, we resequenced exon 4, the location of all but two of the putative mutations, in 282 control individuals. None of these individuals carried any of these putative disease-causing <italic>INF2</italic> variants, nor any other missense or splicing variation. We genotyped the two putative disease-causing mutations found in exon 2 (A13T, L42P) as well as the E184K and R218Q mutations in an additional 341 control individuals using Sequenom assays. Neither variant was present in any of the 682 chromosomes assayed.</p>
    <p id="P8">The phenotype in families with INF2 mutations shares certain features. Unlike the early onset, nephrotic presentation seen with mutations in the slit-diaphragm proteins nephrin and podocin, these individuals presented in early adolescence or adulthood, typically with moderate proteinuria. While we documented nephrotic range proteinuria in members of several of these families, none of the affected individuals displayed the spectrum of clinical findings that constitutes the so-called nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic hematuria and hypertension were noted in some affected individuals. Similar to patients with mutations in ACTN4, disease and proteinuria were progressive, often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p>
    <p id="P9">We reviewed available renal biopsy tissue samples from individuals with <italic>INF2</italic> mutations. Light microscopy typically showed FSGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). In these biopsies, electron microscopy showed focal areas of podocyte foot process effacement, typical of secondary and some genetic forms of FSGS, as well as areas where foot processes and slit-diaphragms were well preserved. We also noted unusually prominent actin bundles within the foot processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Glomerular hypertrophy was not a prominent feature of the biopsies. Neither we nor the original pathology reports noted perihilar, collapsing, or cellular lesions that characterize some subtypes of FSGS. Thus, these biopsies would be categorized as âFSGS, not-otherwise-specifiedâ following one widely adopted classification scheme<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P10">We examined the expression of <italic>INF2</italic> in the kidney by in situ hybridization and by antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). Both showed <italic>INF2</italic> expression in the podocyte. We examined expression of INF2 and the slit-diaphragm protein nephrin together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). INF2 expression showed areas of colocalization with nephrin in podocytes. Some INF2 staining was also noted in a pericapillary pattern, suggesting expression in cells other than podocytes. Within the podocyte, antibody staining showed what appeared to be a predominantly perinuclear pattern of INF2. Northern blot analysis showed <italic>INF2</italic> expression in all tissues tested and identified <italic>INF2</italic> transcripts of approximately 1.5 and 4.5 kb in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). This was consistent with previous reports describing <italic>INF2</italic> as well as the major transcripts predicted from ESTs and genomic sequence analysis as collated in the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P11">INF2 is a member of the formin family of actin-regulating proteins that accelerate actin polymerization<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. All of the FSGS-associated mutations we identified lie within the DID. The DID is an autoinhibitory domain found in the diaphanous formins. In the best studied diaphanous formin, mDia1, the interaction of the N-terminal DID with the C-terminal diaphanous activating domain (DAD) inhibits mDia1 function; this inhibition is relieved by binding to Rho <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. We used structural data available for the N-terminal region of mDia1 to map the mutated INF2 residues and make functional predictions. Our INF2 model derived from the mDia1-RhoC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 c,d,e</xref>) was in agreement with models derived from the other available mDia1 structures (not shown)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Two mutated residues, R214 and R218, lie close to the DAD-binding region of the DID. R214 is on the surface of the DID in proximity to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). R218 is predominately buried but has a small region of surface exposure in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Three other mutated residues (L42, S186, E220) are surface-exposed but on the opposite side of the DID structure from the DAD-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). The A13 position is surface-exposed and lies at the N-terminus of the DID, in the region corresponding to the GTPase binding domain of mDia1. Two of the mutated residues are buried in the core DID structure (E184, L198).</p>
    <p id="P12">Based on these models, we can postulate potential functions for the mutated INF2 residues. R214 and R218 likely form part of the DAD binding site, given their spatial proximity to key DAD-binding residues A149 and I152. The prominent exposure of L42, S186, and E220 on the DID surface raises the possibility that they interact with other molecules. Since the N-terminus of mDia1 plays a major role in its cellular localization<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, the N-terminus of INF2 could also mediate localization. We postulate that E184, L198, and R218 are likely to be important for maintaining the overall fold of the DID. These residues are buried in the interior in all of our models and the identified mutations (E184K and L198R, R218Q) could have effects on the integrity of the DID.</p>
    <p id="P13">We inserted two mutations (E184K and R218Q) predicted to have large effects on the structural integrity of the DID into the INF2 cDNA. We also inserted a third mutation located away from the DAD binding site (S186P) into the cDNA. These three mutations included the two (E186P and R218Q) found in the large families used in the initial genetic linkage analysis. We examined cultured podocytes transfected with wild-type or mutant INF2 (E184K, S186P, and R218Q, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Wild-type transfected podocytes showed perinuclear INF2 staining, while INF2 harboring E184K and R218Q mutations showed a different localization pattern, with a finer, more diffuse distribution. The cellular localization of the S186P mutant INF2 was closer to the pattern observed in the wild-type cells but with a more vermiform appearance. Both the wild-type and mutant forms of INF2 showed significant costaining with phalloidin, consistent with the notion that these proteins induced actin polymerization at their localization, with the overall staining of phalloidin mimicking that of INF2. In the mutant transfected cells, stress fibers and cortical actin were less prominent. The similar and more dramatic changes seen with the E184K and R218Q mutants are consistent with the predicted effect on the overall INF2 DID structure. Furthermore, these data suggest that the DID domain is critical for the subcellular localization of INF2, and is consistent with data demonstrating that it is not required for the ability of INF2 to mediate actin polymerization<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. While these mutant forms of INF2 clearly behave differently than the wild-type, the relationship between this altered behavior and the disease mechanism remains to be clarified.</p>
    <p id="P14">The cumulative evidence we have presented demonstrates that mutations in the <italic>INF2</italic> gene cause an autosomal dominant form of FSGS. In two large families, we found evidence of genetic linkage to a region on chromosome 14 containing <italic>INF2</italic>. We identified missense mutations in <italic>INF2</italic> in 11 of 93 families examined. These mutations cause non-conservative substitutions in amino acids that are highly conserved through evolution. Within the individual families harboring these mutations, inheritance of the mutation segregates with disease. Seven of the nine distinct mutations occur in close proximity within exon 4, and all nine lie within the diaphanous inhibitory domain. By resequencing, we verified that neither these mutations, nor other non-synonymous DID variants, are present in control groups.<italic> INF2</italic> is highly expressed in the kidney including in glomerular podocytes, the cell type thought to initiate most forms of FSGS. Electron microscopy of kidney biopsy material from an <italic>INF2</italic>-mutant FSGS patient showed irregular podocyte foot process morphology and prominent actin bundles. In addition, transfection studies of overexpressed wild-type and FSGS-associated mutant forms of <italic>INF2</italic> indicate differences in the subcellular localization of mutant and wild-type protein, as well as differences in the pattern of distribution of the associated F-actin. In the electron micrographs, prominent actin filament bundles are noted, whereas actin filaments appear somewhat less prominent than normal in the INF2-mutant expressing cells. The precise mechanism by which actin behavior is disrupted in the presence of INF2 mutations <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be defined.</p>
    <p id="P15">Formins are a family of proteins that accelerate actin filament assembly<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. INF2 has the unique ability to accelerate both polymerization as well as depolymerization of actin <italic>in vitro</italic>, and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum in fibroblasts. All of the disease-causing <italic>INF2</italic> mutations we identified are located within the N-terminal regulatory portion containing the DID<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The DID binds the DAD region of INF2 and autoinhibits INF2-mediated actin depolymerization but not actin polymerization<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Previously published work shows that expression of an INF2 mutant in which the DID/DAD interaction is blocked causes actin filament accumulation around the ER and collapse of the ER onto the nuclear membrane<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Here, we find that mutations in the DID predicted to severely affect the domain structure (E184K, R218Q) do not appear to prevent INF2 mediated actin filament accumulation, but do alter INF2 and F-actin localization.</p>
    <p id="P16">Podocytes are complex, actin-rich, interdigitating structures that must be able to react to a unique set of physical and chemical stresses. Dysregulation of the podocyte cytoskeleton is a common feature of glomerular disease states<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The proximal trigger leading to altered actin behavior in podocytes can derive from external signals (e.g. from the slit-diaphragm<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) or internally (as seen in Î±-actinin-4 mutations<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Similar to what has been observed with Î±-actinin-4, INF2 is a widely expressed actin-binding protein which when mutated causes a podocyte-limited phenotype. Our results support a model of podocytes as dynamic structures that are extremely sensitive to alterations in the spatial or temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesize that individuals harboring disease-associated <italic>INF2</italic> mutations have a defect in actin-mediated podocyte structural maintenance and repair. Future studies aimed at defining how <italic>INF2</italic> mutations lead to disease will contribute to our understanding of podocyte biology and FSGS as well as our understanding of the common forms of kidney disease characterized by podocyte dysfunction.</p>

Sections were then fixed and acetylated, and hybridized to the probe at 70Â°C for approximately 72 hrs (approximate concentration 100 ng/ml). Hybridized probe was visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG Fab fragments (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/Nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate (Kierkegard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Sections were rinsed several times in 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA pH 9.5, and coverslipped with glycerol gelatin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

        <p id="P33">c, d, and e: Model of mouse INF2 amino acids 1â330, based on the structure of mDia1 (1). Mutated residues are shown in red, and residues important for the interaction with DAD are shown in blue.</p>
        <p id="P34">c. View of mDia1 showing the positions of A13 and R218 (red). Residues important for the direct interaction with DAD are shown in blue, including R106 (corresponding to K213 in mDia1), N110 (corresponding to N217 in mDia1), A149 (corresponding to A256 in mDia1), and I152 (corresponding to I259 in mDia1). Based on the crystal structure of the mDia1 DID/DAD complex (reference <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the alpha helical INF2 DAD is predicted to lie in the pocket containing these residues, with its N-terminus (D974) contacting R106 and N110, and L986 contacting A149 and I152. In this model, we predict that R218 would contact residues C-terminal to L986.</p>

        <p id="P37">a, b: Kidney biopsy findings in an affected member of family FSB with an E220K INF2 mutation. This patient was 21 years of age at the time of biopsy with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 96 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. She had 3+ urine protein and no hematuria. She developed ESRD seven years after the biopsy was performed. a. Light micrograph (PAS) showing focal global and segmental glomerulosclerosis. b. Electron micrograph showing segmental foot process effacement in some loops (arrowheads) and focally irregular morphology of preserved foot processes. Inset: Higher magnification electron micrograph showing foot processes en face, projecting from a major process. The foot processes appear irregular and jagged, often with prominent longitudinal actin bundles. c, d: Kidney biopsy findings from a different <italic>INF2</italic> mutant patient with an R218Q mutation, from family FGJN. This patient was 26 years old at the time of biopsy. Estimated GFR was 46 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and urine showed 3+ protein and trace blood at the time. c: Light micrograph (PAS) showing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, with moderate chronic parenchymal damage. d: Electron micrograph showing segmental foot process effacement (arrowheads).</p>

        <p id="P39">Localization of INF2 variants in undifferentiated cultured human podocytes. Cells were cultured on coverslips coated with type I collagen. INF2 is visualized using a Cy3 conjugated antibody against its C-terminus <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. FITC phalloidin was used to stain F-actin, and nuclei are stained with DAPI. First column: cells expressing wild-type and three different mutant forms of INF2. Second column: INF2 channel. Third column: Phalloidin. Rows: results for WT and three mutant forms of INF2: E184K, S186P, and R218Q. E184K and R218Q mutants show diffuse localization of INF2 and F-actin compared with the perinuclear INF2 staining seen with the WT expressing cells. The S186P looked similar to WT expressing cells, but INF2 expression was more vermiform in appearance. In all three mutants, stress fibers and cortical actin appeared to be less prominent.</p>
