        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>We report that the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which is induced in most tumor types, is required for neoplastic growth and confers transforming potential to noncancerous cells. TRAP1 binds to and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), the complex II of the respiratory chain. The respiratory downregulation elicited by TRAP1 interaction with SDH promotes tumorigenesis by priming the succinate-dependent stabilization of the proneoplastic transcription factor HIF1Î± independently of hypoxic conditions. These findings provide a mechanistic clue to explain the switch to aerobic glycolysis of tumors and identify TRAP1 as a promising antineoplastic target.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tumors undergo sustained growth in a dynamic environment where oxygen and nutrients are often scarce (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Denko, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). To cope with the energetic requirements of rapid proliferation in these challenging conditions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fritz and Fajas, 2010</xref>), tumor cells profoundly reorganize their core metabolism (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cairns etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Levine and Puzio-Kuter, 2010</xref>). Glucose utilization, which provides ATP, essential anabolic intermediates, and antioxidative defenses (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hsu and Sabatini, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Vander Heiden etÂ al., 2009</xref>), is boosted and dissociated from oxygen availability (the Warburg effect; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Warburg, 1956</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Warburg etÂ al., 1927</xref>). Key to the Warburg effect is the decrease of mitochondrial respiration (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Frezza and Gottlieb, 2009</xref>), which allows cancer cells to grow in the hypoxic conditions found in the interior of the tumor mass (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hsu and Sabatini, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in tumors are understood only partially. The transcription factor HIF1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) decreases the flux of pyruvate into the Krebs cycle and, hence, the flow of reducing equivalents needed to power the electron transport chain (ETC) and stimulates glycolysis by inducing glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Denko, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Semenza, 2010b</xref>). HIF is activated by hypoxia as well as by the accumulation of the Krebs cycle metabolites succinate and fumarate that inhibit the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) responsible for proteasomal degradation of the HIF1Î± subunit (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Selak etÂ al., 2005</xref>). Succinate accumulation can originate from loss-of-function mutations in any of the genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits (or their assembly factor SDHAF2), which cause hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome and are associated to a number of other neoplasms (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bardella etÂ al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Within this conceptual framework, we have analyzed the activity of TRAP1, an evolutionarily conserved chaperone of the Hsp90 family mainly located in the mitochondrial matrix and overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types, where it exerts antiapoptotic functions through mechanisms that are only partially understood (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Altieri etÂ al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kang etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Our results indicate that TRAP1 supports tumor progression by downmodulating mitochondrial respiration through a decrease in the activity of SDH, which leads to HIF1Î± stabilization even in the absence of hypoxic conditions, by increasing succinate levels.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.1">
        <title>Mitochondrial TRAP1 Promotes Neoplastic Transformation</title>
        <p>We found that TRAP1 is localized in mitochondria of cancer cell models (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B available online), as expected (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Altieri etÂ al., 2012</xref>), and that downregulation of TRAP1 expression by RNAi abrogated any transforming potential. In fact, knockdown of TRAP1 expression made SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells, HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, and HeLa cervix carcinoma cells (dubbed shTRAP1 cells; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>CâS1E) unable to both form foci (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A) and grow in soft agar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B) without affecting the rate of cell growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>C). Notably, shTRAP1 tumor cells lost the ability to develop tumor masses when injected into nude mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Conversely, when the TRAP1 complementary DNA (cDNA) was expressed in either RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells or fibroblasts, these nontransformed cells acquired the capacity to form colonies in soft agar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2D), and downregulation of TRAP1 expression in RWPE-2 prostate cells, which are transformed by expression of v-Ki-Ras in RWPE-1 cells (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Rasola etÂ al., 2010a</xref>), abolished their tumorigenic features (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Moreover, stable transfection of a murine TRAP1 cDNA, which is insensitive to human-directed small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs, reinstalled the tumorigenic capability of shTRAP1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). Mitochondrial localization of TRAP1 was essential for its proneoplastic activity, as expression of a TRAP1 cDNA devoid of its mitochondrial targeting sequence was not tumorigenic in either cancer or nontransformed cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2">
        <title>TRAP1 Binds SDH and Inhibits its Succinate:Coenzyme Q Reductase Enzymatic Activity</title>
        <p>We then asked whether TRAP1 promotes transformation by acting on mitochondrial metabolism, thus contributing to the Warburg phenotype. This could occur through an inhibitory effect on respiration. We used a blue native (BN)-PAGE approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A), which allows the separation and characterization of protein complexes under nondenaturing conditions (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wittig and SchÃ¤gger, 2008</xref>), to investigate a possible interaction between TRAP1 and ETC complexes. By cutting BN-PAGE bands and running them on an SDS-PAGE, we could observe the association between TRAP1 and both complex IV (cytochrome oxidase, COX) and complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, SDH) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). Moreover, by performing an immunoblot directly on the BN-PAGE, we found TRAP1 to be in correspondence with both complex IV and complex II bands; notably, these bands were diffused, and TRAP1 colocalized with their upper portion, suggesting that TRAP1 contributes to form a multimeric complex of higher molecular weight than the ETC complex per se (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). We confirmed the interaction between TRAP1 and complex II/SDH through further approaches, including (1) immunoprecipitation, finding coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) of TRAP1 with SDH and vice versa (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C), and (2) mitochondrial protein crosslinking with dimethyl 3,3â²-dithiobis-propionimidate (DTBP), a homobifunctional compound that reacts with the primary amines of two interacting proteins at an average distance of about 8Â Ã (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Giorgio etÂ al., 2009</xref>), followed by TRAP1 immunoprecipitation in order to determine whether TRAP1 and SDH are closely associated. We found that two TRAP1/SDH complexes are formed in mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D).</p>
        <p>We then measured whether TRAP1 affects complex II enzymatic activity. Complex II couples the Krebs cycle to OXPHOS by oxidizing succinate to fumarate and then transferring electrons to coenzyme Q; hence, the enzyme is called either SDH or succinate:coenzyme Q reductase (SQR; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cecchini, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lemarie and Grimm, 2011</xref>). SQR activity can be assessed spectrophotometrically in permeabilized mitochondria after inhibition of the other ETC complexes by recording the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) in the presence of succinate as an electron donor and coenzyme Q1 as an intermediate electron acceptor. The slope of the absorbance decline of DCPIP is directly proportional to SQR activity (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>A). We found that SQR enzymatic activity was increased in mitochondria from shTRAP1 cells relative to those derived from control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A, and S2B). TRAP1 did not affect either the cytochrome oxidase enzymatic activity of complex IV (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>C) or complex II protein levels (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>D) or mitochondrial mass (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>E). Specificity of TRAP1 inhibition on SDH was assessed by (1) expression of the mouse TRAP1 (in shTRAP1 cells) that is insensitive to human-directed shTRAP1 constructs, which resulted in inhibition of SQR activity to values similar to those of mock cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A), and (2) using an inhibitor of TRAP1/Hsp90 ATPase activity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Felts etÂ al., 2000</xref>), 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), whose availability to mitochondria was recently shown inÂ situ (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Xie etÂ al., 2011</xref>); 17-AAG specifically increased SQR activity in control mitochondria, whereas shTRAP1 mitochondria were insensitive to the drug (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A, 4B, and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>B). Notably, the effect of 17-AAG was unrelated to Hsp90, as Hsp90 protein levels were the same in mock and shTRAP1 cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>F). The SQR activity of ETC complex II was further inhibited in mitochondria from control cells that progressed through the focus-forming assay compared to mitochondria from the same cells kept in standard culture conditions, whereas no change in SQR activity could be appreciated in mitochondria from shTRAP1 cells during the focus-forming experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). 17-AAG could still reactivate the SDH enzyme in mitochondria of TRAP1-expressing cells undergoing the focus-forming process (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B), indicating that even the enhanced inhibition of SQR activity occurring during the inÂ vitro transformation progression is mediated by TRAP1 and remains reversible. In further accord with an inhibitory function of TRAP1 on ETC complex II, mitochondria from MEF cells stably expressing TRAP1 showed a diminished SQR activity compared to controls, and this inhibition was increased during the focus-forming assay; 17-AAG reactivated SDH selectively in mitochondria from TRAP1-expressing MEFs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C).</p>

        <title>TRAP1 Induction Inhibits Complex II Enzymatic Activity in Human Colorectal Cancers</title>
        <p>TRAP1 expression was shown to be increased in a variety of tumor types (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kang etÂ al., 2007</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/" id="intref0010">http://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>). We analyzed the SQR activity of ETC complex II in a set of human colorectal cancer samples and compared it with that measured in the surrounding nontransformed mucosa for each patient. In all colorectal cancer samples at stage IV, characterized by metastases to lymph nodes and to distant sites, and in the majority of samples of stage IâIII, characterized by the absence of distant metastases, TRAP1 was upregulated relative to normal mucosa (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Costantino etÂ al., 2009</xref>). When we measured SQR activity in extracts from these samples, we found that TRAP1 upregulation was always paralleled by a decrease in SQR activity, and that this decrease could be partially rescued by adding 17-AAG before starting recordings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). In a small subset of stage IâIII colorectal cancers, TRAP1 expression was not induced relative to surrounding nontumor tissues. In these samples, we could not detect any difference in SQR activity between samples from tumor and normal mucosa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E), strengthening the link between TRAP1 and the regulation of complex II activity.</p>

        <title>TRAP1 Inhibits Cell Oxygen Consumption Rate and ATP Production by OXPHOS</title>
        <p>The SQR assays described so far measure the maximal enzymatic activity of complex II, as the complex is made accessible in permeabilized mitochondria and exposed to an excess of substrates. We next analyzed whether TRAP1 also affects the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of living cells. Downregulation of TRAP1 markedly increased mitochondrial-dependent respiration in all cancer cell models we tested (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>A, and S3B); in full accord with the effect of the drug on SQR activity (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A), the TRAP1 inhibitor 17-AAG increased OCR only in TRAP1-expressing cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>A). In shTRAP1 cells, the extra OCR was used to make ATP, as it was inhibited byÂ the ATP synthase blocker oligomycin; moreover, addition of the uncoupler FCCP increased respiration well above the basal level, indicating an increased respiratory capacity that remained fully sensitive to ETC inhibition by rotenone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). The comparison with control cells is striking because, unlike shTRAP1 cells, they already utilize their maximal respiratory capacity under basal conditions, as shown by the lack of OCR increase with FCCP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A), an arrangement implying that any additional ATP requirement must be provided by glycolysis. Consistently, we found that OXPHOS marginally contributes to ATP synthesis in mock cells, whereas a high proportion of the intracellular ATP content is provided by glycolysis, with a marked increase of glycolytic ATP during the inÂ vitro tumorigenic process; instead, in shTRAP1 cells, most of the ATP comes from OXPHOS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B). Moreover, expression of the TRAP1 cDNA in nontransformed fibroblasts markedly inhibited basal OCR and abolished any respiratory reserve (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C), mimicking the respiratory pattern of TRAP1-expressing tumor cells. Expression in shTRAP1 cells of the murine TRAP1 insensitive to human-directed shTRAP1 constructs determined an OCR pattern indistinguishable from that of mock cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D).</p>

        <title>TRAP1 Induces Succinate Accumulation and HIF1Î± Stabilization, which Is Required for Tumor Cell Growth</title>
        <p>It was shown that succinate induces HIF1 by inhibiting PHDs, the enzymes that hydroxylate HIF1Î±, allowing its subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Selak etÂ al., 2005</xref>). We observed that during the focus-forming assay, the intracellular level of succinate increased only in TRAP1-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A), matching the downmodulation of their SDH enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). In keeping with these results, HIF1Î± was detectable exclusively in TRAP1-expressing cells during the focus-forming process (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B), whereas it was hydroxylated on Pro residues (i.e., primed for proteasomal degradation) both in culture conditions, independently of the presence of TRAP1, and in shTRAP1 cells exposed to focus-forming conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C). HIF2Î±, which shares some redundant functions with HIF1Î± and whose expression is increased in a broad spectrum of cancer cell types (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Keith etÂ al., 2012</xref>), was not stabilized in our experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D). We then used pimonidazole, a compound that is reductively activated under hypoxic conditions and forms protein adducts by reacting with Cys residues (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arteel etÂ al., 1998</xref>), to understand whether HIF1Î± stabilization could at least partially depend on hypoxic conditions occurring during the formation of foci. Remarkably, we could not detect any induction of pimonidazole-protein adducts in TRAP1-expressing cells during the process of inÂ vitro tumorigenesis, even when HIF1Î± had already been stabilized (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E), which demonstrates that pseudohypoxic conditions elicited by the presence of TRAP1 are sufficient to promote HIF1Î± stabilization. Tumor samples obtained from nude mice xenografted with TRAP1-expressing SAOS-2 cells (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D) were characterized by densely packed cells, amidst which fibrotic and necrotic areas could be observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F, marked as F and N, respectively); HIF1Î± was clearly detected in the majority of cells, the signal being particularly strong in the nuclei of cells where proliferation markers were also evident (compare the MIB/Ki67 and the HIF1Î± staining in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F). In these samples, cells displayed a punctate TRAP1 signal that fits well with its mitochondrial localization (see the high-magnification TRAP1 staining in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F). The addition of dimethyl succinate, a membrane-permeable succinate analog, to the focus-forming culture medium both stabilized HIF1Î± (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A) and rescued the capability to form colonies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B) in shTRAP1 cells, while it did not further increase the tumorigenicity of TRAP1-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). Moreover, HIF1Î± inhibition either with a cell-permeable esterified formÂ of Î±-ketoglutarate (1-trifluoromethylbenzyl-Î±-ketoglutarate, TaKG), which reverses HIF1Î± stabilization by restoring PHD enzymatic activity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">MacKenzie etÂ al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tennant etÂ al., 2009</xref>), or with RNAi on HIF1Î± or HIF1Î², the latter being the stable subunit of the heterodimeric HIF transcription factors (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Keith etÂ al., 2012</xref>), fully abolished formation of foci in TRAP1-expressing tumor cells and in MEFs transfected with a TRAP1 cDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>Câ7F). Taken together, these data indicate that TRAP1 prompts neoplastic growth by inducing a succinate-dependent stabilization of HIF1Î±.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Tumor cells tend to increase their glycolytic activity without a matching increase of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Warburg, 1956</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Warburg etÂ al., 1927</xref>). Inhibition of the tumor suppressor p53 or activation of the transcription factor HIF1 curtails OXPHOS by inducing the autophagic degradation of respiratory complexes and by abrogating the synthesis of some of their subunits (such as SDHB) or assembly factors (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Denko, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Semenza, 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Vousden and Ryan, 2009</xref>). Conversely, OXPHOS inhibition can play a causal role in tumorigenesis. Inactivating mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes encoding for subunits of ETC complexes I and III were found associated with renal oncocytomas (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gasparre etÂ al., 2008</xref>) as well as thyroid and prostate cancers (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Amero etÂ al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Petros etÂ al., 2005</xref>). However, these mutations are confined to a small set of neoplasms, and the lack of clear-cut molecular mechanisms hampers the definition of whether OXPHOS inhibition as such can play a general tumorigenic role. Key findings of theÂ present work demonstrate that the mitochondrial chaperoneÂ TRAP1, which is widely expressed in most tumors, but notÂ inÂ highly proliferating, nontransformed cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/" id="intref0015">http://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>), is a component of the molecular machinery that decreases mitochondrial respiration and that this event is crucial for neoplastic progression. Indeed, we find that TRAP1 behaves as an oncogene since (i) without TRAP1, tumorigenesis is blunted both inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo, and (ii) TRAP1 expression confers tumorigenic potential to nontransformed cells. We observe that TRAP1-mediated inhibition of SDH limits the maximal rate of respiration and leads to succinate accumulation followed by HIF1Î±, but not HIF2Î±, stabilization. Remarkably, the membrane-permeable succinate analog dimethyl succinate could both elicit HIF1Î± stabilization and rescue the tumorigenic phenotype of shTRAP1 cells, highlighting the mechanistic connectionÂ between TRAP1-dependent succinate accumulation and HIF1Î±-dependent tumor formation.</p>
      <p>The role played by the transcription factor HIF1 in tumorigenesis is complex. Once activated by inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of its Î± subunit (either HIF1Î± or HIF2Î±), and by the ensuing association with the stable Î² subunit (HIF1Î²), HIF1 can boost evolution of neoplasms by promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the glycolytic switch (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brahimi-Horn etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Semenza, 2010a</xref>). In multiple tumor models, both HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± promote neoplastic progression by regulating sets of genes that are only partially shared, and independent roles for HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± can depend on the cancer type or on its growth and progression stages (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Keith etÂ al., 2012</xref>). However, both Î± subunits can play a tumor suppressor function in specific tumor types, such as renal cell carcinoma (HIF1Î±) or lung adenocarcinoma (HIF2Î±), through poorly defined mechanisms. In our model, HIF1Î± stabilization, and the ensuing HIF activation, have a crucial proneoplastic role, as promoting HIF1Î± degradation or knocking down either HIF1Î± or HIF1Î² abolishes the neoplastic potential of TRAP1-expressing cells. Instead, we could not observe any HIF2Î± stabilization, ruling out its role in the TRAP1-dependent tumorigenic process. It is interesting that HIF2Î± accumulates at higher O<sub>2</sub> concentrations than HIF1Î± (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Keith etÂ al., 2012</xref>), and the possibility exists that, at variance with what we observe for HIF1Î±, pseudohypoxic conditions are insufficient or unable to stabilize HIF2Î±.</p>
      <p>HIF1Î± stabilization emerges after several days of inÂ vitro transformation. This is not at all surprising because excess succinate can be utilized in multiple pathways, including increased heme synthesis (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Frezza etÂ al., 2011</xref>), and because SDH becomes more strongly inhibited by TRAP1 during the focus-forming assay. The latter observation also suggests that a threshold SDH inhibition must be reached to allow for succinate accumulation. Despite a partial respiratory inhibition, TRAP1-expressing cells fully utilize their residual respiratory capacity to produce ATP, as shown by OCR experiments, but reorient their metabolism toward glycolysis to meet any energy demand that exceeds respiratory capacity, in complete accord with Warburgâs observations.</p>
      <p>TRAP1 is likely to begin a feedforward loop, as it inhibits SDH and respiration (hence OXPHOS) and induces HIF1, which in turn further inhibits OXPHOS (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Denko, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Semenza, 2010b</xref>) and directly downregulates SDH by induction of miR-210 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">PuissÃ©gur etÂ al., 2011</xref>). Notably, we have determined that TRAP1-dependent stabilization of HIF1Î± occurs in a pseudohypoxic way (i.e., in the absence of any hypoxic stress). This observation has potential implications for the kinetics of tumor development, as TRAP1 could induce HIF1 transcriptional activity even before the dysregulated accrual of the tumor mass creates hypoxic areas in its inner core.</p>
      <p>At variance with the complete block of the SDH enzyme, which is an extreme case caused by loss-of-function mutations only seen in specific subsets of tumors (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bardella etÂ al., 2011</xref>), the partial and reversible SDH inhibition caused by TRAP1 and its increased expression levels would mediate a more general proneoplastic function, which fits with TRAP1 identification as a bona fide inducible target of the proto-oncogene c-Myc (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Coller etÂ al., 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Tumor cells could be endowed with a multichaperone mitochondrial complex, as TRAP1 interacts with cyclophilin D, Hsp90, and Hsp60 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kang and Altieri, 2009</xref>). Given the multiplicity of chaperone client proteins, we cannot exclude further interactions of TRAP1 with other mitochondrial components. For instance, TRAP1 is involved in the inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kang etÂ al., 2007</xref>), whose opening irreversibly commits cells to death (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rasola and Bernardi, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rasola etÂ al., 2010b</xref>), and we have observed that keeping the pore locked can be used by tumor cells to evade apoptosis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Rasola etÂ al., 2010a</xref>). Thus, TRAP1 could take part in several mitochondrial changes that crucially contribute to the neoplastic phenotype. Targeting its chaperone activity and molecular interactors could dismantle the metabolic and survival adaptations of neoplastic cells, paving the way to the development of highly selective, mitochondriotropic antineoplastic drugs.</p>

        <p>TRAP1 Knockdown Inhibits InÂ Vitro and InÂ Vivo Neoplastic Transformation</p>
        <p>(A and B) Human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells, and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells lose the capability to form foci (A) or colonies in soft agar (B) after knocking down TRAP1 expression. Cells stably transfected with a scrambled shRNA or with TRAP1 shRNAs are dubbed mock and shTRAP1, respectively. Data indicate the total focus or colony area at the 25<sup>th</sup> experimental day. Representative areas showing focus or colony growth are reported.</p>

        <p>Mitochondrial TRAP1 Confers Transforming Potential to Cells</p>
        <p>(A and B) Soft agar tumorigenesis assays were performed both in nontransformed cells (i.e., human epithelial prostate RWPE-1 cells) (A) and MEFs (D), stably transfected with either a TRAP1 cDNA or with a scrambled shRNA (mock); and in transformed cells, i.e., human epithelial prostate RWPE-2 cells obtained by <italic>v</italic>-Ki-Ras expression in RWPE-1 cells (B); cells dubbed shTRAP1a and shTRAP1b were transfected with different TRAP1 shRNAs.</p>
        <p>(C) Expression of a mouse TRAP1 cDNA (mTRAP1) insensitive to human-directed shTRAP1 constructs reinstated the capability to form foci in human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells stably transfected with TRAP1 shRNAs (shTRAP1).</p>
        <p>(D and E) Growth of colonies in soft agar was also assessed in MEF cells (D) or in SAOS-2 shTRAP1 cells (E) stably transfected with a TRAP1 construct lacking the mitochondrial import sequence (ÎNTRAP1). Western immunoblots show TRAP1 expression levels in the different cell types; GAPDH or actin are shown as loading controls. In (D) and (E), the cytosolic localization of ÎNTRAP1 was assessed by subcellular fractionation; caspase-3 and cyclophilin D (CyP-D) are used to verify purity of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. Data are reported as meanÂ Â± SD values (n â¥ 3).</p>

        <p>TRAP1 Binds to ETC Complexes IV and II</p>
        <p>(A) Blue native gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to complex IV (cytochrome oxidase, COX) and complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, SDH) were cut, run on a SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-TRAP1, anti-COX subunit II (COXII), and anti-SDH subunit B (SDHB) antibodies.</p>
        <p>(B) Western immunoblotting was performed directly on a BN-PAGE. Probing was carried out with an anti-TRAP1 antibody and, in parallel lanes, with either an anti-COXII or an anti-SDH subunit A (SDHA) antibody. Note the smeared signal of both COXII and SDHA, suggesting that a population of complexes II and IV is present in the BN-PAGE; TRAP-1 is in the upper part of each complex band.</p>
        <p>(C) Complex II and TRAP1 immunoprecipitations (IPs) on lysates of SAOS-2 mock cells. The interaction between TRAP1 and SDHA is shown by coIP. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is used in negative isotype controls.</p>
        <p>(D) Crosslinking experiments on mitochondria from mock SAOS-2 cells. TRAP1 was immunoprecipitated after mitochondrial treatment with the crosslinker DTBP, loaded in parallel on separate lanes of an SDS-PAGE, and probed with either an anti-TRAP1 or an anti-SDHA antibody.</p>

        <p>TRAP1 Downregulates the Enzymatic Activity of RC Complex II</p>
        <p>(A and B) Analysis of the SQR enzymatic activity of complex II in mitochondria from SAOS-2 cells. In (A), analysis is performed on mitochondria from cultured cells; in (B), complex II activity values of mitochondria from cultured cells are compared with mitochondrial extracts from focus-forming assays obtained at the 15<sup>th</sup> experimental day (i.e., 1â2Â days before cells that did not form foci massively underwent death). Mock indicates SAOS-2 cells stably transfected with a scrambled shRNA; shTRAP1 indicates SAOS-2 cells stably transfected with a TRAP1 shRNA; shTRAP1Â + mTRAP1 indicates SAOS-2 shTRAP1 cells transfected with a mouse TRAP1 cDNA insensitive to human-directed shTRAP1 constructs (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C). Enzyme activity values are compared to those of SAOS-2 mock cells in culture.</p>
        <p>(C) SQR activity is measured on mitochondria from MEFs kept in culture or undergoing a focus-forming assay (15<sup>th</sup> day). TRAP1 indicates cells stably transfected with the TRAP1-containing vector; cells stably transfected with a control vector are dubbed mock. Enzyme activity values are compared to those of mitochondria from TRAP1-expressing MEFs in culture. TRAP1 inhibitor 17-AAG was added 5Â min before starting recordings. Bar graphs report meanÂ Â± SD values (n â¥ 3); <sup>*</sup>pÂ &lt;Â 0.01 with a Studentâs t test analysis.</p>
        <p>(D and E) Representative analyses of SQR activity on human colorectal cancer (CRC) samples are compared to surrounding noncancerous mucosae of the same patient. As shown in the insets, TRAP1 expression was compared between each CRC and noncancerous mucosa by western immunoblot followed by densitometric analysis normalized to GAPDH, which was used as a loading control. TRAP1 was considered induced when the ratio of the protein level between tumor sample and surrounding noncancerous mucosa was â¥ 3. Samples reported in (D) were obtained from metastatic CRC tumors and display an increase of TRAP1 expression in tumors with respect to mucosae; samples reported in (E) were obtained from nonmetastatic CRC tumors and do not show any relevant increase of TRAP1 expression.</p>

        <p>TRAP1-Induced Downmodulation of SDH Activity Decreases Cell Oxygen Consumption Rate and OXPHOS-Dependent Synthesis of ATP and Prompts Resistance to Stress Stimuli</p>
        <p>(A) Representative traces of OCR experiments performed on monolayers of living SAOS-2 cells. Subsequent additions of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, the uncoupler FCCP, the ETC complex I inhibitor rotenone, and the ETC complex III inhibitor antimycin A were carried out.</p>
        <p>(B) ATP levels were measured in mock or shTRAP1 SAOS-2 cells kept in standard culture conditions (bars on the left) or in a focus-forming assay for 15Â days (i.e., 1â2Â days before cells that did not form foci massively underwent death (bars on the right). Where indicated, cells were treated for 2Â hr with the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin or the hexokinase inhibitor 5-thioglucose (5TG) in a no-glucose medium to discriminate between ATP produced by OXPHOS and by glycolysis.</p>
        <p>(C and D) Representative traces of OCR experiments performed on monolayers of living MEF cells (C) or SAOS-2 cells (D). Experiments were carried out as in (A).</p>
        <p>(E) Analysis of the effect of the SDH inhibitor 3-NP on the SQR enzymatic activity of complex II in mitochondria from SAOS-2 cells. 3-NP was added 5Â min before starting recordings; 10Â mM 3-NP was used to fully inhibit the SDH enzyme.</p>
        <p>(F) Cytofluorimetric cell death analysis of SAOS-2 cells starved in a medium without serum for 96Â hr with or without the reported concentrations of 3-NP. Viable cells are identified as double negative for propidium iodide and Annexin V-FITC.</p>
        <p>(G) Soft agar assay on SAOS-2 cells. Data are reported as fold increase of colony area of mock cells grown with 3-NP compared with mock cells kept without the drug (left) and, separately, as fold increase of colony area of shTRAP1 cells grown with 3-NP compared with shTRAP1 cells kept without the drug (right). In SAOS-2 experiments, mock indicates cells stably transfected with a scrambled shRNA; shTRAP1 indicates cells stably transfected with a TRAP1 shRNA; shTRAP1Â + mTRAP1 indicates cells stably transfected with a TRAP1 shRNA and expressing a mouse TRAP1 cDNA. In the experiment with MEFs, cells were stably transfected with either a TRAP1 cDNA or a scrambled shRNA (mock). All bar graphs report meanÂ Â± SD values (n â¥ 3); <sup>*</sup>pÂ &lt; 0.01 with a Studentâs t test analysis.</p>

        <p>TRAP1 Increases Intracellular Succinate Concentration and Stabilizes HIF1Î± in a Hypoxia-Independent Way</p>
        <p>(A) Bar graphs showing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements of intracellular succinate level. Values are compared with cultured mock SAOS-2 cells.</p>
        <p>(BâD) Western immunoblots showing HIF1Î± expression (B), HIF1Î± hydroxylation of the Pro402 and Pro564 residues (C), and HIF2Î± expression in cultured cells and on extracts from focus-forming assays obtained at the 15<sup>th</sup> experimental day (i.e., 1â2Â days before cells that did not form foci massively underwent death). CoCl<sub>2</sub> is used as a positive control for HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± stabilization. Blots were probed with an anti-actin (B) or an anti-GAPDH (C and D) antibody to check for protein load.</p>
        <p>(E) Detection of pimonidazole-protein adducts in SAOS-2 mock cells kept in either normal culture or focus-forming conditions for 10 or 15Â days. Pimonidazole (200Â Î¼M) was added on the focus-forming plate 2Â hr before lysis. As a positive control, cells were kept for 24Â hr in a hypoxic chamber (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>). On theÂ sameÂ samples, both HIF1Î± stabilization and the expression level of TRAP1 were evaluated; blots were probed with an anti-GAPDH to check for proteinÂ load.</p>
        <p>(F) Immunohistochemical inspections of tumors formed by SAOS-2 control cells after injection in nude mice (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Azan-Mallory staining reveal tumors rich in densely packed cells, with few fibrotic areas (F) and a large number of necrotic regions (N). TRAP1 is visible in most cells (see the 6.25Ã magnification) as a punctate signal (100Ã magnification), which is compatible with its mitochondrial localization. HIF1Î± expression is evident all along the samples (see the 6.25Ã magnification), mainly in the nuclear compartment of cells (100Ã magnification), and the signal is particularly strong in the perinecrotic areas, where the proliferation marker MIB-1/Ki67 is also found (25Ã magnification).</p>
