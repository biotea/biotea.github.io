      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">The innate immune system detects infection by employing germline-encoded receptors specific for conserved microbial molecules. Recognition of microbial ligands leads to the production of cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFN), that are essential for successful pathogen elimination. Cytosolic detection of pathogen-derived DNA is one major mechanism of IFN induction<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, and requires signaling via Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1), and its downstream transcription factor, Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3). In addition, a transmembrane protein called STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes; also called MITA, ERIS, MPYS, TMEM173) functions as an essential signaling adaptor linking cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1/IRF3 signaling axis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Recently, unique nucleic acids called cyclic dinucleotides, which function as conserved signaling molecules in bacteria<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, were also shown to induce a STING-dependent type I interferon response<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, a mammalian sensor of cyclic dinucleotides has not been identified. Here we report evidence that STING itself is an innate immune sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. We demonstrate that STING binds directly to radiolabelled cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and that this binding is competed by unlabelled cyclic dinucleotides but not by other nucleotides or nucleic acids. Furthermore, we identify mutations in STING that selectively affect the response to cyclic dinucleotides without affecting the response to DNA. Thus, STING appears to function as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides, in addition to its established role as a signaling adaptor in the interferon response to cytosolic DNA. Cyclic dinucleotides have shown promise as novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutics<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Our results provide insight into the mechanism by which cyclic dinucleotides are sensed by the innate immune system.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">Although nucleotides are critical signaling molecules in all domains of life, cyclic dinucleotides appear to be produced solely by bacteria and archaea. For example, c-di-GMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates biofilm formation, motility, and virulence in diverse bacterial species<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Recently, cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) was discovered as a bacterial regulatory molecule<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, although its role remains to be fully characterized. Since they are unique to microbes, cyclic dinucleotides serve as appropriate targets for immune recognition<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Indeed, induction of IFN by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> depends on bacterial secretion of cyclic-di-AMP<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear how cyclic dinucleotides are sensed in mammalian cells.</p>
    <p id="P3">To address the mechanism by which mammalian cells sense cyclic dinucleotides, we first confirmed that cyclic dinucleotides are detected in the host cell cytosol<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> by expressing RocR, a c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, in the cytosol of macrophages. In these cells, IFN induction by c-di-GMP (but not other stimuli) is reduced 10-fold compared to vector transduced cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), confirming that the cytosolic presence of c-di-GMP is important to induce IFN.</p>
    <p id="P4">To identify candidate cyclic dinucleotide sensors, we sought to identify molecules that could reconstitute the IFN response to cyclic dinucleotides in HEK293T cells, which do not respond to c-di-GMP<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Since STING is essential for the IFN response to cyclic dinucleotides<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and STING expression is low/undetectable in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, data not shown), we first expressed STING in HEK293T cells. Overexpression of STING spontaneously induces an IFN reporter<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, so we transfected a low amount of STING that by itself was insufficient to induce IFN. To our surprise, low levels of STING were sufficient to reconstitute responsiveness of 293T cells to c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) and c-di-AMP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). By contrast, the non-functional <italic>goldenticket</italic> (<italic>gt</italic>) allele of STING (I199N)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> did not restore responsiveness to c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Interestingly, expression of wild-type STING did not confer responsiveness of 293T cells to double-stranded (ds) DNA oligonucleotides (e.g., vaccinia virus (VV) 70mer or interferon stimulatory DNA (ISD)) that were previously shown to induce type I IFN in macrophages via STING<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). By contrast, induction of IFN by poly(dAT:dTA) DNA was identical in cells transfected with wild-type or <italic>gt Sting</italic>, demonstrating that the Pol III DNA-sensing pathway<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> is intact in these cells and is not responsible for detection of c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). As a positive control, <italic>Myd88<sup>â/â</sup>Trif<sup>â/â</sup></italic>immortalized macrophages, which express STING, responded similarly to c-di-GMP, poly(dAT:dTA), VV 70mer and ISD (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Our results demonstrate STING expression is sufficient to restore responsiveness of HEK293T cells to cyclic dinucleotides but not to DNA.</p>
    <p id="P5">We next tested whether STING, or perhaps another protein in HEK293T cells, binds to c-di-GMP. We used an <italic>in-vitro</italic> ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking assay to identify putative sensor protein(s) in HEK293T cell lysates that interact directly with radiolabelled c-di-GMP (c-di-GMP<sup>32)</sup>. We expected to identify directly interacting proteins since only molecules within bond length proximity are efficiently crosslinked by UV<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. We detected a prominent ~40 kDa radiolabelled protein, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of monomeric STING, in lysates of cells transfected with STING-HA, but not in lysates of cells transfected with STING-HA I199N or vector only (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The ~40 kDa band did not appear when the same lysates were crosslinked with GTP<sup>32</sup>, implying that crosslinking to c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup> was specific (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We also observed an ~80 kDa species that possibly corresponds to a previously reported STING dimer<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). To test the hypothesis that STING crosslinks with c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup>, we immunoprecipitated STING from transfected HEK293T cells, and performed the c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup> binding assay on the immunoprecipitate. Bands corresponding to the molecular weight of STING monomer and dimer were identified only in immunoprecipitates of lysates overexpressing STING and not in mock immunoprecipitates of lysates of vector-transfected cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, STING appears to bind c-di-GMP.</p>
    <p id="P6">To confirm that binding of c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup> to STING is specific, we performed the c-di-GMP binding assay in the presence of unlabelled nucleotides. Unlabelled c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP specifically competed with c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup> for binding to STING (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). By contrast, GTP, other guanosine derivatives, or nucleic acids (including dsDNA), competed away non-specific binding (asterisks, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>), but, under our specific assay conditions, could not compete efficiently with c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup> for binding to STING (arrows, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Since the cell cytosol contains high (0.1â1mM) concentrations of GTP, a putative c-di-GMP sensor must exhibit a high degree of specificity for c-di-GMP over GTP. We found that c-di-GMP efficiently crosslinked to STING even in the presence of 1mM GTP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Although these data imply that STING directly and specifically binds cyclic dinucleotides, they do not address whether other host proteins might also be required. STING is predicted to encode an N-terminal domain with multiple transmembrane segments, followed by a globular C-terminal domain (CTD). Since the CTD contains the amino acid substitution (I199N) that abolishes STING function in <italic>goldenticket</italic> mice<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the CTD might be involved in binding cyclic dinucleotides. Thus, we subjected purified recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-tagged CTD of STING (amino acids 138â378) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>) to the c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup> binding assay. We found that the recombinant CTD of STING bound c-di-GMP<sup>32</sup>, and that binding was specifically competed with cold c-di-GMP or c-di-AMP but not cold GTP or ATP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). We used equilibrium dialysis to obtain an estimate of ~5Î¼M for the affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of c-di-GMP binding to the STING CTD (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). In its native membrane-bound form, or in complex with other host factors, STING may exhibit a stronger affinity for c-di-GMP; nevertheless, a 5Î¼M affinity is consistent with the dose response previously observed in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Consistent with the ability of STING to dimerize<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, the binding data suggest a stoichiometry of one molecule of c-di-GMP per two molecules of STING.</p>
    <p id="P8">In order to identify amino acids involved in c-di-GMP binding and/or IFN induction, we introduced point mutations into STING. Focusing on clusters of conserved and charged residues, we mutated a total of 67 amino acids, individually or in groups, and identified mutants that fell in one of five categories (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3â4</xref>). Class I consists of mutations that abolish both binding and IFN induction (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3aâc</xref>, red, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Class II mutants bind c-di-GMP but fail to induce IFN (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, purple). Class III comprises âhyperactiveâ mutants that spontaneously induce IFN at low levels of transfection (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3aâc</xref>, green, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Class IV mutants induced IFN when overexpressed, but were not inducible in response to c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3aâc</xref>, blue, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Class V consists of mutants that had no effect on binding or IFN induction (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, yellow, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Although mutation of STING can result in diverse phenotypes, a key finding is that all mutants that failed to bind c-di-GMP also lost the ability to induce IFN in response to c-di-GMP. Consistent with our observation that the CTD is sufficient to bind c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), all mutations that affected c-di-GMP binding were located within the CTD.</p>
    <p id="P9">DNA and cyclic dinucleotides induce indistinguishable transcriptional responses in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and STING appears essential for both responses<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to cyclic dinucleotides, we found STING expression is insufficient to restore responsiveness of HEK293T cells to DNA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, our competition assays indicate that DNA does not compete with cyclic-di-GMP for binding to STING under the conditions tested (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Thus, while our data indicate STING functions as a direct immunosensor of cyclic dinucleotides, additional host proteins appear likely to be involved in IFN induction by DNA. Indeed, two candidate DNA sensors, DAI and IFI16, have been identified<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, neither of which appear to be essential for the response to cyclic dinucleotides (<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; unpublished data). To determine if responsiveness to cyclic dinucleotides and DNA are separable functions of STING, we sought to identify STING mutants that fail to respond to cyclic dinucleotides but still respond to DNA. We identified a STING mutant (R231A) that was unresponsive to c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), though it still induced IFN when overexpressed (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and still bound c-di-GMP (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly, STING R231A was able to restore responsiveness of <italic>goldenticket</italic> bone marrow macrophages to DNA, but not to cyclic-di-GMP (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, cyclic dinucleotide sensing and DNA sensing can be uncoupled, suggesting that these two pathways are discrete but share STING as a common signaling molecule. It is unexpected that STING would function both as a direct immunosensor (of cyclic dinucleotides) and as a signaling adaptor (in the response to DNA). One possibility is that STING initially evolved as a cyclic dinucleotide sensor and was subsequently coopted for DNA sensing.</p>
    <p id="P10">We previously used mouse mutagenesis to identify STING as an essential molecule in the <italic>in vivo</italic> IFN response to cyclic dinucleotides<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The requirement for STING can now be rationalized by our proposal that STING functions as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. Interestingly, STING does not share homology with any known immunosensor, and therefore appears to represent a novel category of microbial detector. Although a BLAST search of the mouse proteome for homologs of the <italic>Listeria</italic> diadenylate cyclase (lmo2120; DacA) identifies STING as the top hit, the homology is limited to a short region of the STING CTD (amino acids 311â358). STING does not appear to exhibit homology to PilZ-domain proteins that function as c-di-GMP receptors in bacteria<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Structural studies are required to determine if STING resembles any known proteins in mammals or bacteria.</p>
    <p id="P11">Numerous studies have demonstrated that cyclic dinucleotides are potent immunostimulatory compounds that may be valuable as novel immunotherapeutics or adjuvants<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Therapeutic development of cyclic dinucleotides will be greatly facilitated by an improved understanding of the mechanism by which they are sensed. Furthermore, our finding that STING is a direct detector of cyclic dinucleotides provides insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which the innate immune system can detect bacterial infection.</p>
