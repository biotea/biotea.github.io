      <abstract>
        <p>To elucidate the relationship between intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin marks, we performed epigenetic profiling of chromosome 19 in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as well as its counterpart with double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B (HCT116-DKO). Analysis of H3K36me3 profiles indicated that this intragenic mark of active genes is associated with two categories of genes: (i) genes with low CpG density and H3K9me3 in the gene body or (ii) genes with high CpG density and DNA methylation in the gene body. We observed that a combination of low CpG density in gene bodies together with H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 occupancy is a specific epigenetic feature of zinc finger (ZNF) genes, which comprise 90% of all genes carrying both histone marks on chromosome 19. For genes with high intragenic CpG density, transcription and H3K36me3 occupancy were not changed in conditions of partial or intensive loss of DNA methylation in gene bodies. siRNA knockdown of SETD2, the major histone methyltransferase responsible for production of H3K36me3, did not reduce DNA methylation in gene bodies. Our study suggests that the H3K36me3 and DNA methylation marks in gene bodies are established largely independently of each other and points to similar functional roles of intragenic DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 for CpG-rich and CpG-poor genes, respectively.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Methylation of cytosines at promoters is an epigenetic mark, which is linked to gene silencing. The main regulatory function of DNA methylation has been associated with CpG-rich regions, CpG islands, which are frequently co-localized with gene promoters. It is well known that DNA methylation prevents binding of a number of transcription factors and attracts methylated-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) together with chromatin modifiers, which are responsible for the repressive chromatin structure <xref rid="pone.0018844-Klose1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In contrast to unmethylated promoters, repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in normal cells whereas loss of repetitive DNA methylation has been linked to chromosomal instability and cancer <xref rid="pone.0018844-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ehrlich1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The mechanisms that control the inherently non-sequence-specific DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMTs) and establish a particular DNA methylation pattern along the genome are still unclear.</p>
      <p>Connections between DNA methylation and chromatin modification processes have recently become apparent. Aberrant CpG island DNA methylation in cancer has been linked to the Polycomb-associated repressive histone mark, H3K27me3 <xref rid="pone.0018844-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ohm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This histone mark or its associated Polycomb components predispose target sequences to DNA methylation, for example during aging, inflammation and carcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hahn1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-GalYam1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Maegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Teschendorff1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Di- and tri-methylated H3K9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) are frequently found at aberrantly methylated gene promoters <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ohm1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Strunnikova1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It has been shown that H3K9 methylation promotes DNA methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and in mammalian heterochromatin repeats <xref rid="pone.0018844-Tamaru1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Lehnertz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, the H3K9 methyltransferase, SUV39H1 interacts with DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and due to a common interaction partner, HP1, SUV39H1 can be found in the same complex with the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3B <xref rid="pone.0018844-Lehnertz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Bannister1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Fuks1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Lachner1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Also, SETDB1, a methyltransferase that produces H3K9me3, has been detected in complex with the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3A <xref rid="pone.0018844-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, a number of publications reported on the presence of extensive DNA methylation in gene bodies, downstream of transcription start sites (intragenic methylation). It was noticed that actively transcribed genes are associated with increased DNA methylation levels in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0018844-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and in mammals <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ball1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hellman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In fact, in human cells most of the DNA methylation peaks are found in gene bodies rather than in promoters <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Inter- and intragenic CpG islands are preferentially susceptible to DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0018844-Illingworth1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These findings indicate a possible new universal function of DNA methylation. Furthermore, it was observed that the transcription elongation mark, H3K36me3, is often correlated with DNA hypermethylation <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This histone modification is mainly established due to SETD2 histone methyltransferase activity <xref rid="pone.0018844-Edmunds1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. SETD2 forms a complex with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II during elongation <xref rid="pone.0018844-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Yoh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The functional role of DNA methylation in transcription elongation processes or within gene bodies in general is unknown. It has been proposed that DNA methylation may inhibit initiation of aberrant transcription <xref rid="pone.0018844-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and this function could be particularly important in gene bodies <xref rid="pone.0018844-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A similar role is proposed for the H3K36me3 modification <xref rid="pone.0018844-Carrozza1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To more precisely understand the crosstalk between histone modifications, DNA methylation and transcription in mammalian cells, we profiled DNA methylation and chromatin modifications on human chromosome 19 in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). To understand the impact of DNA methylation on chromatin and transcription, we performed a similar analysis in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line with double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, a cell line characterized by loss of 95% of DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rhee1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. To identify a role of H3K36me3 in establishing DNA methylation patterns in gene bodies, we analyzed epigenetic changes in cells lacking SETD2 after siRNA-mediated knockdown of SETD2.</p>

        <title>Crosstalk between histone modifications and DNA methylation on chromosome 19</title>
        <p>To understand the interdependence between DNA methylation and histone modifications, we profiled DNA methylation patterns and several histone modifications along human chromosome 19 (chr19) on NimbleGen tiling arrays in human bronchial epithelial cells immortalized with hTERT and CDK4 <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Chromosome 19 was chosen because of its high gene density and CpG methylation frequency <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These data sets were compared to expression profiles obtained on the Affymetrix platform. DNA methylation patterns were analyzed by using two complementary methods, the UnMethylCollectorâ¢ (UMC) method, here applied for the first time to genome-wide profiling of unmethylated CpGs on tiling arrays, and the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA). Whereas UMC enriches the unmethylated DNA fraction of the genome due to the high affinity of the CXXC domain of the MBD1 protein to unmethylated CpGs <xref rid="pone.0018844-Illingworth1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Jorgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, MIRA is used to enrich methylated genomic DNA fragments by using the protein complex of MBD2B and MBD3L1 <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The combination of both assays allows us to comprehensively map DNA methylation patterns along chromosomes. These methylation patterns were then compared to H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K9/K14 acetylation and H3K36me3 histone modification profiles.</p>
        <p>The distribution of epigenetic marks over all genes of chr19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>) showed that the DNA methylation signal (MIRA) generally is opposite to the unmethylated CpG (UMC) signal (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s001">Figure S1G</xref>). For most genes, DNA methylation also inversely correlates with the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. It is apparent that the DNA methylation level is often high in genes showing H3K36me3 enrichment consistent with previous results <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ball1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Analysis of signals within gene bodies of chr19 genes indicates co-localization of DNA methylation and H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g002">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). Gene body was defined as the entire gene from the transcription start site to the end of the transcript. Absence of H3K36me3 was associated with partial methylation or hypomethylation status of gene body DNA as indicated by UMC signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Genes carrying both intragenic DNA methylation and H3K36me3 are sharply unmethylated at the promoter and hypermethylated within the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g002">Figure 2B,C</xref>). They also show acetylated histone H3 near their 5â² ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>). At the 3â² end of genes, in H3K36me3-free areas, we observed a loss of DNA methylation by using both methods, MIRA and UMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g002">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This finding was confirmed by combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) for the <italic>LSM4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). These observations indicate a strong link between H3K36me3 and DNA methylation since absence of H3K36me3 is immediately reflected in reduction of DNA methylation. We further validated the correlation between H3K36me3 and gene body DNA methylation with additional COBRA methylation assays for the <italic>POLD1</italic> and <italic>NFKBIB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s001">Figure S1B</xref>,C).</p>

        <p>The plotting of unmethylated DNA peaks mapped by UMC versus histone H3 acetylation and H3K36me3 modifications showed that unmethylated DNA is enriched for H3 acetylation but is reverse to H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The profiling of other epigenetic marks indicated that genes carrying H3K36me3 and DNA methylation in the gene body contain very low levels of H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g002">Figure 2B,C</xref>). We then performed correlative analysis of DNA methylation and H3K36me3 signals within gene bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s001">Figure S1D</xref>,E). For these genes, plotting the MIRA signal in gene bodies versus H3K36me3 showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of Râ=â0.38 (p&lt;0.001) whereas the UMC signal was negatively correlated with H3K36me3 (Râ=â-0.39; p&lt;0.001). The data sets suggest that presence of H3K36me3 is associated with an increase of DNA methylation in gene bodies and absence of H3K36me3 is associated with reduced levels of methylated DNA. Histone H3 acetylation or unmethylated CpGs were also negatively correlated with the MIRA signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s001">Figure S1F</xref>,G; P&lt;0.00001).</p>

        <p>It is well known that H3K9me3 is a heterochromatin repressive mark. However, we found that some genes in H3K9me3 blocks harbor also the H3K36me3 modification typical of transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Ninety percent of the 193 dual-occupied genes are zinc finger protein encoding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Most of the ZNF genes carry H3K36me3 in bronchial epithelial cells but they are characterized by a low level of expression in comparison to other genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This level of transcription is comparable to that of H3K27me3-repressed genes. However, in contrast to H3K27me3-associated genes, ZNF genes are occupied by H3K36me3. ZNF gene promoters are frequently associated with high CpG density sequences (CpG islands), in contrast to their gene bodies, which have low CpG density. For most active ZNF genes, promoters are marked by unmethylated DNA according to the UMC and MIRA profiles and by histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>). We did not observe any H3K27me3 enrichment in gene bodies of ZNF genes.</p>
        <p>Our data indicate that 78% of all genes with the H3K36me3 mark are associated with intragenic DNA hypermethylation whereas 17% of the H3K36me3-marked genes carry H3K9me3 in their gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Based on our criteria for gene coverage, these numbers add up to almost 100% for all H3K36me3-associated genes on chr19 and are indicating possible links between high CpG density and DNA hypermethylation in one class of genes and between low CpG density and H3K9me3 in the gene bodies of the other class of genes.</p>
        <p>The relationship between H3K36me3 and DNA methylation and between H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 was further analyzed within genes of different expression levels and with respect to exon-intron structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Expression data from Affymetrix exon arrays were used in this analysis. Again, we subdivided the genes into two categories: genes covered by H3K36me3 and CpG methylation (MIRA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,B) and genes covered by H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s004">Figure S4C</xref>,D). These data show that the exons of the more highly expressed genes carry higher levels of H3K36me3 for both categories of genes. On the other hand, the MIRA signal is stronger for genes with higher expression levels while the H3K9me3 signal does not correlate with expression levels in the other category of genes. When examining all exons combined, we did not find much difference between exons and introns for genes co-occupied either by DNA methylation (MIRA signal) and H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,B) or by H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s004">Figure S4C</xref>,D) although the H3K9me3 signal was slightly lower in introns. We also looked at DNA methylation, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 at the first and last exons and at the first and last coding exons, respectively, in genes with low and high expression levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s004">Figure S4</xref>). All three modifications were generally lower at the first exons but increased at the first coding exons. We think this is because many genes have 5â² untranslated first exons, which often fall within the CpG islands near their promoters. CpG islands are generally devoid of these repressive modifications.</p>

        <p>Since our data indicated a strong link between DNA methylation and the H3K36me3 mark, we investigated epigenetic profiles in the HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line and in its isogenic counterpart with double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rhee1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. As reported, 95% of DNA methylation is lost in this cell line.

We profiled DNA methylation, H3K9me3, H3K36me3 and transcripts (by cDNA hybridization) in HCT116 and HCT116-DKO cells along chr19. These data were also compared to results from Affymetrix exon arrays. To evaluate the epigenetic changes in the <italic>DNMT1</italic> gene itself caused by disruption of exons 3-5, we examined the epigenetic profile of the <italic>DNMT1</italic> locus located on chr19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). We identified H3K36me3 occupancy in HCT116-DKO cells with loss of signal for the deleted exons 3 to 5. Also, analysis of Affymetrix exon arrays indicated a 2.5-times reduced level of DNMT1 transcription. These data confirmed the gene deletion at the <italic>DNMT1</italic> gene in these cells and suggest reduced levels of a transcript presumably encoding a truncated DNMT1 protein <xref rid="pone.0018844-Spada1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Egger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>DNA methylation profiles of chr19 for HCT116-WT and HCT116-DKO cells confirmed reduction of DNA methylation in DKO cells in promoters and in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, we observed that some genes harboring H3K36me3 retained substantial DNA methylation levels in the gene body in the DKO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4A,D</xref>), perhaps related to activity provided by DNMT3A, which recently has been linked to intragenic DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0018844-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Specific knockout lines for DNMT3A are not available and our attempts to knock down DNMT3A using siRNA were not successful. For a small group of active genes, DNA methylation was almost not affected in the gene body in HCT116-DKO cells. These data were confirmed for the <italic>POLD1</italic> and <italic>NFKBIB</italic> genes by COBRA, which showed remaining DNA methylation in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).

However, this fact only infrequently correlated with transcriptional activation.

        <title>ZNF genes become activated due to reduction of DNMT activities</title>
        <p>According to data on transcriptional changes obtained from Affymetrix exon arrays, almost only ZNF genes became activated on chr19 in the HCT116-DKO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This fact was associated with <italic>de novo</italic> H3K36me3 occupation of gene bodies and promoter DNA demethylation in HCT116-DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Since ZNF genes are localized in H3K9me3-occupied areas in HBEC, we profiled this mark in HCT116-WT and HCT116-DKO cells. We observed that activation of ZNF genes is associated with a reduction of the H3K9me3 mark in promoter areas and in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Further analysis indicated that <italic>de novo</italic> H3K36me3 occupation in HCT116-DKO cells is typical for low CpG density gene bodies. Since H3K36me3 is highly correlated with transcriptional activity, we plotted transcription activity changes in HCT116 DKO relative to WT cells versus CpG density in gene bodies, genome-wide, by using results from Affymetrix exon arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Our data indicate that gene activation occurs more frequently than silencing in HCT116-DKO cells. Transcriptional upregulation in HCT116-DKO versus HCT116-WT cells was almost specific for genes with low CpG density in gene bodies. Also, the level of transcriptional change is gradually decreasing with increase of CpG density in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These data are correlated with relatively rare changes in the H3K36me3 profile in HCT116-DKO cells and infrequent transcriptional changes observed on chr19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We performed composite profile analysis for activated genes bearing H3K9me3 in gene bodies in HCT116-DKO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). These data confirmed our observation about the mechanism of ZNF gene activation and showed that gene activation of H3K9me3-covered genes is associated with an increase of H3K36me3 in the gene body, a decrease of H3K9me3 in the promoter and gene body, and loss of DNA methylation at the promoter. On the other hand, repression of H3K9me3-covered genes is associated with a slight increase of H3K9me3 level at the promoter area and loss of H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0018844.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>

        <title>DNA methylation is not affected by reduction of H3K36me3 levels</title>
        <p>To understand if the H3K36me3 mark plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of intragenic DNA methylation patterns, we decreased the level of this chromatin modification in cells to monitor possible changes of DNA methylation and transcriptional activity. Towards this goal, we performed transfection experiments with siRNA for SETD2, the major H3K36me3 methyltransferase <xref rid="pone.0018844-Edmunds1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, in HBEC cells and in HCT116-DKO cells. According to our Western blotting data, H3K36me3 levels were drastically reduced in SETD2 siRNA treated HBEC in comparison to non-targeting siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression analysis by Affymetrix exon arrays indicated that 304 genes underwent transcriptional changes due to SETD2 siRNA treatment. Of these, 209 genes were significantly repressed due to SETD2 siRNA transfection. From these genes, 17 genes were localized on chr19 including 10 ZNF genes. Genome-wide, transcription of 20 ZNF genes was affected due to SETD2 knockdown usually showing repressed transcriptional activity. Since a much higher number of genes sustain a decrease of H3K36me3 levels according to ChIP on ChIP data than the number of genes showing transcriptional changes in SETD2 siRNA experiments, we assume that the H3K36me3 mark is not chiefly involved in maintaining transcript levels.</p>

        <p>We performed composite profile analysis of gene bodies in SETD2 siRNA treated cells versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These data confirmed a reduction of H3K36me3 levels after siSETD2 treatment. Our data did not show a reduction of DNA methylation levels in gene bodies. Importantly, we verified the DNA methylation status for several genes with substantial loss of H3K36me3 levels in gene bodies according to the microarray results. Our COBRA analysis and bisulfite sequencing did not identify a reduction of DNA methylation after siRNA for SETD2 versus non-targeting siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>) (pâ=â0.276; Fisher's exact test, two-tailed, for bisulfite data). Further, we tried to identify a possible role of H3K36me3 under conditions of DNMT deficiency in HCT116-DKO cells. Similar to HBEC, we treated HCT116-DKO cells with SETD2 siRNA for five days. This experiment resulted in significant loss of H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). However, we could not observe a reduction of DNA methylation in SETD2 siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) (pâ=â1.000; Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). Based on these observations, we conclude that DNA methylation patterns in gene bodies are established independently of the H3K36me3 mark.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In our study, we observed that the H3K36me3 mark reflects active transcription. These results support previous genome-wide mapping data of this histone modification, observations of H3K36me3 as a mark for the transcription elongation process and direct interaction of SETD2 with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II <xref rid="pone.0018844-Edmunds1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Krogan1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-KolasinskaZwierz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. According to our detailed analysis of chromosome 19, H3K36me3 presence is clearly correlated with DNA methylation levels in gene bodies. Similar results reporting correlations of H3K36me3, transcript levels, and gene body DNA methylation were obtained in IMR90 cells, in human embryonic stem cells and in human B-lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0018844-Ball1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our results also indicate that absence of H3K36me3 is associated with partial methylation or hypomethylation status of gene body DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>The correlation between DNA methylation and H3K36me3 in gene bodies was also investigated in HCT116-DKO cells lacking DNA methyltransferases. In HCT116-DKO cells, we observed a slight reduction of total H3K36me3 levels compared to HCT116-WT cells but independent of DNA methylation changes. This observation can be explained by the fact that H3K36me3 levels are associated with the cell cycle and that HCT116-DKO cells proliferate more slowly than HCT116-WT cells <xref rid="pone.0018844-Bonenfant1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, we did not observe any substantial loss of H3K36me3 in genes with intensive loss of DNA methylation in HCT116-DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Reduction of H3K36me3 levels by siRNA-mediated knockdown of SETD2 rarely affected transcriptional activity (only 304 genes genome-wide were significantly affected in these experiments). H3K36me3 loss failed to reduce DNA methylation in gene bodies in both HBEC and HCT116-DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018844-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These data suggest that DNA methylation and H3K36me3 are not associated directly and that both marks are established independently during the transcription elongation process. Our data are not directly consistent with recent observations showing an interaction of the PWWP domain of DNMT3A with the H3K36me3 modification <xref rid="pone.0018844-Dhayalan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In our hands, the loss of H3K36me3 did not result in noticeable reduction of DNA methylation in HBEC or in HCT116-DKO cells. Since presence of active DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HBEC could make it difficult to detect a loss of DNA methylation caused by absence of H3K36me3, we performed SETD2 siRNA experiments also in HCT116-DKO cells lacking both DNMT1 and DNMT3B but retaining DNMT3A. We assumed that an effect of H3K36me3 on DNMT3A and DNA methylation would be enhanced in conditions of absence DNMT3B and in presence of reduced levels of truncated DNMT1. However, reduction of H3K36me3 in these cells did not result in loss of DNA methylation either. Nonetheless, it is possible that the low amounts of H3K36me3 remaining after SETD2 knockdown may still suffice for maintaining DNA methylation.</p>
      <p>Since gene body DNA methylation and H3K36me3 are correlated, yet not directly dependent on each other, we assume that both marks are established independently during the transcription elongation process. SETD2 is a component of transcription elongation complexes and binds to RNA polymerase II <xref rid="pone.0018844-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Yoh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Whether the DNA methylation machinery is similarly connected to elongating RNA polymerase II complexes remains to be determined but there is evidence from plants describing proteins that interact with RNA polymerase II and function in RNA-directed DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0018844-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-He1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We found that H3K9me3 is mostly associated with genes characterized by low CpG density in the gene body. The reason for the association of low CpG density genes with H3K9me3 is unclear. We assume that genes with low CpG density in the gene body have a specific epigenetic regulation. In HCT116-DKO cells, almost only low CpG density genes became activated in conditions of DNMT deficiency. It appears that genes having high levels of CpG methylation in both the promoter and the gene body are difficult to reactivate by loss of DNA methylation. Similar to DNA methylation, which is present in gene bodies of many genes, the H3K9me3 mark covers preferentially ZNF genes intragenically. The functional role of the H3K9me3 histone modification in gene bodies is currently unknown, as is the function of DNA methylation in gene bodies. Like DNA methylation, H3K9me3 is generally considered a repressive mark and is usually associated with compacted chromatin. It was suggested that DNA methylation in gene bodies may block false initiation of transcription <xref rid="pone.0018844-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We propose that H3K9me3 may play a similar role in gene bodies and replaces the intragenic function of DNA methylation under conditions of low CpG density. Unlike genes with intragenic DNA methylation, which are associated with intermediate to high levels of transcription <xref rid="pone.0018844-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, genes with H3K9me3 in the gene body are associated with very low levels of transcription. We suppose that H3K9me3 may slow down RNA polymerase II much more effectively than DNA methylation in gene bodies. This fact may be reflected in low levels of ZNF transcripts.</p>
      <p>We observed that ZNF genes are characterized by H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 dual occupation and by very low CpG density in gene bodies. This specific feature was associated with activation of this group of genes in conditions of DNMT deficiency. ZNF genes were previously separated as a group of genes associated with H3K9me3 in the promoter <xref rid="pone.0018844-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Also, the regulation of ZNF genes was linked to the KAP1 factor, which is mostly associated with 3' gene ends and repression of ZNF genes <xref rid="pone.0018844-OGeen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018844-Groner1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These facts also indicate ZNF genes as a separate epigenetic group. The observations suggest that functionally related genes can be divided into groups with specific epigenetic marks.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the two main findings of our study are that (i) the H3K36me3 and DNA CpG methylation patterns in gene bodies are not directly dependent on each other, and (ii) from their CpG density-dependent gene-specific localization patterns, we suggest that there is a similar functional role for intragenic DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 for CpG-rich and CpG-poor genes, respectively. Future studies will determine whether the role of these two intragenic repressive marks indeed lies in suppression of spurious intragenic gene transcription as is assumed by some current models or whether they have other functional roles that are currently not anticipated.</p>

<bold>Gene body DNA modifications and chromatin marks in relation to exon and intron structure.</bold> Genes on chromsome 19 were subdivided into two categories. Panels <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> show genes co-occupied with H3K36me3 and DNA methylation. Panels <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold> represent genes co-occupied with H3K36me3 and H3K9me3. Using data from Affymetrix exon arrays, we determined which exons are expressed at low levels (bottom 15% of expressed genes) and which ones are expressed at high levels (top 15% of expressed genes). The MIRA, H3K36m3 or H3K9m3 average signal (log2 ratio) of probes in the selected exons or introns is plotted. We also plotted the signals for the first and last exons and the first and last coding exons, respectively. <bold>A</bold>. H3K36me3 levels in H3K36me3 and DNA methylation co-occupied genes. <bold>B</bold> DNA methylation levels in H3K36me3 and DNA methylation co-occupied genes. <bold>C</bold>. H3K36me3 levels in H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 co-occupied genes. <bold>A</bold>. H3K9me3 levels in H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 co-occupied genes.</p>

<bold>DNA methylation and epigenetic profiles in HCT116-DKO and HCT116-WT cells.</bold>
<bold>A</bold>. DNA methylation in LINE1 elements in HCT116-DKO and HCT116-WT cells. Using LINE1-promoter-specific primers, bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified. After cutting with HinfI, recognizing CpG dinucleotides, mock (-) and enzyme-digested (+) PCR products were fractionated by size on a 2% agarose gel. In vitro CpG-methylated human DNA (M) served as a positive control. Cleavage indicates DNA methylation, which is almost completely lost in DKO cells <bold>B</bold>. MIRA and H3K36me3 distribution profile along the <italic>DNMT1</italic> gene in HCT116-DKO and HCT116-WT cells. Note the loss of signal between exons 3 and 5 (yellow box) in DKO cells due to gene disruption but persistent transcription as indicated by the H3K36me3 profile. <bold>C</bold>. Verification of retained DNA methylation in some gene bodies in HCT116-DKO cells. Representative profile of persistent DNA methylation in gene bodies in HCT116-DKO cells and comparison to the profile in HCT116-WT cells. Red, DNA methylation; green, H3K36me3. The gene coordinates and location of the analyzed region in the <italic>NFKBIB</italic> gene are indicated. DNA methylation analysis was performed by COBRA for two different genes retaining DNA methylation in the gene body according to the MIRA data. Using gene-specific primers, bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified. After cutting with TaqIa, recognizing CpG dinucleotides, mock (-) and enzyme-digested (+) PCR products were fractionated by size on a 2% agarose gel. In vitro CpG-methylated human DNA (M) served as a positive control. Cleavage indicates DNA methylation.</p>

<bold>A</bold>. Composite profile of upregulated H3K9me3-covered genes in HCT116-WT and DKO cells. The profile was created for genes with gene bodies covered by H3K9me3 with at least 20% of gene body length coverage in HCT116-WT cells and upregulated transcription by at least log2 of 0.5 in comparison to HCT116-WT cells. <bold>B</bold>. Composite profile of downregulated H3K9me3 genes in HCT116-DKO. The profile was created for genes with gene bodies covered by H3K9me3 with at least 20% of gene body length coverage in HCT116-WT cells and downregulated transcription by at least log2 of 0.5 in comparison to HCT116-WT cells.</p>
