      <abstract>
        <p>A novel lyase activity enzyme is characterized for the first time: HMG-CoA lyase-like1 (er-cHL), which is a close homolog of mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase (mHL). Initial data show that there are nine mature transcripts for the novel gene <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>, although none of them has all its exons. The most abundant transcript is called âvariant b,â and it lacks exons 2 and 3. Moreover, a three-dimensional model of the novel enzyme is proposed. Colocalization studies show a dual location of the er-cHL in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol, but not in mitochondria or peroxisomes. Furthermore, the dissociation experiment suggests that it is a nonendoplasmic reticulum integral membrane protein. The kinetic parameters of er-cHL indicate that it has a lower <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> and a higher substrate affinity than mHL. Protein expression and lyase activity were found in several tissues, and were particularly strong in lung and kidney. The occurrence of er-cHL in brain is surprising, as mHL has not been found there. Although mHL activity is clearly associated with energy metabolism, the results suggest that er-cHL is more closely related to another metabolic function, mostly at the pulmonary and brain level.</p>

  <body><p>The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA lyase, or human HMG-CoA lyase (HL), catalyzes the cleavage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA. This reaction is the common final step in ketogenesis and leucine catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). There are two isoforms of the HL protein, one mitochondrial and the other peroxisomal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Both exhibit lyase activity and are encoded by the same gene: <italic>HMGCL.</italic> The HL enzyme has been crystallized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), and the most critical residues for catalytic function, Arg<sup>41</sup>, Glu<sup>72</sup>, Tyr<sup>167</sup> and Cys<sup>266</sup>, are known. Moreover, the residues that bind to the divalent cation Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which are essential for lyase activity (Asp<sup>42</sup>, Asn<sup>275</sup>, His<sup>233</sup>, and His<sup>235</sup>), are also known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial isoform contributes to ketone body production, and it has been studied in depth. It has a homodimer TIM-barrel structure, joined by di-sulfur bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). It is mainly expressed in liver, a ketogenic tissue, but expression and activity levels have been reported in other human tissues, such as pancreas, kidney, and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Its failure causes HL deficiency or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria (MIM 246450), a rare autosomal recessive disease that appears with hypoglycemic states and is accompanied by hypoketosis and metabolic acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>The function of the peroxisomal isoform is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). It has been proposed that it could play a role in cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) or in long-chain fatty acid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Entry to the peroxisomes is due to the CKL signal tripeptide of the C-terminal end. The peroxisomal isoform is 2.5 kDa larger than the mitochondrial isoform because of the presence in the structure of the mitochondrial signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Initially, the peroxisomal isoform was thought to be monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), but it was subsequently identified as a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Despite the differences in size and amino acid sequence between the two isoforms, their kinetic activity values of <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and kcat are close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>In this article we report, for first time, the finding of another HL isoenzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA lyase-like 1 (er-cHL, Uniprot code: Q8TB92, HMGC2_HUMAN), encoded by a different gene: <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>. Our initial studies show that er-cHL is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cytosol of cell cultures. We show that er-cHL has a structural homology with mHL protein, but it has a differential tissue expression pattern and distinct kinetic parameters. These findings suggest that the novel er-cHL isoform has a different function than mHL, which may be to synthesize ketone bodies in the cytosol.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Samples</title><p>Tissue samples of brain, pancreas, liver, testis, lung, and kidney were obtained from adult humans within 24 h post mortem in the Department of Pathology at the University of Zaragoza.

The coordinates of human mHL protein were used as a template [Protein Data Bank code: 2CW6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), blast value: 1.1 Ã 10<sup>â116</sup>, sequence identity: 70%]. The model was built using the SWISS-MODEL server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), which is available at &lt;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org//SWISS-MODEL.html">http://swissmodel.expasy.org//SWISS-MODEL.html</ext-link>&gt;, and the structural quality was checked using the analysis programs provided by the same server (Anolea/Gromos). The overall model quality estimation score QMEAN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) was 0.671. This score is within the range of scores accepted for homology-based structure models. To optimize the geometries, the model was energy minimized using the GROMOS 43B1 force field, implemented in DeepView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) using 500 steps of the steepest descent minimization followed by 500 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>To prepare constructs of <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-pMAL-c2Ã and <italic>HMGCL</italic>-pMAL-c2Ã, we followed the protocol described by Menao et al. (2009) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). cDNA was obtained from a lung cDNA library [Multiple Tissue cDNA (MTC) panels, Clontech]. The pMAL-c2Ã vector (Biolabs) was used to clone the coding region of <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> or <italic>HMGCL</italic>, except for the leader peptide sequence. Thus, we created recombinant plasmids in which the encoded er-cHL and mHL proteins were fused to the N-terminal region of maltose binding protein (MBP). These constructs enabled us to obtain a sufficient quantity of the er-cHL and mHL proteins in a prokaryotic model.</p><p>To prepare constructs of <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-EGFP and <italic>HMGCL-</italic>Red, the pEGFP-N3 and pDsRed2-N1 vectors (Clontech) were used to clone the coding region of er-cHL (340 amino acids) or mHL (325 amino acids). er-cHL and mHL proteins were fused to the N-terminal region of EGFP and Red2 proteins, respectively. These constructs enabled us to localize the er-cHL and mHL proteins inside a eukaryotic cell.</p><p>To prepare constructs of <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-Tag3 and <italic>HMGCL-</italic>Tag3, the pCMV-3Tag-3 vector (Agilent Technologies) was used to clone the coding region of er-cHL (340 amino acids) or mHL (325 amino acids). er-cHL and mHL proteins were fused to c-Myc epitope tag. These constructs enabled us to localize the er-cHL and mHL proteins inside a eukaryotic cell.</p><p>To prepare constructs of <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-pIRES2, the vector pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) was used. The coding region of human <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> was cloned into vector pIRES2-EGFP, which allowed both the gene of interest and the EGFP gene to be translated from a single bicistronic mRNA. This construct enabled us to overexpress the er-cHL protein in a eukaryotic model.</p></sec><sec><title>Directed mutagenesis</title><p>Mutants were generated using PCR according to Stratagene's QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. The <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-pMAL-c2Ã construct was used as a template for single mutations. We performed the following single amino acid mutations: R56Q, H248R, and L207S. Mutations p.R56Q, p.L207S, and p.H248R were paralogous with the changes p.R41Q, p.F192S, and p.H233R in the mHL protein that cause enzyme activity loss. Mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis.</p><p>We generated an exon 6 deletion mutant of the <italic>HMGCLL1 (HMGCLL1Î6)</italic> gene using <italic>HMGCLL1-</italic>pIRES2 and the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-pMAL-c2Ã vectors as a template.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein overexpression</title><p>The er-cHL protein (wild-type and mutants) in the pMAL-c2Ã vector was expressed in <italic>E. coli.</italic> We followed the same protocol as that described by Menao etÂ al. (2009) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>The er-cHL (wild-type and mutant) proteins in the pIRES2 vector were expressed in HEK293 cells. The recombinant vectors <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>-pIRES2 and <italic>HMGCL-</italic>pIRES2 were transfected using METAFECTENE<sup>TM</sup> PRO (Biontex), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4Â°C. They were then washed in 1.5 ml of PBS, and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (30 mM NaCl, 6 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 3 mM NaPPi, 4 mM HEPES, 100 Âµg/ml PMSF, 1.5% Triton X-100). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C. The supernatant was immediately used in the HMG-CoA lyase activity assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot experiments</title><p>A specific er-cHL antibody was developed against the immunological sequence NH<sub>2</sub>-SMGKFEEVVKSARHMN-COOH of the er-cHL, from Abyntek S.A. Antibody specificity was tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot.</p><p>Generally, 50 Âµg of protein sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. A 1:1000 dilution of anti-er-cHL (Abyntek) or anti-mHL (Abnova) was used as the primary antibody. The secondary antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution. The blots were developed with the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) kit. The images captured were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Colocalization studies in culture cells</title><p>Cultured cells were grown on lysine-treated coverslips in 24-well plates.

It contains 11 exons ranging from 64 bp to 334 bp, and 10 introns of between 223 bp and 55,859 bp. The <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene spans more than 160 kbp, but the <italic>HMGCL</italic> gene spans only 24 kbp. This discrepancy is due to the difference in the size of some introns of the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene (supplemental Fig. I). The databases contain several variants of this gene, none of which has all the exons in its sequence. âVariant bâ was the first to be described in the databases, and expressed sequence tags (EST) from this variant are more frequent than others. For this reason, we chose âvariant bâ of the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene as a reference for all the splicing variants found. This variant contains 9 exons and 8 introns, like the <italic>HMGCL</italic> gene.</p><p>There are two additional variants of the gene <italic>HMGCLL1</italic>: âvariant aâ and âvariant c.â These variants have exon insertions: exon 2 in âvariant aâ and exon 3 in âvariant c.â However, when we tried to amplify these variants, we were unable to obtain the whole cDNA from them (the primers hybridized in the 5â²- and 3â²-UTR region of both variants). Exons 2 and 3 are defined as strong by the Splice Site Prediction program (score &gt; 0.9). However, âvariant aâ and âvariant câ could only be amplified when we used specific primers that hybridized with exon 2 or 3 of the gene.</p><p>To identify alternative splice variants of the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene, a search of database ESTs and overlapping amplifications was carried out. The ESTs database search showed seven alternative splicing variants of the gene (deletions of the exons 2 to 7, 5 to 8, 6, 6 and 7, 6 to 8, and 6 to 9). The overlapping amplifications were performed with <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> cDNA from fetal and adult tissues. PCR amplification, which explored the whole gene, showed several bands (supplemental Fig. II) that belong to some of the splicing variants of the gene (deletions of exons 2 to 7, 2 to 9, 6, 6 and 7, 6 to 8, and 6 to 9).</p></sec><sec><title>Structural model for human er-cHL protein</title><p>A 3D structural model was generated for human er-cHL protein.

Sequence alignment of the catalytic domain of both proteins showed a sequence identity of 70% (supplemental Fig. III), with the complete absence of sequence insertions or deletions.

The highest protein levels were found in human kidney, followed by lung, brain, liver, testis, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, the occurrence of a novel extra mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase, with a dual location in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the cytosol (er-cHL), is reported for first time. It is encoded by a different gene (<italic>HMGCLL1</italic>) to the mitochondrial HL or peroxisomal HL enzymes (<italic>HMGCL</italic>). The results outlined here allow us to accurately characterize the novel enzyme and provide clues about its functional role.</p><p>The novel <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene is reported in the National Center for Biotechnical Information and Ensembl. The comparative study of the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> and <italic>HMGCL</italic> genes shows identities of 67% (mRNA) and 70% (protein) of the core sequence of the encoded protein. <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> is in the short arm of the chromosome 6, while the <italic>HMGCL</italic> gene is located in the short arm of chromosome 1. Although the <italic>HGMCLL1</italic> gene has 11 exons and 10 introns, no variant has been found to contain all the exons. The most frequent variant is called âvariant b,â which encodes 340 amino acids. This variant has a genomic organization similar to the <italic>HMGCL</italic> gene, with a high homology between 2 and 9 exons for the <italic>HMGCL</italic> gene, and 4 to 11 exons for the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene (supplemental Fig. I). While the flanking exon sequences are similar in the two genes, the intron size is larger in the <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene. All these results suggest that these are paralogous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) because they are highly homologous and occupy different sites within the same genome.</p><p>The <italic>HMGCLL1</italic> gene study shows a higher number of physiological splicing variants than those reported for the <italic>HMGCL</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). If we take âvariant bâ as a reference, the alternative transcripts can be classified into two groups, according to exon insertion or deletion. âVariant aâ has the insertion of exon 2, while âvariant câ has the insertion of exon 3. Both have only been amplified in one or two fetal tissues using specific primers, which suggests a rather low presence. However, âvariant aâ combines all the elements required to translate an active protein, whereas âvariant câ has a premature STOP codon and encodes a protein of 53 amino acids without a catalytic center.</p><p>All the deletion variants start with the skipping of the exon 2 or 6. This fact has been related with a drag mechanism of these exons over the rest, as proposed for other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Furthermore, all lack exon 6. To find out whether these variants are functional, the common exon 6 was deleted in the cloned whole protein. The loss of activity of the er-cHL-del6 suggests that none of the deleted forms has any activity. The presence of these inactive variants in tissues could be related with a block mechanism of the whole protein, as suggested for the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase and lyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>The high 70% sequence identity between er-cHL and mHL led us to propose a 3D structural model for er-cHL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Like mHL, the catalytic domain of er-cHL exhibits a TIM barrel (Î²Î±)<sub>8</sub> structure, with two additional Î± helices (H9 and H10) located at the COOH end in contact with H1 and H8. The comparison between the amino acid sequence of the two proteins (supplemental Fig. III) indicates that all the motifs previously shown to be essential for lyase activity and substrate binding in the mHL enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) are completely conserved in er-cHL and so presumably located at equivalent positions in the active site of both enzymes. Mutations of p.L207S and p.H248R in er-cHL exhibit a complete lack of enzymatic activity, as described for the mHL mutants. This supports the accuracy of the proposed model for er-cHL.</p><p>The studies performed in cells culture to identify the subcellular localization of the er-cHL show that it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> 4</xref>) but not in mitochondria or peroxisomes, like the HL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Furthermore, the association-dissociation experiment shows us that the novel enzyme is located in the ER membranes but that it is not an integral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). As Guo etÂ al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) reported the presence of a Î²-hydroxybutyrate deshydrogenase, only an enzyme with lyase capacity was necessary to close the ketone body synthesis cytosolic pathway. The findings of the er-cHL enzyme suggest at least the closure of this metabolic pathway.</p><p>The activity experiments show different kinetic parameters for the two isoenzymes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, er-cHL has a lower enzymatic rate and a higher substrate affinity than mHL, which suggests that it functions in a subcellular compartment where substrate availability may be low. Moreover, these results have been confirmed in different subcellular fractions of human testis. The kinetic characteristics of the cloned proteins and the subcellular fractions are similar. The data obtained for the er-cHL are similar to those found in the cytosol + reticulum fraction and for mHL and the mitochondrial fraction. All of these results reinforce the idea that these are the subcellular compartments in which both enzymes function.</p><p>The activity and expression tissue level results for er-cHL show a characteristic and different distribution pattern than the mHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). The absence of mHL activity in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) contrasts with appreciable er-cHL activity in this tissue, and it was initially suggested that these could be two tissue-specific isoenzymes. However, the high mHL activity in liver, the main ketogenic organ, is not accompanied by an absence of activity of the novel enzyme. The liver may also need the ketone bodies in normal-glycemic states, when the mHL is inactive. In these conditions, the er-cHL enzyme could play its functional role.</p><p>The results obtained in lung support a similar idea. In this organ, the synthesis of alveolar surfactant depends on the availability of glucose and ketone bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). The high novel enzyme activity in this tissue could be related with this synthesis. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of respiratory pathology in patients with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria. In acute crisis, these patients develop a hypoglycemic hypoketonemic profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), in which the main substrates for surfactant synthesis are absent. However, this condition does not alter respiratory activity, perhaps because the er-cHL can produce the required ketone bodies in situ in the cytosol.</p><p>The finding of er-cHL in brain suggests that the novel enzyme could play a key role in this tissue. Ketone bodies in brain are an alternative energy source to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Moreover, they have other functions, such as supplying the substrate for myelin lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) and neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). If cerebral ketone bodies depend exclusively on hepatic mHL activity, they can only be used in hypoglycemic situations. However, neuroprotective functions are not limited to this metabolic state. The er-cHL of the brain could provide the ketone bodies required to carry out these roles in situ in the cytosol. Furthermore, there is controversy as to whether there is brain lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). The finding of lyase activity in the cytosol + endoplasmic reticulum fraction (er-cHL) and its absence in the mitochondrial fraction (mHL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) could resolve this issue.</p><p>In summary, with the finding of the er-cHL in the cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum, the ketone body synthesis pathway in cytosol is completed. To date, the presence of this pathway had only been demonstrated in mitochondria or peroxisomes. Moreover, the tissue distribution pattern of the novel isoenzyme suggests that er-cHL and mHL perform different actions. While the mHL has a clear energy metabolism role, the er-cHL could be involved in other metabolic functions.</p></sec>
