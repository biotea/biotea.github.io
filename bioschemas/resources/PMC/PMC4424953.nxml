      <abstract>
        <p>mRNA decay is an essential and active process that allows cells to continuously adapt gene expression to internal and environmental cues. There are two mRNA degradation pathways: 3â² to 5â² and 5â² to 3â². The DCPS protein is the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme which functions in the last step of the 3â² end mRNA decay pathway. We have identified a <italic>DCPS</italic> pathogenic mutation in a large family with three affected individuals presenting with a novel recessive syndrome consisting of craniofacial anomalies, intellectual disability and neuromuscular defects. Using patient's primary cells, we show that this homozygous splice mutation results in a <italic>DCPS</italic> loss-of-function allele. Diagnostic biochemical analyses using various m<sub>7</sub>G cap derivatives as substrates reveal no DCPS enzymatic activity in patient's cells. Our results implicate DCPS and more generally RNA catabolism, as a critical cellular process for neurological development, normal cognition and organismal homeostasis in humans.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human mRNAs contain a modified 5â² cap that is generated co-transcriptionally. This structure is made of a guanosine methylated at position 7 linked to the first transcribed nucleotide by a 5â²-5â² triphosphate (<xref rid="DDV067C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The cap structure, marking the bona fide 5â² end of cellular and some viral mRNAs, plays an important role by facilitating pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA exportation to the cytoplasm, before promoting translation initiation (<xref rid="DDV067C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This landmark also protects mRNA from degradation by nucleases (<xref rid="DDV067C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). mRNA decay is, however, an essential process that allows cells to continuously adapt gene expression to internal and environmental changes. The cap structure needs to be eliminated as part of RNA turnover giving rise to free m<sub>7</sub>G cap (di-) nucleotides as end-products. The two major mRNA degradation mechanisms described in human cells result in the production of different cap derivatives (<xref rid="DDV067C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The first process involves the severing of the triphosphate linkage of the cap by the DCP2 (MIM609844) decapping enzyme yielding m<sub>7</sub>GDP (<xref rid="DDV067C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="DDV067C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The second process entails the 3â²-5â² exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA by the multi-subunit exosome (<xref rid="DDV067C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), releasing free cap (m<sub>7</sub>GpppN) which is degraded by the scavenger decapping enzyme DCPS (MIM610534) (<xref rid="DDV067C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This hydrolase, belonging to the HIT protein family, cleaves m<sub>7</sub>GpppN into m<sub>7</sub>GMP and NDP (<xref rid="DDV067C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). DCPS was also recently shown to be involved in the elimination of m<sub>7</sub>GDP formed by DCP2 (<xref rid="DDV067C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). DCPS is thus a major factor involved in the elimination of cap residues generated by mRNA degradation with an estimated number of 250 molecules being produced per minute in mammalian cells (<xref rid="DDV067C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="DDV067C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This enzyme is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, underlying its importance for basic cellular RNA homeostasis. No diseases or mutations have yet been reported in the DCP2 or DCPS enzymes in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical presentations of patients diagnosed with a novel autosomal recessive disorder</title><p>We studied a Jordanian inbred family consisting of three affected boys III-1, III-2 and III-6 with an unknown syndrome born to unaffected consanguineous parents (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F1">1</xref>A). The three propositi had birth weights below the 5th percentile ranging from 2.3 and 2.9 kg. All presented with similar congenital muscle hypotonia with severe growth delay as measured by height, weight and occipital head circumference at birth and during infancy. Brain structures were normal by MRI scans although all affected cases had mild microcephaly (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV067TB1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Developmental milestones including motor skills such as sitting, walking and linguistic acquisition were also significantly delayed. At age 7, proband (III:1) only spoke a few words, walked with ataxic gait and could not stand for long periods of time (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Video S1</ext-link>). Mild facial dysmorphisms including flat face with deep-set eyes, low-set ears, simple helices, small nose and mouth were observed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F1">1</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Other symptoms documented in all three patients include joint laxity, partial syndactyly, brachydactyly and sandal gap pointing to skeletal anomalies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Skin hypopigmentation and atrial septal defects were also recorded for all three propositi (TableÂ <xref ref-type="table" rid="DDV067TB1">1</xref>). None of these clinical phenotypes were observed in the non-affected family members. The overall clinical presentation consisting of severe growth delay, craniofacial anomalies, cognitive impairment and mild skeletal defects did not match with previously described syndromes suggesting that this may be an unrecognized congenital recessive disorder.

Quantitative PCR performed on dermal keratinocytes detected reduced levels of <italic>DCPS</italic> transcripts in heterozygous and homozygous mutant cells relative to control cells. The differences observed were consistent with the <italic>DCPS</italic> genotype (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>B). Likewise, QPCR performed on dermal fibroblasts confirmed the significant reduction of endogenous <italic>DCPS</italic> levels in both patients III:2 and III:6 relative to control cells which were taken from an age-and gender-matched healthy Jordanian (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>C). To identify what are the <italic>DCPS</italic> transcripts present in the patients' cells, primer sets were designed to distinguish isoforms 1, 2 and 3 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>A and D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv067/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</ext-link>). Sanger sequencing of all amplicons derived from patients' and control cDNA revealed the presence of the major canonical isoform 1 only in control cells but not in mutant cells. Unexpectedly, isoform 2 was seen in all genotypes (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>D). This indicates that the second cryptic splice site can be recognized in both cell types even when the canonical donor splice site of exon1 is not mutated. While it represents a minor form in control cells, isoform 2 is the sole transcript seen in patients' cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>D). Isoform 3 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>D and Data not shown) could not be amplified, but we reasoned that this may be due to the action of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) resulting from the inclusion of a premature termination codon (PTC) located in intron 1. To test this hypothesis, patients' and control fibroblasts were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inhibitor that blocks the NMD pathway (<xref rid="DDV067C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Levels of <italic>DCPS</italic> transcripts monitored by QPCR did not change, suggesting that isoform 3 may not exist (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>E).</p><p>We next assessed the consequences of having two <italic>DCPS</italic> isoforms on the synthesis of the DCPS enzyme in patients' cells. By western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-DCPS antibody, DCPS corresponding to the canonical isoform 1 was readily detected in control keratinocytes and fibroblasts but was entirely absent in mutant cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>F). A slight change in its apparent size was seen between the two control cell types which may be explained by DCPS-specific post-translational modifications such as acetylation (<xref rid="DDV067C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="DDV067C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The father's cells (II:2) exhibited nearly half the amount of DCPS isoform 1 relative to control cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>F). A longer exposure of the same blots revealed trace amounts of a slightly larger DCPS isoform likely representing the 7 amino-acid in-frame insertion translated from isoform 2 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>F). Mass spectrometry performed on cell lysates of patient III:6 confirmed that it was indeed DCPS (data not shown). These results suggest that the discovered splice site mutation completely abolished the translation of the canonical and most abundant DCPS isoform 1. However, we find that the minor isoform 2 is still produced resulting in the synthesis of a larger DCPS enzyme which differs only by one residue (p.V68A) between control and mutant cells. We conclude that the splicing machinery can occasionally skip the canonical donor site and splice at the newly identified cryptic site, albeit at a much lower frequency. By immunofluorescence, we found that in primary fibroblasts, staining for DCPS in the nucleus was lost in mutant cells relative to control cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV067F2">2</xref>G). Taken together, these results suggest that this rare splice site mutation in <italic>DCPS</italic> causes aberrant splicing resulting in the complete absence of the major DCPS isoform 1, leaving trace amounts of a novel DCPS isoform 2 carrying a homozygous (p.V68A) missense mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Patients' cells lack detectable DCPS enzymatic activities</title><p>To determine if the minor DCPS isoform 2, either wild-type and p.V68A mutant form, have any biological function, we compared their enzymatic activities relative to that of the major DCPS isoform 1.

This result demonstrates that all extracts are functional being able to phosphorylate m<sub>7</sub>GDP in m<sub>7</sub>GTP. However, patient extracts are specifically defective in DCPS activity that cleaves m<sub>7</sub>GTP into m<sub>7</sub>GMP. Altogether, these biochemical results demonstrate that cells from affected patients lack detectable DCPS enzymatic activity resulting in defective processing of cap derivatives generated by the 3â²-5â² and 5â²-3â² RNA decay mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we delineate a novel clinical entity which we suggest to refer to as Al-Raqad syndrome (ARS). ARS is a recessive congenital disorder with anomalies in multiple organs. Its most salient phenotypes comprise severe growth delay, neurological defects, cognitive impairment, skeletal and cardiac anomalies. Its genetic etiology can be attributed to homozygous loss-of-function alleles in the <italic>DCPS</italic> gene (MIM608183). The accompanying report by I. Ahmed <italic>et al.</italic> (2015) independently confirmed that a distinct homozygous splice mutation in intron 4 (c.636+1G&gt;A) or a compound heterozygous mutation in <italic>DCPS</italic> also cause neurological deficits in three affected individuals of Pakistani origin. We note that the patient's phenotypes differ in severity between the two families, possibly reflecting on the hypomorphic nature of the Pakistani allele. A similar situation exists in mice where a <italic>Dcps</italic> mouse knockout is reported to be embryonic lethal (<xref rid="DDV067C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) while a mutant <italic>Dcps</italic> mouse line, referenced at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI:1916555) is viable but phenotypic information is unavailable. No <italic>DCPS</italic> mutants have been reported for <italic>Drosophila</italic> or zebrafish but in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, knockdown of its homologue <italic>dcs-1</italic> increased spontaneous mutation rate favoring the accumulation of genetic lesions (<xref rid="DDV067C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Recent findings indicate that a second enzyme FHIT (MIM601153) is also working in the same mRNA scavenging pathway (<xref rid="DDV067C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Partial redundancy between DCPS and FHIT might limit the phenotypic consequences of a DCPS loss-of-function mutation. Given the implication of FHIT in cancer (<xref rid="DDV067C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and the fact that <italic>dcs-1</italic> increases genomic instability in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="DDV067C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), it will be of interest to test whether inactivation of both DCPS and FHIT results in higher mutation rates and/or of cancer incidence.</p><p>At the molecular level, the absence of DCPS will result in accumulation of cap derivatives generated by mRNA decay. These by-products may impair splicing, mRNA nuclear export and/or translation (<xref rid="DDV067C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), thus impacting on cell function. It is possible that neurons have less capacity to eliminate these by-products and/or are more sensitive to the long-term consequences of the cellular damage that they produce. Moreover, m<sub>7</sub>GTP, generated by conversion of m<sub>7</sub>GDP produced by the 5â²-3â² mRNA decay mechanism, could affect GTP-dependent processes, in particular some affecting neurons, such as tubulin polymerization and/or signal transduction by GTPases. The presence of m<sub>7</sub>GTP may also lead to the synthesis of mRNA containing modified bases. Interestingly, accumulation of m<sub>7</sub>G in mRNA was noticed in cells from patients suffering from Huntington's disease (<xref rid="DDV067C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) connecting the presence of this abnormal base in nucleic acid with neuronal degeneration leading to motor and cognitive troubles. DCPS activity has also been associated with the regulation of mRNA degradation by XRN1 (<xref rid="DDV067C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="DDV067C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and the function of the SMN protein (<xref rid="DDV067C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

It is possible that alteration of DCPS in a context were SMN is fully functional in all tissues negatively impact on the balance of DCPS/SMN activities with detrimental consequences on neuronal functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients and clinical assessments</title><p>The affected children were initially diagnosed at Queen Rania Paediatric Hospital in Amman (Jordan) by Dr Mohammad Al-Raqad.
