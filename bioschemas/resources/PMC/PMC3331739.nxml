          <p>Liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis that is elevated by obesity and dietary fat intake. Whether FBPase functions only to regulate glucose or has other metabolic consequences is not clear; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the importance of liver FBPase in body weight regulation. To this end we performed comprehensive physiologic and biochemical assessments of energy balance in liver-specific transgenic FBPase mice and negative control littermates of both sexes. In addition, hepatic branch vagotomies and pharmacologic inhibition studies were performed to confirm the role of FBPase. Compared with negative littermates, liver-specific FBPase transgenic mice had 50% less adiposity and ate 15% less food but did not have altered energy expenditure. The reduced food consumption was associated with increased circulating leptin and cholecystokinin, elevated fatty acid oxidation, and 3-Î²-hydroxybutyrate ketone levels, and reduced appetite-stimulating neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y and Agouti-related peptide. Hepatic branch vagotomy and direct pharmacologic inhibition of FBPase in transgenic mice both returned food intake and body weight to the negative littermates. This is the first study to identify liver FBPase as a previously unknown regulator of appetite and adiposity and describes a novel process by which the liver participates in body weight regulation.</p>

  <body><p>Over recent years, excessive nutrient intake has been associated with rapidly increasing rates of obesity in both developed and developing societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Despite much effort, the specific biochemical mechanisms involved in body weight regulation are not completely understood.</p><p>Body weight is maintained by a fine balance between food intake and energy expenditure. Under normal conditions, energy homeostasis is maintained through a complex interaction between peripheral organs and the central nervous system (CNS). Many peripheral signals from white adipose tissue, the gut, and the pancreas are known to regulate body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The CNS receives these signals and adjusts food intake and energy expenditure accordingly. Although not normally considered as one of the classic body weight regulatory organs, indirect evidence has accumulated over the years in a variety of models to suggest a role for the liver in controlling food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Russek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) was the first to propose that a signal to terminate food intake was generated from the liver. This was based on studies demonstrating that direct injection of glucose into the liver of fasted dogs suppressed food intake more effectively than systemic injection of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Direct infusion of free fatty acids (FFAs) into the hepatic portal vein of rats has also demonstrated an involvement of the liver in lowering food intake through an increase in liver fatty acid oxidation (FAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Conversely, the fructose analog 2,5-anhydro-<sc>d</sc>-mannitol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and other metabolic and FAO inhibitors have been reported to stimulate appetite when administered into animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The gene expressing fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is one of many genes upregulated in the liver by obesity and fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Even though FBPase is known as a regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, a previous study from our laboratory showed that liver-specific FBPase transgenic mice with a physiologic threefold level of overexpression had no change in whole-body glucose tolerance or endogenous glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Surprisingly, the mice consistently displayed an approximate 10% reduction in body weight compared with negative littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), leading us to propose that liver FBPase may have a novel role in the control of body weight.</p><p>We therefore investigated this potential regulatory role of liver FBPase by using our transgenic mouse model that specifically overexpresses FBPase in the liver. We report that overexpression of this liver enzyme leads to the lean body weight phenotype in the transgenic mice by markedly reducing adiposity levels by â¼50%. Reductions in food intake rather than elevated energy expenditure were found to be the contributing factors. The appetite-stimulating neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), were significantly suppressed, whereas the circulating satiety hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), and leptin, rose significantly. Elevation of liver FAO via an increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) appears to be the key linking the increase in liver FBPase to reduced food intake and adiposity in our transgenic mouse.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Animals.</title><p>Hemizygous transgenic mice (males and females) overexpressing the human liver FBPase gene (<italic>FBP-1</italic>) specifically in the liver and their age-matched negative littermate controls, both on a C57Bl6/J background, were used unless otherwise stated.

A laparotomy incision was made on the ventral midline, and the abdominal wall was opened with a second incision. The common hepatic vagal branch was located (under the liver) and transected, stretching the fascia containing the common hepatic branch using fine forceps. A similar incision was also made in the sham-operated mice and the hepatic vagus nerve was located but not transected. The incisions were sutured, mice were administered saline (1 mL) intraperitoneally to aid in postsurgery recovery, and were allowed to recover for 1 week.

Paradoxically, several antidiabetes medications, including the thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and insulin, have the undesired side effect of promoting weight gain. Because there are data showing inappropriate elevation of gluconeogenesis in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), a recent target for glucose-lowering medications has been the gluconeogenic enzyme FBPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Liver FBPase was increased in animal models of obesity and insulin resistance, in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and after fat-feeding in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The NZO mouse is a model of obesity, glucose intolerance, and liver insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) associated with increased liver FBPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). After administration of a specific liver FBPase allosteric inhibitor, we were surprised to find significant, sustained increases in food intake and body weight gain compared with vehicle-treated mice. Similarly, administration of another selective FBPase inhibitor to ZDF rats also resulted in a significant increase in body weight after 1 month of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Together, the data suggest that upregulation of liver FBPase may not only be important in glucose metabolism but may also play a significant part in a homeostatic mechanism to control body weight in states of excess nutrient intake.</p><p>Overexpression of FBPase specifically in the liver of mice resulted in a lean body weight phenotype that was observed consistently throughout adult life, a finding that has not been reported previously. In association with this lean phenotype, there was a dramatic &gt;50% reduction in white adipose tissue mass across the three fat depots measured. We did not directly measure lean body mass so cannot discount the possibility that such a reduction may also be a contributing factor. Nonetheless, the large decrease in adiposity suggests that liver FBPase may be highly important in regulating adiposity. We found that reduced food intake, rather than increases in energy expenditure, was strongly associated with the reduction in adiposity and was specific to liver FBPase expression because we have previously shown no body weight phenotype in mice specifically overexpressing FBPase in the Î²-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Reductions in the appetite-stimulating neuropeptides (NPY and AgRP) were the basis of this effect, which we were able to reverse with pharmacologic inhibition of FBPase (along with body weight and food intake). The lack of effect of the inhibitor in the negative littermates is not surprising, given we are proposing that the action of FBPase occurs to limit the amount of weight gained in response to nutrient overconsumption. Body weight is regulated by a plethora of endogenous hormone/peptide combinations, and FBPase alone is not critical in these situations. Studies in humans with a deficiency in endogenous liver FBPase (due to mutations in the <italic>FBP1</italic> gene) causes a disruption in gluconeogenesis that leads to recurrent episodes of fasting hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis that is often lethal during the neonatal period and infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). These studies show no evidence of increased body weight or appetite in response to reduced FBPase levels and, in fact, show that alternate metabolic consequences occur when FBPase is nonfunctional. This evidence substantiates our hypothesis that increased liver FBPase does not function in the normal physiologic regulation of body weight but acts only when the system is exposed to excess nutrients (i.e., fat). Furthermore, our data demonstrate a strong link between liver and the hypothalamus to suppress appetite-stimulating hormones to lower food intake and reduce adiposity, an observation never before reported.</p><p>The vagus nerve serves as the primary line of communication between the liver and the CNS and has both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Indeed, hepatic branch vagotomies in our transgenic mice increased food intake and, consequently, body weight gain, demonstrating a requirement for vagal nerve signaling. In fact, we found a clear 30% increase in circulating CCK and leptin levels in the transgenic mice, hormones known to act via the vagus nerve, supporting a role for this nerve in mediating FBPasesâ satiety effects. Furthermore, studies using the specific CCK1R antagonist, lorglumide, clearly showed increased food intake in the transgenic mice to similar levels seen in the negative mice. The paradoxic finding of increased leptin in the transgenic mice is surprising given that leptin is tightly regulated with adiposity. There is a possibility that FBPase may activate a signal from the liver to adipose tissue to stimulate leptin production and secretion, however, this has not been investigated. Nevertheless, our data lend critical support for the important and essential involvement of the vagus nerve in the altered body weight of the FBPase transgenic mice.</p><p>Our group has previously shown that increased levels of circulating BHB, a by-product of liver FAO, is linked to elevated CCK levels in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Our transgenic mice also have elevated circulating BHB levels, and when BHB was administered to C57BL/6J mice, food intake decreased, which was associated with higher circulating CCK concentration. These data not only support a positive link between BHB and CCK levels as seen in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) but also provide direct evidence that ketones are effective in lowering food intake through CCK stimulation. However, the mechanism(s) by which BHB regulates CCK production and secretion is not understood. The increases seen in CPT1-a, its regulators PGC1-Î± and PPARÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), and the elevated food intake after etomoxir inhibition, support the BHB data and the overall finding of increased FAO, and are consistent with the increase seen in whole-body fat oxidation (RQ and fat oxidation rates). Our data demonstrate for the first time that increased FAO plays a key role in the reduced appetite of our liver-specific FBPase transgenic mice.</p><p>In seeking the reason for increased FAO, we considered alterations in ATP levels and induction of AMPK, known to be intimately involved in FAO. Our previous characterization of the Î²-cellâ specific FBPase transgenic mice showed reduced glycolysis and pancreatic ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). A reduction in ATP levels may also be occurring in the liver-specific FBPase transgenic mice to increase liver FAO (and generate more ATP) via AMPK activation. However, no differences were found when liver ATP and phospho-AMPK levels were assessed, implying an AMPK-independent pathway. The HBP has been proposed as another cellular sensor of energy availability in muscle and fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), with the main enzyme, OGT, acting as a catalytic subunit for the target of many substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The transgenic mice have increased glycerol gluconeogenesis and circulating glycerol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) leading to elevated F6P levels, the substrate for the HBP and the product of the reaction that FBPase catalyses, and together with elevated OGT levels, implies increased HBP flux. Recently, PGC1-Î± has been shown to form a complex with OGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and was significantly elevated in our transgenic mice. PGC1-Î± works with PPARÎ± to mediate CPT1-a transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and thus activate FAO, which as our data clearly show, does occur. Thus, the action of liver FBPase that appears to regulate food intake in our transgenic mice is likely due to an increased flux through the HBP because its activation leads to increased CPT1-a expression (via PGC-1Î± and PPARÎ± upregulation) and an overall increase in FAO.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that a specific upregulation of FBPase in the liver leads to increased FAO, overproduction of BHB, stimulation of CCK and leptin release, and the generation of a vagal signal leading to reduction in the appetite stimulating hormones, NPY and AgRP, and a subsequent reduction in food intake. We propose that increased expression of liver FBPase after nutrient excess, such as a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), is a novel negative feedback mechanism developed to limit weight gain in response to an abundance of dietary fat. Furthermore, our finding provides strong evidence that any drug to successfully inhibit FBPase will lead to weight gain. Unlike the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones that increase subcutaneous but decrease visceral fat deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), the use of FBPase inhibitors would also likely increase all fat depots, potentially worsening metabolic control for patients with type 2 diabetes. We have clearly demonstrated that liver FBPase should be viewed not only as a mediator of glucose metabolism but also as an important regulator of appetite and adiposity.</p></sec>
