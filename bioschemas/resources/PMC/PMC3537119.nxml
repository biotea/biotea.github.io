        <p id="P1">The function of interleukin 37 (formerly IL-1 family member 7) remains elusive. Expression of IL-37 in macrophages or epithelial cells imparted near complete suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the abundance of these cytokines increased with silencing of endogenous IL-37 in human blood cells. Anti-inflammatory cytokines remained unchanged under similar conditions. IL-37-transgenic mice were protected from lipopolysaccharide-induced shock, exhibiting markedly improved lung and kidney function and reduced liver damage. IL-37-transgenic mice had less circulating and tissue cytokines (72-95% lower) than wild-type mice and exhibited less dendritic cell activation. IL-37 interacted intracellularly with Smad3 and IL-37-expressing cells and transgenic mice exhibited less cytokine suppression when endogenous Smad3 was depleted. IL-37 thus emerges as a natural suppressor of innate inflammatory and immune responses.</p>

    <p id="P2">The interleukin 1 (IL-1) family of ligands comprises 11 members; most are pro-inflammatory. The receptors, signaling pathways, and functions of the classical family members (IL-1Î± [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A004200">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A004200</ext-link>] and IL-1Î² [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A003663">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A003663</ext-link>], IL-18) have been studied extensively. Among the more recently described IL-1 family cytokines, IL-33 (also called IL-1F11) stands apart, as it is the long-sought ligand for the IL-1 receptor family member ST2 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>). Knowledge of IL-1F7, on the other hand, which was first identified by <italic>in silico</italic> research in 2000 (summarized in<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>) remains limited. With the exception of IL-18 and IL-33, the entire human <italic>IL1</italic> family maps to the IL-1 family cluster of genes on chromosome 2 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>). Comprising 12 Î²-barrel strands, IL-1F7 shares the structural pattern of the IL-1 family but particularly that of IL-18 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>). Although constitutive IL-1F7 mRNA is found in the testis, thymus and uterus, IL-1F7 is inducible in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dendritic cells<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The protein has been reported in monocytes<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, tonsil plasma cells, and breast carcinoma cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Five splice variants exist (IL-1F7a through e)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, with IL-1F7b (NM014439) being the largest and is comprised from 5 of the 6 exons. None of the isoforms contain a typical signal peptide, but IL-1F7b and IL-1F7c each contain exons 1 and 2, and exon 1 encodes a putative caspase-1 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000492">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A000492</ext-link>] cleavage site. In addition, IL-1F7b can form homodimers<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Interestingly, IL-1F7 is the only IL-1 family member for which a murine homologue has yet to be found.</p>
    <p id="P3">Processing by caspase-1 cleaves the recombinant (r)IL-1F7b precursor into mature IL-1F7b<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Both the precursor and mature rIL-1F7b are reported to bind to the IL-18 receptor Î± chain (IL-18RÎ±) as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation assays of IL-18RÎ±:Fc constructs. However, the affinity of IL-18 itself for IL-18RÎ± is approximately 50 times higher than that of mature rIL-1F7b<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Although mature IL-1F7b binds to IL-18RÎ±:Fc, rIL-1F7b did not antagonize the activities of IL-18 such as induction of interferon Î³ (IFN-Î³)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and thus is not a receptor antagonist for IL-18 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>). However, consistent with the binding of rIL-1F7b to IL-18RÎ±, IL-1F7b forms a complex with IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A001254">http://www.signaling-gateway.org/molecule/query?afcsid=A001254</ext-link>])<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, the natural antagonist of IL-18 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>). Lower concentrations of IL-18BP inhibit IL-18 activity more effectively than higher concentrations<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, which may be attributable to complex formation between IL-1F7b and IL-18BP. Previously, we reported that mature IL-1F7b translocates into the nucleus and that this process was dependent on caspase-1 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>). We therefore proposed that IL-1F7b may act as a cytokine with intracellular as well as extracellular functionality.</p>
    <p id="P4">Here, we present the functional role and mechanism of action for IL-1F7. To accomplish this, we either reduced IL-1F7 expression in human PBMCs with siRNA or expressed the cytokine in human macrophages, epithelial cells, and mouse macrophages. Moreover, a mouse strain transgenic for IL-1F7b was generated and subjected to non-lethal endotoxic shock, in which heterozygotes and homozygotes were studied. From the data presented here, IL-1F7 emerges as a natural inhibitor of immune responses. Because of the fundamental nature of these effects, we propose this member of the IL-1 family to be assigned the name IL-37.</p>

        <title>Regulation and function of endogenous IL-37</title>
        <p id="P5">Regulation and function of endogenous IL-37 are unknown. First, steady-state constitutive and inducible IL-37 protein abundance was assessed in PBMCs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The TLR ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> as well as transforming growth factor Î²<sub>1</sub> (TGF-Î²<sub>1</sub>) were highly effective in inducing IL-37 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, left). IL-18, IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and CpG also increased synthesis, whereas IL-4 plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibited constitutive IL-37 expression.</p>
        <p id="P6">To assess the function of endogenous IL-37, PBMCs from seven donors were transfected with concentration-matched pairs of scrambled siRNA or siRNA to IL-37 (siIL-37). IL-37 protein abundance in LPS-stimulated PBMCs was considerably reduced by specific siRNA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the same cells, treatment with siIL-37 consistently resulted in dose-dependent 2- to 3-fold increases in production of mature IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF in PBMCs stimulated with either LPS or Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). PBMCs were also stimulated with the TLR6-TLR2 ligand MALP-2, which resulted in a comparable pattern (data not shown). In contrast, anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-1Ra expression in these same supernatants were unaffected by siIL-37 treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The effect of reducing endogenous IL-37 in LPS-stimulated PBMCs was further investigated using an array of 36 cytokines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). The array confirmed the results described above; moreover, the array revealed changes in protein abundance of IL-1Î± (50% increased) as well as GM-CSF and G-CSF (2.1- and 2.4-fold increases, respectively).</p>
        <p id="P7">To demonstrate the expression of IL-37 in human disease, synovial tissue from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were subjected to immunohistochemistry. Diseased synovial lining contained large amounts of IL-37 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>).Thus, we found that production of IL-37 is induced through pattern-recognition and cytokine stimulation and that endogenous IL-37 is a response that limits runaway inflammation initiated by innate pathways.</p>

        <title>IL-37 abrogates pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW cells</title>
        <p id="P8">Using a mouse macrophage RAW cell line which stably expresses the human IL-37b isoform (IL-1F7b, in keeping with the splice variant nomenclature)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, termed RAW-IL-37, we observed that the cytokine was expressed constitutively at low amounts, whereas protein expression dose-dependently increased upon stimulation with LPS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, left). In RAW cells, the molecular weight of IL-37b was 25 kDa; however, endogenous IL-37 in PBMCs migrated at a molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). As the immunoblots were performed under non-reducing conditions, this result is likely due to homodimerization<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. We ascertained specificity of the IL-37 antibody by depletion using excess recombinant IL-37b (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, right).</p>
        <p id="P9">Having confirmed that IL-37b was highly effective in reducing LPS-stimulated TNF, MIP-2, and IL-1Î± (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-d</xref>) as compared to mock-transfected RAW cells, we performed an array of 40 mouse cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. In RAW-IL-37 cells, several major cytokines such as IL-1Î± (by 88%) and IL-6 (86%) were almost completely suppressed in (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Production of M-CSF, BCA-1, GM-CSF, and IL-1Î² was considerably (55 - 62%) reduced, and MCP-5, IL-23, and IL-1Ra, were also lower. The mean changes in other molecules were below 30% (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Stimulation of RAW-IL-37 cells with IL-1Î² or TNF revealed similar reductions in IL-1Î±, TNF, and MIP-2 expression (data not shown).</p>
        <p id="P10">Various TLR ligands induced IL-37b in RAW-IL-37 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, right). Pronounced reductions in IL-1Î±, MIP-2, TNF, and IL-6 expression (by up to 99, 97, 92, and 98%, respectively) also occurred in RAW-IL-37 cells when stimulated by various TLR ligands (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Therefore, expression of IL-37b in murine RAW macrophages reduced TLR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>

        <title>IL-37 reduces cytokines in monocytic and epithelial cells</title>
        <p id="P11">The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was transiently transfected with a pIRES vector controlled by a constitutively active cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter that contained full-length IL-37b linked to a FLAG tag at its carboxyl terminus. The vector also contained a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-coding sequence. IL-37b expression significantly reduced spontaneous and LPS-induced IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², TNF, and IL-8 expression in undifferentiated (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) and phorbol ester (PMA)-differentiated<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> THP-1 cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>). This suppression was also observed for IL-1Î²-induced expression of IL-1Î±, IL-8, and TNF (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a,c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P12">Steady-state IL-37 mRNA is found in tissues rich in epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Hence, we transfected the epithelial cell line A549 with the pIRES-IL-37b plasmid (immunofluorescence in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>, immunoblot in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Constitutive and IL-1Î²-induced IL-6 and IL-1Î± production were reduced by 43 and 47% and 34 and 42%, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). The reduction of IL-1Î²- and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes and macrophages as well as in epithelial cells is consistent with the data obtained by vector-mediated expression of IL-37b in RAW cells and also by silencing endogenous IL-37 in primary human blood mononuclear cells.</p>

        <title>Smad3 and IL-37 form a functional complex</title>
        <p id="P13">In a proteomics-based search for proteins interacting with Smad3, IL-37 was listed<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we transfected human A549 cells with FLAG-tagged IL-37b and observed that IL-37b co-localized with phospho-Smad3 by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, bright yellow in the overlay). Both IL-37b and phospho-Smad3 were induced by IL-1Î² and most prominently stained in perinuclear and cytosolic regions. Images of the corresponding controls (mock-transfected cells) are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>. Furthermore, IL-37b-Smad3 complex formation was demonstrated by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The occurrence of more than one band is likely due to alternate splicing of Smad3 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>).</p>
        <p id="P14">Next, we tested the hypothesis that Smad3 is required for IL-37 activity. We used the specific inhibitor SIS3 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>) to block Smad3 activation and observed a dose-dependent reversal of the inhibition of IL-6 and IL-1Î± expression in the LPS-stimulated RAW-IL-37 cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Under the same conditions, the effects of SIS3 in mock-transfected RAW cells were absent. We then evaluated the IL-37b-Smad3 interactions in THP-1 cells. The SIS3-induced increases in IL-1Î² expression were significantly greater when high concentrations of IL-37b were present (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). By immunofluorescence, there was similar colocalization of IL-37b and Smad3 in THP-1 cells as observed in A549 cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p id="P15">We then generated stable THP-1 clones depleted of Smad3 by lentiviral shRNA coding for Smad3 (mRNA reduction to roughly 12% of that of scrambled siRNA-transfected clones (data not shown), protein knockdown shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). In these cells, the ability of IL-37b to reduce IL-1Î²- or LPS-induced production of IL-8 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), IL-6, and TNF (not shown) was considerably reduced. These <italic>in vitro</italic> findings were confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> as described below.</p>

        <title>Post-receptor signal transduction in the presence of IL-37</title>
        <p id="P16">We determined activation of 37 different kinases triggered by treatment of LPS plus IFN-Î³ in THP-1 cells transfected with IL-37b. Regulators of cellular adhesion and migration, namely focal adhesion kinase (FAK), proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), and paxillin, were suppressed by up to 78% (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38Î± was reduced by 51% and expression of multiple STAT transcription factors, hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), p53, and target of rapamycin (TOR) were also lower in IL-37b-transfected cells as compared to controls. Because changes in kinases affect cellular proliferation and differentiation, we assessed live-cell images from RAW-IL-37 and mock-transfected RAW cells. We observed striking morphological differences in cells transfected with IL-37b. For example, whereas mock-transfected RAW cells formed pseudopodia, RAW-IL-37 hardly did so (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a (arrows) and b</xref>). Moreover, stimulation with LPS induced considerable vacuolization in most mock-transfected cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>, arrows), but not in RAW-IL-37. Similar results were obtained when the cells were treated with TLR ligands 1 to 6 and 9 (data not shown). We therefore demonstrate that IL-37b regulates post-receptor signal transduction in a specific fashion and that these effects result not only in a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, but also in morphological changes in RAW cells.</p>

        <title>IL-37 protects mice from LPS-induced shock</title>
        <p id="P17">To investigate whether IL-37 suppresses innate responses to LPS <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a line of mice transgenic for FLAG-tagged IL-37b (IL-37tg). The presence or absence of IL-37b protein expression in IL-37tg or PCR-negative littermates (neg) was confirmed by FLAG immunoprecipitation and IL-37 staining of splenocytes as well as by IL-37 immunoblots on white blood cell lysates (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). We observed that, similar to <italic>in vitro</italic> results, uninduced, steady-state production of IL-37b <italic>in vivo</italic> was low despite the constitutively active CMV promoter. Synthesis of IL-37b was augmented by LPS administration. Outside of experimental settings, the IL-37tg colony did not differ from negative or wild-type mice: growth, behavior, reproduction, and male-to-female ratio were equal over many generations.</p>
        <p id="P18">We induced non-lethal endotoxic shock in IL-37tg, negative littermates, and wild-type mice with 10 mg/kg LPS injected i.p. The various parameters assessed did not reveal differences between negative littermates and wild-type mice; thus, these two groups are shown as one (hereafter designated as neg-WT). To establish normal values in this model, additional mice from each group received vehicle only. In this latter group, we found no difference in any parameter between IL-37tg and neg-WT. Compared to neg-WT, the effects of endotoxemia were markedly attenuated in the IL-37tg mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c-k</xref>). LPS-induced hypothermia was less in IL-37tg, with the effect being most pronounced in homozygotes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). IL-37tg mice also achieved respiratory compensation of the metabolic acidosis induced by LPS. For example, pH and HCO<sub>3</sub> were higher, pCO<sub>2</sub> was lower, and the base excess (BE) was less negative in IL-37tg than in neg-WT mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d-g</xref>). IL-37tg mice were less dehydrated, as blood Na concentrations were not significantly different from vehicle-controls (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). Likewise, IL-37b conferred protection from a rise in potassium concentrations which in neg-WT mice reached nearly 6 mmol/l after LPS challenge (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>). Moreover, LPS-induced liver damage, as measured by increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), was prevented in IL-37tg as the plasma activity of this enzyme was close to that in vehicle-injected control animals (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref>). Similar results were obtained for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P19">These physiological findings in IL-37tg mice were accompanied by a reduction of various cytokines in different compartments as compared to control mice similarly challenged by LPS (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref>,<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In the plasma, reduced concentrations (up to 65% reduction compared to controls) of IL-6, IL-1Î², IL-17, and IFN-Î³ were seen in heterozygous IL-37tg mice, whereas in homozygotes these cytokines were nearly absent (72 to 95% reduction, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). A cytokine protein array analysis revealed that 18 cytokines were reduced by more than 33% in IL-37tg, 16 of which were pro-inflammatory (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Among the cytokines that were found in similar abundance in the plasma of IL-37tg and neg-WT were the anti-inflammatory I-309, IL-13, and IL-10. These findings, together with the finding that IL-4 and IL-27 averaged up to 2.5-fold increased concentrations in the plasma of IL-37tg mice, demonstrate IL-37b expression results in a specific modulation of the immune response to LPS. Importantly, these data are highly consistent with the suppression of cytokine production in cells transfected with IL-37b.</p>
        <p id="P20">The amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the spleens and lungs of IL-37tg mice were also lower than in organs from neg-WT mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6d,e</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). With the exception of splenic expression of IL-1Î±, the pattern of cytokine regulation in the organs and the systemic circulation was similar. Interestingly, as opposed to the pro-inflammatory cytokines, the immunosuppressive TGF-Î²<sub>1</sub> was not reduced, but 1.8-fold increased in the spleens of IL-37tg mice.</p>
        <p id="P21">Since the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-37b was not limited to cytokines of innate immunity, we determined whether IL-37b affected the function of dendritic cells (DCs), which serve as coordinators of immune responses. Among the splenocytes from the same mice shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, we identified CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs and assessed their activation status by measuring the surface expression of CD86 (B7-2, a co-stimulatory molecule that facilitates T cell activation) and MHC class II (a stimulator of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells). We observed that the presence of IL-37b conferred a marked reduction in LPS-induced DC activation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). Whereas in LPS-injected neg-WT mice the average expression of CD86 and MHC II on DCs was 73% with a range from 46 to 89%, IL-37tg homozygotes only averaged 47% CD86<sup>+</sup>MHC II<sup>+</sup> with a range from 18 to 69%, indicating that considerably fewer DCs were activated in IL-37tg. Consistent with previous data (e.g.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>), DCs in vehicle-treated mice were about 40% CD86<sup>+</sup>MHC II<sup>+</sup> with no difference between neg-WT, IL-37tg heterozygotes, and IL-37tg homozygotes. Thus, IL-37b reduced the number of activated DCs to near constitutive background. We also measured activation of macrophages, which exhibited similar, but less pronounced inhibition (data not shown). Total numbers of DCs, macrophages (F4/80<sup>+</sup>), NK cells (NK1-1<sup>+</sup>), and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were similar in all strains and experimental conditions (not shown).</p>
        <p id="P22">In cultures of fresh whole blood from the mice, we found that production of IL-6 and TNF induced by LPS, LPS plus IL-12, IL-1b, TNF, and IL-12 plus IL-18 were up to 86% lower in IL-37tg than in neg-WT (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d,e</xref>). Hence, the anti-inflammatory functions of IL-37 are also observed in various conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. By suppressing pro- but sparing anti-inflammatory cytokines and by inhibiting DC activation, IL-37b protected the lung, kidney, and liver in a model of endotoxic shock.</p>

        <title>Smad3 <italic>in vivo</italic>-knockdown reduces the activity of IL-37</title>
        <p id="P23">To demonstrate that Smad3 contributes to the function of IL-37 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we silenced Smad3 in the lungs of IL-37tg and neg-WT mice. Effective knockdown was determined by immunoblotting (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Cytokine assays on the same lysates demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory function of IL-37 was considerably reduced when Smad3 was silenced (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b,c</xref>). Whereas IL-1Î² protein abundance was 94% lower in IL-37tg mice compared to controls when scrambled siRNA was inhaled, this reduction was only 63% when Smad3 was silenced. For IL-17 expression, IL-37b-mediated reduction of protein concentrations was from 40.4 to 5.8 pg/mg total protein (86%) with scrambled siRNA, but only 53.3 to 35.7 pg/mg total protein (33%) with siRNA to Smad3. The effect of siRNA to Smad3 was a 1.5- to 2.4-fold increase in cytokine production in neg-WT, compared to an up to 15-fold increase in IL-37tg. These experiments corroborate the functional link between IL-37 and Smad3 but also are relevant to the anti-inflammatory portfolio of TGF-Î².</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P24">Since the first description of IL-37 (IL-1F7) in 2000 (ref <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>), there has been no report on the function of endogenous IL-37. In the present study, reduction of IL-37 protein synthesis in PBMCs with specific siRNA increased the production of several pro-inflammatory mediators, among these IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-12, G-SCF, GM-CSF, and TNF. Remarkably, expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra and IL-10 in the same cultures was unaffected. These data suggest that IL-37 acts as a negative feedback inhibitor of inflammatory responses and that this function is not dependent on anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Since several TLR ligands as well as IL-1Î², TNF, IFN-Î³, and IL-18 induce IL-37, the siRNA data suggest that the mitigating activity of this cytokine affects a wide spectrum of inflammatory assaults. It is not unexpected that inflammation induces anti-inflammatory mechanisms in order to limit damage. Therefore, the observations that, in general, IL-37 is not constitutively expressed in tissues from healthy subjects but expression is high in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis are in accord with the concept that the function of IL-37 constitutes a negative feedback mechanism to curb excessive inflammation.</p>
      <p id="P25">Unexpectedly, low concentrations of the immunoregulatory cytokine TGF-Î²<sub>1</sub> were effective in inducing endogenous IL-37, which is relevant to the interaction of IL-37 with Smad3. In a study designed to identify intracellular candidates that bind to Smad3 using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, the only cytokine among the proteins binding Smad3 was IL-37 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>). Smad proteins are the major intracellular signaling effectors of TGF-Î² and are phosphorylated by TGF-Î² receptors upon binding the ligand. Following phosphorylation, Smad3 translocates to the nucleus and affects gene transcription. For example, Smad3 binding to DNA inhibits DC and macrophage activation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, skews T cells towards tolerance<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or inhibits cellular cytotoxicity<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We previously demonstrated that IL-37b translocates to the nucleus<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and in the present study, we observed that IL-37b binds to both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Smad3 in A549 and THP-1 cells by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, each of which is consistent with the intracellular complex of Smad3-IL-37 identified by mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The functionality of this complex was tested by using a specific inhibitor of Smad3 in RAW and THP-1 cells and siRNA to Smad3 <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, silencing endogenous Smad3 significantly reduced the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37b.</p>
      <p id="P26">We conclude that IL-37 functions, at least in part, with Smad3, thus facilitating the known cytokine-suppressing properties of TGF-Î²<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Foremost, TGF-Î² is well established as a major inhibitor of DC function. For example, TGF-Î² and the downstream activation of the Smad pathway were required for Treg-mediated suppression of DC function, including expression of CD86 and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a murine leukemia model<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In three other studies, blockade of TGF-Î² resulted in reduced capacity of antigen presentation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> or costimulation<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> in human DC <italic>in vitro</italic>; also, treatment with TGF-Î²<sub>1</sub> caused a reduction of IL-12 production and a reduced stimulation of T-cell proliferation by human monocyte-derived DCs<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, functional inactivation of the TGF-Î² receptor (and hence TGF-Î² signaling) in DCs resulted in increased production of T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokines and aggravation of autoimmune encephalomyelitis<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. These data concur with IL-37b-mediated suppression of DC function as well as cytokine regulation, the latter including the elimination of the low background expression of natural IL-37 by IL-4/GM-CSF and the pronounced effect of IL-37 on GM-CSF.</p>
      <p id="P27">The concept that IL-37 acts via an intracellular mechanism in translocating to the nucleus is not new in cytokine biology. For example, IL-1Î± is found in the nucleus and affects the transcriptional machinery<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. IL-33 also functions as an endothelial transcription factor<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Outside the IL-1 family, IL-16 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>), HMGB-1 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>), and MIF<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> are examples for cytokines with intracellular activities. However, these cytokines also exhibit a second function; released from the cell, they trigger their cognate cell surface receptor. Thus, these molecules reveal a dual mode of action. Although recombinant IL-37 has been reported to bind to IL-18RÎ±<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, IL-37 does not appear to function as a receptor antagonist for IL-18. However, in the presence of low concentrations of IL-18 binding protein, recombinant IL-37 reduces IL-18-induced IFN-Î³<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P28">As anticipated from the increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines with siRNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous IL-37, several LPS- and IL-1Î²-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were markedly decreased in human and murine macrophages; the cell type in which most previous studies on IL-37 were conducted<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Since IL-37 is naturally expressed in organs comprising epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, we transfected human lung epithelial cells and confirmed that IL-37 was active in this model. This extension of IL-37 activity to now also including IL-1-mediated signals in epithelia is important, as IL-1Î² stimulation and downstream effector functions of IL-6 constitute major pro-inflammatory insults for epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P29">Despite the constitutively active CMV promoter, IL-37b protein amounts were low under steady-state conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but markedly increased with an inflammatory challenge Consequently, IL-37b-mediated reductions in cytokines were also only observed during inflammation. This observation is consistent with the presence of a coding region instability element in IL-37b mRNA, which is overcome by exogenous stimulation, resulting in mRNA stabilization and IL-37b protein production<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We therefore infer that the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by IL-37 is undesirable under resting conditions and for the early stages of innate immune responses, but that later, when increasing danger is sensed, expression of IL-37 prevents an excessive inflammatory response.</p>
      <p id="P30">Among the kinases whose phosphorylation was suppressed by IL-37b expression were STATs 1-4, which are involved in signal transduction of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-Î³<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Thus, their deactivation represents a straightforward mechanism utilized by IL-37 to attenuate inflammation; furthermore, this notion is in accord with a functional IL-37-Smad3 complex, as Smad3 mostly antagonizes STAT1 and STAT3 (examples in<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, respectively). The same is valid for the reduction of c-Jun, which is a part of the IL-1-inducible pro-inflammatory transcription factor AP-1 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>) and is inhibited by TGF-Î²<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Expression of IL-37b also reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK which holds a central position in several, predominantly pro-inflammatory signaling cascades<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, GSK-3Î±/Î² phosphorylation is increased by IL-37b expression, rendering this kinase inactive. Remarkably, such inhibition of GSK-3 activity skews TLR-ligand-triggered monocytes away from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and towards producing IL-10 (ref. <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>).</p>
      <p id="P31">To assess IL-37 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a mouse strain transgenic for human IL-37b. Both heterozygous and homozygous IL-37tg mice were protected from non-lethal LPS-induced endotoxic shock, as demonstrated by less severe disease in lung, kidney, and liver and reduced hypothermia, although most of the effects were more pronounced in homozygotes. This protection was afforded through a marked reduction in the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lungs, spleens, and plasma, as well as through suppression of DC activation by IL-37b, and was, at least in part, mediated by Smad3. These data provide evidence that IL-37 plays a major role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intriguingly, these findings resemble a report which asserted an essential role for TGF-Î² and Smad3 in the protection from excessive inflammation following an endotoxin challenge<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. In that study, TGF-Î²<sub>1</sub><sup>-/-</sup> and Smad3<sup>-/-</sup> mice featured higher expression of IL-1Î², TNF, and iNOS in liver, lung, and heart tissue, as well as increased NF-ÎºB activation and higher NO plasma levels, ultimately resulting in hyperresponsiveness to LPS. The similarities between these data and our results indicate that the IL-37-Smad3 complex is relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p id="P32">To assess whether the protective functions of IL-37 extend beyond LPS in a whole animal model as they did <italic>in vitro</italic>, we stimulated whole blood from IL-37tg and control mice with IL-1Î², TNF, IL-12 plus IL-18, and IL-12 plus LPS. We found that the pro-inflammatory effect of each of the stimuli was markedly suppressed by IL-37b. Together with the Smad3-associated mechanism of action, these findings are consistent with the inhibition of DC function conferred by IL-37b. DCs receive, integrate, and pass on signals from and to a wide variety of cells and thus constitute part of the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. It is likely that by reducing surface expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 (B7-2) and MHC II (a major activator of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells) on DCs along with propagating an anti-inflammatory cytokine environment, IL-37 attenuates T-cell responses. The suppression of DC activation <italic>in vivo</italic> is also concordant with the IL-37-mediated inhibition of M-CSF and GM-CSF and the reduction of RAW cell differentiation and activation.</p>
      <p id="P33">We conclude that endogenous IL-37 suppresses immune responses by shifting the cytokine equilibrium away from excessive inflammation. This is achieved at least in part by inhibition of DC activation on the cellular level and by interaction with Smad3 and modulation of kinase-checkpoints on the molecular level. The protective activity of IL-37 can be observed <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> and affects a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory insults such as TLR ligands, IL-1Î², TNF, and IL-12 plus IL-18, placing this cytokine as a new member in the portfolio of classical anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-Î².</p>

        <p id="P45">Cells were analyzed using an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Immunocytometry Systems). Between 0.5 and 1 million events were collected. Electronic compensation was performed with antibody capture beads (BD Biosciences) stained separately with individual antibodies used in the test samples. To ensure the accuracy and precision of the measurements taken from day to day quality control was performed on the LSR-II daily using the Cytometer Setup &amp; Tracking (CS&amp;T) feature within BD FACSDiva software. CS&amp;T beads (BD Biosciences) were used to determine voltage, laser delays and area scaling and to track these settings over time. A manual quality control (QC) using rainbow beads was also performed daily to verify the laser delay and area scaling determined by CS&amp;T. The data files were analyzed using the FlowJo Software (Treestar). Splenocytes were gated by their forward and side scatter profile. CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells were selected and expression of CD86 and MHC class II was analyzed using a bivariate dot plot with biexponential scaling. Quadrant gates were set using cells stained with isotype controls and the percentage of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells expressing both CD86 and MHC class II was determined.</p>

        <p id="P46">To achieve a complete inhalation, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and observed closely. Immediately after cessation of breathing activity, mice were removed from the isoflurane environment, and the concentrated siRNA (10-15 Î¼l), was pipetted onto the nostrils. LPS was inhaled similarly 20 h later. Anti-Smad3 siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) contained equal parts of the following four target sequences: I, cca ugg agc ucu gug agu u; II, gca uug uac ccc auu guu a; III, ggg uca acc aug aag aug u; IV, gug gga acu uca aau gga a.</p>

Identical samples were loaded on one gel, which was blotted. The membrane was then cut into two halves. One half was incubated with the depleted IL-36 antibody, the other half was incubated with the vehicle-treated antibody. Both blots were developed simultaneously.</p>

Loading variability between separate membranes was controlled for by densitometry of the positive control spots, followed by normalization of the density of each cytokine to the mean density of these positive control spots. Total protein was also measured and differences in cell death were excluded by LDH measurements (data not shown).</p>
