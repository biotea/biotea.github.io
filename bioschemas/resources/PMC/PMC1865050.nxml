      <abstract>
        <p>In this study, we demonstrate that receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) in an agonist-dependent manner. The interaction is specific for ERÎ± as ERÎ² and several other nuclear receptors tested did not interact with RAP80. Interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ± was supported by mammalian two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The hinge/ligand-binding domain of ERÎ± is sufficient for interaction with RAP80. RAP80 overexpression reduces ERÎ± polyubiquitination, increases the level of ERÎ± protein, and enhances ERÎ±-mediated transactivation. Knockdown of endogenous RAP80 expression by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced ERÎ± protein level and the E2-dependent induction of pS2. In this study, we also demonstrate that RAP80 contains two functional ubiquitin-interaction motifs (UIMs) that are able to bind ubiquitin and to direct monoubiquitination of RAP80. Deletion of these UIMs does not affect the ability of RAP80 to interact with ERÎ±, but eliminates the effects of RAP80 on ERÎ± polyubiquitination, the level of ERÎ± protein, and ERÎ±-mediated transcription. These data indicate that the UIMs in RAP80 are critical for the function of RAP80. Our study identifies ERÎ± as a new RAP80-interacting protein and suggests that RAP80 may be an important modulator of ERÎ± activity.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Estrogens are important for a number of physiological processes that include various reproductive functions and bone metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1â3</xref>). The biological actions of estrogens are primarily mediated by two high-affinity nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor Î± and Î² (ERÎ± and ERÎ²) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the classical model of nuclear receptor action, ER binding of estrogen releases the receptor from inactive complexes containing heat-shock proteins and immunophilins, followed by dimerization, and binding of ER homodimers to estrogen-response elements (EREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes. Agonist binding induces a conformational change including a repositioning of helix 12 which represents the ligand-inducible activation function AF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">3â7</xref>). This allows recruitment of co-activator complexes that cause decompactation of chromatin through their histone acetylase activity and transcriptional activation of target genes. In addition to co-activators, a large number of other proteins that interact with ERÎ± and modify its transcriptional activity have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8â12</xref>). Moreover, various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation and ubiquitination, have been reported to modulate ERÎ± activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13â16</xref>). Polyubiquitination and degradation of ERÎ± and other nuclear receptors by the ubiquitinâproteasome system is important for regulating nuclear receptor levels and their transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">16â21</xref>). Several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, such as PSMC5 (SUG/TRIP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), RSP5/RPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), UBCH7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), have been reported to interact with a number of nuclear receptors, including ERÎ±. Recently, sumoylation has been identified as another mechanism that regulates the transcriptional activity of ERÎ± and was shown to involve UBC9, PIAS1 and PIAS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, our knowledge about the mechanisms by which ubiquitination and sumoylation regulate nuclear receptor level and activity is still far from complete.</p>
      <p>We recently described the identification of a novel protein, referred to as receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) or ubiquitin interaction motif containing 1 (UIMC1) as approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). RAP80 is an acidic nuclear protein of 719 amino acids that contains two Cys-X<sub>2</sub>-Cys-X<sub>11</sub>-His-X<sub>3</sub>-Cys zinc finger-like motifs near the carboxyl terminus. RAP80 is expressed in many tissues, most abundantly in testis. RAP80 was shown to interact with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR), also known as germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) or NR6A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29">26â29</xref>). The objective of the current study was to determine the potential role of RAP80 in modulating the activity of other nuclear receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that RAP80 interacted with ERÎ±, but not with ERÎ² or several other nuclear receptors. This interaction required the presence of an agonist, such as estrogen, while antagonists did not induce the interaction. RAP80 was found to contain two putative ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>) at its amino terminus. UIMs consist of a short-sequence motif of about 20 residues reported to direct (multi)monoubiquitination of proteins that contain this motif. In addition, UIMs have been shown to bind ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30â33</xref>). UIMs were first identified in the S5a subunit of the 19S proteasome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). UIMs have subsequently been found in a variety of proteins with roles in endocytosis, DNA repair, (de)ubiquitination, replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In this study, we show that the UIMs in RAP80 promote monoubiquitination and are able to bind ubiquitin and, therefore, are functional UIM sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate that RAP80 reduces the polyubiquitination of ERÎ± and increases the level of ERÎ± protein and ERÎ±-mediated transcription. The UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is essential for these effects of RAP80 on ERÎ±. Our study identifies RAP80 as a UIM-containing and ERÎ±-interacting protein and provides evidence for a role of RAP80 as a modulator of ERÎ±-dependent transcriptional activation.</p>

        <p>The yeast and mammalian two-hybrid vectors pGBKT7, pGBT9, pGADT7, pM, pVP16, and the retroviral vector pLXIN were purchased from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). The reporter plasmid pFR-Luc, containing 5 copies of the GAL4 upstream-activating sequence (UAS), referred to as (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Luc, was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1(â)Myc-His were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and pCMVâ3ÃFLAG-7.1 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). PhRLâSV40 encoding the Renilla luciferase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). To create pGADT7âRAP80ÎN135, the region encoding aa 135 to the carboxyl terminus, was amplified by PCR and the amplified product was inserted into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pGADT7. RAP80ÎN129 and full-length ERÎ± were inserted in-frame into <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pM and pVP16, respectively, for use in mammalian two-hybrid assays. The EREâCAT reporter, in which the CAT reporter is under the control of the natural ERE from the VitA2 promoter, was a gift from Dr Christina Teng (NIEHS). The ERÎ± expression vector pERÎ± and the (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-Luc reporter were kindly provided by Dr Donald McDonnell (Duke University). The pcDNA3.1âRAP80 was generated by inserting full-length RAP80 into the expression vector pcDNA3.1. pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 was constructed by inserting 3ÃFLAGâRAP80 into the vector pLXIN. pcDNA3.1âERÎ±âMyc-His plasmids containing either full-length ERÎ±, ERÎ±ÎN180, ERÎ±ÎN248 or ERÎ±ÎC248 were generated by inserting the corresponding coding regions, obtained by PCR amplification, into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pcDNA3.1(â)Myc-His. The pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 mutants K90R, K112R and K90,112R were generated using a Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 mutants ÎUIM1, ÎUIM2 and ÎUIM1,2, in which the regions encoding the UIM1, UIM2 or both were deleted, were generated by PCR amplification. The regions up- and down-stream from the UIMs were first amplified by PCR, then ligated at the introduced <italic>Xho</italic>I sites, and subsequently inserted into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pLXINâ3ÃFLAG. The pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 deletion mutants, encoding the regions between aa 1-582, 1-524, 1-504, 1-404, 1-304, 1-204,1-122 and 1-78 were generated by PCR amplification and then inserted into the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pLXINâ3ÃFLAG. The pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80ÎC122 mutants A88S, A113S and A88,113S were generated with a Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit. PEGFPâUIM1,2 was constructed by inserting the UIMs of RAP80 into <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI sites of pEGFP-C1. pGEXâUIM1,2 was constructed by inserting the UIMs of RAP80 into <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI sites of pGEXâ5x-3. pCMVâHAâUb, encoding HAâubiquitin, and pcDNA3âHAâNedd8 were gifts from Dr Yue Xiong (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC).</p>

Synthesis of GST or GST fusion protein was then induced by the addition of isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.5âmM final concentration) at 37Â°C. After 4âh of incubation, cells were collected, resuspended in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) and processed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cellular extracts were then centrifuged at 15â000 Ã <italic>g</italic>, and the supernatants containing the soluble GST proteins were collected. Equal amounts of GSTâRAP80ÎN110 protein or GST protein were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine-labeled ERÎ± and its deletion mutants were generated using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). The GST- and GSTâRAP80ÎN110-bound beads were then incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine-labeled ERÎ± in 0.5âml binding buffer (20âmM Tris-HCl, pHâ7.6, 100âmM KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1âmM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1âmM PMSF) in the presence or absence of 1âÂµM E2. After 1âh incubation at room temperature, beads were washed five times in binding buffer and boiled in 15âÂµl 2ÃâSDS-PAGE loading buffer. Solubilized proteins were separated by 4â12% SDS-PAGE and the radiolabeled proteins visualized by autoradiography. To analyze ubiquitin binding, 500âng of a mixture of polyubiquitin chains (Ub2-7) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were incubated with purified GST or GSTâUIM<sup>RAP80</sup> protein. GST protein complexes were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and examined by western blot analysis with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Covance).</p>

After an additional 24âh incubation, cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and the level of luciferase or CAT protein measured using the Dual-LuciferaseÂ® Reporter Assay System (Promega) or CAT-ELISA kit (Roche). All analyses were performed in triplicate.</p>

        <title>Identification of ERÎ± as a new RAP80-interacting protein</title>
        <p>Earlier, we demonstrated that the nuclear protein RAP80 interacts with and modulates the activity of the nuclear orphan receptor RTR/GCNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To determine whether RAP80 was able to interact with other nuclear receptors, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis using RAP80 as prey and several full-length nuclear receptors or their ligand-binding domains as bait. The yeast strain AH109(MATa) was transformed with pGBT9 plasmids encoding various nuclear receptors and then mated with Y187(MATÎ±) containing pGADT7âRAP80ÎN110. The potential interactions between RAP80 and nuclear receptors were analyzed in the presence or absence of corresponding ligand. This analysis identified ERÎ± as a new RAP80-binding partner and demonstrated that this interaction required the presence of the ERÎ± agonist 17Î²-estradiol (E2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In the presence of E2, RAP80 was able to interact with both full-length ERÎ± and the ligand binding domain of (ERÎ±(LBD)) suggesting that the amino terminus, including the DNA-binding domain (DBD), is not an absolute requirement for the interaction. RAP80 did not show any substantial interaction with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), androgen receptor (AR), liver X receptor Î± (LXRÎ±), retinoid X receptor Î± (RXRÎ±), peroxisome proliferator receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³), or retinoic acid receptor Î³ (RARÎ³) either in the presence or absence of corresponding ligand. The RORÎ³ receptor, which appears to be constitutively active, also did not interact with RAP80.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>RAP80 interacts selectively with ERÎ±. The interaction of RAP80 with different nuclear receptors was analyzed by yeast two-hybrid analysis as described in Materials and Methods. RAP80 was used as bait and several full-length (FL) nuclear receptors or their LBD were used as prey. <bold>(A)</bold> The interaction of RAP80 with different nuclear receptors was analyzed in the presence (+) or absence (â) of corresponding agonist. The following agonists were used: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (100ânM) for VDR; dihydrotestosterone (100ânM) for AR; T0901317 (1âÂµM) for LXRÎ±; GW845 (100ânM) for PPARÎ³; 17Î²-estradiol (100ânM) for ERÎ±(FL) and ERÎ±(LBD); the RXR-panagonist SR11217 (1âÂµM); retinoic acid (1âÂµM) for RARÎ³. <bold>(B)</bold> Interaction of ERÎ±(FL) and ERÎ²(FL) with RAP80 as a function of the estradiol concentration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1112f1"/></fig></p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, the interaction of RAP80 with full-length ERÎ± was dependent on the concentration of E2. A concentration as low as 0.2 nM E2 was able to induce the interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ±. The EC<sub>50</sub> was calculated to be 1.9 nM E2. RAP80 did not interact with full-length ERÎ² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) or ERÎ²(LBD) (not shown) either in the presence or absence of E2. These observations indicate that the interaction of RAP80 with nuclear receptors is highly selective for ERÎ± and is ligand dependent.</p>

        <title>Mammalian two-hybrid analysis</title>
        <p>The interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± was confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid analysis. CHO cells were co-transfected with (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Luc reporter, pMâRAP80 and increasing amounts of pVP16âERÎ± plasmid DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, expression of GAL4(DBD)âRAP80 alone did not enhance transcriptional activation of the (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Luc reporter. Co-expression of GAL4(DBD)âRAP80 with pVP16âERÎ± only slightly increased reporter activity, while addition of E2 greatly induced this reporter activity. Co-transfection with the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1âRAP80 totally abrogated this induction due to competition of RAP80 with GAL4(DBD)âRAP80ÎN129 for ERÎ± binding. These observations support our conclusion that RAP80 interacts with ERÎ± in an E2-dependent manner.
<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Analysis of the interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ± by mammalian two-hybrid analysis. <bold>(A)</bold> CHO cells were co-transfected with (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Luc reporter, pMâRAP80, increasing amounts of pVP16âERÎ± and pcDNA3.1âRAP80 as indicated. Sixteen hours later cells were treated with 100 nM E2 or vehicle. Cells were assayed for reporter activity 24âh after the addition of E2. The relative Luc activity was calculated and plotted. <bold>(B)</bold> Agonists but not antagonists induce interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ±. CHO cells were co-transfected with pMâRAP80ÎN130, pVP16âERÎ± and pS5âCAT reporter. Cells were treated with different agonists or antagonists (1âÂµM) as indicated. Cells were assayed for the reporter activity 24âh after transfection.

        <p>We next compared the effect of several ER agonists and antagonists on the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ±. CHO cells were co-transfected with pMâRAP80ÎN129, pVP16âERÎ±, and the pS5âCAT reporter plasmid containing five tandem GAL4-binding elements. Sixteen hours later cells were treated with various (ant)agonists. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, all agonists tested, E2, estriol (E3) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), induced the interaction of ERÎ± with RAP80. The weak agonist ZZ-dienestrol also induced the interaction; however, treatment with the antagonists tamoxifen (Tam) and ICI 182,780 (ICI) did not promote the interaction between ERÎ± and RAP80. These results indicate that the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± is dependent on the presence of an ERÎ± agonist. Thus, only RAP80 interacts with a transcriptionally active form of ERÎ±.</p>

        <title>Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analysis</title>
        <p>To investigate this interaction further, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis. HeLa cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1âERÎ±âMyc-His and pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 expression plasmids, treated with 100ânM E2 or ethanol (vehicle) before cells were harvested and cell lysates prepared. Part of the cell lysates was used directly for western blot analysis while the remaining was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin to isolate FLAGâRAP80 protein complexes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, ERÎ± was immunoprecipitated with FLAGâRAP80 only when E2 was present. These observations are in agreement with the conclusion that RAP80 and ERÎ± interact with each other in an agonist-dependent manner.

After 24âh, cell lysates were prepared and FLAGâRAP80 protein complexes were isolated using anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity resin.

MCF-7 cells were grown in phenol-red-free medium with 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 2 days and subsequently treated with or without 100 nM E2 or 1âÎ¼M ICI 182,780. After 3âh incubation, cells were collected and nuclear lysates prepared.

The immunoprecipitated ERÎ± protein complexes were then examined by western analysis with anti-RAP80 and anti-ERÎ± antibodies. <bold>(D)</bold> GST pull-down assay. GST and GSTâRAP80Î110 fusion protein were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and then incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine radiolabeled ERÎ± in the presence or absence of 1âÎ¼M E2.

        <p>We next examined whether E2 was able to induce the interaction between endogenous ERÎ± and RAP80. MCF-7 cells were treated with or without E2 or ICI 182,780 for 3âh before nuclear lysates were prepared. RAP80 protein complexes were then immunoprecipitated using an anti-RAP80 antibody and the immunoprecipitated RAP80 protein complexes were examined by western blot analysis with an anti-ERÎ± antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B shows that endogenous ERÎ± and RAP80 interact with each other. ERÎ± was found in complex with RAP80 only in the presence of E2. The association between ERÎ± and RAP80 was confirmed by analysis of ERÎ± protein complexes immunoprecipitated with an anti-ERÎ± antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C).</p>
        <p>We next examined the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± by <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down analysis using purified GSTâRAP80ÎN110 fusion protein and [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled full-length ERÎ±. This analysis showed little interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ± in the absence of E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D); however, significant binding of ERÎ± to RAP80 was observed in the presence of E2. GST alone did not bind ERÎ± either in the presence or absence of E2. To examine which region of ERÎ± was required for this interaction with RAP80, GST pull-down analysis was performed with three ERÎ± deletion mutants, ERÎ±ÎN248, ERÎ±ÎN180 and ERÎ±ÎC248. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, in the presence of E2, RAP80 was able to bind ERÎ±ÎN180 and ERÎ±ÎN248, but not ERÎ±ÎC248. These results demonstrate that the amino terminus of ERÎ± is unable to bind RAP80 and that the LBD of ERÎ± is required and sufficient for interaction with RAP80. In addition, these observations suggest that RAP80 physically interacts with ERÎ±.</p>

        <title>Effect of various deletions in RAP80 on its interaction with ERÎ±</title>
        <p>RAP80 contains two putative zinc finger-like motifs at its carboxyl terminus, between aa 505 and 582. To determine which region of RAP80 was important for its interaction with ERÎ±, we constructed a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) and examined their ability to interact with ERÎ± by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The results demonstrated that carboxyl-terminal deletions up to aa 504 had little effect on the ability of RAP80 to bind ERÎ±, while RAP80ÎC404 was still able to co-immunoprecipitate ERÎ± but less efficiently. In contrast, RAP80ÎC304 and likewise the more severe deletion mutants RAP80ÎC204 and RAP80ÎC122 were unable to interact with ERÎ±. These observations indicate that the region of RAP80 between aa 304 and 404 is critical for the interaction with ERÎ± and that the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger-like motifs are not required. Although several amino-terminal deletions of RAP80 were constructed, none of amino-truncated proteins were expressed in cells. This might be due to improper folding of these mutants and their rapid degradation by the proteasome system.

        <title>Effect of RAP80 on ERÎ±-mediated transcriptional activation</title>
        <p>To examine the functional significance of the RAP80âERÎ± interaction, we determined whether RAP80 had any effect on the transcriptional activity of endogenous ERÎ±. MCFâ7 cells were co-transfected with an (ERE)<sub>3</sub>-Luc reporter and different amounts of RAP80 expression vector, and then treated with or without E2. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, RAP80 increased E2-induced transcriptional activation by endogenous ERÎ±. In contrast to full-length RAP80, the deletion mutant RAP80ÎC204, which does not interact with ERÎ±, had no effect on ERÎ± transcriptional activity. An increase in ERÎ±-mediated transactivation was also observed in CHO cells transfected with an EREâCAT reporter plasmid, and ERÎ± and/or RAP80 expression plasmids (Figure S1A). E2 induced reporter activity in cells transfected with the ERÎ± expression vector, this activation was further increased by 3-fold in cells co-transfected with the RAP80 expression vector. To determine whether this increase was specific for ERÎ±-mediated transactivation or whether RAP80 affected the general transcriptional machinery, the effect of RAP80 on RORE-dependent transcriptional activation by RORÎ³, a nuclear receptor that does not interact with RAP80, was examined. Figure S1B shows that RAP80 had no effect on RORÎ³-mediated transactivation.

        <title>RAP80 expression affects ERÎ± protein levels</title>
        <p>To examine whether RAP80 had any effect on the level of ERÎ± protein, HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vector pERÎ± in the presence or absence of pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, the level of ERÎ± protein was very low in HeLa cells transfected with pERÎ± only. In cells co-expressing RAP80 and ERÎ±, the level of total ERÎ± protein was greatly enhanced but only in cells treated with E2. Similar results were obtained with ERÎ± protein co-immunoprecipitated by FLAGâRAP80. These observations suggest that expression of RAP80 enhances the level of ERÎ± protein and that this increase is dependent on the presence of an agonist. This enhancement in ERÎ± protein was not due to an increase in the levels of ERÎ± mRNA by RAP80 since levels of ERÎ± mRNA were very similar between MCF-7 and MCF-7âRAP80 (Figure S2).
<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>RAP80 expression increases the level of ERÎ± protein. <bold>(A)</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with 2âÎ¼g pERÎ± and 1âÎ¼g pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 plasmid DNA.

As reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), treatment with E2 reduced ERÎ± levels (compare lanes 1 and 2), this reduction was more pronounced in cells in which RAP80 was down-regulated (compare lanes 2 and 4). Little difference in ERÎ± levels was observed between untreated cells (lanes 1 and 3). These data are in agreement with our conclusion that RAP80 enhances the level of ERÎ± protein. To analyze the effect of RAP80 knockdown on the transcriptional activity of ERÎ±, we examined its effect on the induction of the ERÎ± target gene pS2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, the induction of pS2 protein was significantly less in cells in which RAP80 expression was reduced in agreement with our observations that increased RAP80 expression enhances ERÎ± activity.</p>

        <title>RAP80 contains two functional ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs)</title>
        <p>A more extensive analysis of the RAP80 sequence showed that, in addition to the two zinc finger motifs, RAP80 contained two putative ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) at its amino terminus of RAP80 between aa 79-96 and 104-121, respectively. These UIMs (UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>) exhibit high homology with the consensus UIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). UIMs have been reported to bind ubiquitin and to direct (multi)monoubiquitination of proteins that contain them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Before investigating the role of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> in the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ±, we examined whether these putative UIMs were functional by determining their ability to bind ubiquitin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B (lane 2), UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was able to bind Ub2-7. To determine whether UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> could direct monoubiquitination of proteins that contain this sequence, we analyzed the level of ubiquitination of EGFP and a EGFPâUIM<sup>RAP80</sup> chimeric fusion protein in HeLa cells transfected with or without pCMVâHAâUb, encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C, EGFPâUIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was ubiquitinated in HeLa cells only when HAâUb was co-expressed. EGFP was not ubiquitinated either in the presence or absence of HAâUb expression. These observations suggest that UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is able to direct ubiquitination and, therefore, behaves as a functional UIM.

        <title>Role of UIMs on RAP80 ubiquitination</title>
        <p>UIM-containing proteins have been reported to become (multi)monoubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). To determine whether RAP80 was subject to ubiquitination, we examined the ubiquitination of RAP80 in HEK293 cells treated with and without the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Two major ubiquitinated RAP80 proteins migrating at about 120 and 135âkD and referred to as UbâRAP80 and (Ub)<sub>2</sub>âRAP80, were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Previous studies have shown that treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 results in an accumulation of cellular polyubiquitinated proteins that are otherwise rapidly degraded by the proteasome system, whereas MG132 has little effect on monoubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Our data show that MG132 treatment had little effect on RAP80 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) suggesting that RAP80 itself is not polyubiquitinated to a great extent or rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Therefore, the two ubiquitinated RAP80 proteins likely represent RAP80 conjugated to one or two monoubiquitins. The effect of Nedd8, a ubiquitin homolog, was analyzed to further examine the specificity of the ubiquitination of RAP80. These data showed that RAP80 was not neddylated (not shown).

        <p>The UIMs in RAP80 contain two lysine residues (K<sup>90</sup> and K<sup>112</sup>) that are potential ubiquitination sites. To determine whether these sites are important for the multi-ubiquitination of RAP80, the effect of point mutations in these residues on RAP80 multi-ubiquitination was examined. None of the lysine mutants, K<sup>90</sup>R, K<sup>112</sup>R, or the double mutant K<sup>90,112</sup>R, affected the degree of ubiquitination of RAP80 suggesting that K<sup>90</sup> and K<sup>112</sup> are not substrates of monoubiquitination (Figure S3). Further evidence for the role of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> in the monoubiquitination of RAP80 came from experiments analyzing the ubiquitination of the amino terminus of RAP80. RAP80ÎC122, containing the amino terminus including UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>, was ubiquitinated whereas RAP80ÎC78, lacking the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>, was not suggesting that the UIM is required for RAP80 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). In the absence of exogenous HAâubiquitin, the anti-FLAG antibody recognized several bands likely representing multi-ubiquitinated RAP80ÎC122 conjugated with endogenous ubiquitin. No such bands were observed with RAP80ÎC78.</p>
        <p>A88 and A113 are highly conserved among UIMs of different proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), and have been reported to be important for UIM function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). We, therefore, examined the effect of the A88S, A113S and the A88,113S double mutation on the ubiquitination of RAP80ÎC122. Our data showed that the single mutations diminished RAP80 multiubiquitination, while the double mutant A88,113S caused a more pronounced decrease in ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). The results are in agreement with the conclusion that UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is required for the multi-monoubiquitination of the amino terminus of RAP80.</p>

        <title>The UIMs of RAP80 are critical for its effects on ERÎ±</title>
        <p>Next, we investigated the importance of the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> on the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ±. First, we examined whether deletion of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> had any effect on the subcellular localization of RAP80. Full-length FLAGâRAP80 or FLAGâRAP80ÎUIM1,2 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells and their subcellular localization examined by confocal microscopy. Figure S4 shows that both FLAGâRAP80 and RAP80ÎUIM1,2 were localized to the nucleus.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the UIMs play a role in the interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ±, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1âERÎ±âMyc-His and pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 expression plasmids encoding either full-length RAP80 or several UIM deletion mutants of RAP80. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that deletion of a single UIM or both UIMs did not abrogate the interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ± (Figure S5).</p>
        <p>To determine whether UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was required for the observed increase in the level of ERÎ± protein by RAP80, the effects of RAP80 and RAP80UIM1,2 on the level of ERÎ± protein were compared. HeLa cells expressing pERÎ± only contained low levels of ERÎ± protein. RAP80 significantly enhanced ERÎ± levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A), whereas RAP80UIM1,2 only slightly increased the level of ERÎ± protein. Expression of HAâUb caused a further increase in the level of ERÎ± protein. These data suggest that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is required for the increase in ERÎ± protein level induced by RAP80.

RAP80 expression was also detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (lower panels).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1112f9"/></fig></p>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that ERÎ± is degraded by the ubiquitinâproteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Since UIMs have been implicated in ubiquitin binding and in the modulation of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), this raised the question of whether RAP80 affected ERÎ± ubiquitination. To examine this, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1âERÎ±âMyc-His, pCMVâHAâubiquitin and pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 or pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80ÎUIM1,2. Cells were treated with MG132 for 4âh before protein extracts were prepared and protein complexes immunoprecipitated with an anti-ERÎ± antibody. The protein complexes were subsequently examined by western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody to detect ERÎ± ubiquitination. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the presence of E2 enhanced polyubiquitination of ERÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Expression of RAP80 strongly inhibited ERÎ± polyubiquitination whereas RAP80ÎUIM1,2 had little effect. These results suggest that the observed increase in the level of ERÎ± protein induced by RAP80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) may involve reduced polyubiquitination and degradation of ERÎ±. Reduced ERÎ± protein levels were not observed in the experiment described in Figure 10C and may be due to the high expression of ERÎ± induced by pcDNA3.1âERÎ±âMyc-His. RAP80 did not affect ERÎ± ubiquitination in the absence of E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B) or in the presence of tamoxifen (data not shown). The latter is in agreement with the demonstration that interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± is dependent on the presence of an agonist.</p>
        <p>We next examined whether UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was required for the modulation of ERÎ±-mediated transcriptional activation by RAP80. MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with an ERE-Luc reporter plasmid and different amounts of pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80 or pLXINâ3ÃFLAGâRAP80ÎUIM1,2. In the absence of E2, both RAP80 and RAP80ÎUIM1,2 had little effect on Luc reporter activity. Addition of E2 induced ERE-mediated transcriptional activation by endogenous ERÎ±; this activation was enhanced by increased expression of RAP80. In contrast, expression of the RAP80ÎUIM1,2 mutant did not augment ERÎ±-mediated activation of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). These results indicate that UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is critical for the modulation of ERÎ± activity by RAP80.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we identify ERÎ± as a new RAP80-interacting protein. The interaction of RAP80 with nuclear receptors is very selective since a number of receptors, including ERÎ², PPARÎ³, RORÎ³ and ERRÎ± were unable to interact with RAP80 either in the presence or absence of their corresponding ligand. The interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± is dependent on the presence of an ERÎ± agonist, as E2 and E3, promoted this interaction whereas the antagonists ICI 182,780 and tamoxifen did not. Previous studies have shown that binding of an agonist to the ligand-binding pocket of ERÎ± induces a conformational change in the receptor. This involves a repositioning of helix 12 that allows recruitment of co-activators that subsequently mediate the transcriptional activation of ERÎ± target genes by ERÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Binding of an antagonist induces a conformational change that results in the recruitment of co-repressors rather than co-activators. The dependency of the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± on agonist binding indicates that RAP80 interacts with the transcriptionally active conformation of ERÎ±.</p>
      <p>The interaction between RAP80 and ERÎ± was confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation. <italic>In vitro</italic> pull-down analysis with GSTâRAP80 protein demonstrated that RAP80 interacted with full-length ERÎ±, ERÎ±ÎN180 (containing the DBD, hinge domain and LBD), and with ERÎ±ÎN248 (containing the hinge and LBD), but did not interact with ERÎ±ÎC248 (containing the amino terminus, including the DBD). These observations suggest that RAP80 and ERÎ± physically interact with each other and indicate that the amino terminus and DBD of ERÎ± are not an absolute necessity for this interaction. The requirement of the LBD of ERÎ± is in agreement with our observation that the interaction is ligand dependent. Thus, ligand-induced changes could unmask binding motifs in ERÎ± required for its interaction with RAP80.</p>
      <p>To determine which domain in RAP80 is required for its interaction with ERÎ±, the effect of various mutations in RAP80 on this interaction was examined. Analysis of a series of carboxyl-terminal deletions showed that the zinc finger motifs are not required for the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ±, but that the region between aa 304 and 404 is essential. A number of transcriptional mediators have been reported to interact with the LBD of agonist-bound ERÎ± through a sequence containing an LXXLL consensus motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43">41â43</xref>). RAP80 contains two related sequences <sup>296</sup>ILCQL and <sup>625</sup>LLSFL. However, deletion of <sup>625</sup>LLSFL or mutation of <sup>296</sup>ILCQL into <sup>296</sup>ISCQL did not affect the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± (not shown) suggesting that the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ± involves a different sequence.</p>
      <p>In addition to the two zinc finger motifs, we identified two putative UIMs at the amino terminus of RAP80 that exhibit high homology to the consensus UIM eeexÎ¦xxAxxxSxxexxxx (in which Î¦ is a hydrophobic residue, e is a negatively charged residue and x is any amino acid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Several studies have shown that UIMs often mediate the monoubiquitination of proteins that contain these sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In addition, UIMs have been reported to bind ubiquitin and as such mediate intra- or intermolecular interactions by interacting with ubiquitinated target proteins or proteins containing a ubiquitin-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Analysis of the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> demonstrated that RAP80 was able to bind polyubiquitin chains of different lengths and to varying degrees. In addition, UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was able to promote the monoubiquitination of a chimeric EGFPâUIM<sup>RAP80</sup> protein and the amino terminus of RAP80 while no ubiquitination was observed when the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was deleted. In addition, point mutations in A88 and A113, alanines that are highly conserved among UIMs, greatly diminish ubiquitination of RAP80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Although the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> contains two lysines, mutations of these lysines had little effect on RAP80 ubiquitination suggesting that they are not substrates for monoubiquitination. This is in agreement with reports indicating that lysines within UIMs are generally not monoubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Based on the calculated size of ubiquitinated RAP80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A), it was concluded that several lysines may become monoubiquitinated. These observations support the conclusion that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> domain in RAP80 is functional and able to guide monoubiquitination of RAP80 and, in addition, is able to bind ubiquitin. We propose that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> domain mediates a signal that is critical to the function of RAP80.</p>
      <p>Although the mechanisms of protein polyubiquitination and their role in targeting proteins to proteasomes for degradation has been intensively studied, the role of (multi)monoubiquitination is not as well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Monoubiquitination functions as a signal that affects the structure, activity or localization of the target protein, thereby regulating a broad range of cellular functions, including membrane protein trafficking, histone function, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and replication. UIMs are required for the (multi)monoubiquitination of several proteins, such as epsin, Eps15, and Eps15R, involved in receptor endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). These proteins play a critical role in the recruitment of plasma membrane receptor proteins to clathrin-coated pits and their internalization. Deletion or mutation in these UIMs greatly impacts the internalization of membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). A recent study provided evidence for an intramolecular interaction between monoubiquitin and the UIM in Eps15 and Hrs that prevents them to interact with ubiquitinated membrane receptors, thereby affecting their trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Since RAP80 is a nuclear protein, it is likely not involved in membrane receptor endocytosis. Monoubiquitination has been reported to be involved in the regulation of several nuclear functions. For example, monoubiquitination of histones does not target them for degradation but has a role in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Monoubiquitination is also critical in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). For example, the subunit S5a (Rpn10) of the 19S proteosomal regulatory complex contains two UIMs that interact with the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of RAD23B (HR23B), a protein that targets several proteins to the proteasome, including the excision repair factor XPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p>
      <p>Monoubiquitination can also affect the localization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). However, deletion of the UIMs in RAP80 does not affect its nuclear localization. In addition, our data show that the UIMs are not required for the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ±, but are critical to the effects of RAP80 on ERÎ± function. Since several UIM-containing proteins have been reported to be involved in ubiquitination or ubiquitin metabolism, we examined whether RAP80 had any effect on the ubiquitination of ERÎ±. Our results demonstrate that increased expression of RAP80 decreases the ubiquitination of ERÎ±. Although the UIMs were not required for the interaction of RAP80 with ERÎ±, deletion of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> eliminates RAP80's capacity to inhibit ERÎ± ubiquitination suggesting that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is essential for the effect of RAP80 on ERÎ± ubiquitination. What the functions of ubiquitination of nuclear receptors are, is still controversial and not yet completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Ubiquitination of ERÎ± appears to have multiple functions and can affect ERÎ± protein levels and turnover and ERÎ±-mediated transcriptional regulation at different steps in the ERÎ± signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). One function of ERÎ± polyubiquitination is related to targeting misfolded, unliganded ERÎ± for degradation by the proteasome system. This involves binding of the Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) which, through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, ubiquitinates ERÎ± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Another role of ERÎ± ubiquitination relates to transcriptional regulation. Several studies have shown that in the presence of agonist, ERÎ± is rapidly degraded by the proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This turnover of ERÎ± appears to be important for efficient ERÎ±-dependent transcriptional activation. Such a coupling between protein degradation and transactivation might be an integral part of nuclear receptor function. However, overexpression of proteasome 26S subunit PSMC5 (SUG1) enhances the ubiquitination of ERÎ± in the presence of agonist and inhibited transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). In addition, Fan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) reported that inhibition of proteasome degradation by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 enhanced ERÎ±-mediated transcriptional activation. These studies suggest that there is a delicate balance between level of ERÎ± protein and transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>Our results show that expression of RAP80 enhances ERÎ±-mediated transcriptional activation possibly by causing an increase in ERÎ± protein levels. The latter may be related to the reduced ERÎ± ubiquitination and degradation. We show that the effects of RAP80 on ERÎ± were dependent on UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>, supporting our hypothesis that this domain is critical to the function of RAP80. The effects of RAP80 on ERÎ± are very similar to those recently reported for MUC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). MUC1 was shown to stabilize ERÎ± by inhibiting its ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The carboxyl-terminal subunit of MUC1 was shown to associate with ERÎ± complexes on estrogen-responsive promoters and to stimulate ERÎ±-mediated transcription. MUC1 mediates this action by directly binding to the DBD of ERÎ± in an agonist-dependent manner. These different findings indicate the complex role of ubiquitination in the regulation of ERÎ± function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, in this study we identify ERÎ± as a new RAP80-interacting protein and show that this interaction is dependent on ERÎ± agonist binding. We demonstrate that RAP80 is a UIM-containing protein with two functional UIMs that are able to bind ubiquitin and direct monoubiquitination. These UIMs are not required for its interaction with ERÎ± but appear necessary for the decrease in ERÎ± polyubiquitination and the increase in ERÎ±-mediated transcriptional activation induced by RAP80. Our observations show that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is critical for the function of RAP80 and suggests that RAP80 is an important modulator of ERÎ±.</p>
