        <p>Mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5) protein is a trithorax family histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase that regulates diverse biological processes, including cell cycle progression, hematopoiesis and cancer. The mechanisms by which MLL5 protein stability is regulated have remained unclear to date. Here, we showed that MLL5 protein stability is cooperatively regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7). Depletion of OGT in cells led to a decrease in the MLL5 protein level through ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolytic degradation, whereas ectopic expression of OGT protein suppressed MLL5 ubiquitylation. We further identified deubiquitinase USP7 as a novel MLL5-associated protein using mass spectrometry. USP7 stabilized the MLL5 protein through direct binding and deubiquitylation. Loss of USP7 induced degradation of MLL5 protein. Conversely, overexpression of USP7, but not a catalytically inactive USP7 mutant, led to decreased ubiquitylation and increased MLL5 stability. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunostaining assays revealed that MLL5, OGT and USP7 interact with each other to form a stable ternary complex that is predominantly located in the nucleus. In addition, upregulation of MLL5 expression was correlated with increased expression of OGT and USP7 in human primary cervical adenocarcinomas. Our results collectively reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying regulation of MLL5 protein stability and provide new insights into the functional interplay among O-GlcNAc transferase, deubiquitinase and histone methyltransferase.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>MLL5 protein, a trithorax group protein and histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, was originally identified in a segment of chromosome band 7q22 that is frequently deleted in human myeloid leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that MLL5 is an important regulator of the cell cycle progression, either knockdown or overexpression of the MLL5 protein in cells causes aberrant cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several studies using <italic>Mll5</italic>-deficient mice have strongly suggested a crucial role in both hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, MLL5 isoforms appear to be involved in human papillomavirus (HPV) viral E6 and E7 protein transcription in HPV16/18-associated cervical cancers and natural killer cell-mediated innate anti-tumor immunity [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent clinical research indicates that higher expression of MLL5 serves as a useful biomarker for predicting survival outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia after chemotherapy treatment [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent whole-exome sequencing study linked MLL5 to autism spectrum disorder, a serious neurodevelopmental disorder [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite its extensive physiological and pathological functions, the mechanisms regulating MLL5 protein stability remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is an important metabolic signaling mechanism that regulates post-translational modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by O-linked Î²-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The level of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a end product of the HBP pathway and the immediate donor substrate for O-GlcNAcylation, is modulated by the availability of glucose, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides. Therefore, O-GlcNAcylation is considered a nutrient sensor that regulates nearly all aspects of cellular metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the sole enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAcylation in mammalian cells, utilizes UDP-GlcNAc to catalyze addition of the O-GlcNAc group into hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine residues of target proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. So far, more than thousands of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins identified as O-GlcNAcylated by OGT [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] are implicated in many aspects of cellular processes, such as gene transcription and translation, nutrient sensing, neuronal function, cell cycle progression, lymphocyte activation, and stress response [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consistently, deletion of OGT in mice has led to early embryonic lethality and defective somatic and reproductive cell development [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Importantly, abnormal O-GlcNAcylation contibutes to the etiology of several human diseases, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, heart disease and certain cancers [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the reverse reaction to remove the O-GlcNAc modification from substrate proteins. Genetic disruption of OGA in mice has been shown to induce neonatal lethality with developmental delay and defects in metabolic homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, OGT and OGA appear to regulate highly dynamic and reversible cycling of O-GlcNAcylation in response to metabolic changes in cells.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation are important regulatory mechanisms for protein stability and function. Ubiquitylation levels of proteins are controlled <italic>via</italic> balance between E1, E2 and E3 ubiquitinating enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) belongs to the ubiquitin-specific protease family of deubiquitinating enzyme and plays a complex role in regulating the stability of tumor suppressor p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2 [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Later studies disclosed that USP7 is a critical regulator of the activities of proteins involved in DNA damage response, immune response, signal transduction, neuronal differentiation and epigenetic modulation [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the current study, we showed that OGT and USP7 interact with MLL5 protein to form a stable protein complex in the cell nucleus. OGT and USP7 maintain the stability of MLL5 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitylation and degradation. Absence of either OGT or USP7 triggers rapid degradation of MLL5 proteins <italic>via</italic> the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Notably, upregulation of MLL5 is correlated with increased expression of OGT and USP7 in human primary cervical adenocarcinomas. Our results collectively demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism of MLL5 protein stabilization, along with significant associations among cell metabolic sensors, protein deubiquitinase and histone methyltransferase.</p>

        <title>OGT interacts with and stabilizes MLL5 protein</title>
        <p>As a critical trithorax group histone methyltransnferase, MLL5 regulates a range of biological processes. However, the mechanisms regulating MLL5 protein stability remains to be clarified. OGT has been identified as a putative MLL5 binding partner[<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

        <p>Next, we used a lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach to deplete OGT in HeLa cells and examined effects on MLL5 protein. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0145023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>, two different shRNAs targeted to mRNA sequences located 1275 and 1412 bp downstream of the translation start site resulted in effective elimination of OGT. Consistently, global levels of O-GlcNAcylation were markedly decreased in OGT knockdown cells (<xref rid="pone.0145023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Knockdown of OGT led to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="pone.0145023.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A, S1C and S1D Fig</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Moreover, expression levels of Cyclin E and several CDKIs, including p27, p21, p16 and p19 were increased in OGT knockdown cells (<xref rid="pone.0145023.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, MLL5 protein levels were dramatically decreased in OGT knockdown cells (<xref rid="pone.0145023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), although mRNA levels remained unchanged (<xref rid="pone.0145023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Accordingly, we speculated that regulation of MLL5 protein occurs at the post-translational, but not the transcriptional level. To further investigate whether OGT regulates the stability of MLL5, control or OGT knockdown cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, for the indicated times. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0145023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, MLL5 protein levels were only slightly decreased after 9h of CHX treatment in control cells. In contrast, a significant decrease in the MLL5 protein level was observed in OGT knockdown cells treated with CHX, indicating that OGT regulates MLL5 stability by inhibiting its degradation. To further determine whether MLL5 protein is degaraded <italic>via</italic> the ubiquitin/proteasomal-mediated or the autophagy/lysosomal protein degradation pathway, control or OGT knockdown cells were treated with CHX plus the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, or the lysosome inhibitor, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, for the indicated times. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0145023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>, MG132, but not NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment restored the protein levels of MLL5 after CHX treatment in OGT knockdown cells, suggesting that OGT maintains the stability of MLL5 protein mainly through inhibiting proteasomal-mediated degradation.</p>

        <p>Since OGT catalyzes addition of the O-GlcNAc group to the hydroxyl groups of serine or threonine residues of target proteins, we examined whether the O-GlcNAc transferase activity of OGT is required for inhibiting MLL5 ubiquitylation. To this end, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged OGT H498A or H498A and H558A double mutants [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] lacking catalytic activity and HA-tagged MLL5 were transiently co-transfected with that for His-tagged ubiquitin into HEK293T cells, and His pulldown experiment performed with Ni-NTA beads, followed by western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0145023.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, in contrast to the wild-type OGT, overexpression of both OGT mutants caused only a slight decrease in the ubiquitylation of MLL5 protein, indicating that the O-GlcNAc transferase activity of OGT is required for preventing ubiquitylation of MLL5. In view of these finding, we propose that OGT enhances MLL5 protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitylation and degradation.</p>

Expression vectors encoding 3ÃFLAG-tagged MLL5 protein were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, and extracts prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by competitive elution using FLAG peptide and analysis by mass spectrometry analysis. Consequently, a number of putative MLL5-interacting proteins, including two deubiquitinases, USP7 and USP10 protein, were detected (<xref rid="pone.0145023.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Application of the co-immunoprecipitation assay to examine the interactions between the two deubiquitinases and MLL5 revealed that only USP7 interacts with MLL5 (<xref rid="pone.0145023.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> and data not shown), which was therefore subjected to further analysis.</p>

        <p>USP7, also designated HAUSP, contains N-terminal TRAF, intermediate CAT, and C-terminal UBL domains. The USP7 domain(s) responsible for interactions with MLL5 were investigated by using the co-immunoprecipitation assay. Truncated USP7 mutant lacking the TRAF domain abolished the capacity for MLL5 binding (<xref rid="pone.0145023.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that this region mediates interactions with MLL5 protein. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was additionally performed to map USP7-interacting domains within the MLL5 protein. All MLL5 truncation constructs were able to interact with USP7 protein, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0145023.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, indicating that multiple domains or motifs of MLL5 protein may contribute to USP7 binding.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Studies over recent years have greatly expanded our knowledge of epigenetic regulations mediated by MLL5 protein in gene transcription, cell cycle progression, hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis. Here, we showed that OGT stabilizes MLL5 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitylation. Moreover, USP7 was identified as a protein deubiquitinase that interacts with and deubiquitinases MLL5 protein. MLL5, OGT and USP7 formed a stable protein complex and colocalized in the cell nucleus. MLL5 protein levels were additionally correlated with increased OGT and USP7 expression in primary cervical adenocarcinomas. Data from the current study have thus revealed previously unknown mechanisms in maintenance of MLL5 protein stability involving regulation by OGT and USP7 (<xref rid="pone.0145023.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
      <p>The majority of cell proteins undergo post-translational modifications (PTM) to extend their range of biological functions. Using the mass spectrometry, O-GlcNAcylation and ubiquitylation at different sites on MLL5 protein were identified. Our experiments further comfirmed that OGT plays a critical role in the maintenance of MLL5 protein stability. In the absence of OGT, MLL5 underwent rapid degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, while overexpression of wild-type but not mutant OGT lacking GlcNAcyltransferase activity induced a marked reduction in levels of MLL5 ubiquitylation, suggesting that the O-GlcNAcyltransferase activity of OGT is important in preventing ubiquitylation and degradation of MLL5. In addition to O-GlcNAcylation and ubiquitylation, phosphorylation at different sites on MLL5 protein were identified with our mass spectrum assay. Further determination of the effects of these PTMs on the stability and function of MLL5 protein would be of considerable interest.</p>
      <p>In addition to the critical role of OGT, we showed that USP7, a protein deubiquitinase, is directly responsible for deubiquitination of MLL5 protein. USP7 was originally identified as a deubiquitinase for both tumor suppressor protein, p53, and its major E3 ligase, MDM2 [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Recent studies have implicated USP7 in a range of cellular processes, including DNA repair, signaling transduction, immune regulation and cell metabolism. In the current investigation, we showed that USP7 forms a stable complex with OGT and MLL5, with nuclear colocalization of all three proteins within the cell nucleus. Both USP7 and OGT proteins contain multiple motifs or domains with different functions. For example, the C-terminal UBL domain of USP7 protein is important for catalytic activity, whereas the N-terminal TRAF domain is critical for recruitment of target proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Similarly, the N-terminal TPR domain of OGT is involved in recognition and binding of substrate proteins while the central catalytic domains (CD) of OGT are critical for the catalytic activity of the enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Using various truncation mutants and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the USP7 protein is associated with MLL5 and OGT mainly through the N-terminal TRAF domain, while OGT associates with USP7 and MLL5 through its N-terminal TPR domains. In contrast, multiple domains of MLL5 protein are required for association with OGT and USP7. Thus, OGT, USP7 and MLL5 form a highly organized protein complex through specific interactions among domains, and the absence of either USP7 or OGT leads to enhanced ubiquitylation and accelerated degradation of MLL5 protein. Our results raise the interesting question of whether OGT and USP7 catalyze and modulate each otherâs activities. Further studies are required to clarify the interplay between these enzymes.</p>
      <p>Upregulation of OGT and USP7 has been reported in a number of tumor types. These proteins potentially contribute to tumorigenesis either by modulating cellular metabolism or stability of the tumor suppressor, p53. Here, we detected increased protein expression of OGT, USP7 and MLL5 in human primay cervical adenocarcinomas, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Our results provide further evidence that OGT and USP7 cooperatively regulate stabilization of MLL5 protein. MLL5 protein is implicated in regulating cell cycle progression <italic>via</italic> the RB-E2F1 protein pathway [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that a MLL5 isoform is crucial for HPV E6 and E7 transcription and cervical cancer growth [<xref rid="pone.0145023.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, increased MLL5 protein <italic>via</italic> upregulation of OGT and USP7 in tumor cells may contribute to altered cell proliferation and malignant transformation. The precise role of MLL5 protein in tumorigenesis requires further investigations.</p>
      <p>In summary, OGT and USP7 cooperatively regulate the stability of MLL5 protein, a trithorax group H3K4 methyltransferase, through inhibiting its ubiquitylation and degradation. While the specific E3 ligase required for MLL5 ubiquitylation remains to be identified, our results indicate that USP7 acts as a <italic>bona fide</italic> MLL5 deubiquitinase. Considering that OGT is crucially involved in transcriptional and post-translational regulation of cellular metabolism, this study has revealed a new link between cellular metabolic sensors and histone modification. Our findings support the existence of a relatively stable protein complex containing OGT, USP7 and MLL5 in the cell nucleus, suggesting physical and functional interplay among O-GlcNAc transferase, deubiquitinase and histone methyltransferase under normal and pathological conditions.</p>
