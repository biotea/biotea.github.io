        <p id="P3">Despite the essential roles of sphingolipids as both structural components of membranes and critical signalling molecules, we have a limited understanding of how cells sense and regulate their levels. Here we reveal the function in sphingolipid metabolism of the <italic>ORM/ORMDL</italic> genes, a conserved gene family that includes <italic>ORMDL3</italic>, which has recently been identified as a potential risk factor for childhood asthma. Starting from an unbiased functional genomic approach, we identify Orm proteins as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production. We also define a regulatory pathway in which phosphorylation of Orm proteins relieves their inhibitory activity when sphingolipid production is disrupted. Changes in <italic>ORM</italic> gene expression or mutations to their phosphorylation sites cause dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Our work identifies the Orm proteins as critical mediators of sphingolipid homeostasis and raises the possibility that sphingolipid misregulation contributes to the development of childhood asthma.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P4">As cells grow, divide and respond to their environment, they must synthesize lipids to meet metabolic demands while also ensuring the correct balance of a wide array of structurally and functionally diverse lipid species. At the same time, cells need to maintain the correct distribution of lipids within the membrane bilayers of different organelles and the plasma membrane. Regulatory mechanisms that ensure proper levels of some lipid species including sterols<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and various glycerolipids<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> have been identified, with loss of such controls leading to a variety of disease states<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. While remarkable progress has been made in defining the protein machinery responsible for synthesizing<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and transporting sphingolipids<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, insights into how cells sense and maintain their levels are only now emerging<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The need for precise regulation of sphingolipids may be particularly acute as, in addition to the structural roles of the terminal products, several biosynthetic intermediatesâincluding sphingosine, ceramide, and their phosphorylated derivatesâare signalling molecules that participate in key physiological and pathological processes<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P5">Our investigations into how cells achieve sphingolipid homeostasis stem from analysis of the <italic>ORM/ORMDL</italic> genes, which have been implicated recently in asthma. Asthma has emerged as a major health problem, with rates of childhood disease increasing dramatically over the last three decades<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. There is a strong heritable component that modulates asthma susceptibility, and many studies have been undertaken to identify genetic risk factors<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. A breakthrough in these efforts came with the genome-wide association study of Moffatt et al.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, which identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosome 17q21 near the <italic>ORMDL3</italic> gene that confer an increased risk of childhood asthma. Subsequent studies have reproduced this finding in multiple ethnic groups<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> . Additionally, the disease-associated polymorphisms have been shown to modulate expression of <italic>ORMDL3</italic> and the adjacent gene <italic>GSDMB</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, suggesting that dysregulation of one or both of these genes may contribute to childhood asthma. Thus genetic variants near <italic>ORMDL3</italic> are a widespread risk factor for developing childhood asthma that may raise the incidence of the disease by up to ~20%<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. However, translating these findings into an increased understanding of how <italic>ORMDL3</italic> may contribute to asthma pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of information on the function of <italic>ORM</italic>-family genes.</p>
      <p id="P6">Members of the <italic>ORM</italic> gene family encode trans-membrane proteins localized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and include two genes in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>ORM1/2</italic>) and three genes in humans (<italic>ORMDL1/2/3</italic>)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. The Orm proteins have no known functional domains, and little is known about their cellular role; however, they are strongly conserved and have been proposed to share a common function<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Here we use a combination of global and targeted studies to identify Orm proteins as homeostatic regulators of the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis.</p>

      <sec id="S3">
        <title>Orm1/2 negatively regulate sphingolipid synthesis</title>
        <p id="P7">We began our investigation of <italic>S. cerevisiae ORM1</italic> and <italic>ORM2</italic> using a global approach to characterize gene function based on large-scale measurements of genetic interactions, termed epistatic mini-array profiles or E-MAPs<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. In this strategy, the function of a given gene can be inferred without <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses by comparing the spectrum of genetic interactions resulting from mutation of that gene with interaction patterns caused by mutations in other genes of defined function. When we compared the genetic interaction profile resulting from deletion of <italic>ORM2</italic> to those obtained for a collection of &gt;1400 yeast mutants focused on ER biology (manuscript in preparation and ref. <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), we observed a strong anti-correlation with the interaction patterns seen for hypomorphic alleles that reduce expression of <italic>LCB1</italic> and <italic>LCB2</italic> (<italic>lcb1-DAmP</italic> and <italic>lcb2-DAmP</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), thus implying that <italic>ORM2</italic> and <italic>LCB1/2</italic> have opposing cellular roles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data</xref>). We also examined the genetic interactions that result from over-expression of <italic>ORM1</italic> or <italic>ORM2</italic> using the strong promoters <italic>pTDH3</italic> and <italic>pTEF2</italic>, as it was shown that the asthma-associated polymorphisms near <italic>ORMDL3</italic> are associated with increased expression of this gene<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Over-expression of <italic>ORM1</italic> or <italic>ORM2</italic> produced a pattern of genetic interactions that was highly correlated with those seen for the <italic>lcb1-DAmP</italic> and <italic>lcb2-DAmP</italic> strains, indicating that increased Orm expression phenocopies reduced Lcb1/2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P8"><italic>LCB1</italic> and <italic>LCB2</italic> encode serine palmitoyltransferase, an essential hetero-dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The synthesis of sphingolipids begins in the ER, where two classes of lipid metabolites, long chain bases (LCBs) and very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). LCBs are produced by the condensation of serine with fatty acids by serine palmitoyltransferase (Lcb1/2 in yeast and Sptlc1/2/3 in mammals), followed by Tsc10-mediated reduction.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. LCBs can then be phosphorylated or N-acylated with VLCFAs to form long chain base phosphates or ceramides, respectively, with the latter undergoing further modification to generate complex sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P9">Thus our E-MAP data showing a correlation between increased <italic>ORM</italic> expression and decreased <italic>LCB1/2</italic> function implicate the Orm proteins as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis and highlight the reaction carried out by Lcb1/2 as the possible step in the pathway at which Orm1/2 may act (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,d</xref>). We therefore examined the effects of altering Orm levels on cellular lipid composition using a mass spectrometry-based global lipidomic technique<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In agreement with the genetic interaction data, over-expression of <italic>ORM1</italic> or <italic>ORM2</italic> resulted in changes to the lipidome, including reduced LCB and ceramide levels, that closely resembled those seen for the <italic>lcb2-DAmP</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data</xref>). Conversely, cells deleted for <italic>ORM1/2</italic> had highly elevated levels of LCBs and ceramides. In principle, this accumulation of LCBs caused by deletion of <italic>ORM1/2</italic> could result from a failure to consume these species by reaction with VLCFAs to form ceramides, as is seen when <italic>SUR4</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and ref. <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, in contrast to the <italic>sur4</italic>Î strain, the <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î strainâs elevated LCB levels are also accompanied by increased amounts of the terminal sphingolipid mannosyl-diinositolphosphorylceramide (MIP<sub>2</sub>C). Thus, <italic>ORM1/2</italic> deletion causes increased flux throughout the sphingolipid pathway. This increased flux is also the primary cause of the growth defect seen in <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î cells, as artificially decreasing Lcb1/2 activity, either through the use of myriocin, a drug that specifically inhibits Lcb1/2<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, or through the <italic>lcb2-DAmP</italic> allele, significantly suppresses the growth defect caused by loss of <italic>ORM1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S4">
        <title>A complex with Orm1/2, Lcb1/2, and Sac1</title>
        <p id="P10">We next explored how Orm proteins modulate sphingolipid production by identifying proteins bound by Orm1 and Orm2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Isolation of functional 3ÃFlag-tagged forms of Orm1 and Orm2 expressed from their endogenous loci revealed a previously uncharacterized, roughly stoichiometric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Mass spectrometry showed that this complex comprises the serine palmitoyltransferase proteins Lcb1, Lcb2 and Tsc3, in addition to the phosphoinositide phosphatase Sac1<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To further characterize physical interactions among these proteins, we utilized a 3ÃFlag-tagged form of Lcb1 that is able to rescue the inviability seen upon loss of <italic>LCB1</italic> (although this allele does exhibit mild sensitivity to myriocin). Purification of 3ÃFlag-Lcb1 yielded the same components seen in the Orm1/2 pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that the Orm-associated proteins are likely to exist in a single complex. Orm proteins and potentially their binding partners may also form higher-order oligomers, as we detected Orm2 co-immunoprecipitation with 3ÃFlag-Orm1 (and vice versa) and self-association of differently tagged copies of the same Orm protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P11">The presence of Sac1 in association with Lcb1/2 suggests a new connection between this phosphoinositide phosphatase and sphingolipid biosynthesis. Deletion of <italic>SAC1</italic> leads to elevated LCB levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref> and ref. <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and resistance to the Lcb1/2 inhibitor myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This resistance was also seen in cells expressing the <italic>sac1â8</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> catalytically inactive mutant of <italic>SAC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Additionally, we found that Sac1 and Orm1/2 bind independently to Lcb1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and that <italic>SAC1</italic> and <italic>ORM1/2</italic> deletions exhibit synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). These findings together suggest that Sac1 modulates serine palmitoyltransferase activity directly, but in a mode distinct from Orm1/2.</p>
        <p id="P12">Finally, we showed that the functional complex between Orm proteins and serine palmitoyltransferase is conserved in human cells. Immunoprecipitations from HEK293T cells expressing 3ÃFlag-tagged Ormdl3 led to a prominent Sptlc1 band detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Additionally, we found that simultaneous knock-down by RNAi of <italic>ORMDL1/2/3</italic> in Hela cells causes an approximately three-fold increase in ceramide levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P13">Together, these results establish that Orm proteins are components of a novel and conserved protein complex, which we term the SPOTS complex (<underline>S</underline>erine <underline>P</underline>almitoyltransferase, <underline>O</underline>rm1/2, <underline>T</underline>sc3, and <underline>S</underline>ac1). Additionally, our data suggest that Orm1/2 negatively regulate sphingolipid synthesis by acting directly on Lcb1/2 (for example by altering Lcb1/2 catalytic activity, accessibility of substrates to the enzyme, or its sub-cellular localization).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="S5">
        <title>Homeostatic regulation of Orm1/2 activity</title>
        <p id="P14">Why would cells include negative regulators of serine palmitoyltransferase, Orm1/2, as core components of this essential enzyme complex? This seemingly paradoxical arrangement prompted us to investigate whether Orm-mediated inhibition of LCB production might be regulated in response to changes in the cellular need for sphingolipid synthesis. We therefore examined how <italic>ORM1/2</italic> deletion affects sensitivity to the Lcb1/2 inhibitor myriocin. Growth in the presence of myriocin is strongly dependent on the cellular capacity for LCB production, as the <italic>lcb2-DAmP</italic> strain is highly sensitive to myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and <italic>SAC1</italic> deletion, which leads to increased LCB levels, confers myriocin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Thus, naively we might expect deletion of <italic>ORM1/2</italic> to also confer pronounced resistance to this drug. However, we observed that wild-type and <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î strains exhibit comparable growth in the presence of myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Thus, loss of <italic>ORM1/2</italic> strongly impacts cell growth under standard conditions but has little apparent effect when sphingolipid synthesis is disrupted, suggesting that Orm1/2 may be inactivated in response to myriocin treatment.</p>
        <p id="P15">To further investigate this possibility, we compared the effects of myriocin on the LCB levels of wild-type and <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î strains. As described above, the <italic>ORM1/2</italic> deletion strain exhibits highly elevated LCB levels in the absence of myriocin. However, with increasing doses of myriocin, LCB levels in the <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î strain decrease strongly and approximately converge with those of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), supporting our growth data indicating that Orm1/2 may be inactivated in response to myriocin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that wild-type cells maintain roughly constant LCB levels even at intermediate myriocin concentrations (up to ~40 ng/ml). This robustness is not due to a failure of myriocin to affect Lcb1/2 at these concentrations, as LCB levels in the <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î strain are reduced strongly by the same drug concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>; for further evidence see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Rather, these results suggest that progressive inactivation of Orm1/2 may provide cells with a homeostatic mechanism to maintain nearly constant sphingolipid output in the face of increasing Lcb1/2 inhibition. Consistent with this hypothesis, LCB levels in the wild-type strain begin to decline only at myriocin concentrations where Orm-mediated inhibition of LCB synthesis appears to be fully relieved, as evidenced by convergence of wild-type and <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î LCB levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

        <title>Orm1/2 regulation by phosphorylation</title>
        <p id="P16">We next investigated the mechanism by which Orm1/2 activity might be decreased in response to myriocin treatment. Growth in myriocin did not alter Orm1/2 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) or abolish their ability to interact with Lcb1/2 and Sac1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). However, we observed a notable reduction in localization of GFP-Orm2 to the cortical but not peri-nuclear ER after myriocin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), raising the possibility that changes in sub-cellular localization contribute to regulation of SPOTS complex activity. We also found a strong reduction in Orm protein co-immunoprecipitation in cells treated with myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), both for Orm1âOrm2 interaction and for self-association of Orm1 and of Orm2. A weak reduction in Orm-Lcb1 binding was also observed in response to myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These findings suggest a model in which Orm-Lcb1/2 sub-complexes can self-associate into higher-order oligomers in a manner that is inhibited in response to disruptions to sphingolipid synthesis.</p>
        <p id="P17">We also detected in our Orm1/2 co-immunoprecipations a slight shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Orm1 caused by myriocin treatment, indicating that Orm proteins may be post-translationally modified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, Flag-Orm1 and HA-Orm1 inputs). Analysis of 3ÃFlag-Orm1 and 3ÃFlag-Orm2 in SDS/PAGE gels that incorporate a phosphate-binding agent that aids in the separation of phosphorylated species<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> resolved multiple phosphorylated forms for both Orm1 and Orm2 that collapsed to faster-migrating species upon phosphatase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). Importantly, growth in myriocin induced a dose-dependent shift to more highly phosphorylated forms, and this response occurred over the same concentrations of myriocin that led to homeostatic inactivation of Orm1/2, as determined by LCB measurements (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b and Fig. 4d</xref>). We also observed increased Orm1/2 phosphorylation after shutting off expression of downstream sphingolipid synthetic enzymes such as Tsc10 or Lag1 (in a <italic>lac1</italic>Î background; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), further indicating that phosphorylation of Orm proteins is a homeostatic response to disruption of sphingolipid production (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Finally, we did not observe substantial changes in Orm1/2 phosphorylation upon shutting off expression of <italic>AUR1</italic> or <italic>CSG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), thus providing preliminary evidence that a metabolite upstream of these enzymes, such as ceramide, is the sphingolipid intermediate whose levels are sensed to regulate Orm1/2 activity.</p>
        <p id="P18">To test our phosphorylation-mediated feedback model directly, we identified residues of Orm1 and Orm2 that are phosphorylated. Through a combination of targeted mutagenesis and mass spectrometry, we found several sites of Orm1 and Orm2 phosphorylation in the N-terminal regions of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Importantly, mutation of these sites to alanine blocks formation of the slower-migrating phosphorylated species seen in phosphate-affinity gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This loss of phosphorylation is unlikely to be due to these mutations resulting in non-functional Orm proteins, as the phospho-mutants are expressed at levels comparable to wild-type and rescue the slow growth of the <italic>orm1</italic>Î/<italic>orm2</italic>Î strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, immunoprecipitations of phospho-mutant Orm1/2 revealed that these proteins not only maintain the ability to interact with Lcb1 and each other, but that blocking phosphorylation prevents the change in higher-order assembly of the SPOTS complex normally seen in response to myriocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Thus Orm1/2 phosphorylation appears to be the event that triggers dynamic regulation of SPOTS complex oligomerization.</p>
        <p id="P19">We next investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of Orm1/2 phosphorylation. Consistent with a basal level of Orm1/2 phosphorylation that is important for steady-state LCB production, we observed a substantial (two-fold) reduction in LCB levels in the <italic>ORM1/2</italic> phospho-mutant strain under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Furthermore, we found that this strain is highly sensitive to myriocin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). This result thus confirms a key prediction of our homeostatic model and indicates that although cells may possess additional mechanisms to regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis, such pathways cannot compensate for disruption of the critical feedback control provided by Orm1/2. Thus, Orm proteins are dynamic negative regulators of serine palmitoyltransferase whose inhibitory activity is dependent on adequate levels of downstream sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P20">Our studies identify Orm proteins as homeostatic regulators of sphingolipid metabolism and demonstrate that alteration of these controls leads to misregulation of sphingolipid production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Specifically, loss of the Orm1/2-mediated brake on serine palmitoyltransferase activity results in toxic accumulation of sphingolipids, while mutations that prevent this brake from being removed render cells unable to survive disruptions to sphingolipid synthesis.</p>
      <p id="P21">A phosphorylation-based feedback loop provides a mechanistic basis for homeostatic regulation of sphingolipid production and exhibits a number of features that make it well-suited to precisely control sphingolipid levels. First, phosphorylation of a direct regulator of serine palmitoyltransferase may enable cells to respond rapidly to changing environments. Second, Orm1/2 exhibit partial phosphorylation under standard growth conditions, which may position the Orm1/2-based sphingolipid rheostat for maximal sensitivity to changes in lipid metabolism. Additionally, multi-site phosphorylation of Orm1 and Orm2 has the potential to generate several distinct and stable phospho-states, which may provide cells with a graded mechanism to finely adjust lipid production to match cellular needs. Finally, multiple phosphorylation sites may also render Orm1/2 responsive to multiple physiologic or metabolic cues.</p>
      <p id="P22">Our identification of the SPOTS complex reveals a novel mechanism by which cells may be able to coordinate a variety of important secretory pathway processes. While a link between sphingolipids and phosphoinositides has been appreciated for some time<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, we provide evidence that the phosphoinositide phosphatase Sac1 directly modulates sphingolipid metabolism, as it is associated physically with serine palmitoyltransferase. These results are of particular interest given the role of phosphoinositides, including the Sac1 substrate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), in the trafficking of both proteins and sphingolipids from the ER and Golgi apparatus<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Additionally, changes in Sac1 localization from the ER to the Golgi have been shown in both yeast and mammals to regulate protein flux through the secretory pathway in response to nutrient levels<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. We therefore suggest that the SPOTS complex may represent a dynamic coordinating center that couples changes in sphingolipid and nutrient levels to the activity and localization of key enzymes of lipid metabolism and trafficking. This model is consistent with our finding that Orm proteins self-associate in a regulated fashion and with evidence that mammalian serine palmitoyltransferase is part of a high-molecular-mass complex<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P23">Finally, our characterization of <italic>ORM</italic> gene function provides a framework for investigating whether alterations in <italic>ORMDL3</italic> activity and sphingolipid metabolism play a role in asthma pathogenesis. A number of studies support a role for sphingolipids such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate in asthma-associated inflammatory processes, including mast cell degranulation, airway hyper-responsiveness, and immune cell trafficking<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Our findings now link this growing body of evidence to the identification of SNPs near <italic>ORMDL3</italic> that are associated with childhood asthma<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Specifically, our observation that altered Orm levels strongly impact sphingolipid metabolism raises the testable hypothesis that misregulation of sphingolipids may have a direct and causative role in the development of asthma. A broader potential role for sphingolipids in inflammatory disease is also suggested by reports that SNPs near <italic>ORMDL3</italic> are associated with Crohnâs disease<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, type I diabetes<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and primary biliary cirrhosis<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Finally, the existence of a rich set of pharmacologic tools targeting the sphingolipid pathway<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> raises the possibility of therapeutic intervention to counteract the potential effects of changes in <italic>ORMDL3</italic> activity.</p>

        <title>Serial-dilution cell spotting assays</title>
        <p id="P39">Logarithmically growing yeast were spotted onto agar plates in 10-fold serial dilutions from a starting OD<sub>600</sub> density of 0.3 to a final OD<sub>600</sub> density of 3E-4. Plates were imaged after growth for 24â48 hr. Plates with myriocin are standard YEPD supplemented with 0.1% tergitol and 2mM citric acid.</p>

        <title>LCB extraction and analysis by HPLC</title>
        <p id="P40">LCB extraction and analysis was carried out as described by Lester and Dickson<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Myriocin-treated samples were grown for 14â16 hr in the presence of drug prior to extractions. For extractions, 50ml of a logarithmically growing culture was harvested and re-suspended in 10ml 5% TCA at 4Â°C. Following a 10 min incubation, cells were washed once in 5% TCA and three times in H<sub>2</sub>O at 4Â°C. Cell pellets were then re-suspended in 75Âµl H<sub>2</sub>O followed by addition of 425Âµl 70.6mM TEA/EtOH. Lipids were extracted by bath sonication (3Ã 99s, 30W) and incubation at 65Â°C for 30 min. 150Âµl of this extract was derivatized by reaction for 40 min at room temperature with 30Âµl of AccQ Fluor reagent (Waters Corp.). Ester-linked lipids were de-acylated by addition of 22.5Âµl of 1.5M KOH/MeOH. Following 30 min incubation at 37Â°C, the reaction was neutralized by addition of 22.5Âµl 1.74M AcOH/MeOH. Samples were analyzed on an Agilent Chemstation HPLC using a reverse-phase C18 column (ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18; Agilent).</p>

Residues mutated to alanine in the indicated phospho-mutants are highlighted in red below. <bold>b</bold>, Native immunoprecipitations of 3ÃFlag-tagged wild-type or phospho-mutant Orm1 and Orm2 were performed from strains expressing wild-type or phospho-mutant 3ÃHA-Orm1/2 after growth in standard media or media supplemented with 100 ng/ml myriocin. Western blots were analyzed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>. <bold>c</bold>, Model for homeostatic regulation of Orm1/2, in which Orm proteins act as negative regulators of serine palmitoyltransferase (Lcb1/Lcb2/Tsc3), whose inhibitory activity is dependent on levels of downstream sphingolipids. P-Orm1/2 denotes phosphorylated Orm1/2; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> for abbreviations used. <bold>d</bold>, LCBs were extracted and analyzed from wild-type (WT) and 3ÃFlag-tagged <italic>ORM1/2</italic> double phospho-mutant strains grown in standard media. Data were analyzed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> (average Â± s.d., n = 3). <bold>e</bold>, Serial dilutions of wild-type (WT), <italic>ORM1/2</italic> deletion, and 3ÃFlag-tagged <italic>ORM1/2</italic> double-phospho-mutant strains were spotted on plates with 0 or 280 ng/ml myriocin and imaged after growth for 24â36 hr.</p>
