        <p>Recently, genetic studies have implicated <italic>KIAA0319</italic> in developmental dyslexia, the most common of the childhood learning disorders. The first functional data indicated that the KIAA0319 protein is expressed on the plasma membrane and may be involved in neuronal migration. Further analysis of the subcellular distribution of the overexpressed protein in mammalian cells indicates that KIAA0319 can colocalize with the early endosomal marker early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) in large intracellular vesicles, suggesting that it is endocytosed. Antibody internalization assays with full-length KIAA0319 and deletion constructs confirmed that KIAA0319 is internalized and showed the importance of the cytoplasmic juxtamembranal region in this process. The present study has identified the medium subunit (Î¼2) of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) as a binding partner of KIAA0319 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Using Rab5 mutants or depletion of the Î¼-subunit of AP-2 or clathrin heavy chain by RNA interference, we demonstrate that KIAA0319 follows a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. We also identify tyrosine-995 of KIAA0319 as a critical amino acid required for the interaction with AP-2 and subsequent internalization. These results suggest the surface expression of KIAA0319 is regulated by endocytosis, supporting the idea that the internalization and recycling of the protein may be involved in fine tuning its role in neuronal migration.</p>

  <body><p><sc>developmental dyslexia</sc> (DD) is one of the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorders among school-age children, with a frequency between 5% and 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Dyslexic individuals have difficulties with learning to read despite intellectual ability and appropriate educational opportunities. To date, nine dyslexia susceptibility loci (<italic>DYX1â9</italic>) have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>), and several genes have been proposed as candidates: <italic>DYX1C1</italic>, <italic>ROBO1</italic>, <italic>DCDC2</italic>, and <italic>KIAA0319</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). All these genes participate in brain development processes such as neuronal migration and axonal guidance, and abnormalities in brain development have been reported in dyslexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). More recently two other genes (<italic>MRPL19</italic> and <italic>C2ORF3</italic>) have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>) but with little functional information available.</p><p>The locus <italic>DYX2</italic>, on chromosome 6p22, is of particular interest because it has been consistently reported in several independent studies, and not one, but two, candidate DD susceptibility genes (<italic>DCDC2</italic> and <italic>KIAA0319</italic>) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). We have previously described a risk haplotype in this locus associated with dyslexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>) and showed that this haplotype is associated with a reduction of <italic>KIAA0319</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Interference with rat <italic>Kiaa0319</italic> expression in utero disrupts neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex and causes a marked change in the normal morphology of migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). This protein is predicted to have a motif at NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus with seven cysteine (MANSC), five polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains and a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). We have recently shown that KIAA0319 is a highly glycosylated, dimeric, type I plasma membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). The precise function of this protein and its involvement in neuronal migration are still unclear. The presence of PKD domains suggests a possible role in cell adhesion or cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>), although the detection of a secreted, nonmembranal, minor isoform could also indicate a role in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>).</p><p>Plasma membrane proteins, upon reaching the cell surface, are tightly regulated to determine whether they stay at the cell surface or are internalized in response to specific signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Many proteins are internalized, including proteins involved in cell adhesion such as cadherins and integrins, and their intracellular trafficking is thought to regulate their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Most cell-surface receptors and integral membrane proteins are internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, although several alternative endocytic pathways operate at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). Thus clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best characterized route of protein internalization. Clathrin is not only involved in endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins but also in the selective transport of cargo molecules between membrane-bound intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). Many proteins involved in the formation of the clathrin-coated pits, the binding of cargo proteins, and the regulation of the pathway are known. One of the key regulators of the early endocytosis traffic is Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Rab proteins constitute the largest family of monomeric small GTPases, and their regulatory function lies in their ability to cycle between an active, GTP-bound, and an inactive, GDP-bound, state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Rab proteins function in the tethering/docking of vesicles to their target compartment, leading to membrane fusion, and thus these proteins regulate vesicular transport in endocytosis and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Rab5 is localized to the early endosome where it regulates clathrin-coated, vesicle-mediated transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes as well as homotypic early endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Sorting of cargo into clathrin-coated pits requires adaptors that recognize either directly or indirectly signals present within the cytoplasmic domain of the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Although several adaptors have been identified, adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) is the main adaptor functioning at the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). AP-2 is a heterotetramer composed of two large subunits (Î± and Î²2), one medium subunit (Î¼2), and a small subunit (Ï2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>).</p><p>Among the sorting signals present in the cargo proteins, the âtyrosine-basedâ and the âdileucine-basedâ motifs are the most characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). The YXXÎ¦ motif (where X is any amino acid and Î¦ a hydrophobic amino acid) is the main tyrosine-based signal, widely involved in protein sorting at the plasma membrane and at several intracellular compartments and is recognized by the Î¼-subunit of AP-2 and other AP complexes. NPXY, the other tyrosine-based signal, is only involved in internalization from the plasma membrane and, although it has been reported to bind AP-2 and clathrin, it is recognized by alternative adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). The dileucine-based sorting signals also include two motifs, in the form of [DE]XXXL[LI] and DXXLL consensus sequences, although only [DE]XXXL[LI] is involved in internalization of plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>).</p><p>We recently started to characterize the protein KIAA0319 to gain further insight into its role in DD. Analysis of the trafficking of KIAA0319 is necessary to understand the function of this protein. Herein we show that, after reaching the plasma membrane, KIAA0319 is internalized back into the cell. This endocytosis follows a clathrin-mediated pathway that involves the participation of Rab5 and a direct interaction with AP-2. Furthermore, we identify the sorting signal in the cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319 necessary for its interaction with AP-2 and, therefore, for the internalization process.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>DNA constructs.</title><p>Standard PCR and molecular cloning techniques were used to generate expression plasmids. Primer sequences and cloning conditions are available upon request. Mammalian expression plasmids pcD4KAm and pcD4Kmd20-21, encoding COOH-terminal mycHIS-tagged KIAA0319 full-length (KA) and 984-1072 deletion protein (Kd20-21), respectively, have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). New constructs used here are pcD4Kmd20-21a and pcD4Kmd21b, encoding the COOH-terminal mycHIS-tagged KIAA0319 deletion proteins Kd20-21a (deletion of exon 20 and part of exon 21, encoding amino acids 984-1023) and Kd21b (deletion of part of exon 21, encoding amino acids 1031-1072), respectively. Plasmid pcDKAV, encoding the COOH-terminal V5-tagged KIAA0319 full-length protein (KAv), was obtained by subcloning an <italic>Nde</italic>I-<italic>BstB</italic>I fragment from pcD4KAm into pcDNA3.2/V5/GW/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319 (KACt, amino acids 980-1072) was cloned into the yeast expression vector pAS2DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) to obtain pAS2_KACt. KACt and fragments f1, f2, and f3 encoding amino acids 980-1013, 1008-1044, and 1039-1072 of KIAA0319, respectively, were cloned into pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences) for bacterial overexpression as GST-fusion proteins. Yeast control plasmids are pLAM5â²-1, encoding a GAL4 DNA-Binding Domain/human Lamin C hybrid, and pGADT7-T, encoding a fusion of the SV40 large T antigen and the GAL4 Activating Domain (Clontech).

We observe that this protein very often localizes to intracellular vesicles, usually at a juxtanuclear position (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic>â<italic>C</italic>). These vesicles can be very large in size in transiently transfected cells, which may be a reflection of the overexpression of the protein. Several subcellular markers were used in IF experiments, and colocalization was detected in some vesicles with the early endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>D</italic>â<italic>F</italic>). This result suggests that these vesicles could be early endosomes originated by the internalization of KIAA0319 from the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis we performed antibody-internalization assays. For this purpose we used R2 antiserum, which recognizes an antigen in the PKD2 domain of the KIAA0319 protein. Cells were incubated with this antiserum for 30 min at 4Â°C; under these conditions endocytosis is inhibited and the antibodies bind to the protein located at the plasma membrane, where the antigen is accessible, but not the protein in internal compartments (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>G</italic>â<italic>I</italic>). Subsequent incubation at 37Â°C allows the endocytic process to resume, and the uptake of the antibody indicates internalization of KIAA0319. Under these conditions, the R2 signal is detected in vesicles (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>J</italic>â<italic>L</italic>) similar to those detected by normal IF (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A</italic>â<italic>C</italic>), indicating that KIAA0319 is endocytosed from the plasma membrane. We confirmed that this internalization process is not an artifact triggered by the binding of the polyclonal antibody itself by performing internalization assays using the Fab fragments derived from the affinity-purified-specific antibodies (supplementary <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>The cytoplasmic juxtamembranal region of KIAA0319 is needed for internalization.</title><p>The KIAA0319 COOH-terminus (KACt, residues 980 to 1072, mostly encoded by exons 20 and 21), constitutes the cytoplasmic domain of the protein. Although it is not needed to localize to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>), it might contain important signals for endocytosis. To investigate this we performed antibody internalization assays with several deletion constructs of KIAA0319. Cells expressing the Kd20-21 deletion protein, lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain, do not internalize R2 antibodies (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>M</italic></xref>), suggesting this region of the protein is needed for endocytosis. We further analyzed the location of the signal for endocytosis by using two other constructs encoding KIAA0319-deletion proteins Kd20-21a and Kd21b, lacking residues 984 to 1023 and 1031 to 1072, respectively. Internalization assays were performed as described. Vesicles with internalized Kd21b could be observed (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>O</italic></xref>), as seen with the full-length protein (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>L</italic></xref>), but not with Kd20-21a (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>N</italic></xref>), which presented a similar pattern to that of the full cytoplasmic-domain-deleted protein Kd20-21 (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>M</italic></xref>). These internalization assays, together with normal IF staining, are shown more in detail in supplementary <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. These results suggest that the signal needed for KIAA0319 endocytosis resides in the region 984-1023 of the protein, mostly encoded by exon 20.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>KIAA0319 internalization is Rab5 dependent.</title><p>We further examined the internalization of KIAA0319 by investigating the effect of Rab5 mutants. In the early endocytic pathway, Rab5 regulates clathrin-coated, vesicle-mediated transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes as well as homotypic early endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Two Rab5 mutants Q79L (âconstitutively activeâ) and S34N (âdominant negativeâ) with opposing biochemical properties have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>): Rab5 Q79L has reduced GTPase activity and is a potent stimulator of homotypic fusion between early endosomes, whereas Rab5 S34N has preferential affinity for GDP and causes fragmentation of endosomes, inhibition of endosome fusion, and inhibition of transferrin endocytosis. R2 antiserum internalization assays were performed in cells cotransfected with KIAA0319 and one of the Rab5 mutant constructs. R2 antiserum is detected at the plasma membrane after incubation at 4Â°C both in cells expressing the Q79L mutant (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic>â<italic>C</italic>) and in cells expressing the S34N mutant (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>G</italic>â<italic>I</italic>). After incubation at 37Â°C, internalized KIAA0319 colocalizes with Rab5 Q79L in enlarged vesicles of transfected cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>D</italic>â<italic>F</italic>). However, in cells expressing Rab5 S34N, KIAA0319 internalization is inhibited (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>J</italic>â<italic>L</italic>). These results suggest that KIAA0319 most probably enters the early endosomal system following a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>KIAA0319 interacts with the Î¼-subunit of AP-2.</title><p>In parallel with the experiments described above, and as part of the characterization of KIAA0319, we performed a Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H) screen to identify proteins interacting with its cytoplasmic domain (KACt). The bait KACt was first tested for transcriptional activation. As expected, neither growth on media lacking histidine nor activation of <italic>lacZ</italic> gene was observed for the Y190 strain pretransformed with the bait KACt (Y190[KACt]) (data not shown). After Y190[KACt] was mated with the pretransformed library, five independent clones encoding Î¼2, the Î¼-subunit of the AP-2 complex (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_004068">NM_004068</ext-link>) were identified from 5.5 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> diploids. Three of these clones contained a prey vector encoding amino acids 66-435 (codon 436 being the stop codon), one clone encoded amino acids 2-435, and the last clone amino acids 87-435 of the Î¼2-subunit of AP-2. We retested this protein interaction by cotransformation of Y190 with one of the purified prey plasmids encoding Î¼2 (pGADT7_Î¼2, insert encoding amino acids 66-435) and either the bait vector pAS2_KACt or the control vector pLAM5â²-1. Only colonies expressing KACt and the Î¼2-subunit could grow on selective media lacking histidine (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>) and activate the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene (data not shown), confirming an interaction between KACt and Î¼2.</p><p>To provide further evidence of this interaction, we performed GST pull-down experiments. After immobilization on sepharose beads, GST or the fusion protein GST-KACt were incubated with HeLa cell protein extracts, beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis to detect Î¼2. To ascertain the region of KIAA0319 involved in the interaction with Î¼2, we performed the same experiment using three GST fusions containing overlapping fragments of KACt, f1, f2, or f3 (residues 980-1013, 1008â1044, and 1039-1072, respectively, of the KIAA0319 protein) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Specific binding could only be detected with the KACt and the f1 GST-fusion proteins (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Ponceau S staining confirms the presence of the GST fusion proteins in all samples. These results corroborate the Y2H data showing an interaction between KIAA0319 and the Î¼2 subunit of AP-2. Furthermore, in agreement with the antibody-internalization results obtained with the KIAA0319-deletion constructs (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>M</italic>â<italic>O</italic>), the interaction domain is mapped to the region 980-1013 of full-length KIAA0319.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>KIAA0319 undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</title><p>AP-2 is a key component for the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of transmembranal proteins, and the results described above strongly support that KIAA0319 follows this endocytic pathway. To further analyze KIAA0319s dependence on the AP-2 complex and clathrin for internalization, we carried out RNAi to deplete the Î¼2-subunit or clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) in HeLa cells overexpressing KIAA0319. Western blot analysis revealed &gt;90% depletion of Î¼2 or CLTC (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Because the antibodies that we tried against the Î¼2-subunit do not work in immunofluorescence, we used the transferrin receptor as a control. Transferrin receptor internalization is a very well-known marker for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and knockdown of Î¼2 or CLTC blocks the internalization of the transferrin receptor (which also interacts with the Î¼2-subunit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Depleted cells can be identified by the absence of labeled transferrin uptake. In these depleted cells KIAA0319 internalization is also prevented, as shown by the accumulation of the R2 antibody at the cell surface after performing the internalization assay (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>G</italic>â<italic>L</italic>). Nontargeting scrambled siRNA or mock transfection had no effect on the endocytosis of KIAA0319 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>A</italic>â<italic>F</italic>). The same experiments as those described in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, but detecting clathrin instead of transferrin, are presented in supplementary <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and show the same results. Thus preventing the functioning of AP-2 or clathrin by depleting Î¼2 or CLTC causes retention of KIAA0319 on the cell surface where it is blocked from internalizing. These results confirm that KIAA0319 follows the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and that this internalization is dependent on AP-2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Tyrosine-995 is needed for the endocytosis of KIAA0319.</title><p>The cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319 contains residues YTIL at position 995-998, matching the consensus sequence for the YXXÎ¦ AP-2-binding motif (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). It is located in fragment f1, which we show to be necessary for interaction with AP-2. To investigate whether this motif does indeed mediate the interaction between KACt and AP-2, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to change tyrosine-995 into alanine (Y995A).</p><p>We assessed the effect of Y995A mutation on the subcellular localization and internalization of KIAA0319, either by normal IF or by anti-KIAA0319 R2 antiserum internalization assays. HeLa cells were transfected with either KIAA0319 wild-type (KAv) or mutated KIAA0319 (KAv-Y995A), both tagged with a COOH-terminal V5 tag. As previously demonstrated in the HEK293T cell line (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), KIAA0319 wild type is observed intracellularly with some plasma membrane staining apparent (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 <italic>A</italic></xref>,A) and as expected, the R2 antibody is internalized (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>,B). KAv-Y995A on the other hand is detected mainly at the cell surface by normal IF (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>,D). Furthermore, the internalization of the R2 antibody in KAv-Y995A expressing cells is inhibited (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>,E), suggesting that the cell surface expression of KAv-Y995A is due to a defect in endocytosis. Transferrin internalization occurs normally in both KAv- and KAv-Y995A-expressing cells (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, C and F) showing clathrin-mediated endocytosis is unaffected in both cases. These results indicate that tyrosine-995 is necessary for the endocytosis of KIAA0319.</p><p>To confirm that the mutation Y995A in KIAA0319 prevents its interaction with AP-2, we performed Y2H and GST-pulldown experiments. The Y190 yeast strain was cotransformed with a prey plasmid expressing Î¼2 (pGADT7_Î¼2) and either the bait plasmid pAS2_KACt or the mutated bait plasmid pAS2_KACt-Y995A. Yeast containing the wild-type bait plasmid could grow on media lacking histidine (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>) and activate the reporter gene <italic>lacZ</italic> (not shown), whereas yeast containing the mutated bait plasmid failed to grow and to activate <italic>lacZ</italic> under the same conditions. Further data confirming the importance of this residue were obtained from GST-pulldown experiments (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>), with GST-KACt-Y995A showing a highly reduced binding to AP-2 compared with the result obtained with the wild-type GST-KACt. The reduction of binding is not due to lower expression of the mutated fusion protein GST-KACt (see Ponceau staining, <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>) but to the substitution of tyrosine-995 to alanine. These results indicate that the binding of AP-2 to the COOH-terminus of KIAA0319 involves the tyrosine-based motif in position 995-998 of the KIAA0319 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Neuronal migration is one of the key processes leading to the formation of the cerebral cortex and thus, during the development of the brain, neurons are required to tightly regulate cell-cell adhesion and migration. Recent data on KIAA0319 suggest that it is required for appropriate cell adhesion between migrating neurons and the glial fibers in the developing neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). We have recently shown that KIAA0319 is a single transmembrane protein detected at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). This subcellular localization is necessary for the protein to be directly involved in cell adhesion/neuronal migration. However, most proteins reaching the plasma membrane are not permanent residents but instead traffic between different subcellular compartments. The observation of vesicles positive for both KIAA0319 and an early endosome marker indicated that KIAA0319 could be internalized after reaching the plasma membrane. However, neither the traffic mechanisms of KIAA0319 nor the motifs in its sequence driving this traffic were known. We have characterized such mechanisms and motifs and show here that KIAA0319 is internalized via a clathrin-dependent pathway through direct interaction with the Î¼-subunit of the adaptor protein AP-2. This interaction is mediated by a YXXÎ¦-type internalization signal in the cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319.</p><p>Using deletion constructs, we observe that the juxtamembranal cytoplasmic region, encoded by exon 20, is necessary for the internalization of specific antibodies bound to KIAA0319 at the plasma membrane. The internalization of the protein, overexpressed in mammalian cells, appears to be a constitutive process as it is observed in normal culture conditions. For the characterization of the endocytic mechanism driving the internalization of this protein, we took advantage of the availability of Rab5 mutants. Rab5 controls critical steps for the endocytosis as it regulates clathrin-mediated transport from the plasma membrane to early endosomes as well as homotypic early endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Rab5 has been reported to participate at the very early stages of the endocytic pathway as it is required for vesicle formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Different Rab5 mutants have been described. The Q79L mutant is constitutively active because of a strongly decreased intrinsic GTPase activity. Overexpression of this mutant leads to a dramatic change in cell morphology, with the appearance of large early endocytic structures. The S34N is a dominant negative mutant, with a preferential affinity for GDP. Its overexpression inhibits transferrin receptor internalization, which follows the classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). The KIAA0319 protein, when coexpressed with these Rab5 mutants, colocalizes with the Q79L mutant in large vesicles, while its internalization is prevented in cells expressing Rab5-S34N; this is a very similar localization pattern as those reported for transferrin in the same conditions and suggests that KIAA0319 follows the same clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway.</p><p>As described before, there are two main sorting signals for proteins following clathrin-mediated endocytosis: dileucine- and tyrosine-based motifs. No sequence in the cytoplasmic COOH-terminus of KIAA0319 (KACt) fits the dileucine-based consensus signals. Regarding the tyrosine-based signals, out of the three tyrosine residues (Y995, Y1013, and Y1067) in KACt, none of them fits the NPXY sequence and only Y995, with the 995-998 region YTIL, matches the consensus for a YXXÎ¦ motif. The presence of a sequence conforming to a sorting motif is not necessarily predictive of sorting function because these signals must be present in an appropriate context to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). However, the observation that the deletion protein KAd20-21a, where the YTIL sequence is missing, could not be internalized from the plasma membrane suggests that such a sequence is likely to be the internalization signal for KIAA0319. We have shown that this is indeed the situation by identifying a direct interaction of KIAA0319 with the Î¼-subunit of the adaptor protein AP-2 (Î¼2). This interaction was found following an independent approach as a result of a parallel experiment where we used KACt as bait in a Y2H screen to identify interacting proteins. We identified several clones of Î¼2, encoding three different protein fragments, the smallest starting at residue 87. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of Î¼2 (1/3 of the protein) is involved in interaction with the Î²-subunit of the AP complex, and the COOH-terminus (2/3 of the protein) is involved in binding to YXXÎ¦ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Thus all the clones detected in the Y2H screen contain the COOH-terminal region of the protein and would be able to interact with proteins containing a YXXÎ¦ sequence. The use of fragments f1, f2, and f3 of KACt as well as the Y995A KACt mutant in Y2H experiments further confirmed that the YTIL sequence is responsible for the in vitro interaction of KIAA0319 with Î¼2. We confirmed that this was also the case in vivo. Depletion of Î¼2 or CLTC, as seen similarly in cells transfected with the Rab5 dominant-negative mutant, blocked the endocytosis of KIAA0319, indicating that the pool of KIAA0319 localized on the plasma membrane is indeed internalized via the clathrin pathway using AP-2 as an adaptor. The full-length KIAA0319-Y995A mutant protein, however, could not be internalized, confirming the importance of tyrosine 995 in the binding to AP-2 and endocytosis. This is true not only in the commonly used cell lines HEK293T or HeLa, used above, but also in neuronal cell lines such as Kelly (supplementary <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which could be regarded as a better model to study the function of the neuron-expressed KIAA0319 protein.</p><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis represents the major route by which hormones, receptors, and signaling factors are internalized. Endocytosed proteins reach the early endosomes, which play an important role in their sorting and regulation. From early endosomes, two alternative routes are available: the recycling back to the cell surface or to the trans-Golgi network, or the transport through late endosomes for degradation in the lysosome. Both routes will influence the surface expression of the endocytosed proteins. The sorting signal present in the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins could also be important for the choice of the postearly endosome route followed by the protein. Thus YXXÎ¦ motifs are involved in targeting transmembrane proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>), and both position within the cytoplasmic domain and actual amino acid sequence are important. Accordingly, it would be expected that KIAA0319 follows a recycling pathway after endocytosis instead of degradation. We are currently investigating this hypothesis to establish the specific steps that KIAA0319 follows after its internalization.</p><p>As it has been mentioned before, the recycling pathway of cell adhesion proteins such as cadherins is thought to have an important role in the regulation of their adhesive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Understanding the trafficking pathway of the KIAA0319 protein is important in the context of its involvement in neuronal migration as it would probably allow us to gain new insight in the mechanisms used to regulate this process. We have reported the initial steps to reach this objective, and the data presented here will be a valuable base to complete this task and advance in the functional characterization of this protein.</p></sec><sec><title>GRANTS</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Wellcome Trust.</p></sec>

        <p>KIAA0319 is internalized into early endosomes. Transiently transfected HEK293T cells expressing mycHIS-tagged full-length KIAA0319 KA (<italic>A</italic>â<italic>L</italic>) or several COOH-terminal-deletion proteins (<italic>M</italic>â<italic>O</italic>) were processed for normal IF or for internalization assays as described in <sc>materials and methods</sc>. KIAA0319 proteins were detected with polyclonal R2 antiserum and/or monoclonal anti-myc 9E10 antibody. KA is detected in vesicles (<italic>A</italic>â<italic>C</italic>), some of which show colocalization with the endosomal marker anti-EEA1 (<italic>D</italic>â<italic>F</italic>) (arrows). For the internalization assays, cells were loaded at 4Â°C with R2 antiserum, followed by incubation at 37Â°C to allow endocytosis to proceed (<italic>G</italic>â<italic>L</italic>). Antibody bound at 4Â°C stays at the plasma membrane (<italic>G</italic>â<italic>I</italic>) but is internalized after incubation at 37Â°C (<italic>J</italic>â<italic>L</italic>). Similar internalization assays performed for deletion proteins Kd20-21 (<italic>M</italic>), Kd20-21a (<italic>N</italic>), and Kd21b (<italic>O</italic>) (lacking residues 984-1072, 984-1023, and 1031-1072, respectively) show that only Kd21b is internalized. This indicates that the juxtamembranal region of the cytoplasmic domain contains a signal for endocytosis (see supplementary <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for more details). 10-Î¼m bars are shown in the merged panels.</p>

As shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, R2 antiserum bound at 4Â°C stays at the plasma membrane (<italic>B</italic>, <italic>H</italic>). In Rab5 Q79L transfected cells (<italic>D</italic>), KIAA0319 is internalized (<italic>E</italic>) and colocalizes with the enlarged Rab5-positive endosomes (<italic>F</italic>) after incubation at 37Â°C. In cells overexpressing Rab5 S34N (<italic>J</italic>), the R2 antiserum stays at the plasma membrane after the incubation at 37Â°C (<italic>K</italic>), and no colocalization with the Rab5 mutant is detected (<italic>L</italic>), suggesting that the endocytosis of KIAA0319 is inhibited. 10-Î¼m bars are shown in the merge panels.</p>

HeLa cell protein lysates were incubated with GST or GST-fusion proteins (full-length KACt or overlapping fragments f1-f2-f3) immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads.

A Ponceau staining of the membrane indicates the expression level of GST and GST-fusion proteins used in the experiment.

        <p>KIAA0319 undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis. HeLa cells were treated with transfection reagent alone (mock), with 100 nM scrambled small interfering RNA (siRNA) or with 100 nM siRNA directed against either Î¼2 or cathrin heavy chain (CLTC). After siRNA treatment, cells were transfected with a full-length KIAA0319 construct containing a V5 tag. <italic>A</italic>: cell lysates were prepared 72 h later and Western blotted using antibodies directed against Î¼2, CLTC, or actin. RNAi is specific for Î¼2 and CTLC and does not influence actin levels. <italic>B</italic>: R2 internalization assays in siRNA-treated cells. KIAA0319 protein at the plasma membrane was labeled with anti-KIAA0319 R2 antiserum, and after a period of internalization cells were fixed and processed to detect internalized R2 (<italic>B</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>K</italic>). Cells silenced for Î¼2 or CLTC can be identified by the absence of transferrin-594 uptake (<italic>A</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, <italic>J</italic>). In mock transfected and scrambled control cells, R2-labeled KIAA0319 is observed intracellularly, where it colocalizes with transferrin (<italic>A</italic>â<italic>F</italic>). In cells depleted of Î¼2 or CLTC, R2-labeled KIAA0319 is observed only on the cell surface (<italic>H</italic>, <italic>K</italic>).

        <p>Tyrosine-995 is needed for the endocytosis of KIAA0319. <italic>A</italic>: effect of Y995A mutation on the subcellular localization of KIAA0319. HeLa cells were transfected with constructs expressing either wild-type (KAv) (<italic>A</italic>â<italic>C</italic>) or mutant (KAv-Y995A) (<italic>D</italic>â<italic>F</italic>) V5-tagged full-length KIAA0319 protein. Proteins were detected with anti-V5 antibody (<italic>A</italic>, <italic>D</italic>) or by R2 antiserum internalization assays (<italic>B</italic>, <italic>E</italic>). KAv is observed on the cell surface and in internal structures, whereas KAv-Y995A is found only at the cell surface and R2 antibodies are not internalized. Internalization of transferrin-594 is unaffected by the expression of either construct demonstrating clathrin-dependent endocytosis occurs normally in both cases (<italic>C</italic>, <italic>F</italic>). <italic>b</italic>: effect of Y995A mutation on the interaction between KIAA0319 COOH-terminus and the Î¼2-subunit by Y2H analysis. Y190 yeast cells were cotransformed with either the bait vectors pAS2_KACt (wild-type bait) or pAS2_KACt-Y995A (mutated bait) and the prey plasmid encoding Î¼2 (pGADT7_Î¼2). Only yeast transformed with wild-type KACt could activate the reporter gene <italic>his</italic> and grow on media lacking histidine (assays shown in duplicate). <italic>c</italic>: effect of Y995A mutation on the interaction between KIAA0319 and the Î¼2-subunit by GST-pulldown analysis. Experiments performed as described in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Binding of Î¼2 was highly reduced with mutated KACt fragment (KACt-Y995A) compared with wild-type fragment. Ponceau staining indicates amounts of fusion protein used for the GST pulldown. Scale bars: 10 Î¼m.</p>
