        <p id="P3">Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an elevated rate of change of chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. CIN is observed in the majority of solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and elevated DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CINâ CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three novel CIN-suppressor genes (<italic>PIGN</italic> (<italic>MCD4</italic>), <italic>RKHD2</italic> (<italic>MEX3C</italic>) and <italic>ZNF516</italic> (<italic>KIAA0222</italic>)) encoded on chromosome 18q, which is subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors following CIN-suppressor gene silencing and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.</p>

    <p id="P4">Structural and numerical chromosomal instability are commonly observed together in solid tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. This co-occurrence can be experimentally induced via defective mitotic checkpoint function or chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle, or through pre-mitotic defects affecting chromosome structure, such as faulty DNA repair and replication<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying CIN in cancer remain unclear.</p>
    <p id="P5">Colorectal cancers can be broadly classified as CIN+/aneuploid or CINâ/microsatellite unstable<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. CIN+ cells displayed an increased frequency of chromosome segregation errors compared to CINâ cells (median = 38% versus 18%, p=0.0025, Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. To address whether mitotic or pre-mitotic mechanisms are responsible for these segregation errors, we analysed high resolution images of anaphases in a panel of CIN+ CRC cells. The majority of segregation errors consisted of chromosome fragments without centromeres (acentrics, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) and anaphase bridges (54-81%, median 70%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref>), indicative of structural chromosome aberrations arising through pre-mitotic defects<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In contrast, only 10-43% of segregation errors were lagging chromosomes with centromeres (median 20%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref>), suggesting that mitotic dysfunction resulting in improper chromosome attachments<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> cannot explain the majority of segregation errors in CIN+ CRC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, kinetochore distortion of lagging chromosomes (reflecting merotelic attachments<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>) was rare (0-12%, median 8% of segregation errors, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). We did not observe differences in mitotic timing, mitotic checkpoint function, sister chromatid cohesion or supernumerary centrioles between CIN+ and CINâ cells, and multipolar spindles were infrequent (0-18%, median 8%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d-i</xref>). These data suggest that mitotic dysfunction occurs at low frequency in CIN+ CRC cells and that the majority of observed chromosome segregation errors result from structural chromosome aberrations. Accordingly, 22-71% (median 36%) of CIN+ cell metaphases displayed structurally abnormal chromosomes, including acentric chromosomes, dicentric chromosomes and DNA double strand breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2j</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Next we sought a putative cause for these structural chromosome alterations. Activation of the DNA damage response has been observed in both colorectal adenomas and carcinomas<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and is thought to reflect DNA replication stress<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Pharmacological induction of replication stress in HCT-116 (CINâ) cells resulted in structural chromosome aberrations and segregation errors, 82% of which were bridges or acentric chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a-f</xref>). Importantly, numerical chromosome changes were also induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3g,h</xref>), demonstrating that replication stress can result in both structural and numerical chromosomal instability<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P7">DNA replication stress results in a number of cellular phenotypes including DNA damage in prometaphase<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, ultra-fine anaphase DNA bridges (UFBs)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and 53BP1-positive nuclear bodies in G1 cells<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3i-m</xref>). CIN+ cells displayed elevated prometaphase DNA damage (median 74% CIN+ versus 34% CINâ cells with â¥3 Î³H2AX foci, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,e</xref> (p=0.033, Mann-Whitney test)) in the absence of increased oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a-c</xref>). Î³H2AX foci were not confined to telomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>). CIN+ cells also displayed more 53BP1 nuclear bodies in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,f</xref>, p=0.028, Mann-Whitney test). Consistent with the hypothesis that replication stress may drive chromosome segregation errors in CIN+ cells, UFBs were enriched in anaphases with segregation errors compared to anaphases without segregation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d,g</xref>, p=0.00018, paired t-test).</p>
    <p id="P8">To assess DNA replication directly, DNA fibre assays were performed for two CINâ and four CIN+ cell lines, to measure progression of individual replication forks, fork stalling and asymmetry between sister replication forks. CIN+ cells displayed significantly slower fork rates relative to CINâ cell lines (0.56-0.83 kb/min compared to 1.11-1.12 kb/min, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>. Additionally, there was evidence of increased replication fork stalling and asymmetric sister fork progression in several CIN+ cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5c-e</xref>), consistent with impaired replication fork progression. These data indicate that elevated replication stress, as demonstrated using established hallmarks and direct measurement of replication fork progression, may contribute substantially to chromosome missegregation in CIN+ CRC cells.</p>
    <p id="P9">We sought a genetic basis for the elevated replication stress and chromosome segregation errors in CIN+ cells. Examining whole-exome sequencing data in colorectal tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and mutation status for 64 genes in CRC cell lines (COSMIC), revealed that the only gene mutated at significantly higher frequencies in CIN+ tumours or cell lines was <italic>TP53</italic>, which is also mutated in 13-33% of CINâ tumours and cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). Mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> are thought to be permissive for CIN rather than causative<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. These data suggest that whilst mutations in known oncogenes or tumour suppressors may contribute to replication stress in cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, these are unlikely to exclusively account for the elevated replication stress in CIN+ CRC cells. We therefore addressed whether additional genetic aberrations may contribute to CIN.</p>
    <p id="P10">We hypothesised that regions of consistent somatic copy number loss in CIN+ CRC might encode CIN-suppressor genes, loss of which could contribute to the induction of chromosome missegregation. To identify CIN-specific regions of loss, comparative genomic hybridisation data (CGH) was analysed for a cohort of 26 aneuploid colorectal tumours and 20 CIN+ cell lines. Chromosome 18q was most frequently subject to copy number loss, observed in 88% of aneuploid tumours and 80% of CIN+ cell lines, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) consistent with published studies in CRC and other tumour types<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Copy number losses in CIN+ tumours and cell lines were highly concordant (p&lt;0.001, Fisherâs exact test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Next we examined the temporal sequence and consequences of 18q copy number loss in tumours. In a cohort of 28 adenomas (preinvasive tumour) with carcinoma in the same specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), 18q loss of heterozygosity (LOH - indicative of copy number loss) was observed in 21/28 (75%) carcinomas, compared to 10/28 (35.7%) adenomas, implicating 18q loss in the adenoma-carcinoma transition. 18q LOH was significantly associated with aneuploidy in both adenomas and carcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">To identify candidate CIN-suppressor genes encoded within regions of recurrent copy number loss, HCT-116 cells were transfected with pools of four siRNAs targeting the most frequently lost genes, present at â¤1 copy in at least 30% of CIN+ cell lines (94 genes encoded on chromosome 18q, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). After 48 hours anaphase segregation errors were quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Importantly, this approach would identify both mitotic and pre-mitotic defects. SiRNA pools inducing segregation errors to â¥3 standard deviations above the frequency in control-transfected cells were assessed in validation assays. All sequences targeting <italic>PIGN, RKHD2</italic> and <italic>ZNF516</italic> induced segregation errors and efficiently depleted mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7b-d</xref>). Additional independent siRNA sequences targeting each of the three genes also induced segregation errors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7e</xref>) and these genes were prioritised for further analysis, although we cannot exclude a contribution of other genes encoded on 18q to CIN. Of note, <italic>RKHD2</italic> is the only protein-coding gene located between two genes implicated in CRC carcinogenesis, <italic>DCC</italic> and <italic>SMAD4</italic>. Copy number loss of <italic>PIGN, RKHD2</italic> or <italic>ZNF516</italic> is observed in 85% of the 20 CIN+ cell lines and 84% of aneuploid tumours (n=103) in the independent TCGA cohort<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, with loss of all three genes in 70% of CIN+ cell lines and 79% of aneuploid tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Importantly, reduced copy number correlated significantly with reduced mRNA expression for all three genes both in the TCGA tumour cohort and CRC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">We next ensured off-target siRNA effects reported against MAD2 (mitotic checkpoint protein) and RAD51 (DNA repair protein), were not causing chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8b-e</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Two RKHD2 sequences partially depleted MAD2 protein, and were excluded from further analysis. Additionally, expression of exogenous RKHD2-GFP rescued segregation errors induced upon silencing endogenous RKHD2 using a 3â² UTR-targeted siRNA, and expression of siRNA-resistant PIGN-GFP and ZNF516-GFP reduced segregation errors induced by depletion of endogenous PIGN or ZNF516 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8f</xref>). Silencing each CIN-suppressor also induced segregation errors in two additional CINâ CRC cell lines, DLD1 and RKO, and in 18q-normal CIN+ NCIH508 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9a-c</xref>). Induction of segregation errors was independent of oncogenic KRAS signalling in HCT-116 cells, as segregation errors were also induced following CIN-suppressor gene silencing in a <italic>KRAS</italic> wild-type isogenic cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P13">CIN-suppressor gene silencing in HCT-116 cells primarily induced acentric chromosomes and anaphase bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) in the absence of gross mitotic defects (data not shown), similar to observations in CIN+ CRC cell lines with 18q loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). This suggested a pre-mitotic origin for these chromosome segregation errors and accordingly, we observed an increased frequency of structurally abnormal chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). To assess chromosome non-disjunction, HCT-116 cell lines stably expressing small-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were constructed. shRNA-mediated silencing of each CIN-suppressor gene increased segregation error frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>), and single cell clones grown from each cell line displayed significantly increased intra-colony deviation for chromosomes 2 and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10c</xref>), indicating that CIN-suppressor gene silencing induces both structural and numerical instability.</p>
    <p id="P14">We next examined replication stress following CIN-suppressor gene silencing. Elevated prometaphase DNA damage was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>), and this increased concomitantly with, rather than after, the rise in segregation error frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10d</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the observed DNA damage reflects a cause, rather than a consequence, of segregation errors. Silencing each CIN-suppressor gene also resulted in elevated 53BP1 bodies in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>), which were unaffected by cytokinesis-inhibition, and therefore unlikely to reflect cytokinesis-induced chromosome damage<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 10e-g</xref>). Silencing PIGN and ZNF516 also significantly increased the frequency of UFBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>). Consistent with loss of CIN-suppressor genes contributing to replication stress in CIN+ cells, transient co-expression of PIGN, RKHD2 and ZNF516 resulted in a partial reduction in G1 53BP1 bodies in 3 CIN+ cell lines with 18q loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 11a-d</xref>). DNA fibre assays revealed a shift in distribution towards reduced replication fork speeds upon silencing each of the CIN-suppressor genes in HCT-116 cells, with reduced average fork rates after silencing PIGN and ZNF516 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12a,b</xref>). Furthermore, we observed increased sister fork asymmetry after silencing each of the three genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12c</xref>) consistent with impaired replication fork progression.</p>
    <p id="P15">These data suggest that segregation errors resulting from CIN-suppressor gene silencing are driven by replication stress. To further test this hypothesis, HCT-116 cells transfected with siRNAs against CIN-suppressor genes were supplemented with nucleosides, previously shown to reduce replication-induced DNA damage<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Nucleosides significantly reduced the induction of segregation errors following silencing of PIGN (62% to 32%), RKHD2 (57% to 36%) and ZNF516 (43% to 34%) whilst control segregation errors were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). We then tested whether nucleoside supplementation could attenuate chromosome missegregation in CIN+ cell lines with 18q loss. Nucleoside supplementation significantly reduced segregation error frequency by 45-55% and attenuated prometaphase DNA damage by 28-43% in four CIN+ cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>), indicating suppression of replication-induced DNA damage and subsequent chromosome missegregation. The extent of the nucleoside-mediated reduction in segregation errors implies that <italic>de novo</italic> generation of structural chromosome aberrations is responsible for a large proportion of chromosome missegregation events in CIN+ cells. In contrast, nucleoside supplementation did not affect segregation error frequency in four CINâ cell lines or 18q-normal CIN+ NCIH508 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13b,c</xref>). Nucleoside supplementation did not affect proliferation, cell cycle distribution, or cellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 14a-f</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P16">In conclusion, our findings implicate replication stress as a major driver of chromosomal instability in CRC. In addition to impaired replication fork progression, CIN+ cells exhibit replication stress-associated DNA damage and structurally abnormal chromosomes that missegregate during mitosis, linking structural and numerical instability. Supplementing CIN+ cells with nucleosides reduced both DNA damage and segregation errors, supporting a direct role for replication stress in driving CIN. Given the complex nature of replication stress and CIN, it is likely that there are multiple genetic aberrations contributing to these phenotypes within an individual tumour. Here, we suggest a putative genetic mechanism that may contribute to CIN in CRC, through the recurrent loss of a region on chromosome 18q, encoding three newly identified suppressors of replication stress and chromosome missegregation. The loss of chromosome 18q in many solid tumour types suggests the potential contribution of this locus to CIN in tumours beyond CRC. Furthermore, reports of DNA replication stress across multiple tumour types suggest replication stress may be a common route to CIN and intratumour heterogeneity<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Efforts to target or restrain replication stress may therefore provide a rational approach to limit tumour diversity, genome evolution and adaptation.</p>

The parameter <italic>s(i)</italic> defines the region-specific standard deviation<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In contrast to a standard two-sample t-statistic, SAM includes an additional parameter s<sub>0</sub>, which decreases the influence of high sample variance. This was empirically set to 0.5, resulting in a balanced weighting of frequency and amplitude. To detect significant regions, we randomly permuted (N = 10000) SNP probes for each sample separately. To save computation time, we randomly drew copy numbers for each sample, setting the probability for a given copy number to the percentage of SNP probes showing this copy number level across the genome. For each tested region, p-values were estimated by counting the percentage of permutation d-scores greater or equal than the observed d-score. To adjust for multiple testing, q-values were estimated with the R-package <italic>qvalue</italic> and genes with q&lt;0.25 were called significant. To ensure selection of genes consistently altered across CIN+ cell lines, genomic changes not seen in â¥50% of cell lines were excluded from further analysis. Genes were then mapped to regions using the R package biomaRt<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. All genes present at â¤1 copies in â¥30% of CIN+ cell lines, and no more than 1 CINâ cell line, were selected for functional investigation.</p>

        <title>Carcinoma-in-adenoma samples</title>
        <p id="P36">20 archival FFPE tumours showing adjacent but discrete colorectal carcinoma and adenoma were identified. Samples and records were used in accordance with UK research ethics approval (MREC06/Q1702/99). H&amp;E slides of the samples were reviewed, regions marked as normal (if present)/adenoma/carcinoma. and used as a guide to take tissue from each region from unstained slides by needle microdissection. DNA was extracted with standard proteinase K digestion, and purified (DNeasy kit - Qiagen). Ploidy analysis was performed using automated image-based cytometry (Fairfield Imaging, Nottingham, UK) as previously described<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. <underline>LOH analysis</underline>: <italic>SNP arrays</italic>: The Illumina Sentrix Beadarray human linkage mapping panel version IVb was used according to the Goldengate genotyping assay instructions (Illumina, San Diego, USA). DNA was amplified, fragmented and hybridized to the Beadchip, followed by single-base extension. Beadchips were stained, dried and scanned using a Beadarray reader (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Image data were visualised using Genomestudio (Illumina, San Diego, USA). All samples had call rates above 0.97. Adenomas and carcinomas were marked as having LOH or no LOH in 18q according to the absence or presence of heterozygous alleles respectively. <italic>LOH analysis using microsatellites</italic><bold>:</bold> Standard PCR conditions were used with the forward primer fluorescently labelled with HEX or FAM. At each marker, LOH was considered present when a peak area in the adenoma or the carcinoma was reduced to 50% of the other allele, relative to the normal paired DNA. Up to 5 microsatellites in 18q21 (D18S46, D18S1110, D18S35, D18S69 and D18S1407) were analysed. All PCRs were performed twice and all samples analysed with SNP arrays had concordant results.</p>
