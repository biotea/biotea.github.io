      <abstract>
        <p>Homo sapiens J domain protein (HSJ1) is a J-domain containing co-chaperone that is known to stimulate ATPase activity of HSP70 chaperone, while it also harbors two ubiquitin (Ub)-interacting motifs (UIMs) that may bind with ubiquitinated substrates and potentially function in protein degradation. We studied the effects of HSJ1a on the protein levels of both normal and the diseaseârelated polyQ-expanded forms of ataxin-3 (Atx3) in cells. The results demonstrate that the N-terminal J-domain and the C-terminal UIM domain of HSJ1a exert opposite functions in regulating the protein level of cellular overexpressed Atx3. This dual regulation is dependent on the binding of the J-domain with HSP70, and the UIM domain with polyUb chains. The J-domain down-regulates the protein level of Atx3 through HSP70 mediated proteasomal degradation, while the UIM domain may alleviate this process via maintaining the ubiquitinated Atx3. We propose that co-chaperone HSJ1a orchestrates the balance of substrates in stressed cells in a <italic>Yin-Yang</italic> manner.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The homeostasis of proteins is vital to the physiological activities and health of eukaryotic cells <xref rid="pone.0019763-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Balch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which is influenced by many intrinsic and environmental factors. Besides synthesis, protein folding and degradation are the two major post-translational factors to maintain this particular process <xref rid="pone.0019763-Buchberger1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, many reasons endogenously or exogenously, such as gene mutation, protein overexpression and dislocation, or chemical stresses, can cause protein misfolding or aberrant degradation <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chiti1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Douglas1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Malgaroli1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For a protein, the failure to refold to its native state or to be eliminated for recycling often leads to protein aggregation, dysfunction, and ultimately cell death, which is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxias <xref rid="pone.0019763-Douglas1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Malgaroli1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Stefani1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A histopathological hallmark of these diseases is that the misfolded proteins form neuronal intracellular inclusions. Many pathological polyglutamine (polyQ) containing inclusions have been found to be co-localized with HSP70 and its co-chaperones, ubiquitin (Ub) and proteasome subunits <xref rid="pone.0019763-Cummings1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Stenoien1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Wyttenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Overexpression of HSP70 and its co-chaperone can reduce inclusion formation and suppress the cell death <xref rid="pone.0019763-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Barral1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These findings suggest that molecular chaperones and the Ub-proteasome system (UPS) are contributable to refold or eliminate the misfolded proteins before their aggregation <xref rid="pone.0019763-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Combination of these functions plays a central role in the cellular stress response to maintain protein homeostasis in eukaryotes <xref rid="pone.0019763-Arndt1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Bukau1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Taipale1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been well studied that molecular chaperones and their co-chaperones work together to regulate diverse cell activities including protein folding, transportation and degradation <xref rid="pone.0019763-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Among the various co-chaperones, the J-domain (JD) containing proteins (J proteins) are the most popular. There are at least 50 J proteins encoded by the human genome <xref rid="pone.0019763-Kampinga1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Homo sapiens J domain protein (HSJ1), also called DNAJB2, is a JD-containing co-chaperone and preferentially expressed in neural tissues <xref rid="pone.0019763-Cheetham1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There are two alternatively spliced isoforms identified, HSJ1a and HSJ1b. HSJ1a has been reported to function in regulating the ATPase activity of HSP70 and substrate binding <xref rid="pone.0019763-Cheetham2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Besides the conserved J-domain, HSJ1a also harbors two Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs), which make it a special co-chaperone implicated in linking the molecular chaperone and ubiquitination associated degradation <xref rid="pone.0019763-Arndt1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Esser1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Ataxin-3 (Atx3) is a well known polyQ-containing protein; abnormal expansion of the polyQ tract is responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or MachadoâJoseph disease <xref rid="pone.0019763-Kawaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Haberhausen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. There are literatures reported that overexpression of polyQ-expanded Atx3 may cause heat shock response, and some chaperones and co-chaperones function in orchestrating the protein levels and cellular toxicity of polyQ-expanded Atx3 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jana1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For example, HSP40 and HSP70 were reported to localize in the intranuclear aggregates formed by mutant ataxin-3 and that overexpression of HSP40 reduces aggregation of truncated and full-length Atx3 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this research, we applied exogenous overexpressed Atx3, normal with 22 glutamines (Atx3<sub>22Q</sub>) or polyQ expanded (Atx3<sub>71Q</sub>), to mimic the high protein level of Atx3 in cells and to investigate the function of HSJ1a in cell stress response through potential cooperation between HSP70 chaperone and ubiquitination associated degradation. We found that HSJ1a can dually regulate the proteasomal degradation of the cellular overexpressed Atx3 through maintaining a balance between HSP70 binding and Ub binding. A schematic model for <italic>Yin-Yang</italic> regulating the substrate level by co-chaperones in stressed eukaryotic cells is also proposed and discussed.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a dually regulates the protein level of Atx3</title>
        <p>HSJ1a is a co-chaperone that was reported to interact with HSP70 and regulate its chaperoning activities <xref rid="pone.0019763-Cheetham2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is predominantly comprised of an N-terminal HSP70-binding J-domain (JD) and two putative Ub-interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To get insights into the possible mechanism underlying that HSJ1a regulates cellular metabolism and affects the protein level of Atx3, we focused the research on the protein level of Atx3 in cellular models by Western blotting and microscopic imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). As a result, HSJ1a can slightly increase the protein level of normal Atx3 (Atx3<sub>22Q</sub>) as compared with the mock vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1B &amp; 1C</xref>), suggesting that HSJ1a may have regulatory function on the fate of Atx3 via some yet unidentified pathways. To address this issue, we prepared two HSJ1a fragments, JD (residues 1-91) and JD-deletion (ÎJD, 91-274), respectively (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Co-expression with the JD fragment dramatically decreases the protein level of Atx3 to an undetectable extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1B &amp; 1C</xref>). On the other hand, co-expression with the ÎJD fragment largely increases the level of Atx3. Confocal microscopic imaging exhibits that the JD fragment of HSJ1a can almost eliminate cellular Atx3, whereas the ÎJD fragment significantly increase the Atx3 amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results demonstrate that HSJ1a dually regulates the steady state of Atx3 level through both the J-domain that decreases the Atx3 amount and the UIM domain that increases it.</p>

        <p>To get information whether the change of Atx3 amount caused by HSJ1a or its fragments in cells is due to the different protein expression efficiency, we examined the transcriptional levels of the constructs by measuring the mRNA amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). Although the mRNA amount of Atx3 exhibits a slight increase in the presence of the JD fragment as compared with others, the difference in mRNA levels cannot account for the remarkable decrease of Atx3 amount caused by the J-domain.</p>

        <title>Chaperone binding is important for the function of the J-domain</title>
        <p>Since HSJ1a dually regulates the protein level of Atx3 by harboring two functional domains, we explored whether this dual regulation is dependent on the binding to chaperone or Ub. The physical interaction between HSJ1 and HSP70 has been studied <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0019763-Cheetham2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Schnaider1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our study indicates that the J-domain of HSJ1a is sufficient to bind with HSP70 (data not shown). The binding site of HSP70 on the J-domain has been well defined to the conserved HPD tripeptide <xref rid="pone.0019763-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Greene1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We replaced the HPD site with QPN on the J-domain of HSJ1a (hereafter referred to JD<sup>mut</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). GST pull-down experiment shows that this mutation disrupts the interaction between HSJ1a and HSP70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast to the wild-type J-domain, JD<sup>mut</sup> loses the ability to reduce the protein level of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lane 4). Moreover, co-expression of JD with Atx3 decreases the amount of Atx3 at a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g002">Fig. 2C &amp; 2D</xref>). However, JD<sup>mut</sup> without HPD site largely weakens this reducing effect. This means that interaction between the J-domain and HSP70 chaperone is essential for the HSJ1a functionality. Then, we generated the same HPD-to-QPN mutation on full-length HSJ1a (referred HSJ1a-JD<sup>mut</sup>). In comparison with JD<sup>mut</sup>, this HSJ1a mutant also loses the ability to reduce the Atx3 amount in cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lane 3), which exhibits similar effect with the ÎJD fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the regulatory function of the J-domain on Atx3 level is dependent on its specific interaction with the HSP70 chaperone.</p>

        <title>Ub binding is important for the function of the UIM domain</title>
        <p>Next, we tested whether the increased level of Atx3 by HSJ1a is dependent on the interaction between the UIM domain and Ub chains. The C-terminal UIM domain of HSJ1a contains two UIM motifs (UIM12, residues 206-272) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We studied the interaction of UIM12 with isopeptide-linked diUb chains <italic>in vitro</italic> by using biophysical techniques. The data from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) shows that UIM12 binds to K48-diUb with a higher affinity than to K63-diUb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s002">Fig. S2A &amp; S2B</xref>). NMR titration indicates that the second UIM (UIM2) is more important than the first UIM (UIM1) for binding with K48- or K63-diUb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s002">Fig. S2C, S2D &amp; S2E</xref>), which is consistent with the previous report <xref rid="pone.0019763-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Then we substituted the two conserved Ser and Glu residues with Ala in each UIM in the context of full-length HSJ1a (referred to HSJ1a-UIM<sup>mut</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Co-IP experiment shows that this mutation significantly disrupts the interaction with polyUb chains in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s002">Fig. S2F</xref>). The UIM mutation indeed abolishes the increasing effect of HSJ1a on the protein level of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lane 4), exhibiting similar effect with the JD fragment that significantly decreases the level of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). These effects on the Atx3 levels are also confirmed by the experiments under an HSJ1a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Immuno-fluorescence imaging also directly shows that HSJ1a-JD<sup>mut</sup> significantly increases the protein level of Atx3, whereas HSJ1a-UIM<sup>mut</sup> considerably decreases it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results clearly indicate that regulation of Atx3 by HSJ1a is somehow related to the binding of its C-terminal UIM domain to Ub chains.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a regulates degradation of Atx3 through a proteasome pathway</title>
        <p>Since regulation of Atx3 by HSJ1a is not possibly related to the transcriptional way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), the fluctuation in the Atx3 amount is somehow associated with the degradation that may be modulated by HSJ1a. Previous studies indicate that Atx3 is degraded by the Ub-proteasome pathway <xref rid="pone.0019763-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We examined whether the J-domain of HSJ1a promotes the degradation of Atx3 through a proteasome or lysosome pathway. We treated the HEK 293T cells that overexpress Atx3 and HSJ1a-UIM<sup>mut</sup> with a proteasome or lysosome inhibitor, and then examined the Atx3 levels of the cell lysates. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystine, the Atx3 level is recovered to that as the control vector only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, the lysosome inhibitor, ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) has only a slight influence on the Atx3 level, similar to non-treatment of the cells. In the cells transfected with Atx3 and HSJ1a or HSJ1a-UIM<sup>mut</sup>, inhibition of proteasome activity by MG132 results in a remarkable accumulation of Atx3 as in the case of mock vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g004">Fig. 4B &amp; 4C</xref>). However, proteasome inhibition has no considerable effect on the amount of Atx3 when the cells were transfected with Atx3 and HSJ1a-JD<sup>mut</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), because HSJ1a-JD<sup>mut</sup> has exerted the effect on accumulating Atx3 protein to a saturation before the proteasome activity being inhibited. Thus we propose that the degradation of Atx3 modulated by HSJ1a may undergo through a proteasome pathway.</p>

        <p>As known, ubiquitination of a protein substrate is required for its proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0019763-Hershko1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Hochstrasser1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, thus the degradation of Atx3 modulated by HSJ1a may also be associated with ubiquitination of Atx3. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected Atx3 and HSJ1a or its mutants into HEK 293T cells, treated the cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132, and then detected the ubiquitination level of Atx3 by co-immunoprecipitation. As a result, both HSJ1a and HSJ1a-JD<sup>mut</sup> can promote accumulation of the ubiquitinated Atx3 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>), as compared with the mock vector. However, the HSJ1a-UIM<sup>mut</sup> loses the ability to accumulate the ubiquitinated Atx3, which can only be detected in the presence of MG132. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HSJ1a down-regulates the degradation of Atx3 through accumulating the ubiquitinated Atx3 involved in the Ub-proteasome pathway.</p>
        <p>Since Atx3 itself also harbors two UIM motifs near the polyQ region that may also recruit ubiquitinated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), there is still a possibility that the ubiquitinated proteins we have observed in the gels are not Atx3 itself but other substrates. To exclude this possibility, we prepared some mutations in the UIM region of Atx3 (S236A/S256A, Atx3-UIM<sup>mut</sup>) to disrupt its binding with Ub chains <xref rid="pone.0019763-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The results show that HSJ1a exerts the similar effect on the UIM mutant of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the UIM domain of HSJ1a plays an important role in protecting the ubiquitinated Atx3 from proteasomal degradation.</p>

        <title>Atx3 is a substrate of HSP70-mediated proteasomal degradation</title>
        <p>As the J-domain binds with HSP70 chaperone and promotes degradation of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), it is most likely that HSJ1a regulates the Atx3 level though an HSP70-mediated degradation pathway. It has been established that HSP70 and its co-chaperones regulate the proteasomal degradation of some short-lived or aberrant proteins, such as polyQ-containing proteins <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Bercovich1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. To investigate whether HSP70 is a direct mediator for degradation of Atx3 modulated by HSJ1a, we treated the cells with ATPase inhibitors of HSP70 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jinwal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. As shown, Azure C treatment does lead to a significant increase of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Methylene blue (MB), another HSP70 inhibitor proved to inhibit the ATPase activity and to regulate degradation of polyQ-containing proteins <xref rid="pone.0019763-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, has the similar effect on the Atx3 amount (data not shown).

Similar to inhibition of proteasome, inhibition of the HSP70 activity results in a significant accumulation of Atx3 when co-transfected with mock vector, HSJ1a or HSJ1a-UIM<sup>mut</sup>, but it has no such effect on the cells co-transfected with HSJ1a-JD<sup>mut</sup>, a mutant with co-chaperone deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g005">Fig. 5B &amp; 5C</xref>).

        <title>CHIP is also involved in the HSJ1a-modulated degradation of Atx3</title>
        <p>CHIP is an E3 or E4 ligase for ubiquitination; its TPR domain can interact with the C-terminal EEVD motif of HSP70 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Murata1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Scheufler1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

It was previously reported that overexpression of CHIP increases the ubiquitination and degradation rates of polyQ-expanded Atx3, which is also enhanced by HSP70 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jana1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This indicates that Atx3 is a potential substrate of HSP70. Indeed, our data show that overexpression of HSP70 or CHIP leads to the up-regulation of the ubiquitination level and down-regulation of the Atx3 level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Without HSP70, CHIP can ubiquitinate Atx3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but with a rather low efficiency. Interestingly, HSP70 can dramatically enhance the ubiquitination efficiency of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Deletion of the CHIP-binding motif in the C-terminus of HSP70 (HSP70-631 or HSP70-610, residues 1-631 or 1-610) results in loss of the ability of CHIP as an E3 ligase to promote ubiquitination of Atx3. Besides HSP70, HSP90 is another chaperone also harboring an EEVD motif for CHIP binding. However, HSP90 has no such effect on promoting ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Actually, HSJ1a is prior to binding with HSP70 when both chaperones are present in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), even though HSJ1a can interact with HSP70 and HSP90, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0019763-Schnaider1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. These results suggest that down-regulation of the Atx3 level by the J-domain of HSJ1a is mediated by HSP70 rather than HSP90. Next, we tested whether HSJ1a, CHIP, HSP70 and Atx3 can form a complex in cells. We overexpressed FLAG-Atx3, HA-HSP70 and Myc-HSJ1a or Myc-CHIP in HEK 293T cells for co-IP experiments. The data show that HSJ1a can precipitate both HSP70 and Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), while CHIP can also precipitate HSP70 but a trace amount of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). This may be attributable to the quantitative difference and transient interaction between the substrates and E3 ligase. A reverse co-IP experiment shows that a considerable amount of CHIP can be precipitated by Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). These results provide a possibility that HSP70 and its co-chaperones, HSJ1a and CHIP, work together to regulate the degradation of Atx3.</p>

        <p>Although our data show that CHIP may associate with Atx3 to ubiquitinate Atx3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we still wonder whether CHIP is directly involved in the degradation of Atx3. We thus knocked down CHIP expression by using siRNA in HEK293T cells. As a result, silencing of CHIP significantly increases the amount of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>), suggesting that CHIP may down-regulate the Atx3 level. Next we examined whether CHIP regulates Atx3 through HSJ1a. When co-transfected with HSJ1a or its mutants, the amount of Atx3 increases in the context of CHIP silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> panel). A decrease of the ubiquitinated conjugates precipitated by Atx3 is also observed as compared with the siRNA control (1<sup>st</sup> panel).

As mentioned above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), Atx3-UIM<sup>mut</sup> loses the potential to bind with polyUb chains, so the ubiquitinated conjugates precipitated by this mutant are mostly the ubiquitinated form of Atx3. Indeed, the amount of the ubiquitinated conjugates, which was maintained by HSJ1a, was significantly reduced when CHIP silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6G</xref>).

        <title>Overexpression of Atx3 and cell stress response</title>
        <p>In eukaryotic cells, the amount of a protein must be maintained to a relatively stable level by diverse regulatory processes. Loss of this regulation may cause protein accumulation and even abnormal aggregation or inclusion formation, and consequently lead to stress response <xref rid="pone.0019763-Balch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Morimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It was previously reported that overexpression of abnormal Atx3 can evoke a stress response in cells as manifested by marked induction of HSP70 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The overexpressed Atx3 may cause a proteotoxic stress in cells and it will be eliminated (or refolded) by HSP70 chaperone machinery. Thus, it is very important for a cell to respond the overexpression stress. Molecular chaperones such as HSP70 may act as a sensor of the abnormal proteins by recognize the misfolded or aggregated proteins <xref rid="pone.0019763-Balch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The data from our study and other literatures implicate that the overexpressed Atx3 is a potential substrate of HSP70 and thus orchestrated by HSJ1a <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jana1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, HSJ1a cannot regulate the endogenous Atx3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s008">Fig. S8</xref>), possibly because Atx3 with normal amount is correctly folded that cannot be censored by HSP70. Thus, we propose that HSP70 is a key molecular factor to censor the overexpressed Atx3 and trigger the cell stress response.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a binds HSP70 and promotes proteasomal degradation of Atx3</title>
        <p>HSJ1a is a J-domain containing co-chaperone of HSP70 that binds with HSP70 and stimulates its ATPase activity for modulating its functionality <xref rid="pone.0019763-Cheetham2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Molecular chaperones and their co-chaperones, such as HSP70, HSP40 and CHIP, may function in modulating aggregation, cytotoxicity, and disease onset in polyQ diseases <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jana1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Fei1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Zijlstra1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Recently, HSP70 and CHIP have been proposed to regulate the proteasomal degradation of polyQ-expanded proteins including Atx3 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Jana1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019763-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Our studies both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell model demonstrate that the N-terminal J-domain of HSJ1a binds HSP70 and enhances proteasomal degradation of Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g003">Fig. 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g007">7</xref>). HSP70 dramatically promotes the ubiquitination efficiency of overexpressed Atx3 in the presence of CHIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), while inhibition of the ATPase activity of HSP70 as well as proteasome significantly accumulates the ubiquitinated Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g004">Fig. 4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g007">7</xref>). Therefore, the overexpressed Atx3, whether it is normal or polyQ expanded, is an HSP70 client and subsequently the substrate of HSP70-assisted proteasomal degradation. As a co-chaperone of HSP70, HSJ1a functions as a modulator to regulate this process.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a binds ubiquitinated Atx3 and retards its degradation</title>
        <p>HSJ1a also harbors two UIM motifs that may function in binding with Ub chains or ubiquitinated substrates. Our observation indicates that the UIM domain of HSJ1a can accumulate the ubiquitinated Atx3 and impede it from proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g005">5</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g007">7</xref>). This is generally consistent with the previous observation that HSJ1a can accumulate ubiquitinated proteins <xref rid="pone.0019763-Howarth1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. As known, the J-domain of HSJ1a rather than the UIM domain exerts a function down-regulating the protein level of Atx3. The UIM domain of HSJ1a actually finely decelerates the degradation process by accumulating the ubiquitinated Atx3.</p>
        <p>It was reported that HSJ1a can stimulate CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Raf-1, and the UIM domain is not responsible for this stimulation <xref rid="pone.0019763-Westhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> study indicates that HSJ1a can inhibit the CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Atx3 depending on the UIM domain, whereas the J-domain cannot promote the process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019763.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). It is possible that the J-domain of HSJ1a enhances the degradation of Atx3 through assisting release of the ubiquitinated Atx3 from the HSP70-CHIP complex, instead of promoting its ubiquitination. The UIM domain may prevent the degradation of Atx3 through binding with the ubiquitinated Atx3 and inhibiting its further ubiquitination in cells.</p>

        <title>HSJ1a is a dual regulator of the cellular Atx3 level</title>
        <p>One of the important issues involved in HSP70-assisted proteasomal degradation is that how a chaperone cooperates with UPS. Actually, it is the co-chaperones that act as bridges to link these two systems. Among the diverse co-chaperones of HSP70 yet identified, several proteins harbor both chaperone and Ub related domains <xref rid="pone.0019763-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Besides HSJ1 (JD-UIM) in this study, these proteins include BAG-1 (BAG-UbL) <xref rid="pone.0019763-Luders1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, BAG-6/BAT3 (UbL-BAG) <xref rid="pone.0019763-Minami1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, Sacsin (JD-UbL) <xref rid="pone.0019763-Parfitt1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, and the well-characterized CHIP (TPR-Ubox) <xref rid="pone.0019763-McDonough1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. These co-chaperones have great potential to play important roles in the protein quality control processes through linking the chaperone system and UPS. In this study, we demonstrate that co-chaperone HSJ1a can dually regulate degradation of Atx3, and even eliminate the inclusion bodies formed by polyQ expanded Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) and another polyQ disease-related protein Atx7 (data not shown) in cells. The J-domain and the UIM domain play distinct roles in this particular process. Interestingly, the increasing level of polyQ-expanded Atx3 caused by the ÎJD fragment does not result in an increase of the inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>).</p>

        <title>HSJ1a regulates the Atx3 level in a <italic>Yin-Yang</italic> manner</title>
        <p>Our findings demonstrate that the N-terminal J-domain of HSJ1a promotes proteasomal degradation of Atx3, whereas the C-terminal UIM domain alleviates the degradation. In this regard, HSJ1a may exert a role deciding whether a chaperone client to be degraded in proteasome or to be stayed in its ubiquitinated form <xref rid="pone.0019763-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, we propose that HSJ1a dually regulates the protein level of Atx3 in stressed cells in a <italic>Yin-Yang</italic> manner, no matter it is normal or polyQ expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019763-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). In this model, the chaperone HSP70 recruits the E3 ligase CHIP to ubiquitinate Atx3, while the co-chaperone HSJ1a enhances the function of the HSP70 complex to eliminate the overexpressed substrate. The J-domain of HSJ1a binds with HSP70 to promote the chaperone-assisted proteasomal degradation of the substrate, as in the case of HSP40 that associates with HSP70 to reduce aggregation of Atx3 <xref rid="pone.0019763-Chai1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, HSJ1a can also impede the proteasomal degradation of the ubiquitinated Atx3 to maintain the protein level when needed. The UIM domain of HSJ1a may bind with and stabilize the ubiquitinated Atx3, so as to protect it from degradation. These two distinct processes make HSJ1a a dual regulator to maintain the homeostasis of Atx3 molecules. Impairment of the protein homeostasis may cause a pathogenic phenotype, for example formation of inclusion bodies <xref rid="pone.0019763-Balch1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Thus, finely modulating the balance of the functions of two HSJ1a domains could be considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0019763-Powers1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>

            <p>This model proposes that HSJ1a acts like a balance orchestrating the cellular level of Atx3. The J-domain promotes the proteasomal degradation of Atx3 through HSP70 binding, whereas the UIM domain retards the proteasomal degradation of Atx3 through ubiquitin binding. HSP70 acts as an adaptor to recruit co-chaperones and the substrates.</p>
