      <abstract>
        <p>The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) mediates sorting of lysosomal hydrolase precursors from the TGN to endosomes. After releasing the hydrolase precursors into the endosomal lumen, the unoccupied receptor returns to the TGN for further rounds of sorting. Here, we show that the mammalian retromer complex participates in this retrieval pathway. The hVps35 subunit of retromer interacts with the cytosolic domain of the CI-MPR. This interaction probably occurs in an endosomal compartment, where most of the retromer is localized. In particular, retromer is associated with tubularâvesicular profiles that emanate from early endosomes or from intermediates in the maturation from early to late endosomes. Depletion of retromer by RNA interference increases the lysosomal turnover of the CI-MPR, decreases cellular levels of lysosomal hydrolases, and causes swelling of lysosomes. These observations indicate that retromer prevents the delivery of the CI-MPR to lysosomes, probably by sequestration into endosome-derived tubules from where the receptor returns to the TGN.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Like other basic cellular processes, the mechanisms by which newly synthesized acidic hydrolases are sorted to the yeast vacuole and the mammalian lysosome are evolutionarily conserved. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, this sorting is initiated by the binding of soluble hydrolase precursors such as pro-carboxypeptidase Y and pro-proteinase A to the transmembrane receptor Vps10p in the late Golgi complex (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Marcusson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cooper and Stevens, 1996</xref>). The hydrolaseâVps10p complexes are then transported to a late endosomal or prevacuolar compartment by a process that is at least partially dependent on the coat proteins, clathrin (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Seeger and Payne, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Deloche et al., 2001</xref>), Golgi-localized, Î³ earâcontaining ARF-binding proteins (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dell'Angelica et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Costaguta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Mullins and Bonifacino, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Zhdankina et al., 2001</xref>), and AP-1 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Costaguta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2001</xref>). The acidic environment of the prevacuolar compartment induces dissociation of the hydrolaseâVps10p complexes, after which the hydrolases are transported to the vacuole and the pro sequences are removed by proteolytic cleavage, while Vps10p returns to the late Golgi complex to mediate further rounds of sorting (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cooper and Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>). Emr and colleagues demonstrated that Vps10p retrieval is mediated by a heteropentameric complex named âretromerâ (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>). The yeast retromer comprises five cytosolic/peripheral membrane proteins termed Vps5p, Vps17p, Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>). Vps35p recognizes the cytosolic domain of Vps10p and forms a stable subcomplex with Vps29p (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Nothwehr et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Vps5p and Vps17p contain Phox homology domains that bind phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, and interact with one another to form another stable subcomplex. This Vps5pâVps17p subcomplex has a tendency to oligomerize and has therefore been proposed to serve as a scaffold for the assembly of a putative membrane coat that drives vesicle formation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Horazdovsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Seaman and Williams, 2002</xref>). Finally, Vps26p has been proposed to promote the assembly of the cargo-selective Vps35pâVps29p subcomplex with the structural Vps5pâVps17p subcomplex (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Reddy and Seaman, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The functional counterparts of Vps10p in mammals are two transmembrane mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), namely the cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR) and cation-independent MPR (CI-MPR; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2003</xref>). The names of these receptors derive from their ability to bind mannose 6-phosphate groups on the lysosomal hydrolase precursors in a divalent cation-dependent or -independent manner, respectively. This binding takes place at the TGN, which is the mammalian equivalent to the yeast late Golgi. The cytosolic domains of the MPRs have COOH-terminal acidic clusterâdileucine signals that bind Golgi-localized, Î³ earâcontaining ARF-binding proteins (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Takatsu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>) and other less well-characterized signals that bind AP-1 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Glickman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Mauxion et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Honing et al., 1997</xref>). These interactions are thought to cooperate in the packaging of hydrolaseâMPR complexes into clathrin-coated vesicles or pleiomorphic carriers that bud from the TGN and deliver the complexes to either early or late endosomes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Geuze et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Klumperman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Doray et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Waguri et al., 2003</xref>). As described in the previous paragraph for yeast, the hydrolaseâMPR complexes dissociate at the acidic pH of endosomes, upon which the hydrolases are carried with the fluid phase to the lysosome lumen while the MPRs recycle to the TGN. Several proteins and protein complexes have been implicated in endosome-to-TGN retrieval of MPRs in mammalian cells. Among these are the AP-1 complex (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>)âwhich thus seems to be involved in both forward and retrograde transportâand two adaptor-like proteins: tail-interacting protein of 47 kD (TIP47; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Diaz and Pfeffer, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Krise et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Orsel et al., 2000</xref>) and phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein-1 (PACS-1; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 1998</xref>). Intriguingly, mutations in yeast AP-1 alone do not impair pro-carboxypeptidase Y trafficking to the vacuole, implying normal recycling of Vps10p (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Yeung et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, TIP47 and PACS-1 have no homologues in yeast. These findings could point to either important mechanistic differences between endosome-to-TGN transport in yeast and mammals or to the existence of evolutionarily conserved components of the MPR retrieval machinery that remain to be identified.</p>
      <p>These considerations led us to hypothesize that the mammalian retromer could be involved in MPR trafficking. Indeed, structural homologues of all the yeast retromer subunits (except for Vps17p) have been identified in mammals (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Haft et al., 2000</xref>). Despite the absence of a Vps17p homologue, the mammalian retromer is also thought to comprise five subunits, namely hVps26p, hVps29p, and hVps35p (âhâ prefix designates âhumanâ), plus two Vps5p homologues, the sorting nexins 1 and 2 (Snx1 and Snx2, respectively). The subunit interactions, tendency to oligomerization, and overall structure are similar to those of the yeast retromer components (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Horazdovsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haft et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kurten et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Seaman and Williams, 2002</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the mammalian retromer has an important role in the trafficking of the CI-MPR.</p>

        <title>Interaction of the cytosolic domain of the CI-MPR with hVps35</title>
        <p>Genetic and biochemical analyses have identified Vps35p as the cargo recognition component of the yeast retromer (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Nothwehr et al., 2000</xref>). To determine whether this function is conserved in mammals, we tested for interaction of the 164-residue cytosolic domain of the CI-MPR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
A) with hVps35 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). This analysis was conducted using the LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system, which is especially suited for the detection of low affinity interactions. Colony growth assays showed that hVps35 and the CI-MPR cytosolic domain do interact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). No interactions were observed when these constructs were replaced by hVps29 or lamin C, respectively, indicating that the hVps35âCI-MPR interaction is specific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). We also did not detect interaction between the CI-MPR cytosolic domain and hVps26 (unpublished data). The determinants of interactions were mapped by testing deletion mutants of the CI-MPR cytosolic domain and hVps35. Two nonoverlapping regions comprising cytosolic domain residues 48â80 and 80â100 of the CI-MPR cytosolic domain were found to be independently sufficient for interactions with hVps35 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C), indicating the existence of two binding sites for hVps35 on the CI-MPR domain. Many amino acid substitutions within each of these regions abrogated binding (unpublished data), indicating that the binding determinants are complex and possibly conformational. Notably, the 48â100 region does not contain the YSKV sequence (residues 26â29) involved in internalization of the CI-MPR or the acidic clusterâdileucine motif (residues 153â162) implicated in its sorting at the TGN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2003</xref>). The region of hVps35 that binds to the cytosolic domain of CI-MPR was similarly mapped to the segment comprising residues 500â693 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). Thus, these experiments demonstrated an interaction between residues 48â100 of the CI-MPR cytosolic domain and residues 500â693 of hVps35.</p>

        <title>Partial colocalization of retromer and CI-MPR on endosomes</title>
        <p>The interactions described above prompted us to examine the potential involvement of retromer in CI-MPR trafficking. We started by determining the subcellular localization of endogenous retromer relative to various organellar markers, including the CI-MPR. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies to three retromer subunits, hVps26, Snx1, and Snx2, showed a similar punctate staining of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
, AâC). A 30-min treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin resulted in loss of the punctate staining for all three proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, DâF). This result was consistent with the expected requirement of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate for association of the Snx proteins to membranes (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2002</xref>). Double-labeling experiments showed that endogenous hVps26 colocalized with transgenic myc-tagged Snx2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, GâI) and with transgenic hVps35 tagged with YFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, JâL), indicating that the punctate staining observed for all of these proteins reflects the distribution of the retromer complex.</p>

        <p>Additional experiments revealed extensive colocalization of endogenous hVps26 with the transferrin receptor (TfR), an early endosomal marker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>
, AâC; arrowheads). hVps26 was also found to localize to early endosomes enlarged by expression of the constitutively active Rab5Q79L mutant (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Stenmark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, DâF). In contrast, we observed little or no colocalization of hVps26 with the TGN marker TGN46 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, GâI) or the late endosomal/lysosomal marker Lamp-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, JâL). The CI-MPR has been previously shown to distribute to the TGN and endosomes at steady state (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Geuze et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Klumperman et al., 1993</xref>). hVps26 exhibited partial colocalization with the CI-MPR, particularly in peripheral cytoplasmic foci (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, MâO; arrowheads). From these experiments, we concluded that hVps26 (and, by extension, the retromer complex) is mainly localized to endosomes, where it partially colocalizes with a peripheral population of CI-MPR.</p>

        <title>Association of retromer with tubular profiles adjacent to endosomes</title>
        <p>The localization of retromer was analyzed at higher resolution by cryo-gold immuno-EM using a pAb to hVps26. Most of the hVps26 labeling (275 out of 365 gold particles counted, or 75%) was observed in association with tubular profiles in the vicinity of organelles that had the appearance of endosomes. Some of these organelles had a relatively clear lumen, whereas others contained intraluminal vesicles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>)
. The tubules were often connected to the vacuolar portion of the organelles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>; arrows). A smaller fraction of hVps26 (90 out of 365 gold particles counted, or 25%) was found on the limiting membrane of the endosomes themselves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, AâC), in some cases concentrated at the necks of protruding tubules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, small arrowhead). The multivesicular organelles often exhibited thick, flat coats resembling the âbilayeredâ clathrin- and Hrs-containing coats previously implicated in sorting to the ubiquitinâmultivesicular body pathway (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Raposo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and C</xref>, large arrowhead). Retromer was not excluded from these bilayered coats, although it tended to concentrate on other domains of the organelle membrane adjacent to emerging tubules.</p>

        <p>To characterize these structures in more detail, we performed double labeling for hVps26 and other organellar markers. The multivesicular endosomes that contained hVps26 also labeled for the TfR, indicating that they corresponded to an early endosomal compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). The CI-MPR was found in the intraluminal vesicles of the endosomes as well as in the retromer-containing tubules emanating from these endosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>

We did not observe significant colocalization of retromer with Lamp-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B), ruling out an association of retromer with mature late endosomes and lysosomes.

        <title>In vivo dynamics of retromer-containing structures</title>
        <p>The dynamics of retromer-containing structures were examined by live imaging of M1 cells expressing YFP-hVps35 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>)
. Immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments demonstrated that YFP-hVps35 was efficiently incorporated into the retromer complex (unpublished data), and thus reflected the behavior of the complex. Indeed, the cytoplasmic punctate distribution of YFP-hVps35 was similar to that of other retromer subunits, as demonstrated by colocalization with endogenous hVps26 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, JâL). The YFP-hVps35 puncta were often adjacent to dark vacuoles that probably correspond to the vacuolar part of endosomes observed by EM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Both the fluorescent and dark structures remained tightly associated as they moved together in the cytoplasm over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A; Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312055/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312055/DC1</ext-link>). The YFP-hVps35 puncta often gave rise to long fluorescent tubules that extended in various directions, some toward the juxtanuclear area of the cell and others toward other puncta (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A; Video 1). Treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole prevented the formation of tubules (unpublished data). FRAP of the YFP-hVps35 puncta showed that this protein reassociated with the same puncta with a half-time of 6.5 Â± 0.4 s (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>). These results confirmed and extended the observations on fixed cells by demonstrating that YFP-hVps35 is dynamically associated with structures adjacent to vacuolar profiles from which tubules arise.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of retromer expression by siRNA increases lysosomal turnover of the CI-MPR</title>
        <p>Next, we sought to establish a functional connection between retromer and the CI-MPR by depleting cells of hVps26 using a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). After 72 h of treatment with this siRNA, the levels of hVps26 decreased, as observed by both immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>)
and immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> I). Quantification of the corresponding immunoblots showed that the amount of hVps26 decreased by 90 Â± 5% (<italic>n</italic> = 6).

        <p>The depletion of hVps26 had no effect on the steady-state distribution or levels of various transmembrane proteins including TGN46, the TfR, Lamp-1, and the EGF receptor (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, CâF, I, and unpublished data). It also had no apparent effect on TfR internalization and recycling, as well as on internalization and degradation of the EGF receptor, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312055/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200312055/DC1</ext-link>). However, the levels of CI-MPR were significantly reduced (to 38 Â± 21%; <italic>n</italic> = 8) in cells depleted of hVps26, as observed by both immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, G and H</xref>) and immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> I). The remaining CI-MPR exhibited a more dispersed distribution in the cytoplasm, suggesting a shift towards endosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> H). Similar results were obtained by siRNA-mediated depletion of hVps35 (Fig. S2). We reasoned that the reduction in CI-MPR levels could be due to degradation of the receptor. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cycloheximide chase experiment in which the levels of CI-MPR in mock- and siRNA-treated cells were examined at different times after inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>
A). In mock-treated cells, the receptor had a half-life of 27 h (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A; Fig. S3), which was similar to that previously reported by <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Creek and Sly (1983)</xref>. In contrast, in the siRNA-treated cells, the half-life of the CI-MPR was reduced to 7 h (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A; Fig. S3; half-lives are the mean from three determinations). To determine whether this degradation occurred in lysosomes, we incubated the siRNA-treated cells with the lysosomal inhibitors leupeptin and E64, plus or minus methionine methyl ester. We observed that these treatments prevented the decrease of CI-MPR levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B) and resulted in the accumulation of the CI-MPR in large vesicles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, CâH) that contained Lamp-1-YFP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, IâK). Together, these observations indicate that the absence of retromer causes increased delivery of the CI-MPR to lysosomes.</p>

        <p>Finally, we assessed the consequences of CI-MPR degradation on lysosomal function. The activities of Î²-hexosaminidase and Î²-glucuronidase, which are normally sorted to lysosomes by the MPRs, were reproducibly decreased by 25% in extracts of cells treated for 72 h with a single dose of hVps26 siRNA (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>
A). In contrast, aconitase activity, which is present in the cytosol and mitochondria, was not affected by depletion of hVps26 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> A). This indicated that the reductions of lysosome hydrolase activities were specific. Treatment with two doses of hVps26 siRNA at 72-h intervals (for a total of 144 h) resulted in significant loss of viability, which precluded accurate measurement of lysosomal enzyme activities. However, the cells that remained attached to the cover glasses exhibited reduced staining for cathepsin D (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, B and C</xref>), another enzyme sorted by the MPRs. In addition, we noticed swelling of the lysosomes stained for Lamp-1 in the hVps26 siRNA-treated cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, D and E</xref>), which probably resulted from accumulation of undegraded materials in lysosomes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results presented here support a role for the mammalian retromer in the retrieval of the CI-MPR from endosomes to the TGN. This role appears to involve the recognition of a bipartite determinant in the cytosolic domain of the CI-MPR (residues 48â100) by the hVps35 subunit of retromer. The retromer-binding determinant does not overlap with the YSKV signal involved in CI-MPR endocytosis (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Jadot et al., 1992</xref>) or the acidic clusterâdileucine signal responsible for sorting of the receptor from the TGN to endosomes (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Kornfeld, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In addition, the retromer-binding determinant differs from those sorting signals in that it is much longer and contains many critical residues, perhaps indicating that it is conformational in nature. We have been unable to demonstrate a similar interaction with the cytosolic domain of the CD-MPR, but we did detect an interaction with the cytosolic domain of metallocarboxypeptidase D (unpublished data), a transmembrane protein that cycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Varlamov and Fricker, 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>The hVps35âCI-MPR interactions are likely physiological because human retromer partially colocalizes with a pool of CI-MPR in vesicularâtubular structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm, though less so with a pericentriolar pool of CI-MPR. The morphology and composition of the structures where retromer colocalizes with CI-MPR correspond to those of early endosomes (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geuze et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 1991</xref>) or intermediates in the maturation of early to late endosomes (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Geuze et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>). Many of these endosomes have electron-dense deposits resembling the previously described bilayered clathrin- and Hrs-containing coats (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Raposo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>). They contain the TfR and are enlarged by expression of Rab5Q79L, but also enclose numerous intraluminal vesicles. All of these are well-established characteristics of the bilayered coated endosomes, which represent a transition from early to late endosomal stages (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Raposo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Sachse et al., 2002</xref>). Retromer is most concentrated on tubules that radiate from the vacuolar aspect of these endosomes, whereas CI-MPR appears evenly distributed between the radiating tubules and intraluminal vesicles. These observations indicate that a function of retromer may be to extract CI-MPR from endosomesâperhaps even from the intraluminal vesiclesâthrough capture into a recycling tubular compartment. Although the tubules themselves appear mobile, it is at present unclear whether they constitute the actual transport carriers or give rise to vesicular transport intermediates. The association of retromer with tubules is consistent with the presence in Snx1 and Snx2 of a BAR-like domain that has the ability to sense highly curved membranes (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Peter et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>The involvement of retromer in recycling of CI-MPR to the TGN is further supported by the phenotype elicited by siRNA-mediated interference of retromer expression. This treatment resulted in enhanced lysosomal degradation of CI-MPR and, consequently, decreased steady-state levels of this receptor. Cellular levels of lysosomal hydrolases also decreased and lysosomes swelled, probably due to accumulation of undegraded materials within their lumen. The most logical interpretation of these observations is that retromer keeps the CI-MPR from going to lysosomes by mediating its removal from maturing endosomes. We think that the CI-MPR determinant recognized by retromer might encompass a âlysosomal avoidanceâ signal functionally similar to that described by Kornfeld and colleagues in the cytosolic domain of the CD-MPR (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Rohrer et al., 1995</xref>). However, the phenylalanineâtryptophan motif that defines this signal in the CD-MPR (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Rohrer et al., 1995</xref>) is not present in the CI-MPR, indicating that the latter must be structurally different. It is noteworthy that delivery to lysosomes is the fate of the CI-MPR in the absence of retromer. This indicates that other determinants within the CI-MPR direct its targeting to lysosomes in the absence of retromer. These determinants may be responsible for inclusion of the CI-MPR into intraluminal vesicles bound for destruction in lysosomes. In this regard, the luminal domain of the CI-MPR has been shown to detain chimeric proteins in endosomes (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dintzis et al., 1994</xref>), although we do not know if this property contributes to the lysosomal degradation of the receptor in the absence of retromer.</p>
      <p>There is a general consensus that the CI-MPR and its cargo hydrolases follow an intracellular route from the TGN to the endosomalâlysosomal system (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2003</xref>). However, the initial port of entry into this system remains a matter of debate. Indeed, different reports have presented evidence for transport from the TGN to either early or late endosomes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Geuze et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Runquist and Havel, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Rijnboutt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Klumperman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Press et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Waguri et al., 2003</xref>). Although our experiments do not directly address this issue, they highlight the critical importance of passage through early endosomes or earlyâlate endosomal intermediates in the biosynthetic or endocytic trafficking of the CI-MPR, as previously proposed (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Runquist and Havel, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Rijnboutt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). Because dissociation of the lysosomal hydrolases from both the CI-MPR and CD-MPR occurs between pH 5.0 and 6.0 (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Sahagian et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Hoflack and Kornfeld, 1985</xref>), some maturation of the early endosomes must take place before the retromer can assume its role in the retrieval of the unoccupied receptors.</p>
      <p>The above considerations notwithstanding, our results do not rule out that the CI-MPRâhydrolase complexes may be delivered in part to late endosomes (i.e., those lacking TfR but containing Lamps). It is indeed possible that more than one endosomal compartment acts as the acceptor for TGN-derived carriers, or that some CI-MPR traffics from early to late endosomes prior to retrieval. Proteins such as AP-1 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), TIP47 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Diaz and Pfeffer, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Orsel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Krise et al., 2000</xref>), and PACS-1 (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 1998</xref>) could cooperate with retromer in CI-MPR recycling from early endosomes, perhaps by participating in consecutive sorting steps along the route to the TGN, or they could be involved in CI-MPR recycling from late endosomes, as previously proposed for TIP47 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Diaz and Pfeffer, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Barbero et al., 2002</xref>). The existence of distinct TGN retrieval pathways originating from early and late endosomes is well established in both mammalian (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mallet and Maxfield, 1999</xref>) and yeast (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>) cells.</p>
      <p>The alterations in lysosomal/vacuolar sorting resulting from depletion of retromer in mammalian cells (this paper) and yeast cells (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>) are remarkably similar, demonstrating the conservation of this aspect of the protein-sorting machinery. However, a review of the published work on the mammalian Snx1 and Snx2 makes our results surprising. Snx1 and Snx2 have been shown to interact with the cytosolic domains of the EGF, transferrin, and leptin receptors, and of protease-activated receptor-1 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kurten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Haft et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). In the case of the EGF receptor, interaction with Snx1 is thought to enhance its degradation in lysosomes (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kurten et al., 1996</xref>), contrary to the role of retromer in CI-MPR trafficking (this paper). A possible explanation for this difference could be that Snx1 and Snx2 are not only components of retromer, but also are subunits of other still undefined complexes involved in targeting to late endosomes and lysosomes. Resolving this issue will require a more detailed analysis of the diversity of retromer subunit assembly and function.</p>
