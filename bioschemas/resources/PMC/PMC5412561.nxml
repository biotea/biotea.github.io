      <abstract>
        <p>Autophagy-dependent clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins is critical to protein quality control, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report the essential role of the BEACH (beige and ChediakâHigashi) and WD40 repeat-containing protein WDR81 in eliminating ubiquitinated proteins through autophagy. WDR81 associates with ubiquitin (Ub)-positive protein foci, and its loss causes accumulation of Ub proteins and the autophagy cargo receptor p62. WDR81 interacts with p62, facilitating recognition of Ub proteins by p62. Furthermore, WDR81 interacts with LC3C through canonical LC3-interacting regions in the BEACH domain, promoting LC3C recruitment to ubiquitinated proteins. Inactivation of LC3C or defective autophagy results in accumulation of Ub protein aggregates enriched for WDR81. In mice, WDR81 inactivation causes accumulation of p62 bodies in cortical and striatal neurons in the brain. These data suggest that WDR81 coordinates p62 and LC3C to facilitate autophagic removal of Ub proteins, and provide important insights into CAMRQ2 syndrome, a WDR81-related developmental disorder.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein misfolding frequently occurs during the process of normal protein synthesis, and can be greatly exacerbated by cellular stresses such as heat shock, ER stress, and oxidative stress (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg, 2003</xref>). If not properly resolved, misfolded proteins can further aggregate and impair cellular functions (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kopito, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kirkin et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). Clearance of aggregated protein is thus critical to cell homeostasis, defects in which are associated with many late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsonâs disease and Huntingtonâs disease (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Rubinsztein, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Autophagy can selectively remove ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins, thus serving as a protein quality-control system (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Rubinsztein, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gamerdinger et al., 2009</xref>). Autophagic clearance of aggregated proteins, also termed âaggrephagy,â requires the recognition of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins by receptors such as p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Noda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>). p62/SQSTM1 is a general cargo receptor that preferentially binds Ub chains linked by K63 through the C-terminal Ub-associated domain (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, p62 interacts with members of the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies through an LC3-interacting region (LIR; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">BjÃ¸rkÃ¸y et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>). Because p62 recognizes a diverse range of ubiquitinated cargos and interacts with LC3 or GABARAP family members in a nonselective manner, additional receptors or scaffold/adaptor proteins cooperate with p62 to promote selective autophagy (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the Huntingtonâs disease gene-encoded Huntingtin protein interacts with p62 and functions as a scaffold that recruits ULK1 but excludes mTOR, thus promoting selective autophagy of several cargos (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rui et al., 2015</xref>). ALFY/WDFY3, a PtdIns3P-binding protein, plays an important role in aggrephagy by interacting with p62 and Atg5-12 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>). In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, EPG-7 acts as a scaffold that interacts with the p62 homologue SQST-1 and a variety of autophagy regulators to mediate clearance of aggregated proteins in embryo development (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). The cargo specificity of autophagy may be achieved by selective interaction of certain p62-interacting scaffolds or receptors with members of the LC3 or GABARAP family. For instance, NDP52 selectively interacts with LC3C to mediate bacterial autophagy (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">von Muhlinen et al., 2012</xref>). In the aggrephagy pathway, ALFY was recently found to mainly interact with GABARAP (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lystad et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the LC3 homologues LGG-1 and LGG-2 bind to distinct groups of autophagy substrates, thus playing different roles in aggrephagy (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although aggrephagy is critical to protein quality control, the mechanisms determining the selectivity of cargo recognition and autophagosome formation during aggrephagy are not fully understood. In this study, we identify WDR81, a BEACH (beige and ChediakâHigashi) domainâ and WD40-containing protein, as an essential regulator of aggrephagy. WDR81 and its <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue, SORF-2, were recently shown to function in maintaining endosomal PtdIns3P levels by forming a complex with another WD40-containing protein, WDR91 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rapiteanu et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we uncover a distinct function of WDR81 in aggrephagy. We show that WDR81 directly interacts with p62 and promotes the recognition of ubiquitinated proteins. We further demonstrate that out of the three isoforms of the autophagosome membrane protein LC3, WDR81 preferentially interacts with LC3C to facilitate the removal of ubiquitinated proteins. We provide evidence that knocking out WDR81 results in accumulation of p62 bodies in mouse brain. These findings establish WDR81 as an essential regulator of aggrephagy and provide valuable insights into CAMRQ2 syndrome, a WDR81-related neuronal disorder.</p>

        <title>Inactivation of WDR81 causes accumulation of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins</title>
        <p>Previously, we found that WDR81 partially localizes to endosomes and forms a complex with WDR91 to regulate early-to-late endosome conversion (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that a substantial proportion of WDR81 is not located on endosomes suggests that WDR81 may have other functions in addition to a role in intracellular trafficking. To explore this possibility, we examined whether WDR81 localizes to the Golgi apparatus, ER, or mitochondria. Immunostaining revealed that WDR81 does not obviously colocalize with the Golgi protein GM130 or the ER protein Sec61Î², suggesting that WDR81 does not act in the Golgi or ER (Fig. S1 A). Partial colocalization of WDR81 with MitoTracker Red staining was detected, as previously reported in mice (Fig. S1 A; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Traka et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we found that WDR81 substantially costained with ubiquitin in HeLa cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To consolidate this observation, we treated HeLa cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that induces accumulation of polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Salomons et al., 2009</xref>), or puromycin, a proteotoxin that induces premature release of polypeptide chains from ribosomes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Blobel, 1971</xref>). Both MG132 and puromycin induced formation of large Ub-positive focal structures that were enriched in WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In contrast, tunicamycin or FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone), which induces ER stress or depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential, respectively, did not induce formation of WDR81-positive foci (Fig. S1 B). These results suggest that WDR81 likely participates in a process involving ubiquitinated and misfolded proteins. To investigate this possibility, we depleted WDR81 using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and then examined the levels of Ub proteins. In HeLa cells and SH-SY5Y cells, WDR81 siRNA (si81) greatly increased the number and size of Ub protein foci compared with control siRNA (siCtrl; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Some of these Ub protein foci were also positive for p62/SQSTM1, a receptor for diverse autophagy cargoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">BjÃ¸rkÃ¸y et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, large Ub protein foci that costained with p62 were frequently observed in WDR81 knockout (KO-81) HeLa cells, but not control HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). The levels of Ub proteins and p62, as revealed by immunoblotting, were strongly elevated in si81 or KO-81 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, HâJ</xref>). The increased Ub proteins in KO-81 cells contained predominantly K63-linked Ub chains (K63-Ub), whereas the levels of Ub proteins with K48-linked Ub (K48-Ub) were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 K</xref>). Consistent with this, the MG132- or puromycin-induced WDR81 foci were mainly positive for K63-Ub but only partially costained with K48-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 L</xref>). In addition, we evaluated the effect of si81 on polyQ aggregates. In HeLa cells inducibly expressing Htt97Q-GFP, si81 significantly increased the number of polyQ foci, comparable to that caused by knocking down several major autophagy regulators, including the p62 receptor, the aggrephagy scaffold protein ALFY (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">BjÃ¸rkÃ¸y et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>), and the core autophagy factors Atg5 and Beclin1 (Fig. S2, A and B). Collectively, these findings suggest that WDR81 is important for preventing the accumulation of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins.</p>

        <title>WDR81 acts in the autophagy pathway for clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins</title>
        <p>Given that proteins with K63-linked polyubiquitination are mainly degraded through autophagy (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Newton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kirkin et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Cuervo, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rui et al., 2015</xref>), we investigated whether WDR81 promotes Ub protein clearance in an autophagy-dependent manner. Although si81 or KO-81 HeLa cells accumulated much higher levels of Ub proteins and p62 than cells with siCtrl, MG132 treatment further enhanced the levels of Ub proteins and p62 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Because MG132 causes inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>), the additive effect of si81 and MG132 suggests that WDR81 does not act in proteasome-dependent clearance of Ub proteins. Next, we knocked down WDR81 in both wild-type and <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kuma et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, Ub proteins accumulated similarly in <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells or si81 MEF cells; nevertheless, si81 treatment did not further enhance the levels of Ub proteins in <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells. Likewise, the elevation in p62 protein levels in <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells was not enhanced with si81 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results suggest that WDR81 acts through autophagy to promote clearance of Ub proteins.

        <p>To investigate if WDR81 is degraded through autophagy, we knocked down the core components of the autophagy machinery or used bafilomycin A1 (BFA1) to inhibit lysosomal activity. siRNA of ATG5 or Beclin1 strongly increased Flag-WDR81 that was stably expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Levels of stably expressed Flag-WDR81 were similarly enhanced with BFA1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). These results suggest that WDR81 acts in autophagic clearance of Ub proteins and can be degraded through autophagy. Interestingly, MG132 treatment also enhanced Flag-WDR81 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>), suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may contribute to WDR81 stability. In addition, we investigated whether WDR81 is required for general autophagy by examining the LC3 forms in KO-81 cells. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was the same in KO-81 and control cells (Fig. S2 D). Starvation (Earleâs Balanced Salt Solution treatment) or lysosomal inhibition (BFA1) did not alter this ratio either (Fig. S2 D). Consistent with this, KO-81 cells did not show a significant increase in GFP-LC3 foci compared with control cells when cultured normally or treated with Earleâs Balanced Salt Solution or BFA1 (Fig. S2 E). Using the RFP-GFP-LC3 fusion protein as an indicator, we found that the numbers of autophagosomes and autolysosomes were similar in control cells and KO-81 cells without or with starvation or BFA1 treatment (Fig. S2 F). Altogether, these findings suggest that WDR81 is unlikely to play a role in general autophagy.</p>

        <title>The function of WDR81 in aggrephagy is independent of the endosomal WDR91âWDR81 complex</title>
        <p>Because WDR81 and WDR91 form a complex to promote endosome maturation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rapiteanu et al., 2016</xref>), we asked whether knockout of WDR91 also induced accumulation of Ub protein and p62 foci. Unlike KO-81 cells, WDR91 knockout (KO-91) cells do not contain enlarged foci of Ub proteins and p62 (Fig. S3 A). In addition, puromycin- or MG132-induced p62 foci were negative for WDR91 (Fig. S3 B). Given that inactivation of WDR81 or WDR91 similarly impairs endosome conversion (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rapiteanu et al., 2016</xref>), these results suggest that the elevation in Ub proteins and p62 in KO-81 cells do not result from defective endosome maturation. Supporting this conclusion, coexpression of GFP-WDR81 with mCherry-WDR91 (mCh-WDR91) led to perfect colocalization of these proteins with obvious endosomal structures, suggesting that WDR91 promotes the recruitment of WDR81 to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>); however, MG132 or puromycin induced formation of distinct GFP-WDR81 foci separate from mCh-WDR91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Similarly, whereas GFP-WDR81 colocalized fairly well with the late endosomeâspecific marker Rab7 tagged with mCherry (mCh-Rab7), GFP-WDR81 no longer colocalized with mCh-Rab7 after MG132 or puromycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In contrast, MG132 or puromycin did not change the colocalization of GFP-WDR91 with mCh-Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). These findings suggest that the function of WDR81 in aggrephagy is independent of the endosomal WDR81âWDR91 complex. In addition, whereas WDR81 and WDR91 form a complex with Beclin1 and their knockout enhanced Beclin1-dependent endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>), neither protein was found in the Atg14LâBeclin1âVps34 complex, and knockout of either WDR81 or WDR91 did not affect autophagic PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). This suggests that WDR81 does not fulfill its role in aggrephagy by affecting autophagic PI3K activity.</p>

Remarkably, the autophagic vesicles in control cells predominantly contained darkly stained proteinaceous material and had intact membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and H</xref>). KO-81 cells, however, contained many proteinaceous structures in the cytosol that were more darkly stained and were either not enclosed by membranes or only partially surrounded by membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E, G, and H</xref>).

        <title>WDR81 functions together with p62</title>
        <p>To pinpoint how WDR81 functions in aggrephagy, we investigated whether it acts in complex with p62.

Likewise, puromycin or MG132 treatment induced colocalization of WDR81 and p62 to large focal structures (Fig. S4 A). Because p62 overexpression results in formation of p62 bodies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">BjÃ¸rkÃ¸y et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Szeto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>), we tested if such p62 bodies could recruit WDR81. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, BFP-WDR81 coexpressed with GFP-p62 localized exclusively to p62 bodies. Likewise, overexpressed GFP-p62 recruited endogenous WDR81 to focal structures in both HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 B</xref> and S4 B). GFP-tagged NBR1 (GFP-NBR1), a p62-like cargo receptor (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kirkin et al., 2009a</xref>), also formed obvious foci when overexpressed. Nevertheless, these GFP-NBR1 foci failed to recruit either ectopically expressed mCh-WDR81 or endogenous WDR81 (Fig. S4 C). In addition, mCherry-tagged NDP52, optineurin, and TAX1BP1, which are adaptors for xenophagy or mitophagy (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">von Muhlinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>), localized to large Myc-Ubâpositive focal structures in cells treated with MG132 (Fig. S4 D). However, they did not colocalize with GFP-WDR81 to focal structures in cells without MG132 treatment (Fig. S4 E). Together, these findings suggest that WDR81 is preferentially recruited by p62. In addition, colocalization of BFP-WDR81 with EGFP-p62 and mCh-WDR91 was observed in cells coexpressing these three proteins; however, WDR91 did not localize to p62 bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), suggesting that WDR81 plays dual roles in aggrephagy and endosome conversion by acting with p62 and WDR91, respectively.</p>

        <p>We next attempted to identify the region in WDR81 that mediates colocalization with p62. By coexpressing mCh-p62 with truncated WDR81 proteins fused with GFP, we found that p62 foci efficiently recruited WDR81 truncations containing the N-terminal 1â650 aa (WDR81(1â650)), which include the BEACH domain. Other WDR81 truncations lacking this region failed to colocalize with p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Using immunoprecipitation (IP), we found that HA-p62 physically interacted with Flag-tagged full-length WDR81 and WDR81(1â650), but not the WD40-repeat region (aa 1,637â1,940, WDR81(WD40); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, EâG</xref>). In vitro, GST-fused p62, but not GST, efficiently pulled down either full-length WDR81 or WDR81(1â650), but not WDR81(WD40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). GST-p62 also pulled down <sup>35</sup>S-labeled full-length WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that WDR81 and p62 directly interact with one another and that the BEACH-containing N terminus (1â650) of WDR81 is sufficient and necessary for this interaction.</p>
        <p>We then investigated which domain in p62 is required for the interaction with WDR81 by coexpressing GFP-WDR81(1â650) with a series of mCh-p62 truncations. We found that p62 fragments containing the PB1 domain (aa 1â120), including aa 1â120, 1â180, and 1â385, formed foci to which GFP-WDR81(1â650) was recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 J</xref>). Longer fragments had a stronger effect on WDR81(1â650) recruitment. In contrast, p62 truncations without the PB1 domain did not show obvious colocalization with WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 J</xref>). Using in vitro pull-down assays, we found that GST-p62 and GST-p62(PB1) directly interacted with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled WDR81(1â650) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 K</xref>). Moreover, the p62 truncations aa 1â120, 1â180, and 1â385, but not 121â320 or 321â440, interacted with WDR81(1â650) in co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>). These data demonstrated that the PB1 domain mediates the interaction of p62 with WDR81.</p>

        <title>WDR81 promotes the interaction of p62 with Ub proteins</title>
        <p>To understand how the interaction of WDR81 may affect p62 function, we investigated the binding of p62 with Ub proteins in KO-81 cells. To this end, we immunoprecipitated p62 and examined the coprecipitated Ub proteins. Whereas the levels of total Ub proteins and K63-Ub proteins were strongly enhanced in KO-81 cells, the amount of total Ub proteins or K63-Ub proteins coprecipitated with p62 was much lower in KO-81 cells than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). K48-Ub proteins were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Consistent with this, the proportion of Ub protein foci positive for p62 in KO-81 cells, regardless of proteotoxic stress (e.g., MG132 treatment), was significantly decreased compared with that in control HeLa cells treated with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In contrast, p62-associated total Ub and K63-Ub proteins, but not K48-Ub proteins, were greatly increased in HEK293 cells overexpressing Flag-WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, EâG</xref>). These data suggest that WDR81 facilitates the interaction of p62 with K63-Ub proteins. To corroborate this point, we coexpressed Flag-WDR81 and HA-p62 with Myc-Ub(K63) or Myc-Ub(K48) in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated HA-p62. Co-expression of Flag-WDR81 strongly increased the association with HA-p62 of Myc-Ub(K63)-labeled, but not Myc-Ub(K48)-labeled, proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>). KO-81 HeLa cells or HEK293 cells expressing Flag-WDR81 did not show an obvious change in p62 phosphorylation at Ser 403, though this phosphorylation was increased by BFA1 treatment as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, WDR81 did not facilitate p62 interaction with K63-Ub proteins by changing p62 phosphorylation.</p>

We found that Ub proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-WDR81 in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 K</xref>). The association of Ub proteins with WDR81 is probably noncovalent, because very low levels of Ub proteins were coprecipitated with WDR81 when IPs were performed with SDS-containing RIPA buffer (+RIPA), which is known to prevent noncovalent interactions (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>).

        <title>WDR81 is critical for LC3C recruitment by Ub proteins</title>
        <p>Given that WDR81 promotes cargo recognition by interacting with p62 during aggrephagy, we further asked if WDR81 plays a role in facilitating the recruitment of major autophagy factors to Ub protein aggregates. The recruitment of ULK1, ATG12, Vps34, or ATG14L by Ub protein foci was similar in MG132-treated control HeLa cells and in KO-81 cells with or without MG132 treatment (Fig. S5 A). However, the proportion of Ub protein foci that were positive for LC3 family proteins in KO-81 cells was significantly reduced compared with that in control cells treated with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>), suggesting that WDR81 is important for recruitment of LC3 family members by Ub proteins. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether WDR81 interacts with individual members of the LC3 or GABARAP subfamilies. Whereas no obvious coprecipitation of mCh-LC3B or mCh-LC3A with Flag-WDR81 was detected, mCh-LC3C clearly coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>). In addition, mCh-tagged GABARAP and GABARAPL1, but not GABARAPL2, showed very weak association with Flag-WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). These results indicate that WDR81 preferentially interacts with LC3C. Consistent with this notion, coexpressed BFP-WDR81 and GFP-LC3C colocalized to Myc-Ub foci, and this colocalization became more obvious after exposure to MG132 (Fig. S5 B). In KO-81 cells, however, a significant proportion of Myc-Ub foci were negative for GFP-LC3C, whereas the colocalization of GFP-LC3B with Ub protein foci was unchanged regardless of MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, DâF</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that WDR81 preferentially interacts with LC3C and promotes its recruitment by Ub proteins.</p>

        <p>Using quantitative RT-PCR or a human LC3Câspecific antibody, we found that LC3C is expressed in both control and KO-81 HeLa cells, as well as in HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. S5, CâE). Intriguingly, no information about the LC3C gene was found in the mouse genome database. Nevertheless, an LC3C-like protein comparable to human LC3C was detected in both wild-type and <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells with the same LC3C-specific antibody, and <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells seemed to have a higher level of this LC3C-like protein (Fig. S5 F). In addition, whereas siLC3A and siLC3B specifically knocked down LC3A and LC3B in <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells, respectively, the level of the LC3C-like protein was not changed by these siRNA treatments (Fig. S5 G). Like <italic>ATG5<sup>â/â</sup></italic> MEF cells, the brain of WDR81 conditional knockout (cKO) mice (see below) also has a higher level of the LC3C-like protein than the wild type (Fig. S5 H). These findings suggest that mice probably have an LC3C-like protein that might act similarly to human LC3C in selective autophagy. In HeLa cells, siRNA of LC3C, which did not affect other LC3 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, G and H</xref>), led to formation of Ub protein focal structures that costained with endogenous p62 or WDR81 and were immunostained much more intensely than the small puncta in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, I and J</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the levels of Ub proteins and p62 were indeed greatly elevated after siLC3C treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 K</xref>). Similarly, siLC3C strongly increased the protein level of stably expressed Flag-WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 L</xref>). Thus, LC3C is essential for clearance of Ub proteins, p62, and WDR81, suggesting that LC3C plays a critical role in aggrephagy.</p>

        <title>WDR81 interacts with LC3C through LIRs</title>
        <p>We next investigated which domain in WDR81 is responsible for interaction with LC3C. Using co-IPs, we found that GFP-tagged WDR81(1â650), but not other regions, coprecipitated with mCh-LC3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Further co-IP analysis revealed that the BEACH domain (WDR81(341â650)) was sufficient and necessary for WDR81 to interact with LC3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Based on these results, we sought to identify amino acid residues in this region that are required for interaction with LC3C. Interestingly, this region contains two putative canonical LIRs, which are found in several autophagy receptors such as p62, NBR1, and FUNDC1 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kirkin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). These putative LIRs are also found in WDR81 homologues in multiple species (Fig. S5 I). In addition, two candidate noncanonical LIRs (CLIRs), which are similar to that in NDP52, are also found in this region (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">von Muhlinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). We thus mutated key residues in these putative LIRs or CLIRs and examined the interaction with LC3C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>, mutations in LIR1 (W544A/L547A, LIR1<sup>AA</sup>) and LIR2 (S577A/Y578A/V581A, LIR2<sup>AA</sup>), but not the putative CLIRs, abrogated the interaction of WDR81(341â650) with mCh-LC3C in co-IP assays. Similarly, whereas full-length Flag-WDR81 clearly coimmunoprecipitated with mCh-LC3C, Flag-WDR81 containing LIR1<sup>AA</sup>, LIR2<sup>AA</sup>, or both, failed to associate with mCh-LC3C in co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Using GST pull-down assays, we confirmed that GST-LC3C, but not GST, pulled down full-length Flag-WDR81 but not Flag-WDR81 containing LIR mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 F</xref>). Altogether these findings suggest that WDR81 interacts with LC3C through canonical LIRs.</p>

Our co-IP results showed that neither the K32Q/F33H mutations, which affect the W-site, nor the L64V/F69L mutations, which affect the L-site, had an obvious effect on the interaction of mCh-LC3 with Flag-WDR81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 I</xref>).

Furthermore, overexpression of the K32Q/F33H/L64V/F69L LC3C mutant failed to rescue the accumulation of p62 induced by siRNA of LC3C, in sharp contrast to the full rescuing effect of wild-type LC3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 J</xref>).

To investigate the effect of WDR81 inactivation on protein aggregates in the brain, we examined brain sections and performed immunostaining of p62 and ubiquitin. Intriguingly, no obvious brain abnormalities were observed in <italic>WDR81<sup>f/f</sup></italic> cKO mice, unlike the defective development of the corpus callosum, third ventricle, fourth ventricle, and cerebellum in human CAMRQ2 patients carrying a WDR81 mutation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gulsuner et al., 2011</xref>). However, p62 foci strongly accumulated in the cortex of both dead and surviving <italic>WDR81<sup>f/f</sup></italic> cKO mice at postnatal day 0 (P0), and the dead mice had higher levels of accumulation of p62 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Both Ub-positive and Ub-negative p62 foci were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Accumulation of p62 bodies was also observed in the developing cortex at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, F and G</xref>). In surviving adult <italic>WDR81<sup>f/f</sup></italic> cKO mice at P180, p62 foci were found not only in the cortex but also in the striatum, whereas the brain did not show any obvious abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 H</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine the cell types in which WDR81 functions, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis and found that WDR81 is mainly expressed in neurons, but not astrocytes, in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, AâC</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that p62 foci were mainly present in NeuN-positive neurons, but not GFAP-positive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, D and E</xref>). These data suggest that WDR81 is required for preventing protein aggregate accumulation in neurons. To consolidate this conclusion, we induced <italic>WDR81</italic> inactivation in the striatum of adult <italic>WDR81<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice by stereotaxically grafting lentivirus expressing a GFP-fused Cre (Cre-GFP) or a GFP-fused Cre truncation (ÎCre-GFP) that has no recombinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 F</xref>). Grafting of lentivirus expressing Cre-GFP effectively ablated <italic>WDR81</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 F</xref>). Consistent with this, accumulation of p62 foci was detected over time in the NeuN-positive neurons, but not GFAP-positive astrocytes, in the brain regions infected by viruses expressing Cre-GFP, whereas no p62 foci were observed in the contralateral regions infected with ÎCre-GFP-expressing viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, G and H</xref>). Collectively, these findings provide further evidence that WDR81 plays an important role in removing aggregated proteins in neuronal cells in mice. Of note, these results do not exclude the possibility that WDR81 participates in other selective autophagy processes in mice, as the accumulated p62 or Ub foci in WDR81 cKO mouse brain may include other selective autophagy cargoes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we identify WDR81 as an essential factor in autophagy-dependent clearance of Ub proteins. Loss of WDR81 function leads to accumulation of Ub proteins and the autophagy receptor p62 in cells and mouse brains. WDR81 associates with ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins, where it acts in complex with p62. WDR81 inactivation significantly reduced, whereas its overexpression strongly enhanced, the association of p62 with Ub proteins. This suggests that the interaction of WDR81 with p62 promotes cargo recognition for aggrephagy. In addition, loss of WDR81 specifically reduced the recruitment of LC3C to ubiquitinated proteins. Our data further indicate that WDR81 interacts with LC3C, but not other LC3 subfamily members. The canonical LIRs in WDR81 mediate the interaction with LC3C through the LC3C-specific hydrophobic pocket. These findings collectively suggest that WDR81 coordinates p62-dependent recognition of Ub proteins with LC3C-mediated assembly of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating Ub protein clearance through autophagy.</p>
      <p>Although WDR81 was found to act in complex with WDR91 to regulate endosome maturation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), the findings in this study suggest that neither WDR81 nor WDR91 affects the activity of the autophagic PI3K complex. The function of WDR81 in aggrephagy does not require WDR91. This is supported by the fact that WDR81, but not WDR91, is recruited by Ub protein foci and p62 bodies and that KO-91 cells do not accumulate enlarged foci of Ub proteins and p62. In addition, WDR81 separately interacts with p62 and WDR91. Thus, WDR81 plays dual functions in aggrephagy and endosome maturation by forming complexes with p62/LC3C or WDR91, respectively.</p>
      <p>Previously it has been shown that LC3C interacts with NDP52 to mediate antibacterial autophagy. This interaction, conferred by a noncanonical LIR in NDP52, executes selective autophagic removal of bacteria (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">von Muhlinen et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings about the WDR81âLC3C interaction establish the essential role of LC3C in aggrephagy. We found that LC3C interacts through its hydrophobic pocket with the canonical LIRs of WDR81. Interestingly, the hydrophobic pocket residues in LC3C are more closely related to those in GABARAP subfamily members. For example, K32, L64, and F69 in LC3C are conserved in GABARAP members, but not in LC3A or LC3B (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">von Muhlinen et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, WDR81 strongly interacts with LC3C but weakly with GABARAPs, whereas no interaction with LC3A and LC3B was observed. Thus, other residues in the hydrophobic pocket in LC3C may also contribute to the preferential interaction with WDR81. In addition, because loss of WDR81 does not completely abrogate LC3C recruitment to Ub proteins, other LC3C-interacting adaptor proteins, for example ALFY or NDP52, likely act redundantly with WDR81 in aggrephagy. Our results, together with those reported previously, suggest that the specific role of LC3C in selective autophagy is achieved by interacting with different adaptors/receptors.</p>
      <p>Our findings suggest that the BDCP (BEACH domainâcontaining protein) family members WDR81 and ALFY play distinct roles in aggrephagy (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cullinane et al., 2013</xref>). Both WDR81 and ALFY facilitate aggrephagy by interacting with p62. Nevertheless, ALFY appears to act as a scaffold during the interaction of the autophagy factors Atg5-12 with the phagophore membrane without being degraded (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Clausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, WDR81 does not obviously affect assembly of core autophagy factors but is degraded together with autophagy cargos and the p62 receptor. In addition, a recent study revealed that ALFY directly interacts with GABARAPs, but it interacts with LC3C much more weakly (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lystad et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we found that WDR81 strongly interacts with LC3C but weakly with GABARAPs. Thus, the preferential interactions of WDR81 or ALFY with LC3C or GABARAPs likely play different roles in formation of autophagosomes during aggrephagy. Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that LGG-1 and LGG-2, the ATG8 homologues in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, bind to different substrates or ATG protein complexes in autophagic degradation of protein aggregates during <italic>C. elegans</italic> development (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
      <p>A human <italic>WDR81</italic> mutation was found to be associated with CAMRQ2 syndrome, which manifests as quadrupedal locomotion, mental retardation, and cerebrocerebellar hypoplasia (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gulsuner et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we revealed a distinct role of WDR81 in removing ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins. This is strongly supported by the fact that WDR81 knockout leads to a strong accumulation of p62 bodies in the cortex and striatum in mouse brains. WDR81 may also participate in clearance of damaged mitochondria, because mice carrying a WDR81 point mutation accumulate aberrant mitochondria in Purkinje cell dendrites (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Traka et al., 2013</xref>). Although no LC3C gene information was found in the mouse genome database, an LC3C-like protein, which seems to be degraded in a WDR81- and ATG5-dependent manner (Fig. S5, F and H), might be involved in aggrephagy or other selective autophagy processes. It is possible that WDR81 acts together with this LC3C-like protein in mice, similar to the WDR81âLC3C interaction in human cells. Future studies will determine the identity of the LC3C-like protein and how it functions. In addition, although WDR81 cKO mice did not phenocopy the defective brain development in CAMRQ2 patients, the accumulation of aggregated proteins or damaged mitochondria may impair the function of neurons and render them sensitive to induction of cell death, a process that is implicated in neurodegenerative disease (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Filimonenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Moscat and Diaz-Meco, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Menzies et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, we and others recently showed that WDR81 is important for early-to-late endosome conversion, a key step in intracellular trafficking (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rapiteanu et al., 2016</xref>). Given the multifunctional properties of WDR81, CAMRQ2 syndrome may result from diverse defective cellular processes that lead to developmental defects. Importantly, mutations in several other BDCP family members are found to be associated with diseases, including ChediakâHigashi syndrome, immune deficiency, autism, gray platelet syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematous (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cullinane et al., 2013</xref>). It will therefore be of great interest to explore whether these BDCP proteins act similarly to WDR81 or ALFY in regulating intracellular trafficking or autophagy-related cellular processes.</p>

Endogenous Vps34 was immunoprecipitated by antibody against Beclin1 and Atg14L (Medical &amp; Biological Laboratories). Immunoprecipitated beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and further washed twice with reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mg/ml BSA). The beads were then incubated with 10 Âµg sonicated phosphatidylinositol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 Âµl 10 mM ATP in 30 Âµl reaction buffer for 30 min at RT. Conversion of ATP to ADP was measured with an ADP-GloTM kinase assay kit (Promega) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.</p>

Brains were cleared in xylene for 1 h with two repeats and then immersed in paraffin for 1 h with three repeats. The brains were embedded in a paraffin block. Sections (8 Âµm thickness) were generated on a microtome and floated in a water bath at 40Â°C. The sections were transferred onto glass slides and deparaffinized twice in xylene (5 min each). The slides were then rehydrated by sequential washes in graded ethanols (100%, 100%, 95%, 85%, 70%, and 50%, each for 3 min) at room temperature. After a final wash in 0.85% NaCl for 5 min at room temperature, the slides were subjected to immunohistological analysis.</p>

        <title>Recombinant lentivirus and in vivo lentiviral grafting</title>
        <p>Lentivirus production and lentiviral grafting were performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2011b</xref>). In brief, lentiviral transfer vector DNA and packaging plasmid DNA were cotransfected into 293T cells. The medium was collected and pooled at 40, 64, and 88 h and then filtered through a 0.2-Âµm filter. Viruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 19,000 rpm for 2 h at 20Â°C using a SW27 rotor (Beckman Coulter). To determine the titer of the viruses, the virus preparation was made in 10-fold serial dilutions. 2 Âµl of each dilution was used to infect 100,000 HeLa cells/well in six-well plates. 48 h later, cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of GFP-positive cells between 1% and 10% was used to calculate virus titer (infection units per microliter) using the following formula: titer (infection units per microliter) = [(percentage of GFP-positive cells) Ã 100,000 Ã dilution factor]/2. For in vivo lentiviral grafting, 4-wk-old C57B/L6 male mice were anesthetized, and viruses (â¥10<sup>8</sup> viruses/Âµl in 1.5 Âµl) were injected stereotaxically into the striatum using the following coordinates relative to bregma: anteroposterior, 0 mm; lateral, Â±2 mm; ventral, â2 mm (from dura). Every 2 weeks after viral grafting, mice were deeply anesthetized with avertin and perfused with saline followed by 4% PFA.</p>

        <p>Fig. S1 describes the subcellular localization of WDR81. Fig. S2 shows that WDR81 is important for clearance of polyQ aggregates, but not essential for general autophagy. Fig. S3 demonstrates that WDR91 is not required in aggrephagy. Fig. S4 shows that WDR81 is recruited by p62, but not other autophagy receptors or adaptors. Fig. S5 characterizes the recruitment of major autophagy regulators to Ub foci, the expression of LC3C in different cell types and mouse brain, the WDR81 LIR motifs, and the interaction of p62 with LC3C mutants. Table S1 summarizes the mammalian expression vectors used in the study. Table S2 lists oligos used for siRNA. Table S3 lists oligos used for site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
