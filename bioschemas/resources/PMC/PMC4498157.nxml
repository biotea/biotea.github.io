      <abstract>
        <p>Mucolipidosis II (MLII) and III alpha/beta are autosomal-recessive diseases of childhood caused by mutations in <italic>GNPTAB</italic> encoding the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor protein of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex. This enzyme modifies lysosomal hydrolases with mannose 6-phosphate targeting signals. Upon arrival in the Golgi apparatus, the newly synthesized Î±/Î²-subunit precursor is catalytically activated by site-1 protease (S1P). Here we performed comprehensive expression studies of <italic>GNPTAB</italic> mutations, including two novel mutations T644M and T1223del, identified in Brazilian MLII/MLIII alpha/beta patients. We show that the frameshift E757K<italic>fs</italic>X1 and the non-sense R587X mutations result in the retention of enzymatically inactive truncated precursor proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to loss of cytosolic ER exit motifs consistent with a severe clinical phenotype in homozygosity. The luminal missense mutations, C505Y, G575R and T644M, partially impaired ER exit and proteolytic activation in accordance with less severe MLIII alpha/beta disease symptoms. Analogous to the previously characterized S399F mutant, we found that the missense mutation I403T led to retention in the ER and loss of catalytic activity. Substitution of further conserved residues in stealth domain 2 (I346 and W357) revealed similar biochemical properties and allowed us to define a putative binding site for accessory proteins required for ER exit of Î±/Î²-subunit precursors. Interestingly, the analysis of the Y937_M972del mutant revealed partial Golgi localization and formation of abnormal inactive Î²-subunits generated by S1P which correlate with a clinical MLII phenotype. Expression analyses of mutations identified in patients underline genotypeâphenotype correlations in MLII/MLIII alpha/beta and provide novel insights into structural requirements of proper GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomal enzymes catalyze the degradation of a variety of endogenous and exogenous macromolecules. They require mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) residues on their oligosaccharides for efficient targeting of lysosomes. The formation of M6P is initiated in the lumen of the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi apparatus by the transfer of an <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to distinct mannose residues generating GlcNAc-1-phosphodiester (<xref rid="DDV100C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="DDV100C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This reaction is catalyzed by a hexameric GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex consisting of two Î±-, Î²- and Î³-subunits (<xref rid="DDV100C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In a second step, the masking GlcNAc residues are removed in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network by the uncovering enzyme that exposes terminal M6P modifications (<xref rid="DDV100C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The M6P residues allow the binding of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to M6P-specific receptors which mediate their segregation from the secretory pathway and delivery to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment (<xref rid="DDV100C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The Î±- and Î²-subunits of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex are synthesized as a common Î±/Î²-subunit precursor protein encoded by the <italic>GNPTAB</italic> gene that is located on chromosome 12q23.3 (<xref rid="DDV100C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="DDV100C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The <italic>GNPTG</italic> gene, located on chromosome 16p13.3, encodes the Î³-subunit (<xref rid="DDV100C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Non-sense, frameshift and splice site mutations in <italic>GNPTAB</italic> cause the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type II (MLII; MIM #252500; also called I-cell disease) which is associated with a complete loss of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity (<xref rid="DDV100C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In contrast, missense mutations in <italic>GNPTAB</italic> showing residual GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity result in a milder course of the disease (MLIII alpha/beta; MIM #252600) (<xref rid="DDV100C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV100C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The MLIII gamma form (MIM #252605) is caused by defects in the <italic>GNPTG</italic> gene (<xref rid="DDV100C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). To date, more than 140 different <italic>GNPTAB</italic> mutations have been described.</p><p>Biochemically, the complete or partial loss of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity leads to missorting and hypersecretion of multiple lysosomal enzymes. The subsequent intracellular deficiency of lysosomal enzymes results in the accumulation of non-degraded storage material in lysosomes (<xref rid="DDV100C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). MLII patients suffer from severe psychomotor retardation and show coarse facial features, gingival hypertrophy, shortened neck, joint contractures, osteopenia, <italic>dysostosis multiplex</italic> and very short stature. Death occurs due to cardiopulmonary complications within the first decade of life (<xref rid="DDV100C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="DDV100C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). MLIII alpha/beta is presented by progressive joint stiffness, claw hands, carpal and tarsal tunnel syndrome, scoliosis and decreased mobility of knees and hip joints (<xref rid="DDV100C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The Î±/Î²-subunit precursor is a type III membrane protein of 1256 amino acids and two transmembrane domains. Its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires a combinatorial sorting motif located in the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (<xref rid="DDV100C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Upon arrival in the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi apparatus, the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor is proteolytically cleaved between amino acids K928 and D929 into the mature Î±- and Î²-subunits by the site-1 protease (S1P), which also plays an essential role in cholesterol homeostasis (<xref rid="DDV100C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="DDV100C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The proteolytic cleavage of Î±/Î²-subunit precursor protein is a prerequisite for the catalytic activity of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and therefore plays an important role in the biogenesis of lysosomes.</p><p>The luminal Î±-subunit exhibits a conserved modular structure, and recently the DNA methyltransferase-associated protein (DMAP) domain has been described as the binding site for lysosomal enzymes (<xref rid="DDV100C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The Î±- and Î²-subunits mediate the catalytic function of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (<xref rid="DDV100C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which appears to be modulated by the Î³-subunits (<xref rid="DDV100C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used the subcellular localization determined by double immunofluorescence microscopy, and the capability to be enzymatically activated by the Golgi-localized S1P to analyze the effect of eight selected disease-causing <italic>GNPTAB</italic> mutations found in Brazilian MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients. We have presented evidence that in addition to the loss of combinatorial cytosolic targeting motifs (<xref rid="DDV100C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), luminal missense mutations located in the âstealthâ region 2 of the Î±-subunit impair the transport of the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor to the Golgi apparatus. This region most likely represents a contact site for a yet unknown accessory transport protein. Finally, a stretch of amino acids in the N-terminus of the Î²-subunit is essential for precise S1P-mediated cleavage and activity of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We examined the biological significance of eight selected disease-causing <italic>GNPTAB</italic> mutations found in MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients in Brazil. Two of the mutations, T644M and T1223del, were novel and found in heterozygosity in the patient described in Materials and Methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv100/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>, patient #6). In addition, three missense mutations (I403T, C505Y and G575R), an in-frame deletion mutation of 36 amino acids (Y937_M972del), a non-sense mutation (R587X) and a frameshift mutation (E757K<italic>fs</italic>X1), which were identified previously (<xref rid="DDV100C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="DDV100C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) have been included in this study (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F1">1</xref>). These mutations were introduced into the wild-type (WT) cDNA of human <italic>GNPTAB</italic>-myc constructs and transiently expressed in HEK-293, HeLa or S1P-deficient SRD-12B cells. The cells were analyzed for expression, subcellular localization of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and correlated to the activity.

In cells expressing the WT protein, a 190 kDa Î±/Î²-subunit precursor and 45 kDa Î²-subunits were detectable (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>A, lane 2, B, lane 1) which were not present in extracts of non-transfected control cells (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>A, lane 1). The reactivity of the monoclonal antibody with the mature Î±-subunit of a calculated molecular mass of 145 kDa was weak, most likely due to the high N-glycosylation, which could be improved by deglycosylation of the samples. After treatment of cell extracts with peptide-<italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F (PNGase F), hydrolyzing all N-linked oligosaccharides, the molecular masses of the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor and Î±- and Î²-subunits shifted to â¼170, 125 and 38 kDa (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>A, lane 3, B, lane 2), respectively. In extracts of cells overexpressing the missense mutant I403T, the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor protein but no cleaved Î±- and Î²-subunits were observed (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>A, lanes 4 and 5). The mutants C505Y, G575R (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>A, lanes 6â9) and T644M (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4) were cleaved into mature Î±- and Î²-subunits. Densitometric analysis revealed, however, that only 20, 10 and 30% of the C505Y, G575R and T644M mutants were proteolytically processed in comparison to 80% of the WT Î±/Î²-subunit precursor. The non-sense R587X mutant led to the expression of a truncated 70 kDa glycosylated and 60 kDa non-glycosylated polypeptide which could be detected with the anti Î±-subunit antibody but not with the anti-myc antibody (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>A, lanes 10 and 11). The frameshift mutant E757K<italic>fs</italic>X1 was expressed as 120 kDa glycosylated and 80 kDa non-glycosylated polypeptide (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6). In extracts from HEK-293 cells overexpressing the Y937_M972del mutant, the loss of 36 amino acid residues was hardly detectable by changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>B, lanes 7 and 8). However, we unexpectedly observed no Î²-subunits with increased electrophoretic mobility due to the deletion but with approximately the same mass as the WT Î²-subunit (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>B, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, we observed in other experiments even a lower migrating Î²-subunit (discussed below). The mutant T1223del Î±/Î²-subunit precursor was cleaved into mature Î±- and Î²-subunits (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref>B, lanes 9 and 10).

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell extracts were incubated for 1 h in the presence (+) or absence (â) of PNGase F followed by SDSâPAGE (10% acrylamide) under reducing conditions and western blot analysis detecting Î±/Î²-subunit precursor and Î±-subunits (anti Î±) or Î±/Î²-subunit precursors and Î²-subunits (anti-myc).

To examine genotypeâphenotype correlations in this cohort of Brazilian MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients, the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity was measured using Î±-methylmannoside (Î±-MM) as a phosphate acceptor. The expression of the WT Î±/Î²-subunits precursor of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase has led to a 13-fold increase in GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity compared with non-transfected cells. Less than 2% of WT GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity was measured in cells expressing R587X and E757K<italic>fs</italic>X1 mutants (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F5">5</xref>) which are retained in the ER (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F4">4</xref>).

The mutants T644M and T1223del that were correctly transported and proteolytically cleaved into mature Î±- and Î²-subunits exhibited 50 and 85% of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, respectively, of the WT enzyme.

These data are consistent with the milder and less progressive MLIII alpha/beta than MLII phenotype of the patients carrying the T644M and T1223del mutations.

All other tested mutants were cleaved by S1P and could exit the ER.

The loss of ER exit signals in the cytoplasmic domain of the Î²-subunit (<xref rid="DDV100C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) in these truncated Î±/Î²-subunit precursors is responsible for the retention in the ER and the subsequent inability for S1P-mediated proteolytic activation. In contrast, both mutations T644M and T1223del identified in the patient #6 altered the amino acid sequence in the region between the Notch-repeat-like domain 2 and DMAP domain and the second transmembrane domain (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F1">1</xref>), respectively, partially impaired Golgi localization, proteolytic activation and GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity.

Of note, the substitution of T644 by methionine changes a potential N-glycosylation in the Î±-subunit. At present, it is unclear whether N642 is glycosylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and the loss of this N-glycosylation site affects the function of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex.</p><p>The 31-year-old MLIII alpha/beta patient #5 was found to be compound heterozygous for the non-sense and missense mutations R587X and C505Y, respectively. The premature termination after R586 in the Î±-subunit explains both the ER localization and the absence of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity. The substitution, however, of cysteine 505 by tyrosine in the Notch-repeat-like domain 2 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F1">1</xref>) impaired the ER-Golgi transport and proteolytic activation which is consistent with the residual GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv100/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). During the preparation of the manuscript, Kornfeld and co-workers (<xref rid="DDV100C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) reported the analysis of two missense mutations affecting cysteine residues in the Notch-repeat-like domain 2 of the Î±-subunit. Our data are in agreement with their finding on the C505Y mutation. Although comparative activity measurements in cysteine mutants of the Notch-repeat-like domain 1 (C442Y, C461G and C468S) suggested that this domain is involved in the recognition of lysosomal enzyme binding (<xref rid="DDV100C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), it is unclear whether the Notch-repeat-like domain 2 harboring C505 residue also has a role in lysosomal enzyme binding.</p><p>We previously reported that the mutation S399F located in the stealth domain 2 (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F1">1</xref>) is retained in the ER and not cleaved to mature Î±- and Î²-subunits (<xref rid="DDV100C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Interestingly, the Brazilian patient #3 carries the heterozygous mutation I403T that behaves in an analogous manner as S399F (<xref rid="DDV100C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) (FigsÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F4">4</xref>) lacking catalytic activity as shown by Kornfeld and co-workers (<xref rid="DDV100C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). When we examined the substitutions of other randomly selected residues by alanine, I346A and W357A were found to be not or partially cleaved by S1P (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F6">6</xref>). Two other mutations in the stealth domain 2 have been reported, R334Q and R334L (<xref rid="DDV100C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DDV100C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), which are localized in the ER and therefore lack cleavage and catalytic activity (<xref rid="DDV100C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Thus, it is likely that at least the amino acid residues R334, I346, W357, S399 and I403 in stealth domain 2 form a putative surface structure capable of interacting with a yet unknown protein in the lumen of the ER required for proper sorting to the ER exit sites, cargo incorporation into the nascent vesicles and/or transport to the Golgi apparatus. Several proteins functioning as subunits or luminal chaperones in the trafficking of transporter proteins or transcription factors from the ER to other organelles have been described (<xref rid="DDV100C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="DDV100C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The identification of potential accessory proteins which bind to signal structures of the stealth domain 2 in the Î±-subunit is currently under investigation.</p><p>Of particular interest was the Y937_M972del mutant which was partially transported to the Golgi apparatus and abnormally cleaved (Fig.Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV100F8">8</xref>). The regular cleavage site of the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor between K928 and D929 is located in the consensus recognition motif of S1P (R/K)X(hydrophobic)Zâ, where X represents any amino acid and Z preferentially L or T. For cleavage, at least 20 amino acid residues proximal to the cleavage site are required to allow the interaction of S1P with the Î±/Î²-subunit precursor protein (<xref rid="DDV100C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Obviously, an intact amino acid sequence covering more than nine residues distal to the cleavage site is also necessary for effective S1P-mediated cleavage. Although no further S1P consensus sequences in the Î±-subunit are known, the experiments in S1P-deficient SRD-12B cells have demonstrated that S1P is the responsible protease for the generation of abnormal cleavage of the Î±-subunit preventing the proper activation step. The identification of the abnormal cleavage site remains to be investigated.</p><p>The data presented here demonstrate the importance of comprehensive expression analyses of missense and deletion mutations in the <italic>GNPTAB</italic> gene in the context with a thorough clinical evaluation and help to define genotypeâphenotype correlations in order to improve the predictions of the clinical course of MLII and III alpha/beta.

Mutagenic primers were designed using the web-based program PrimerX (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.bioinformatics.org/primerx">www.bioinformatics.org/primerx</uri>). The mutation c.2808A&gt;G was not associated with an amino acid change but effect the splicing. This mutation creates a similar sequence to the canonical donor splice site, and consequently cDNA analysis of the patient RNA revealed the presence of an abnormal transcript lacking the last 108 bp of exon 14 resulting in an in-frame deletion of 36 amino acids of the Î²-subunit (Y937_M972del) (<xref rid="DDV100C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To introduce this mutation into the <italic>GNPTAB</italic> construct, 48 bp primers were used.
