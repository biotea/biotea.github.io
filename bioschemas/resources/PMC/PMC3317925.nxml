          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Experimental and clinical evidence has pinpointed a critical role for matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in ischemic ventricular remodeling and systolic heart failure. Prior studies have demonstrated that transgenic expression of the full-length, 68 kDa, secreted form of MMP-2 induces severe systolic failure. These mice also had unexpected and severe mitochondrial structural abnormalities and dysfunction. We hypothesized that an additional intracellular isoform of MMP-2, which affects mitochondrial function is induced under conditions of systolic failure-associated oxidative stress.</p>

          <title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Western blots of cardiac mitochondria from the full length MMP-2 transgenics, ageing mice and a model of accelerated atherogenesis revealed a smaller 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform. Cultured cardiomyoblasts subjected to transient oxidative stress generated the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform. The 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform was also induced by hypoxic culture of cardiomyoblasts. Genomic database analysis of the MMP-2 gene mapped transcriptional start sites and RNA transcripts induced by hypoxia or epigenetic modifiers within the first intron of the MMP-2 gene. Translation of these transcripts yields a 65 kDa N-terminal truncated isoform beginning at M<sup>77</sup>, thereby deleting the signal sequence and inhibitory prodomain. Cellular trafficking studies demonstrated that the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform is not secreted and is present in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, while the full length 68 kDa isoform was found only in the extracellular space. Expression of the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform induced mitochondrial-nuclear stress signaling with activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-ÎºB, NFAT and IRF transcriptional pathways. By microarray, the 65 kDa MMP-2 induces an innate immunity transcriptome, including viral stress response genes, innate immunity transcription factor IRF7, chemokines and pro-apoptosis genes.</p>

          <p>A novel N-terminal truncated intracellular isoform of MMP-2 is induced by oxidative stress. This isoform initiates a primary innate immune response that may contribute to progressive cardiac dysfunction in the setting of ischemia and systolic failure.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Matrix metalloproteinases play a central role in many forms of cardiovascular disease, including valvular disease, ischemia/reperfusion injury, compensatory hypertrophy, post-infarction remodeling and systolic heart failure (Reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0034177-Spinale1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). The human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family is comprised of multiple members with a remarkable diversity of structure, function and regulation. The current nomenclature of this gene family is based on the preferred extracellular matrix molecules cleaved by each enzyme. The gene family has been divided into subgroups consisting of interstitial collagenases (MMP-1,-8,-13), the stromelysins (MMP-3, -10, -11), the matrilysins (MMP-7,-26), the membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMP1-6) and the gelatinases (MMP-2, -9). The proteins share several distinguishing features, included a conserved modular structure, secretion in an inactive zymogen form and dependence on zinc for catalytic activity.</p>
      <p>From this diverse group it has become increasingly evident that a specific metalloproteinase, MMP-2, is of central pathophysiologic and therapeutic importance in cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0034177-Spinale1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The primary mRNA transcript for MMP-2 encodes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 68 kDA consisting of a short N-terminal signal sequence for ER/Golgi/secretory vesicle processing, a propeptide domain which maintains enzymatic latency, and a highly conserved zinc-binding catalytic domain in conjuction with hemopexin and fibronectin domains important for binding to extracellular matrix substrates. Enzymatic latency is maintained by the âcysteine switchâ mechanism, in which a cysteine residue in the prodomain sequence PR<bold>C</bold>GVN is folded over the zinc-containing catalytic site. Classical proteolytic activation in the extracellular space is a complex process resulting from the interaction of the latent MMP-2 with MT1-MMP/TIMP2 complexes on the cellular surface, resulting in cleavage of the prodomain and acquisition of enzymatic activity <xref rid="pone.0034177-Turck1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Morgunova1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Until recently, nearly all studies had focused on the extracellular actions of MMP-2 in the genesis of cardiac dysfunction. This appeared reasonable in view of the above described structure of the molecule, with the typical features of a secreted protein. Coker, et al. <xref rid="pone.0034177-Coker1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> provided the first evidence for the existence of intracellular MMP-2. Isolated left ventricular cardiomyocyte preparations were cultured for short periods and evaluated for MMP-2 secretion. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence staining of the isolated cardiomyocytes revealed prominent MMP-2 staining within the myocyte in a pattern consistent with both sarcomeric and sarcolemmal localization. Subsequently, the Schulz laboratory published a pivotal paper showing physical association of latent, full-length 68 kDa MMP-2 with the cardiac sarcomere <xref rid="pone.0034177-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A direct interaction with sarcomeric troponin I was demonstrated and the authors provided evidence for MMP-2-mediated troponin I degradation following acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. As reported, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Sawicki1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Ali1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, activation of latent full length 68 kDa MMP-2 in the setting of I/R injury is mediated by the nonproteolytic action of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to open the cysteine switch.</p>
      <p>We have reported on the phenotype of cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active, full-length (68 kDa) isoform <xref rid="pone.0034177-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our initial hypothesis was that cardiac expression of active MMP-2 would primarily affect the structure and composition of the cardiac extracellular matrix. While there was a significant increase in cardiac extracellular matrix in these mice, the most remarkable phenotypic findings related to contractile abnormalities and severe systolic dysfunction. In addition, ultrastructural studies demonstrated cardiomyocyte myofilament lysis and mitochondrial structural abnormalities. Furthermore, these mice did not respond to ischemic preconditioning in isolated heart preparations and exhibited unanticipated abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial respiration, lipid peroxidation and recovery of contractile function following ex vivo ischemia/reperfusion injury <xref rid="pone.0034177-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These findings suggested that specific mitochondrial abnormalities were induced by MMP-2 expression. Given these observations, we hypothesized that a second intracellular MMP-2 isoform may exist which affects cardiomyocyte structure and function, in part through interactions with mitochondria. In this report we provide a detailed characterization of a novel intracellular, N-terminal truncated 65 kDa isoform of MMP-2 generated by oxidant stress which activates a pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic innate immune response.</p>

        <title>Detection of a Mitochondrial-Associated 65 kDa MMP-2 Isoform in Three Murine Models of Cardiac Injury</title>
        <p>We recently reported that hearts from mice expressing a constitutively active full-length 68 kDa MMP-2 transgene exhibited a number of abnormalities, including systolic dysfunction and fibrosis, coupled with mitochondrial structural and functional defects <xref rid="pone.0034177-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Interestingly, as these mice aged and developed systolic dysfunction there was a large increase in endogenous (i.e. non-transgene) MMP-2 expression <xref rid="pone.0034177-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Western blots of isolated cardiac mitochondria detected a 65 kDa MMP-2 protein not derived from the epitope-tagged MMP-2 transgene and not present in age-matched litter mate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g001">Figure 1</xref>, I., A). These observations generated the hypothesis that a previously undetected intracellular MMP-2 isoform induced within the context of the failing ventricle could contribute to the observed mitochondrial defects.</p>

II. <italic>In vitro</italic> model of transient inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhosI). Partial OxPhosI was induced by incubation for 15 minutes in mitochondrial substrate glucose/pyruvate-free DMEM as detailed in Methods, followed by restoration in complete medium. More complete OxPhosI was induced by inclusion of antimycin A (2 ÂµM) and 2-deoxyglucose (10 mM) in substrate-free medium. Westerns blots of mitochondrial-enriched fractions were performed at 24, 48 and 72 hours following OxPhosI. The 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform was detected in the mitochondria-enriched fractions from the H9C2 cells subjected to partial inhibition of OxPhosI and this was increased in the fractions from cells subjected to more complete OxPhosI with antimycin A and 2-deoxyglucose.

        <p>To exclude the possibility that artifacts arising from aberrant MMP-2 transgene expression or transgene transcript processing were responsible for the observed 65 kDa MMP-2 protein, we performed Western blots of cardiac mitochondria-enriched preparations from ageing mice. We also examined cardiac mitochondrial preparations from a murine model of cardiovascular disease within a non-MMP-2 transgenic context. The mitochondrial isolation procedures used generate highly enriched preparations of mitochondria with minimal cytoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum contamination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034177.s001">Figure S1</xref>). As an important technical note, (see Methods), the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform was present in very limited amounts (â¼1â5 ng/200 Âµg mitochondrial lysate). We used an affinity capture technique to exploit the selective binding of the fibronectin-like domains of the MMP-2 protein to immobilized gelatin <xref rid="pone.0034177-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Due to the large MMP-2 binding capacity of immobilized gelatin, this technique quantitatively captures all ambient MMP-2 protein present in cellular fractions. Using this approach it is not possible to use conventional Western blot protein loading controls.</p>

        <title>Transient Oxidative Stress Induces the 65 kDa MMP-2 Isoform <italic>in Vitro</italic>

This suggested to us that the truncated 65 kDa isoform of MMP-2 was possibly generated as a consequence of reactive oxygen species production. Therefore, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular model using cardiomyoblast H9C2 cells to determine the potential effects of transient oxidative stress on formation of the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform. We established a two-step method to induce graded degrees of mitochondrial stress generated by transient inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhosI) <xref rid="pone.0034177-Cybulsky1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Lower levels of OxPhosI were induced by incubating cells in DMEM lacking D-glucose and sodium pyruvate for 15 minutes, thereby depriving the cells of substrates required for mitochondrial respiration. Higher levels of OxPhosI were induced by including the mitochondrial Complex III inhibitor antimycin A (2 ÂµM) and 2-deoxyglucose (5 mM) in the medium for 15 minutes. Thereafter, the cells were washed and cultured in complete medium for 24 to 72 hours. Western blots for MMP-2 were performed on mitochondria-enriched fractions.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g001">Figure 1</xref>, panel II., incubation in mitochondrial respiration substrate-free medium for 15 minutes followed by return to complete medium was sufficient to induce synthesis of the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform, which was readily detected at 24 hours and unchanged by 72 hours. Addition of the Complex III inhibitor antimycin A, in combination with 2-deoxyglucose, increased the levels of the mitochondria-associated 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform. Thus, a transient period (15 min) of graded inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, with subsequent ROS generation, leads to graded increases in synthesis of a 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform associated with mitochondria.</p>

The full length 68 kDa protein is encoded by a transcript generated by the canonical transcriptional start site (TSS) located in the 5â² flanking region of the MMP-2 gene. M<sup>1</sup> is located within the first exon. Mapped alternate TSSâs are located in the 3â² end of the first intron and are induced by hypoxia or epigenetic stress (arrows). Transcripts generated from these TSS encode a 65 kDa MMP-2 protein beginning at M<sup>77</sup> located within the second exon.

        <p>Sequence analysis of all deposited MMP-2 transcripts in the NCBI database identified several mRNA transcripts encoding the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform, which directly, and independently, confirms the existence of the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform as a discrete transcriptional product. Sequence BAE87867 from a cDNA library made from macaque brain and testes encodes the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform. Sequence BAG 63035 from a cDNA library of human mesenchymal stem cells treated with trichostatin and 5-azacytidine also encodes the 65 kDa isoform, consistent with epigenetic activation of a latent MMP-2 alternative promoter. Based on the length of the 5â²UTRâs of these transcripts it is possible to precisely localize the transcriptional start sites of these two transcripts to the 3â² region of the first intron of the MMP-2 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g002">Figure 2</xref>, panel I.), confirming the observations obtained with the DBTSS analysis detailed above.</p>
        <p>We directly confirmed the activity of the hypoxia-induced TSS in the first MMP-2 intron reported in the DBTSS.

        <p>Initiation of MMP-2 translation at M<sup>77</sup> generates an N-terminal truncated (NTT) isoform with a predicted molecular mass of 65 kDa; initiation of translation from M<sup>96</sup> generates an N-terminal truncated isoform with a predicted molecular mass of 62.5 kDa.

<italic>In Vitro</italic> Analysis of 65 kDa MMP-2 Isoform Cellular Trafficking</title>
        <p>To directly test the hypothesis that a truncated transcript lacking the initiator methionine would encode a 65 kDa MMP-2 protein, we used a pcDNA3.1 plasmid expressing a MMP-2 cDNA construct starting at base pair +81 relative to the ATG encoding M<sup>1</sup> of the full length MMP-2 protein.

Representative results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g004">Figure 4</xref>, panel I.

        <p>To exclude the possibility that the intracellular 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform is derived from aberrant processing, proteolytic or otherwise, of the full-length 68 kDa MMP-2, we transfected H9C2 cells with the cDNAâs encoding either the full-length 68 kDa MMP-2 or the 65 kDa NTT-MMP-2 isoforms and examined the extracellular (conditioned medium) and mitochondria-enriched compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g004">Figure 4</xref>, panel II). Full-length 68 kDa MMP-2 protein was readily detected in the extracellular (secretory) compartment, but not within the mitochondria-enriched fractions. In contrast, the 65 kDa NTT-MMP-2 protein was not present in the extracellular compartment but was present within the mitochondria-enriched fractions.</p>
        <p>These experiments demonstrate that the native, non-modified Kozak consensus sequence flanking M<sup>77</sup> is sufficient to serve as a translation initiation site and that the sequence +81 to +229 bp is a functional 5â² UTR. In some experiments we detected small amounts of a MMP-2 band with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa, suggesting that the Kozak consensus sequence flanking M<sup>96</sup> is only weakly utilized in the presence of an intact M<sup>77</sup> Kozak sequence. Equally important, these experiments demonstrate the selective cellular trafficking of the full-length and N-terminal truncated MMP-2 isoforms and indicate that there is no significant overlap in the cellular fates of these proteins. These studies also indicate that approximately one-third of the 65 kDa MMP-2 protein derived from transfection of the NTT-MMP2 cDNA into cardiomyoblast H9C2 cells is associated with mitochondria. Analyses using graded digitonin extraction of isolated mitochondria are consistent with localization of the 65 kDa MMP-2 protein within the mitochondrial intermembranous space (data not shown).</p>

        <title>The 65 kDa N-Terminal Truncated MMP-2 Induces an Innate Immune Response Transcriptome</title>
        <p>As detailed above, the 65 kDa N-terminal truncated MMP-2 activates NFAT, NF-ÎºB and IRF transcriptional factors, key components of the innate immunity transcriptional network. To determine the specific gene ontologies regulated by these transcription factors we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of H9C2 cells transfected with the 65 kDa N-terminal truncated MMP-2 cDNA and compared these to the gene ontologies regulated by transfection with the full length 68 kDa MMP-2 cDNA. Controls were transfected with an empty pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid as detailed in Methods.

Using stringent conditions of analysis 36 annotated transcripts (from a target total of 10 K) were up-regulated by 65 kDa N-terminal truncated MMP-2, while 28 annotated transcripts were down-regulated. Twenty-seven of the N-terminal truncated MMP-2 up-regulated transcripts could be assigned to ontologies with 2 â¥ components, while only twelve N-terminal truncated MMP-2 down-regulated transcripts could be assigned to ontologies with 2 â¥ components. Only six annotated transcripts were significantly up-regulated by transfection of H9C2 cells with the full-length MMP-2 construct. There were no clear ontologies in this group and no overlap with the transcripts up-regulated by N-terminal truncated MMP-2.</p>

The largest ontology consisted of viral stress induced genes and included ten components, including OAS1A, OAS1B, OASL1, IFIT1-3, and PRKRA. These genes are central components of a primary innate immune response and initiate cellular defense mechanisms, and also promote apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0034177-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The N-terminal truncated MMP-2 cDNA also induced the innate immune response transcription factors IRF7, STAT2, IFP35 and the transcriptional cofactor PARP14.

        <title>The 65 kDa MMP-2 Isoform is a Discrete Functional Entity</title>
        <p>The principal finding of this study is the identification of a novel intracellular N-terminal truncated 65 kDa isoform of MMP-2 that activates an innate immune response. The 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform is structurally and functionally distinct from the sarcomeric latent full length 68 kDa MMP-2 isoform described by Schulz and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0034177-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0034177-Ali1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The N-terminal truncated MMP-2 isoform is not present under basal conditions and is generated under conditions of oxidative stress both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The cellular trafficking of the N-terminal truncated isoform is clearly distinct from the full length MMP-2. The N-terminal truncated isoform is present in both the cytosol and mitochondrial fractions. The MMP-2 protein does not include a canonical mitochondrial targeting sequence and the precise mechanism whereby a proportion of the 65 kDa isoform enters mitochondria remains to be explored. As recently reviewed, there are additional mechanisms, including chaperone proteins, that regulate mitochondrial protein import that do not require a N-terminal targeting sequence <xref rid="pone.0034177-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Heat shock protein 90 is an important intracellular chaperone associated with transport of client proteins to the mitochondria and has been recently shown to physically interact with MMP-2 <xref rid="pone.0034177-Kriechbaumer1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Stellas1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This awaits direct experimental verification, but suggests that MMP-2 may enter mitochondria as a client protein of specific cellular chaperones.</p>

        <title>Mechanisms of 65 kDa MMP-2 Isoform Generation</title>
        <p>We considered several potential mechanisms for the generation of the 65 kDa isoform. Firstly, physiologic processing of the 68 kDa proenzyme takes place in the extracellular space and has been fully characterized <xref rid="pone.0034177-Morgunova1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Bergmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Will1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Pro-MMP-2 (68 kDa) is secreted and forms a complex on the cell surface with MT1-MMP and TIMP2. MT1-MMP cleaves the Asn<sup>66</sup>-Leu<sup>67</sup> bond in the MMP-2 prodomain, followed by autocatalytic cleavage to generate the 62 kDa active extracellular MMP-2 protein. The transfection studies detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g004">Figure 4</xref> clearly demonstrate the separate cellular targeting pathways of full-length 68 kDa MMP-2 vs. the 65 kDa isoforms. Finally, it was not possible to generate a 65 kDa MMP-2 protein by transfection with the cDNA encoding the 68 kDa isoform.</p>
        <p>In terms of alternative splicing, the European Bioinformatics Institute Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity (ASTD) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/astd">www.ebi.ac.uk/astd</ext-link>) assembled a total of seven human MMP-2 transcripts (including the full-length reference transcript). One transcript has a slightly shorter 5â²UTR and would be predicted to encode the full-length MMP-2 protein. Five transcripts are extensively truncated at the C-terminus, presumably due to premature termination of transcription, and all encode putative proteins of less than 50 kDa in size.</p>
        <p>A third mechanism for the generation of protein diversity results from the activation of alternative promoters. This is frequently coupled with the use of alternative translational start sites, thereby generating N-terminal truncated protein variants. A recent bioinformatic analysis of the human transcriptome indicates that N-terminal in-frame methionines associated with functional Kozak consensus sequences are not rare and employment of this mechanism is responsible for the N-terminal modification of several key regulatory proteins, including p53, c-myc, osteopontin and renin, among others <xref rid="pone.0034177-Kochetov1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0034177-Shinohara1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Role of the First Intron in the Expression of the 65 kDa MMP-2 Isoform</title>
        <p>We have previously reported that the first intron of the MMP-2 gene plays a critical role as a regulator of MMP-2 transcription following in vivo ischemic injury <xref rid="pone.0034177-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We demonstrated that the first intron has an enhancer function and was required for increased MMP-2 transcription mediated by NFATc2 binding to the 3â² region of the intron. Analysis of physically mapped MMP-2 transcriptional start sites and deposited MMP-2 transcripts encoding the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform identify the first intron of the MMP-2 gene as an alternative promoter, as well. Based on the ENCODE project epigenetic mark and chromatin structure analyses, <xref rid="pone.0034177-The1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, the first intron of the MMP-2 gene includes DNAse hypersensitivity sites, chromatin structures consistent with a poised promoter and the histone marks, H3K4Me3 and H3K4Me1, characteristic of active promoters and enhancers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0034177-g002">Figure 2</xref>, panel I.).</p>
        <p>A recent genome-wide study of the effects of hypoxia on activation of alternative promoters identified a hypoxia-inducible alternative MMP-2 promoter localized to the 3â² region of the first intron <xref rid="pone.0034177-Tsuchihara1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We directly confirmed this observation within the context of hypoxic H9C2 cells. Hypoxia, or accompanying redox stress, can promote genomic DNA demethylation, thereby permitting activation of intragenic (intronic) alternative promoters <xref rid="pone.0034177-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Maunakea1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Yamashita, et al. <xref rid="pone.0034177-Yamashita1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> provided a quantitative assessment of the relative transcript abundance of the full length and 65 kDa MMP-2 isoforms in a variety of adult and fetal tissues and cell lines. The transcript encoding the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform was not detected in templates derived from adult tissues, but was detected in fetal heart templates and templates from cultured fetal lung fibroblasts cultured under hypoxic conditions. In the current study, we employed the H9C2 cardiomyoblast cell line which is derived from embryonic rat heart <xref rid="pone.0034177-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

        <title>Activation of Nf-ÎºB and NFAT Signaling and Expression of a Pro-Inflammatory, Pro-Apoptotic Transcriptome</title>
        <p>We determined that transient generation of redox stress was associated with activation of NF-ÎºB and NFAT signaling cascades, an event dependent upon MMP-2 enzymatic activity. Direct demonstration that the 65 kDa isoform activates inflammatory signaling cascades was provided by transfection studies using the 65 kDa MMP-2 cDNA. One potential explanation for the activation of these signaling cascades is provided by the studies demonstrating that mitochondrial IÎºB-Î± is degraded by MMP-2, thereby freeing NF-ÎºB for transport to the nucleus. Given the finding that the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform was also present in the cytoplasm, it is conceivable that NF-ÎºB activation takes place in this compartment as well.</p>
        <p>Microarray analysis revealed that the 65 kDa MMP-2 isoform induced a remarkably focused set of innate immunity gene ontologies, the promoters of which were highly enriched in binding sites for NFAT and NF-ÎºB. These gene ontologies have been primarily reported in association with viral infection and generally promote apoptosis and recruitment of inflammatory cells. The 2â²â5â²-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS1A/B, OASL1) synthesize 2â²,5â²-linked phosphodiester bonds to polymerize ATP into adenosine oligomers and thereby activate latent RNAse L <xref rid="pone.0034177-Sarkar1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034177-Sadler1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

PRKRA activation subsequently leads to cellular growth inhibition and apoptosis.

Chemokine (C motif) ligand-2 (MCP-2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1) is one of the most studied factors leading to cardiovascular disease and plays a major role in myocarditis, ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardiomyocyte death <xref rid="pone.0034177-Zhou3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0034177-Niu1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

        <title>Construction of N-Terminal Truncated (NTT) MMP-2 cDNA</title>
        <p>The cDNA encoding the full-length human MMP-2 protein was obtained from Origene. Using the full length MMP2 cDNA as a template, NTT-MMP2 cDNA was generated with sense primer, 5â²-TGCAAGCTT-TTGTGCTGAAAGATACC3â², and antisense primer, <named-content content-type="gene">5â²-CCTCTAGACTCGAGCGGC-3â²</named-content>. This generated an NTT-MMP-2 cDNA construct (cloned into pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) starting at base pair +81 relative to the ATG encoding M<sup>1</sup> of the full length MMP-2 protein. The native Kozak consensus sequence flanking amino acid M<sup>77</sup> (aagAagA<sub>+229</sub>TGc) was not modified.</p>
        <p>An NTT-MMP-2 protein positive control was generated by transient transfection of the NTT-MMP-2 cDNA expression plasmid into CHO cells (ATCC) using standard methodology. At 48 hours following transfection, CHO cells were lysed into 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, plus protease inhibitor. The NTT-MMP-2 protein was recovered by affinity chromatography on gelatin-coupled Sepharose (Sigma) as reported <xref rid="pone.0034177-McMillan1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. A full-length MMP-2 positive control protein was generated in a similar fashion from CHO cell conditioned medium.</p>

Subconfluent H9C2 cells were washed and transiently transfected with Fugene 6 using 200 ng/well of the pHTS-NFAT and pHTS-NF-ÎºB reporter plasmids. At 24 hours the H9C2 cells were subjected to the full OxPhosI protocol, including antimycin and 2-deoxyglucose. Controls were maintained in complete medium. Luciferase activity (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) was measured after a further 48 hours of culture in complete medium. The requirement for MMP-2 activity for induction of luciferase activity was assessed by inclusion of the cyclic peptide MMP-2 inhibitor, CTTHWGFTLCGG (Calbiochem) at 25 Âµmol/l. Values are given as meansÂ±SD of triplicate to quadruplicate measurements of relative luciferase activity wherein controls are assigned a luciferase activity of 100%.</p>
