        <p id="Par1">TAF6Î´ is a pro-apoptotic splice variant of the RNA polymerase II general transcription factor, TAF6, that can dictate life vs. death decisions in animal cells. TAF6Î´ stands out from classical pro-apoptotic proteins because it is encoded by a gene that is essential at the cellular level, and because it functions as a component of the basal transcription machinery. TAF6Î´ has been shown to modulate the transcriptome landscape, but it is not known if changes in gene expression trigger apoptosis nor which TAF6Î´-regulated genes contribute to cell death. Here we used microarrays to interrogate the genome-wide impact of TAF6Î´ on transcriptome dynamics at temporal resolution. The results revealed changes in pro-apoptotic BH3-only mitochondrial genes that correlate tightly with the onset of cell death. These results prompted us to test and validate a role for the mitochondrial pathway by showing that TAF6Î´ expression causes cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. To further dissect the mechanism by which TAF6Î´ drives apoptosis, we pinpointed BIM and NOXA as candidate effectors. siRNA experiments showed that both BIM and NOXA contribute to TAF6Î´-dependent cell death. Our results identify mitochondrial effectors of TAF6Î´-driven apoptosis, thereby providing the first of mechanistic framework underlying the atypical TAF6Î´ apoptotic pathwayâs capacity to intersect with the classically defined apoptotic machinery to trigger cell death.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Apoptosis represents a genetically programmed form of cellular suicide that is crucial for normal development and homeostasis in multicellular organisms. The TAF6Î´ pathway of apoptosis can control cell death decisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, but its emerging properties distinguish it from other classical apoptotic pathways such as the Bcl-2 family, the caspase family, the death receptor pathway, or the p53 pathway. Classical pro-apoptotic genes, including tumor suppressors (e.g., p53, RB1, and APC) or members of the core apoptotic machinery (e.g., caspases, Bcl-2 family members, and death receptors) have been shown to be non-essential at the cellular level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In stark contrast to these classical apoptotic pathways, the TAF6Î´ pathway hinges on the expression of the <italic>TAF6</italic> gene that is essential for cellular viability from yeast to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. We therefore refer to TAF6Î´ as the prototypical member of type E (essential) pro-apoptotic proteins, to distinguish it from traditional type NE (non-essential) pro-apoptotic proteins that include the caspases, Bcl-2 family members, p53, and the death receptors. Another atypical feature of the TAF6Î´ pathway is that it involves coupling cell signaling pathways to cell death via subunit changes in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) general transcription factor (GTF), TFIID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, other pro-apoptotic transcription factors, such as the p53 tumor suppressor, act primarily as gene-specific DNA-binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par3">TFIID is a multi-protein complex composed of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP associated factors (TAFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. TFIID plays a well-established role in the recognition of Pol II core promoter elements, cell cycle control, and the recognition of certain modified histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Once TFIID is assembled upon the core promoter, it forms a scaffold for pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly that allows transcriptional activation. More recently, the TAFs have been shown to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recently, mutations in the histone-fold domain of the core TFIID subunit TAF6 were linked to neurogenetic disorders in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to the canonical form of TFIID, tissue-specific or signal-responsive TFIID subunits can be incorporated into functionally distinct PICs that contribute to the combinatorial control of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">TAF6Î´ is a minor inducible splice variant of the TFIID subunit TAF6 whose expression drives apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The major isoform of TAF6, TAF6Î±, is constitutively expressed in all cell types under normal culture conditions. In contrast, TAF6Î´ is not expressed under normal conditions, but can be induced experimentally using antisense splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, or under specific pro-apoptotic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. TAF6Î´ is produced via the alternative splicing of <italic>taf6</italic> pre-mRNA that results in the loss of 10 amino acids in the second Î±-helix of its histone-fold domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. TAF6Î´ therefore cannot interact with the normal dimerization partner of TAF6Î±, TAF9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, TAF6Î´ incorporates into a TFIID complex lacking TAF9 termed TFIIDÏ that drives apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TAF6Î´ specifically regulated the expression of ~1000 genes, of which more than 90% were upregulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Gene ontology analysis of the TAF6Î´-induced transcriptome signature showed an over-representation of the Notch, oxidative stress response, integrin, p53, apoptosis, p53 feedback loop, and angiogenesis cellular signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">The TAF6Î´ pathway intersects the p53 signaling hub both directly and indirectly. p53 acts primarily as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression to control cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Both the major TAF6Î± isoform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and its pro-apoptotic TAF6Î´ counterpart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> make direct physical contacts with the <italic>trans</italic>-activation domain of p53. In vitro the TAF6Î±-p53 interaction is essential for transcriptional activation by p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Likewise, in vivo the TAF6Î±-p53 interaction is important for the apoptotic and tumor suppressive functions of p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The presence of TAF6Î± vs. TAF6Î´ can influence the activation of target genes, and the presence or absence of p53 can influence the regulation of certain TAF6Î´-dependent genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Importantly, the pro-apoptotic function of TAF6Î´ is independent of p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Since the mechanisms by which TAF6Î´ triggers apoptosis are currently unknown, we have focused here on defining downstream molecular events that underlie TAF6Î´-driven cell death.</p>
      <p id="Par6">The two most extensively understood pathways of apoptosis are the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is induced by extracellular cell death ligands, such as TRAIL or FAS, and proceeds via ligand-dependent formation of the death-inducing signaling complex that leads to cleavage and activation of the initiator caspase-8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by intracellular signals, such as DNA damage, that proceeds by permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing the key event of release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm to form the apoptosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Here we employed temporal analysis of TAF6Î´-driven transcriptome dynamics to identify positive effector genes of TAF6Î´-dependent cell death. Our data show that TAF6Î´ triggers cell death primarily via the intrinsic pathway, and that BIM and NOXA contribute functionally to TAF6Î´-dependent apoptosis.</p>

        <title>TAF6Î´ drives dynamic transcriptome changes</title>
        <p id="Par7">To dissect the molecular mechanisms by which the transcription factor TAF6Î´ induces apoptosis, we employed a systems biology approach. We reasoned that the expression of functionally relevant pro-apoptotic effectors of TAF6Î´ would correlate closely in time with the induction of TAF6Î´-induced cell death. To identify such genes, we employed genome-wide microarray analysis and induced the expression of TAF6Î´ in HeLa via transfection of SSOs as we have previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We verified the induction of TAF6Î´ mRNA levels by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and analyzed apoptosis levels by flow cytometry (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As expected, SSO transfection caused steadily increased levels of TAF6Î´ mRNA (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Increased levels of apoptosis achieved statistical significance 8âh after TAF6Î´ induction and continued to increase until 18âh post induction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The transcriptome dynamics were recorded and analyzed using the ace.map algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to quantitate and classify the time-course of gene expression changes. In total, 5320 transcripts displayed statistically significant TAF6Î´-dependent regulation (Supplementary TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and the 3 most common classes of changes were transcripts transiently upregulated (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, class b; 47.7% of changes), transcripts whose expression increased constantly throughout the time-course (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, class a; 20.7%), and transcripts whose expression decreased constantly during the time-course (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, class g; 11.8%). More complex expression patterns were detected, albeit with much lower frequencies (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). To further separate transient and evolving expression profiles, we also performed an overlap analysis for all time points compared to the last 18âh time point. The results show increases in the number of genes, and the statistical significance of the overlaps, with the latest time point progressively throughout the time-course (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Significant changes were detected at all time points with the largest number of regulated genes detected at 14âh post transfection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Throughout the time-course more genes were upregulated than downregulated, reinforcing our previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> showing that TAF6Î´ acts primarily to activate gene expression (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Time-course analysis of TAF6Î´-induced cell death</title><p>HeLa cells were transfected with 100ânM control or TAF6 SSO to induce TAF6Î´ expression and harvested every 2âh after the transfection.

The size of each heatmap is proportional to the number of regulated genes (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05) and the maximum and minimum logQ values are indicated</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41419_2017_115_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e538"/></fig></p>
        <p id="Par8">To further dissect the transcriptome impact of TAF6Î´ over time, we applied gene ontology analysis to the complete set of regulated genes. We found that many of the pathways we previously identified at a single 18âh time point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> were over-represented, including oxidative stress, the p53 pathway, and importantly apoptosis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In addition, the much more extensive analyses performed here, including multiple early time points, allowed the detection of the enrichment of genes in other new pathways, for example, the transforming growth factor-Î² and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We further compared the transcriptome changes at the 18âh time point with our previous independent experimental analysis. The data show a statistically significant overlap, confirming the reproducibility of the microarray analysis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). We next followed four key pathways that we had previously shown to be over-represented upon TAF6Î´ induction, including the Notch, p53, oxidative stress, and apoptosis pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. No statistically significant changes were observed for these pathways when cells were treated with negative control SSO, but as expected they were regulated when TAF6Î´ expression was induced (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).

        <title>TAF6Î´ acts via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis</title>
        <p id="Par9">Based on the dynamic TAF6Î´-driven transcriptome landscape recorded above, we hypothesized that TAF6Î´ could act via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. To determine whether the mitochondrial pathway is important for TAF6Î´-dependent cell death, we overexpressed the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> to prevent the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, and Bax were transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells, and their protein levels were verified by western blot analysis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). TAF6Î´ levels were induced in the overexpressing cells and confirmed by PCR (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Apoptosis levels were quantitated by flow cytometry and showed that both Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> expression caused a statistically significant decrease in apoptosis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein was included as a positive control and showed the opposite effect with increased apoptosis as expected (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The inhibition of TAF6Î´-directed cell death by Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> implicates the mitochondrial pathway as an important contributor to the TAF6Î´ pathway of cell death.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Blockade of the mitochondrial pathway by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> interferes with TAF6Î´-induced apoptosis</title><p>HeLa cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-Bcl-2, pcDNA3.1-Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, pcDNA3.1-Bax, or empty pcDNA3.1 vector, and 16âh later with scrambled or TAF6 SSO.

        <p id="Par10">To obtain direct biochemical evidence that the mitochondrial pathway of cell death is triggered by TAF6Î´, we performed cell fractionation experiments to measure the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial fraction into the cytoplasmic fraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. TAF6Î´-dependent cell death was induced by transfection with SSO, and the presence of cytochrome c and control proteins in cell fractions was monitored by immunoblotting. The efficiency of the fractionation was validated using antibodies against the known mitochondrial protein VDAC-1 that was found in the mitochondrial but not cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, lanes 3 and 4 vs. 5 and 6). As expected, cytochrome c was found in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, lane 3), but not in the cytoplasmic fraction of untreated cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, lane 5). Upon induction of endogenous TAF6Î´, cytochrome c became readily detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, lane 6).

        <p id="Par11">We next used immunofluorescence as an independent experimental approach that allows visualization of cytochrome c subcellular localization in individual cells. As expected, control cells displayed cytochrome c organized characteristically within the mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In contrast, cell populations where TAF6Î´ was induced showed statistically significant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) increases in the number of cells where cytochrome c localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). We note that the release of cytochrome c was observed in cells early in the apoptotic process before the onset of gross morphological changes of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, white arrows). This observation excluded the possibility that the re-localization of cytochrome c could simply be due to late apoptotic morphological changes.

        <p id="Par12">To establish the extent to which the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is triggered in other cell types, we established cell lines of different origins overexpressing Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> using lentiviral transduction. TAF6Î´-dependent apoptosis was induced via SSO transfection and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. HeLa cervical carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma, Saos-2 osteosarcoma, and Panc-1 pancreas ductal carcinoma cells all displayed statistically significant reductions in TAF6Î´-dependent apoptosis when the mitochondrial pathway was blocked via overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These data suggest that the contribution of the mitochondrial pathway to TAF6Î´-driven cell death is not limited to HeLa but occurs in a broad range of cell types.

        <p id="Par13">Having established that the mitochondria pathway of apoptosis is triggered by TAF6Î´, we next parsed the transcriptome data to identify candidate TAF6Î´-induced apoptotic effector genes.

Based on the facts that TAF6Î´ causes the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), that TAF6Î´ induces BIM and NOXA expression with a timing that closely parallels the levels of apoptosis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), and that BIM and NOXA have established roles in the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we asked whether these genes could contribute functionally to TAF6Î´-driven cell death.</p>

        <title>The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is dispensable for TAF6Î´-mediated cell death</title>
        <p id="Par16">The above data demonstrate a role for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in TAF6Î´-directed cell death, with functional contributions from the TAF6Î´-induced genes <italic>BIM</italic> and <italic>NOXA</italic>. Nonetheless, in the time-course transcriptome analysis, certain genes with well-established roles in the extrinsic pathway were regulated by TAF6Î´. For example, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10B (TNFR10B/DR5/Killer) is a receptor for the death ligand TRAIL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and displayed a wave-like induction in response to TAF6Î´ (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Moreover, CFLAR/c-FLIP is a known inhibitor of caspase-8 activation when the extrinsic pathway is triggered, and its expression is strongly downregulated at late time points by TAF6Î´ (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). We therefore asked whether the extrinsic pathway could play a role in TAF6Î´-dependent death. We expressed the cowpox CrmA protein that specifically inhibits caspase-8, thereby blocking the extrinsic pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We first verified that CrmA specifically allows discrimination between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis in our experimental system.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par17">TAF6Î´ is a transcription factor whose expression dictates cell life vs. death decisions, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To define the mechanism by which TAF6Î´ drives apoptosis, we have performed a transcriptome-wide microarray analysis to temporally dissect gene expression changes during TAF6Î´-dependent cell death. The results revealed that genes that correlate temporally with TAF6Î´-mediated death include genes with established roles in the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Based on this observation, we tested and confirmed a role for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. The overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins blocked TAF6Î´-driven apoptosis (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), establishing the importance of mitochondrial pathway in TAF6Î´-dependent death. Furthermore, TAF6Î´-enforced death was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria as measured by subcellular fractionation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and immunofluorescent localization of cytochrome c (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These observations establish, for the first time, the importance of the mitochondrial pathway in TAF6Î´-induced apoptosis.</p>
      <p id="Par18">Having established the role of the mitochondrial pathway as essential for TAF6Î´-dependent cell death, we then identified BIM and NOXA as pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes whose expression correlates temporally with TAF6Î´-induced apoptosis. siRNAs were used to demonstrate a functional contribution of BIM and NOXA to TAF6Î´-dependent cell death (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). BIM and NOXA are induced by TAF6Î´ and their depletion significantly reduced TAF6Î´-driven apoptosis, revealing them as pro-apoptotic effectors of TAF6Î´. Although BIM and NOXA are induced by TAF6Î´ and their expression profiles correlate closely with the induction of apoptosis, it is presently unclear whether BIM or NOXA are direct or indirect targets of TAF6Î´. Further work will be required to establish the direct targets of TAF6Î´, a challenging task given that TAF6Î´ is significantly expressed only in cells destined to rapidly undergo apoptosis. It is noteworthy that NOXA expression can be activated by both p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, a finding compatible with our previous work showing that the pro-apoptotic function of TAF6Î´ is independent of p53 but shares some overlap on target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Our observation that NOXA induction is not a universal feature of TAF6Î´-induced apoptosis shows that NOXA induction is not required for death in all cell types. One possible explanation for this finding is simply that the induction of BIM alone can be sufficient for apoptosis. A second possibility is that cell-type-specific TAF6Î´-induced genes, potentially other functionally overlapping BH3-only family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, such as PUMA (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">3</xref>), may contribute to death via the mitochondrial pathway in different cellular contexts. The identification of BIM and NOXA as mitochondrial effectors of TAF6Î´ represents a fundamental step forward in the understanding of how changes in the subunit composition of the GTF, TFIID, can lead to cell death.</p>
      <p id="Par19">We have focused the current study by applying stringent biological and temporal correlation criteria to identify positive effectors of TAF6Î´-dependent apoptosis. Given the complexity of the TAF6Î´-directed transcription program, further analysis of our transcriptome data should continue to provide insights into the biological impact of this splice variant. Although we have not pursued them here, reductions in gene expression may also contribute to TAF6Î´-driven apoptosis, as exemplified by the drop in mRNA levels of the anti-apoptotic protein heme oxygenase (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In addition, while we have focused on genes whose expression correlate in a linear manner with apoptosis levels, genes whose mRNA expression is induced in a burst-like manner could also contribute to cell death. For example, the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain-only gene <italic>PUMA</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> is induced by TAF6Î´ transiently only at the 10âh time point and the pro-apoptotic <italic>p53AIP1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> gene is transiently induced at 4âh (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Further work will be required to exclude or validate a potential role for transient changes in gene expression as functionally contributing to TAF6Î´-induced apoptosis. By more deeply interrogating the transcriptome changes directed by TAF6Î´ at temporal resolution, the data provided here should also further contribute to our understanding of this pathway beyond the outcome of death that we have explored here. In this vein, we have recently used kinetic ontology enrichment analysis to identify and experimentally validate a functional link between the Notch signaling pathway and the TAF6Î´ pathway (Alvarado Cuevas et al., unpublished).</p>
      <p id="Par20">The systems biology approach employed here, correlating transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression with a phenotypic outcome, should be applicable to the dissection of other subunit changes in TFIID due to alternative splicing. Such changes in transcription complex composition have biologically important consequences as highlighted by the alternative splicing of the TFIID subunits TAF1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and TAF4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which have been shown to result in functionally distinct TFIID complexes. More broadly, the strategy we describe herein could contribute to the dissection of any subunit change within transcription factor complexes due to alternative splicing. For example, the functions of as-yet uncharacterized alternative splice variants of subunits of the Mediator complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> could be explored using the methodology we present here.</p>
      <p id="Par21">Drug resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of cancer, and the crippling of apoptotic pathways represents one of the major mechanisms by which tumor cells acquire chemoresistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. One mechanism of chemoresistance is the mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Elegant genetic studies with transgenic mice have revealed the sobering fact that the restoration of p53 expression in tumors via gene therapy was rapidly overcome by mutation of the non-essential p53 or other genes in the p53 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Likewise, mutations within the <italic>BIM</italic> gene can contribute to drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. TAF6 contrasts with previously described pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53, Bcl-2 family members, caspases, and death receptors, which are non-essential (type NE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as the major isoform of TAF6 protein is essential at the cellular level in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. From a therapeutic standpoint, the essential nature of the <italic>TAF6</italic> gene places genetic constraints on the TAF6Î´ pathway of apoptosis that reduce the possibilities to develop resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The essential nature of TAF6 therefore underscores the strategic value in exploring this pathway as a therapeutic target in cancer, since its expression cannot be extinguished to generate resistance.</p>
      <p id="Par22">In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate a predominant role for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in TAF6Î´-mediated cell death. Furthermore, by using temporal resolution transcriptome analysis, our data have identified BIM and NOXA as BH3-only proteins that are effectors of TAF6Î´-driven apoptosis.</p>

The quantitative PCR were performed with 10ng of cDNA per reaction with KlenTaq Polymerase in a buffer containing 6âmM Tris-Hcl (pH 8.3), 25âmM KCl, 4âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 75âmM Trealose, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1âmg/ml non-acetylated BSA, and 0.1Ã Sybrgreen (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). The amplification of BIM, NOXA, and ACRC was performed with the BIM-F1/BIM-R2, NOXA-F1/NOXA-R1, and ACRC-F1/ACRC-R1 primers. The <italic>hRPLPO</italic> and <italic>TBP</italic> genes were used for the normalization. The raw data were analyzed using the ÎÎCt method and the average of TBP and hRPLPO Ct values for normalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
