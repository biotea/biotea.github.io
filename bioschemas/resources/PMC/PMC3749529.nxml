        <p>The underlying mechanisms allowing <italic>West Nile virus</italic> (WNV) to replicate in a large variety of different arthropod, bird and mammal species are largely unknown but are believed to rely on highly conserved proteins relevant for viral entry and replication. Consistent with this, the integrin Î±vÎ²3 has been proposed lately to function as the cellular receptor for WNV. More recently published data, however, are not in line with this concept. Integrins are highly conserved among diverse taxa and are expressed by almost every cell type at high numbers. Our study was designed to clarify the involvement of integrins in WNV infection of cells. A cell culture model, based on wild-type and specific integrin knockout cell lines lacking the integrin subunits Î±v, Î²1 or Î²3, was used to investigate the susceptibility to WNV, and to evaluate binding and replication efficiencies of four distinct strains (New York 1999, Uganda 1937, Sarafend and Dakar). Though all cell lines were permissive, clear differences in replication efficiencies were observed. Rescue of the Î²3-integrin subunit resulted in enhanced WNV yields of up to 90â%, regardless of the virus strain used. Similar results were obtained for Î²1-expressing and non-expressing cells. Binding, however, was not affected by the expression of the integrins in question, and integrin blocking antibodies failed to have any effect. We conclude that integrins are involved in WNV infection but not at the level of binding to target cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>West Nile virus</italic> (WNV) is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and to the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. In the natural transmission cycle WNV circulates between mosquitoes as vectors and birds as reservoir hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">Hurlbut <italic>et al</italic>., 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">Work <italic>et al.</italic>, 1955</xref>). Most noticeably, WNV can infect a wide taxonomical range of vertebrate species but most of them do not sufficiently support virus replication for transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">Dietrich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">van der Meulen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Disease symptoms rarely occur, except in humans and horses where WNV infections are frequently accompanied by a mild fever (West Nile fever), which occasionally results in the development of neurological disorders with fatal outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">Mostashari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">Murgue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">Petersen &amp; Roehrig, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Determination of the factors that define host species tropism and pathogenesis includes the identification of receptors used by the virus for attachment to the cell surface and subsequent internalization, and whether this receptor is expressed at what density on the cell surface in a particular host or the respective organ or cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">Marsh &amp; Helenius, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">Schneider-Schaulies, 2000</xref>). Although a variety of putative <italic>Flavivirus</italic> receptors have been proposed to date, the array of cellular molecules required for virus entry has not been completely identified. Within the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus the early events in virus entry are best studied in <italic>Dengue virus</italic> and <italic>Japanese encephalitis virus</italic>.</p>
      <p>The cellular receptors and determinants that mediate entry of WNV are unclear to date. The ability of WNV to infect a broad range of species (mosquitoes, reptiles, birds and mammals) and virtually every <italic>in vitro</italic> cell line is notable, and is supposed to be related to cellular proteins relevant for virus entry and replication that are highly conserved among divergent host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">Brinton, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>The heterogeneous, ubiquitously distributed cell surface receptor integrin Î±vÎ²3 was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng (2004)</xref> as the functional receptor for WNV, mediating both binding and entry. However, experiments accomplished by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Medigeshi <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> resulted in a contrary conclusion. They demonstrated that WNV entry is independent of integrin Î±vÎ²3, since Î²3-integrin deficient cells could be infected successfully.</p>
      <p>Integrins are highly conserved heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix and cell-to-cell contact, and which participate in many cell cycle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Clark &amp; Brugge, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Giancotti &amp; Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Hynes, 2002</xref>). They consist of two non-covalently bound Î± and Î² glycoprotein subunits. In mammals, the combination of at least 18 Î± and eight Î² subunits yields 24 distinct integrin dimers that are expressed in large numbers on virtually all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">Gahmberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Integrins are used as receptors by several viruses, including <italic>Adenovirus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">Wickham <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), <italic>Foot-and-mouth disease virus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">Neff <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), <italic>Hantavirus</italic> (Gavrilovskaya <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">1999</xref>), human coxsackievirus A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">Roivainen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) and human echovirus 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">Nelsen-Salz <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>The overall aim of this study was to clarify the involvement of integrins in WNV infection of cells. For this purpose we have established specific integrin knockout cell lines which lack the particular integrin subunits. Results of our study clearly demonstrate that the presence of Î±v-, Î²1- or Î²3-integrins is not required for the attachment of four different WNV strains to the cell surface. However, Î²1- and Î²3-integrin expression significantly enhances virus amplification. These findings imply that other routes are used in the absence of these integrins, or that different routes are generally used in parallel.</p>

        <p>Wild-type and specifically Î±v-deficient and Î²3-deficient cells were isolated from transgenic mouse embryos with specific modifications in the particular integrin subunit genomic sequences. The Î±v- and Î²3-knockout mice had been generated to investigate integrin-associated human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Bader <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">Hodivala-Dilke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">Hynes &amp; Hodivala-Dilke, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In this study, a new Î±v-deficient mouse allele was applied. The Î±v-integrin subunit coding gene was inactivated by replacing the first exon with the <italic>E. coli</italic> LacZ gene cassette by homologous recombination (Fig. S1, available in <italic>JGV</italic> Online). With regard to the Î²3-integrin subunit, homologous recombination replaced a 1.4 kb fragment of the wild-type allele containing exon I and II by the 1.7 kb neomycin resistance cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">Hodivala-Dilke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from 12.5 day old mouse embryos. The Î²3-knockout mice are fully viable so that homozygous animals could be mated. In contrast, a homozygous Î±v knockout results in embryonic or perinatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Bader <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Therefore, heterozygous mice were mated to generate embryos with three different genotypes: Î±v (+/+) wild-type, heterozygous Î±v (+/LacZ) and homozygous Î±v-deficient (LacZ/LacZ) embryos. Embryos used for producing full Î±v-knockout cells exhibited the typical phenotype with intracerebral haemorrhages resulting from neurovascular defects as described previously (Fig. S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Bader <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">McCarty <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The generated cell lines were designated wild-type MEFs, integrin Î±v-deficient MEFs or MEF-ITGAV(â/â) and integrin Î²3-deficient MEFs or MEF-ITGB3(â/â).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-2">
        <title>Integrin expression properties of the mouse fibroblast cell lines</title>
        <p>Cell lines were characterized with respect to their integrin expression features. Integrins are expressed as heterodimers on the cell surface. Thus, the loss of the Î±v-integrin subunit results in the lack of all five Î±v-integrin receptor combinations (Î±vÎ²1, Î±vÎ²3, Î±vÎ²5, Î±vÎ²6, Î±vÎ²8). In Î²3-deficient MEFs, only the expression of integrin Î±vÎ²3 is affected, since Î±IIbÎ²3 is exclusively expressed on thrombocytes. Two additional mouse fibroblast cell lines were included in the studies: mouse kidney fibroblasts MKF-ITGB1(â/â) and their parental cell line MKF-ITGB1(flox/flox), used as a wild-type control. Both cell lines differed from the MEFs described above in their morphology and in the proliferation rate. The absence of the integrin subunit Î²1 makes the expression of 12 heterodimeric integrin combinations, i.e. integrin Î±vÎ²1 and integrins Î±(1â11)Î²1, impossible.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the Î±v-, Î²1- and Î²3-integrin deficiency of these cell lines, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) immunofluorescence measurements and flow cytometry were accomplished. Confocal laser scanning microscopy allowed visualizing the integrin distribution in focal contact points on the cell surface of the mouse fibroblasts, in particular around the cell protrusions and cell-to-cell-contacts. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1(a)</xref> imaging showed that Î±v- and Î²3-integrins assembled in a typical focal contact manner, i.e. isolated bar-shaped dots localized on the cell surface, whereas Î²1-integrins presented a more elongated assembly similar to those of stress fibres with which they are connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">Kusano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>

        <p>Flow cytometry was carried out to estimate integrin expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Results were generally consistent with the PCR data (not shown) and with IFA results, and verified the absence of Î±v- and Î²3-integrins on MEF-ITGAV(â/â), of Î²1-integrins on MKF-ITGB1(â/â) and of Î²3-integrins on MEF-ITGB3(â/â) cells. Interestingly, expression levels of individual integrins were not affected by the integrin subunit knockdowns, e.g. Î²1-integrin was not upregulated as compensation in Î²3-integrin deficient cells, and vice versa, which is consistent with what has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">Bader <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">Hodivala-Dilke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>Integrin deficient cells are not resistant to WNV infection</title>
        <p>In a first experiment the ability of WNV to infect and to replicate in cells lacking the Î±v- or Î²3-integrin subunit was assessed in a qualitative approach. The experiment was designed to confirm results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng (2004)</xref> and to study whether there are strain dependent differences in the infection ability. Wild-type MEFs were used as a control cell line. Since Î²1-integrins had not been found to affect WNV infectivity greatly, Î²1-deficient cells were also included in the experiment as a control. Cells were infected with four WNV strains: two WNV lineage 1 strains (New York 1999, Dakar) and two lineage 2 strains (Uganda 1937, Sarafend) and incubated for 5 days (time period usually used for propagation). A low m.o.i. was chosen to allow long-term virus propagation. Relative amounts of viral RNA content in the supernatants were quantified by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To calculate the yields of infectious virus particles, the titres of representative samples, based on cycle threshold (CT) values, were determined by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, results clearly show that all cell lines were permissive for WNV and that all strains used in this study were able to replicate in the above-mentioned cell lines. Obviously, replication of WNV could not be prevented completely by the absence of one or several integrins. There were, however, distinct and reproducible differences in the CT values measured after 5 days. Significantly reduced virus yields were found in the supernatant of Î²3-deficient MEFs when infected with the WNV strains New York and Dakar relative to wild-type MEFs. Amplification of WNV Dakar in Î±v-deficient cells was also significantly lower. The highest replication efficiencies were seen in Î²1-deficient cells which were comparable to those found in Vero cells (data not shown). The significantly enhanced virus propagation in comparison to wild-type cells can presumably be attributed to the fact that MKF-ITGB1(â/â) were derived from a different tissue and had been immortalized. Titration results confirmed these findings, although amplification rates of infectious virus particles in terms of TCID<sub>50</sub> titres were lower than the amplification of viral genome equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>).</p>

        <p>Although our findings had shown that Î±v-, Î²1- and Î²3-integrins were not essential for a productive WNV infection, it became evident that the replication in Î²3-integrin defective cells was significantly reduced. To unambiguously confirm this finding, and to exclude possible side effects the mouse line background may have on derived mouse fibroblast, a functional rescue was accomplished by transfecting MEF-ITGB3(â/â) cells with an expression plasmid encoding the full mouse integrin Î²3-subunit (designated Î²3-rescue MEFs or MEF-ITGB3(â/â) rescue) followed by zeocin selection for stably transfected cells.

Forty eight hours after infection an obvious cytopathic effect was seen in the Î²3-rescue MEFs, whereas Î²3-deficient MEFs seemed less affected, when compared to mock infected control cells. Clear differences in the amount of viral RNA two days after infection were observed. The level of viral genome containing particles in the supernatant of the Î²3-expressing rescue cells was always higher than in the Î²3-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The cell line and the virus strain were found to have a highly significant effect on viral yields.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current understanding of WNV binding to and entry into host cells is rather incomplete. Previous studies using host gene knockdown assays as well as specific antibody binding competition assays suggested that integrins, in particular integrin Î±vÎ²3, act as the functional receptors for this virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng, 2004</xref>). In line with this, CS-1 melanoma cells, highly differentiated non-invasive tumour cells that do not synthesize Î²3- and Î²5-integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">Knudsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>), were non-permissive to WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng, 2004</xref>). However, contradicting results were found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Medigeshi <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>, who were able to infect CS-1 melanoma cells with WNV with efficiencies comparable to those in other cell lines. It is known that integrin expression on CS-1 melanoma cells can be induced by certain stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>).</p>
      <p>In order to resolve the inconsistent results on the involvement of integrin in WNV infection of cells we have established distinct specific integrin subunit deficient cell lines. The integrin knockout and rescued mouse fibroblast cell lines appear to provide a more reliable model than CS-1 melanoma cells. The ablation of one integrin subunit leads to the absence of all corresponding integrin heterodimer combinations on the cell surface. Integrin heterodimers, which fulfil important cellular functions, are usually encoded redundantly by more than one subunit combination. Whether the loss of either the Î±v-, Î²1- or Î²3-subunit modulated the expression levels of other integrin heterodimer combinations was beyond the scope of this study. The cell culture model was designed: (i) to study the involvement of integrins and the extent to which they participate in WNV replication, (ii) to identify which subunit is involved, (iii) to clarify their function in WNV binding, and (iv) to investigate whether or not specific traits of lineages or even strains determine the affinity to these surface molecules.</p>
      <p>In this study, there was no evidence that WNV binding to mouse fibroblasts was in any way influenced by the expression of the integrins when integrin expressing and non-expressing cells were compared as to their binding efficiencies. Equally, application of integrin specific antibodies that block integrin binding to their ligands failed to inhibit virus binding and infection of cells, even at high concentrations. This is in contrast to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng (2004)</xref>, who inhibited to a large extent, though not completely, both binding and internalization of WNV by application of function blocking antibodies. It can be argued that the different outcome of our study may result from the use of different cell lines and antibodies. Thus, the overriding importance of integrin Î±vÎ²3, at least its role as a binding receptor, must be denied.</p>
      <p>Our results clearly show that the integrins in question are not a prerequisite for an infection of cells by WNV. To enhance the comparability of results on how Î²1- and Î²3-integrin expression affects WNV infectivity, and to facilitate a direct quantitative assessment, deficient cell lines were directly compared with their corresponding integrin expressing cell lines. This allowed any background differences between cell lines that may arise from possible differences between mouse strains to be excluded. Although we were not able to confirm that integrins participate in virus adsorption to cells, it could be demonstrated in this study that integrins enhance replication of WNV in the mouse fibroblast cells. The replication efficiency of WNV was clearly reduced by 90â% (at maximum) by the lack of either the Î²1- or Î²3-integrin subunit. These results were generally in accordance with those obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng (2004)</xref>, showing the loss of the Î²3-integrin subunit had the greatest effect on cell permissiveness in terms of viral yields. Since the expression of both Î²-integrins seems to affect virus replication it is likely that several integrin receptors may be used in parallel by WNV and that in the absence of specific integrins the virus can use other members of the integrin family.</p>
      <p>Our experimental approach for the infection assays was not able to distinguish whether integrins are required for entry or for another stage of the WNV replication cycle. An increasing number of viruses have implicated integrins with different functions beyond virus binding, e.g. entry by initiating endocytosis, rearrangement and modification of the cytoskeleton, activation of signalling pathways or by providing a more stable environment for the virus by downregulating the innate immune response mechanisms of the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). For example, echovirus 1 and coxsackievirus A9 enter cells via integrin-mediated endocytosis regulated by a dynamin-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">HeikkilÃ¤ <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">PietiÃ¤inen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), <italic>Dengue fever virus</italic> binding to the integrin Î±vÎ²3 induces actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and Herpes simplex virus is routed to lipid rafts and dynamin-2-dependent acidic compartments upon binding integrin Î±vÎ²3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">Gianni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010b</xref>). However, there is currently no evidence that HSV directly interacts with integrin Î±vÎ²3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">Gianni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010a</xref>).</p>
      <p>Integrins are not only the main activators in linking extracellular stimuli to the cytoskeleton, inducing actin rearrangement, and in regulating the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">Clark &amp; Brugge, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">Giancotti &amp; Ruoslahti, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">Yamada &amp; Miyamoto, 1995</xref>). Remarkable in terms of viral entry is their ability to guide the trafficking of other signalling receptors, in particular of growth factor receptors, as well as cellular structures such as cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, and they influence the way by which growth factor receptors respond to their ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">Caswell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">Walker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Integrins are concentrated in lipid rafts which are docking sites for many signalling molecules. Hence they may also function as modulators of the intensity of multiple other signalling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">Baron <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">Giancotti &amp; Tarone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">Krauss &amp; Altevogt, 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our findings suggest specific functions of integrins in WNV infection: (i) integrins may interact as a co-receptor directly with the virus in combination with another surface receptor, or (ii) they may not directly interact with the virus but enhance or block other cell surface molecules important for WNV binding and entry, or may improve accessibility to other surface receptors for virus binding, or (iii) integrins may merely be involved in the downstream signal transduction, which either initiates viral uptake or modifies the cellular milieu for virus replication in a post-entry step. Though an involvement of integrins in another stage of the virus replication cycle cannot be excluded, the surface localization of these cell adhesion molecules leads to the assumption that integrins respond to virus binding, and may therefore be involved in virus internalization rather than in the downstream replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">Triantafilou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Since disagreement in the essentials of the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">Chu &amp; Ng (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">Medigeshi <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> in respect of the involvement of integrin Î±vÎ²3 in WNV entry was thought to result from the genetic differences between WNV strains, four representative strains of the two major WNV lineages were selected for this present study, including both of those used in these two studies. Observations made from infection experiments with flaviviruses suggest that receptor binding and entry characteristics may depend on the serotype or strain used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">Bielefeldt-Ohmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). However, our data do not adumbrate strain dependent effects in WNV regarding the usage of integrins during attachment, entry or the replication process.</p>
      <p>Altogether, our data indicate that integrins play a significant role in WNV infection of cells. Still, the understanding of the WNVâintegrin relationship is superficial and needs further investigation in order to convincingly depict the complex interaction. The specification of the molecules involved and the entry-associated signalling processes that finally lead to virus internalization will definitely help to elucidate the first steps in WNV infection, and to identify the factors that modulate the susceptibility to and the transmission efficiency of WNV.</p>

          <p>Cells were stained with integrin subunit specific antibodies to visualize integrin expression patterns by confocal laser scanning microscopy and to evaluate integrin expression levels by flow cytometry analysis (see supplementary material for details).</p>

          <title>Long-term replication assay.</title>
          <p>Vero cells and mouse fibroblasts prior to confluency (80â95â%) were infected with m.o.i. 0.05 p.f.u. per cell in a total volume of 1 ml virus diluted in medium without FBS. Virus absorption was allowed for 1 h at 37 Â°C with gentle agitation every 20 min. After addition of fresh maintenance medium, supplemented with 25 mM HEPES and 2â% FBS, incubation proceeded at 37 Â°C. Five days after infection, the supernatant was harvested and cleared from cell debris by low speed centrifugation.</p>

          <title>Binding assay.</title>
          <p>Cells were seeded on 12-well culture dishes before infection. In a first approach the exact seeding concentration of each cell line was determined to give same cell densities per well 24 h later when infected (1Ã10<sup>5</sup> MEF-ITGB3(â/â) and MEF-ITGB3(â/â)rescue, or 5Ã10<sup>5</sup> MKF-ITGB1(â/â) and MKF-ITGB1(flox/flox)). After pre-incubation at 4 Â°C cells were washed with FBS-free medium containing 0.05 g BSA fraction V l<sup>â1</sup> before inoculation with virus at 10 p.f.u. per cell (ITGB3 experiments) or 2 p.f.u. per cell (ITGB1 experiments). Incubation was allowed for 1 h at 4 Â°C with intermittent agitation. To remove unbound virus particles the virus suspension was aspirated and cells were washed three times with PBS. Finally, cell monolayers were dissolved in TRIzol (Invitrogen). For the application of integrin blocking antibodies the experiments were instead carried out on 24-well culture dishes with half the cell number.</p>

          <title>Replication assay.</title>
          <p>Following the above described procedure, after binding at 4 Â°C for 1 h, plates were shifted to 37 Â°C and cells were incubated for 30 min to allow endocytosis. Cells were washed once with PBS before being treated with acid glycine buffer pH 3.0 for 1 min to inactivate non-internalized virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">Hung <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), followed by washing twice with PBS. Finally, fresh maintenance medium containing 2â% FBS was added to the wells. The culture supernatant was harvested after incubation at 37 Â°C for 48 h.</p>

          <title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR.</title>
          <p>Viral and total RNA extracts were obtained as described in the supplementary material. Five microlitres of the eluted viral RNA were used to determine viral genome containing particle numbers by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">Eiden <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref>. For quantifying the WNV genome copy numbers through a calibration curve, serial dilutions of a synthetic RNA control were run in parallel. The qRT-PCR was run on the Mx 3000P QPCR (Stratagene) or CFX96 Real-Time Systems (Bio-Rad).</p>

          <title>Statistical analysis.</title>
          <p>Statistical significance values of results were determined using JMP version 3.2.1 (SAS Institute, USA). Data from infection experiments were log-transformed, if necessary, to stabilize variances with respect to parametric statistical testing. The results of all parametric ANOVA tests were checked with the non-parametric ScheirerâRayâHare test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">Scheirer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>). If the results of the parametric ANOVA were in accordance with the ScheirerâRayâHare test, linear contrasts were tested with the parametric ANOVA to identify significant differences of means among groups.</p>
