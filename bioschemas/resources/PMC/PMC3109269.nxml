      <abstract>
        <p>Casein kinase 1 delta and epsilon (CK1Î´/É) are key regulators of diverse cellular growth and survival processes including Wnt signaling, DNA repair and circadian rhythms. Recent studies suggest that they have an important role in oncogenesis. RNA interference screens identified CK1É as a pro-survival factor in cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and the CK1Î´/É-specific inhibitor IC261 is remarkably effective at selective, synthetic lethal killing of cancer cells. The recent development of the nanomolar CK1Î´/É-selective inhibitor, PF670462 (PF670) and the CK1É-selective inhibitor PF4800567 (PF480) offers an opportunity to further test the role of CK1Î´/É in cancer. Unexpectedly, and unlike IC261, PF670 and PF480 were unable to induce cancer cell death. PF670 is a potent inhibitor of CK1Î´/É in cells; nanomolar concentrations are sufficient to inhibit CK1Î´/É activity as measured by repression of intramolecular autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of disheveled2 proteins and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Likewise, small interfering RNA knockdown of CK1Î´ and CK1É reduced Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling without affecting cell viability, further suggesting that CK1Î´/É inhibition may not be relevant to the IC261-induced cell death. Thus, while PF670 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling, it only modestly inhibits cell proliferation. In contrast, while sub-micromolar concentrations of IC261 neither inhibited CK1Î´/É kinase activity nor blocked Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in cancer cells, it caused a rapid induction of prometaphase arrest and subsequent apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. In a stepwise transformation model, IC261-induced killing required both overactive Ras and inactive p53. IC261 binds to tubulin with an affinity similar to colchicine and is a potent inhibitor of microtubule polymerization. This activity accounts for many of the diverse biological effects of IC261 and, most importantly, for its selective cancer cell killing.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Casein kinase 1 (CK1) is a family of ubiquitous serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that regulates diverse cellular processes, including Wnt signaling, circadian rhythms, cellular signaling, membrane trafficking, cytoskeleton maintenance, DNA replication, DNA damage and RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vielhaber and Virshup, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knippschild <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Price, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Virshup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Small-molecule inhibitors that were developed to antagonize CK1 kinase activity have been valuable tools in dissecting the role of CK1 in these processes. However, one caveat with all small-molecule inhibitors (and indeed, with most perturbants) is that they may often antagonize the function of more than one cellular target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hampton, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of human cancers. Targeting key mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway such as CK1Î´/É may inhibit tumor progression. Notably, several recent studies have highlighted the role of CK1Î´ and CK1É in cell survival and cancer progression. Kinome RNA interference (RNAi) screens showed that knockdown of CK1É slowed cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grueneberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Stockwell, 2008</xref>). CK1Î´, a close homolog of CK1É, has also been implicated in pancreatic cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brockschmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In a number of these studies, data obtained from the RNAi knockdown of CK1Î´/É were corroborated with the use of a CK1Î´/É-specific inhibitor, IC261 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brockschmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Stockwell, 2008</xref>). IC261 is a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK1Î´ and CK1É with less effect on CK1Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrend <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mashhoon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified protein it has a reported half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) in the range of 1â25âÎ¼ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrend <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), but inhibition of CK1 in cultured cells most likely requires concentrations at the high end of this range. In a number of studies, cultured cells were treated with IC261 at concentrations of 25â100âÎ¼. For instance, we demonstrated that 100âÎ¼ IC261 partially blocked the CK1Î´/É-dependent degradation of the circadian regulator Per2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eide <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), a finding consistent with genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kloss <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Price <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of CK1Î´/É with 40âÎ¼ IC261 negatively modulates Wnt signaling by strengthening the interactions of proteins in the Î²-catenin destruction complex with both axin and Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, IC261 has also been reported to induce cellular phenotypes at much lower doses. It has been reported that 0.4â1âÎ¼ IC261 causes cell cycle arrest, mitotic spindle defects and apoptosis, with the degree of cell killing dependent on p53 status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrend <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">StÃ¶ter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). While these data appeared to be consistent with a key role for CK1 in chromosome segregation, subsequent CK1Î´/É-specific RNAi knockdown studies have not produced such dramatic effects on the cell cycle and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brockschmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Stockwell, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, new small-molecules that inhibit CK1Î´/É activity with greater potency have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). One of these compounds, PF670462 (herein referred to as PF670), with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 80â130ân <italic>in vitro</italic>, was shown to alter CK1Î´/É-dependent processes in circadian rhythms in both cultured cells and in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sprouse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A second compound, PF4800567 (herein referred to as PF480) is selective for CK1É, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 32ân for CK1É and 711ân for CK1Î´ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In the present study, we compared the efficacy of PF670, PF480 and IC261 on the repression of CK1Î´/É-dependent Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and inhibition of cancer cell growth. Consistent with its IC<sub>50</sub>, the dual kinase inhibitor PF670 is three orders of magnitude more potent than IC261 at inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Notably, at sub-micromolar concentrations that effectively induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, IC261 failed to inhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> CK1Î´/É kinase activity. Instead, we find that IC261 blocks mitotic progression by direct inhibition of microtubule polymerization. Conversely, PF670 inhibited cellular CK1Î´/É but did not induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Our findings have ramifications for studies employing sub-micromolar concentrations of IC261 as CK1Î´/É inhibitors and highlight its potential as a cancer selective drug that acts through inhibition of microtubule polymerization.</p>

        <title>IC261 selectively suppresses human cancer cell growth</title>
        <p>As CK1Î´/É activity has been reported to be essential for survival of cancer cell lines, including some that are dependent on Î²-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grueneberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Stockwell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), we treated a panel of cancer cells with IC261 to assess its spectrum of activity. Consistent with previous reports, 100ân IC261 caused a near-total growth arrest of most of the cell lines that we screened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the two lines analyzed in more detail, the acute growth inhibition of HEK293 and HT1080 cells was characterized by caspase 3-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Several studies indicated that IC261 might selectively kill transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrend <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Stockwell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). To confirm and extend this finding, we utilized a series of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) either immortalized with hTert, partially transformed with hTert, small t antigen, and H-Ras<sup>V12</sup>-ER, or fully transformed by the further addition of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rangarajan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We exposed these HMEC-derived cells to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)- or IC261-supplemented culture media with 0.13âÎ¼ 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; to activate H-Ras<sup>V12</sup>-ER) for 72âh. IC261 selectively suppressed the growth of fully transformed HMEC-derived cells, but not their non-transformed counterparts, at sub-micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The IC261-induced growth arrest of HMEC-derived cells appeared to require concurrent activation of the Ras signaling pathway and deregulation of the p53 pathway, as these cells remained viable in IC261-supplemented culture media without 4-OHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We observed similar results with a series of BJ-derived fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure S1). Taken together, our data confirm and extend prior reports that IC261 potently and selectively inhibits cancer cell growth.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>PF670 is a weak inhibitor of proliferation</title>
        <p>IC261 is widely used as a selective inhibitor of CK1Î´/É, albeit at micromolar concentrations, and the preceding data are consistent with the model that inhibition of CK1Î´ and/or CK1É causes cancer cell death. It would be desirable to have additional small-molecule inhibitors of CK1Î´/É with higher affinities to further test this hypothesis. PF670, a recently developed CK1Î´/É inhibitor, inhibits CK1Î´/É at nanomolar concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, the compound is bioavailable, as it can induce a phase delay in circadian rhythms in cells, tissues, mice and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sprouse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). If inhibition of CK1Î´/É and Wnt/Î²-catenin is indeed responsible for the cytotoxic effects of IC261, PF670 should be an even better anti-cancer agent as it inhibits CK1Î´/É at concentrations that are three orders of magnitude lower.</p>
        <p>We therefore, tested PF670 on two representative cell lines that are sensitive to IC261. Unexpectedly, we found that 1âÎ¼ PF670 only modestly reduced the growth of HEK293 and HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a, b and c</xref>). Furthermore, PF670 failed to induce either an acute cell cycle arrest at G2/M (in HEK293 cells) or a sub-G1 population indicative of apoptosis (HT1080 cells), as was observed within 24âh of exposure to IC261 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In the same assays, 1âÎ¼ IC261 completely inhibited the growth of these cells, as demonstrated by both colony-forming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and viable cell count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and c</xref>) analyses. These data suggest that either PF670 did not inhibit CK1Î´/É and subsequently Î²-catenin activity in these cell lines, or that CK1Î´/É and Wnt/Î²-catenin inhibition is irrelevant for the cytotoxic effects exhibited by IC261.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>PF670 is a more potent inhibitor than IC261 of CK1Î´/É activity</title>
        <p>To examine the first possibility, we tested the effects of PF670 on CK1Î´/É activity and the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. CK1Î´/É is required for high-level Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sakanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryja <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Using HEK293 cells expressing Wnt3A and containing an integrated luciferase gene driven by Î²-catenin responsive promoter (HEK293<sup>STF3A</sup>) as a Wnt/Î²-catenin reporter assay, the activities of IC261 and PF670 were compared. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, PF670 inhibited Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling with an IC<sub>50</sub> of â¼17ân, while IC261 had an IC<sub>50</sub> of â¼36âÎ¼, consistent with previously reported values for CK1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Notably, PF670 gave near maximal inhibition of Î²-catenin activity at 1âÎ¼ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), but had only a small effect on proliferation at this concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a, b and c</xref>), whereas IC261 did not significantly repress Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling at this concentration but had strong growth inhibitory activity toward HEK293 cells.</p>
        <p>Thus far, our data suggest that PF670 represses Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling by inhibition of CK1Î´/É, while IC261 at 1âÎ¼ induces cancer cytotoxicity without inhibiting Î²-catenin activity. However, as transactivation of a Î²-catenin responsive promoter is an indirect measure of CK1Î´/É activity, we investigated whether phosphorylation of CK1Î´/É targets <italic>in vivo</italic> could also be inhibited by these drugs at 1âÎ¼. To directly test CK1Î´/É activity we made use of the fact that the kinase autophosphorylates its carboxyl-terminus regulatory domain in an intramolecular reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cegielska <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This reaction is continuously reversed by cellular protein phosphatases that are sensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cegielska <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivers <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), and addition of 50ân calyculin A consequently results in a rapid and distinct electrophoretic mobility shift of endogenous CK1Î´ and CK1É due to unopposed phosphorylation. PF670 inhibited <italic>in vivo</italic> CK1É and CK1Î´ carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation completely at 1âÎ¼ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2). Notably, strong inhibition of <italic>in vivo</italic> CK1Î´/É autophosphorylation in this short-term assay was achieved with as low as 100ân PF670, consistent with its effect on Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling (data not shown). In contrast, 1âÎ¼ IC261 did not result in detectable inhibition of autophosphorylation by CK1, consistent with its failure to inhibit Î²-catenin activity at this concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Although 1âÎ¼ IC261 can be cytotoxic to these cells, in the short time frame of this experiment (up to 60âmin) no detrimental effect on cell viability or protein abundance was seen.</p>
        <p>The inhibition of autophosphorylation by PF670 indicates the compound regulates intracellular CK1 activity. To examine the effect of the compounds on CK1 activity towards known Wnt pathway substrates, the phosphorylation of the Wnt regulator disheveled (Dvl) was examined. CK1É phosphorylates Dvl proteins on multiple sites in response to Wnt signaling, inducing an electrophoretic mobility shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). We exposed HEK293<sup>STF3A</sup> cells to PF670 or IC261 for 30âmin and determined the effect on Dvl2 phosphorylation. Nanomolar concentrations of PF670 inhibited the electrophoretic mobility shift of Dvl2, while &gt;10âÎ¼ IC261 was required to achieve the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, we examined the differential activity of the CK1 inhibitors on the expression of <italic>Axin2</italic>, an endogenous target of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Consistent with their effect on CK1 autophosphorylation and Dvl2 phosphorylation, after a 6-h incubation, nanomolar concentrations of PF670 but micromolar concentrations of IC261 were able to inhibit the expression of <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of CK1Î´/É, while capable of inhibiting Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, does not block cell cycle progression or induce cell death.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of CK1Î´/É phenocopies PF670 and not IC261</title>
        <p>To test inhibition of CK1Î´/É activity via an independent approach, we performed RNAi knockdown of both CK1Î´ and CK1É levels in the HEK293<sup>STF3A</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, we observed significant repression of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling upon reduction of CK1Î´ and CK1É abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). However, the combined partial knockdown of CK1Î´ and CK1É levels with small interfering RNA (siRNA) failed to induce cell cycle arrest and/or cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Knockdown of CK1Î´/É gave similar results to those seen with treatment with 1âÎ¼ PF670, and distinct from those seen with 1âÎ¼ IC261.</p>
        <p>Several RNA interference studies have demonstrated that a number of shRNAs directed against CK1É but not CK1Î´ can slow cancer cell growth, while both IC261 and PF670 inhibit both CKIÎ´ and CK1É. To investigate whether isolated CK1É inhibition could be more toxic than combined CK1Î´/É inhibition, we tested a different, CK1É-selective inhibitor, PF4800567 (PF480), that relatively spares CK1Î´ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Walton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We confirmed that PF480 selectively inhibited CK1É using the <italic>in vivo</italic> autophosphorylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). PF480 was less effective than PF670 at inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). These data suggest that CK1Î´ and CK1É have additive roles in promoting Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. The CK1É-selective PF480 displayed no anti-proliferative effects at concentrations that completely inhibited CK1É activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c and d</xref>). We conclude that combined inhibition of CK1Î´ and CK1É is required for maximal inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b, c and e</xref>), and that effective isolated pharmacologic inhibition of CK1É does not significantly alter the proliferation of cells that are sensitive to IC261.</p>

        <title>PF670 and IC261 have divergent effects on gene expression</title>
        <p>To assess whether PF670 and IC261 share a common mechanism of cancer cytotoxicity, we studied their effect on gene expression at near lethal doses. In the gastric cancer cell line AGS, the GI<sub>50</sub> of IC261 was found to be 340ân, while PF670 failed to inhibit growth of AGS cells even at 10âÎ¼ (data not shown). Cells were treated with DMSO (&lt;0.1%), 10âÎ¼ PF670 or 340ân IC261 for 6âh, respectively, before gene expression profiling. We analyzed the gene signature profiles by significance analysis of microarrays (with false discovery rate (FDR)â©½0.01%) and observed that only five genes were in common among the 186 and 86 genes differentially regulated by PF670 and IC261, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with our quantitative PCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), the Wnt signaling-related genes <italic>Fzd6</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> were significantly downregulated by PF670 but not IC261 (Supplementary Table S1). Taken together, gene expression analysis supports the conclusion that PF670 and IC261 regulate distinctive intracellular pathways.</p>

        <title>IC261 is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization</title>
        <p>The data indicate that IC261 induces both mitotic arrest and cytotoxicity independent of its inhibition of CK1Î´/É. Thus, there should be another widely expressed protein to which IC261 binds at nanomolar, rather than micromolar concentrations. To determine other potential cancer-associated cellular targets of IC261, we more closely examined the IC261 G2/M arrest phenotype. Time-lapse video microscopy was performed using asynchronous histone 2B-GFP-expressing HeLa cells. DMSO- or PF670 (1âÎ¼)-treated HeLa cell progress normally through mitosis and give rise to a pair of daughter cells (Supplementary Video S1 and S2). However, 1âÎ¼ IC261 induced a prometaphase arrest of HeLa cells followed by apoptosis (Supplementary Video S3).</p>
        <p>Prometaphase arrest is triggered by the spindle assembly checkpoint and can be caused by a number of compounds that block proper assembly and attachment of mitotic microtubules to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weaver and Cleveland, 2005</xref>). Different drugs produce distinctive effects on mitotic spindle formation that can readily be assessed. The effect of IC261 was therefore compared with other compounds that block the cell cycle at prometaphase, including inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 and the mitotic kinesin EG5, as well as the microtubule polymerization inhibitors nocodazole and colchicine, and the microtubule stabilizer taxol. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> illustrates, 1âÎ¼ IC261 phenocopied the effect of nocodazole and colchicine, and blocked formation of mitotic spindles in the presence of condensed chromosomes.</p>
        <p>To test directly whether IC261 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> microtubule polymerization inhibitor, the effect of IC261 on microtubule assembly was determined <italic>in vitro</italic>. IC261 directly inhibited the polymerization of purified porcine brain tubulin with equimolar potency to the microtubule binding agents, colchicine and nocodazole, while PF670 had no effect on microtubule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). There are two well-characterized sites on tubulin that destabilize polymerization, the vinca site and the colchicine site (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). We find that IC261 competes with [<sup>3</sup>H]colchicine for binding to tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Taken together, while the biological effects of PF670 appear to be explained by inhibition of CK1Î´/É, the cytotoxicity of IC261 is a direct consequence of its ability to bind to the colchicine site on tubulin and thereby inhibit microtubule polymerization.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Genetic ablation and pharmacological intervention represent two complementary approaches that are widely used to dissect the role(s) of druggable cellular targets such as protein kinases in tumorigenesis. The ability to cross-validate RNA knockdown and drug studies can provide valuable confirmation of appropriate targets and may help exclude off target effects. A number of recent studies have found that shRNAs that knockdown CK1É slowed cancer cell growth. Additionally, these and other studies found that the CK1Î´/É-selective inhibitor IC261 is a potent transformation-selective anti-cancer agent. Here, we independently validated the potency of IC261 as an anti-cancer drug and confirmed that it induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a wide range of transformed cells at nanomolar concentration. We find that IC261 acts by a CK1Î´/É- and Wnt/Î²-catenin-independent induction of the spindle assembly checkpoint. This prometaphase arrest initially suggested IC261 might be inhibiting a mitotic kinase. However, in prior surveys, IC261 did not inhibit a number of mitotic kinases, including Polo-like kinase 1, Aurora B and C, and Chk1 and Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fedorov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Instead, our data indicate that IC261 inhibits microtubule polymerization at doses far below those needed to inhibit CK1, a finding consistent with induction of prometaphase arrest. The effect is due to direct binding of IC261 to the colchicine-binding site on Î²-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Intriguingly, several other trimethoxy phenolic compounds that are chemically similar to IC261 have been reported to be microtubule polymerization inhibitors with potent anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This suggests that the trimethoxy phenol moiety of these anti-mitotic compounds is critical for their shared microtubule depolymerization property.</p>
      <p>IC261 selectively suppressed growth of both transformed fibroblasts and HMEC-derived cells, but not their non-transformed counterparts, consistent with reports indicating that IC261 may be transformation selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrend <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Stockwell, 2008</xref>). This highlights the selective sensitivity of transformed over non-transformed cells to microtubule poisons that trigger spindle assembly checkpoints. We confirmed that activation of RAS combined with inactivation of p53 was required to fully sensitize cells to killing by IC261. This effect was seen in both fibroblasts and HMEC. The mechanism underlying this sensitization is not well understood. Spindle poisons can lead to damaged DNA, an effect that may be more pronounced in transformed than in non-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Similarly, RAS and p53 mutations can cooperate to cause chromosome breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agapova <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Microtubule poison-induced DNA damage has been postulated to lead to caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008</xref>). One speculative model is therefore, that chromosome damage occurs in response to prolonged exposure to IC261 and other microtubule poisons and RAS activation and p53 loss potentiates this damage. Excessive damage may lead to caspase activation and cell death. Further studies will be required to fully understand this synthetic lethality.</p>
      <p>The anti-cancer activity of IC261 is largely independent of its described inhibitory effects on CK1Î´/É activity. We confirmed the new compound PF670 as a potent inhibitor of CK1Î´/É activity and CK1Î´/É-dependent processes <italic>in vivo</italic>, including Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. At concentrations that effectively inhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> CK1Î´/É kinase activity, PF670 did not cause cytotoxicity or cell cycle arrest. In contrast, at concentrations that effectively killed human transformed/cancer cells, IC261 did not inhibit CK1Î´/É. Consistent with this data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> recently demonstrated that PF670 preferentially inhibits proliferation of Î²-catenin-positive MCF7 cells as compared to Î²-catenin-negative MDA-MB-453 cells, albeit 12-fold less effectively than IC261. Taken together, we conclude that effective inhibition of CK1Î´/É by PF670 or RNAi impairs Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and Dvl phosphorylation but does not lead to significant cell cycle arrest or cytotoxicity.</p>
      <p>Why do multiple shRNA screens find an anti-proliferative effect of CK1É knockdown, while we see different results with siRNA and perhaps with PF480 and PF670? Knockdown by shRNA can be more durable than knockdown by siRNA, and more effective knockdown or inhibition of CK1Î´/É does in fact impair cell growth, albeit via a different mechanism than IC261. The shRNA-mediated growth inhibition reported by others is similar to the â¼50% maximal growth inhibition we see in cells treated with PF670 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and c</xref>), and supports a positive but not essential role for CK1Î´/É in proliferation, perhaps via their function in the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Interestingly, we did not see significant growth inhibition by the CK1É-selective agent, PF480. This suggests either the growth effect is via inhibition of CK1Î´, or redundancy of CK1É with CK1Î´, but fails to explain why shRNA against CK1É was so effective in slowing cell growth in other reports. We note that CK1É could also have non-catalytic functions in cell proliferation, as a structural role in circadian rhythms has been reported for the Drosophila ortholog double-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A scaffolding role for CK1É might account for some of the differences between the shRNA and PF480 drug studies.</p>
      <p>PF670, more so than PF480, was effective at inhibiting Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, and this could contribute to its ability to slow cancer cell proliferation. Notably, PF670 only produced sub-maximal inhibition of Î²-catenin signaling even at levels that fully inhibit CK1Î´/É. This is likely to be attributable to a basal level of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling that does not require CK1Î´/É activity, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryja <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A number of cell lines have aberrant activation of Î²-catenin due to diverse mechanisms including autocrine Wnt loops, mutation of APC and mutation of Î²-catenin. CK1Î´/É can act both at the level of the disheveled/axin complex and downstream as well at the level of the translational co-repressor Tcf3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Pharmacologic inhibition of CK1Î´/É can therefore diminish Î²-catenin signaling via several routes. However, the sub-maximal inhibition may only slow, rather than fully block, proliferation. Inhibition of Î²-catenin signaling via targeting of CK1Î´/É may therefore not be an effective way to halt proliferation of many cancer cell lines.</p>
      <p>Finally, we conclude that previous studies where the biological effect of low micromolar concentrations of IC261 in transformed cells was attributed to CK1 inhibition should be interpreted with caution.</p>

        <p>IC261 selectively inhibits cancer cell proliferation. (<bold>a</bold>) IC261 inhibits proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines. A panel of transformed/cancer cell lines was cultured in 12-well plates and treated with either DMSO (0.001%) or IC261 (0.1âÎ¼) for 5 days. Cell proliferation was measured by crystal violet staining (Materials and methods). Cell proliferation was calculated by OD<sub>595</sub><sup>IC261</sup>/OD<sub>595</sub><sup>DMSO</sup> of each respective cell lines and expressed as a percentage of proliferation in the DMSO control. Data were derived from three independent sets of experiments each performed in triplicate. (<bold>b</bold>) IC261 induces caspase activation. HEK293 and HT1080 cells were seeded at 80% confluence in 6-well plates and treated with DMSO (0.001%) and IC261 (0.1âÎ¼), respectively for 48âh. Cells were lysed by 4% SDS and analyzed by SDSâPAGE/western blot. (<bold>c</bold>) IC261 is transformation selective.

HEK293 and HT1080 cells were seeded at 5% confluence in 6-well plates and treated with either DMSO (0.001%), PF670462 (1âÎ¼) or IC261 (1âÎ¼) over 7 days and assessed by (<bold>a</bold>) 0.5% crystal violet staining and (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold>) viable cell counts. (<bold>d</bold>) IC261, but not PF670462, causes cell cycle arrest. HEK293 and HT1080 cells were seeded at 80% confluence in 6-well plates and treated with DMSO (0.001%), PF670462 (1âÎ¼) or IC261 (1âÎ¼) for 24âh before DNA content analyses by flow cytometry. (<bold>e</bold>) PF670462 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. HEK<sup>STF3A</sup> cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PF670462 or IC261 for 16âh. DMSO (0.001%) was used as the vehicle control. Reporter activity was measured as relative light units (RLU) and normalized to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. PF670462 and IC261 doseâresponse curves were fitted using a non-linear regression model in GraphPad Prism 5.0c.</p>

        <p>IC261 and PF670462 have divergent effects in cells. (<bold>a</bold>) Cytotoxic concentrations of IC261 do not inhibit CK1Î´/É in cells. CK1É intramolecular autophosphorylation in intact cells was unmasked as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivers <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) (Materials and methods) by the addition of 50ân calyculin A in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of PF670462 or IC261. PP2A A subunit served as the loading control. PS denotes phosphorylated and shifted. The residual mobility shift of CK1É in the presence of PF670462 is probably due to its phosphorylation by other cellular kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clokie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The decreased immunoreactivity of the autophosphorylated CK1É is due to phosphorylation-mediated masking of the Mab epitope. (<bold>b</bold>) PF670462, but not cytotoxic concentrations of IC261, inhibits Dvl2 phosphorylation. HEK293<sup>STF3A</sup> cells were treated with vehicle or the indicated concentration of PF670462 or IC261 for 30âmin. Cells were then lysed and the Dvl2 mobility shift was assessed by SDSâPAGE and immunoblotting. (<bold>c</bold>) Dose-dependent inhibition of a Î²-catenin target gene by PF670462 and IC261. HEK293<sup>STF3A</sup> cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compound for 6âh, followed by lysis and qPCR quantification of <italic>Axin2</italic> mRNA. Data are representative of three independent sets of experiment each performed in triplicate.
