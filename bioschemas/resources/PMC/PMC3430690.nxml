      <abstract>
        <p>Leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 and 2 (LRRK1 and LRRK2) are large multidomain proteins containing kinase, GTPase and multiple protein-protein interaction domains, but only mutations in LRRK2 are linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Independent studies suggest that LRRK2 exists in the cell as a complex compatible with the size of a dimer. However, whether this complex is truly a homodimer or a heterologous complex formed by monomeric LRRK2 with other proteins has not been definitively proven due to the limitations in obtaining highly pure proteins suitable for structural characterization. Here, we used stable expression of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in HEK293T cell lines to produce recombinant LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins of greater than 90% purity. Both purified LRRKs are folded, with a predominantly alpha-helical secondary structure and are capable of binding GTP with similar affinity. Furthermore, recombinant LRRK2 exhibits robust autophosphorylation activity, phosphorylation of model peptides <italic>in vitro</italic> and ATP binding. In contrast, LRRK1 does not display significant autophosphorylation activity and fails to phosphorylate LRRK2 model substrates, although it does bind ATP. Using these biochemically validated proteins, we show that LRRK1 and LRRK2 are capable of forming homodimers as shown by single-particle transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. These LRRK dimers display an elongated conformation with a mean particle size of 145 Ã and 175 Ã respectively, which is disrupted by addition of 6M guanidinium chloride. Immunogold staining revealed double-labeled particles also in the pathological LRRK2 mutant G2019S and artificial mutants disrupting GTPase and kinase activities, suggesting that point mutations do not hinder the dimeric conformation. Overall, our findings indicate for the first time that purified and active LRRK1 and LRRK2 can form dimers in their full-length conformation.</p>

      <p>ROCO proteins are a family of multidomain proteins characterized by the presence of tandem ROC (Ras of Complex Proteins) and COR (C-terminal of ROC) domains <xref rid="pone.0043472-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Marin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Bosgraaf1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There are four human ROCO proteins: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 and 2 (LRRK1 and LRRK2), death-associated kinase 1 (DAPK1) and Malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 (MFASH1). LRRK1 and LRRK2 share a similar domain organization, which includes a serine-threonine kinase domain C-terminal of ROC-COR, and leucine-rich and ankyrin-like repeats at the N-terminus. The major differences between LRRK1 and LRRK2 are at the N-terminal region, where LRRK2 has a large number of unique repeats <xref rid="pone.0043472-Marin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Marin2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Marin3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and unique phosphorylated consensus binding sites for 14-3-3 <xref rid="pone.0043472-Dzamko1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Nichols1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. There are important differences also in the C-terminal regions <xref rid="pone.0043472-Marin3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> which show the lowest degree of homology compared to other domains <xref rid="pone.0043472-Jorgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This divergence may be relevant with respect to a recently proposed pre-synaptic function of LRRK2, which was shown to interact with a number of pre-synaptic proteins <italic>via</italic> its C-terminal WD40 domain <xref rid="pone.0043472-Piccoli1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>

          <p>(A) Schematic alignment of LRRK1 and LRRK2. Predicted functional domains are drawn to scale at the relative location within the full protein sequence. For domains containing repeat sequences, predicted individual repeat units are depicted. The sequence identity and similarity for the LRR, ROC, COR and Kinase domains are given below the schematic. Also given are detailed alignments of LRRK1 and LRRK2 at the level of common LRRK2 clinical mutations. Abbreviations for the domains: ARM, armadillo repeat domain; ANK, ankyrin repeat domain; LRR, leucine rich repeat domain; ROC, Ras of comple proteins domain; COR, C-terminal of ROC domain; Kin, kinase domain; WD40, WD40 repeat domain. (B) Representative western blot analysis of HEK293T cells stably expressing (from lane 1 to 7) 3xFlag-tagged LRRK2 wild-type, T1348N GTP deficient binding mutant, K1906M kinase dead, G2019S pathogenic mutant and LRRK1 wild-type K650A GTP deficient binding mutant, K1269M kinase dead. Upper panel shows membranes probed with Flag (M2) antibody (note that LRRK2 and LRRK1 have different exposure time due to the very low expression of T1348N mutant). Lower panel shows Î²-tubulin loading control. (C) Representative confocal images of stable HEK293T cells expressing LRRK1 and LRRK2 wild-type and mutants. Scale bar 10 Âµm.</p>

      <p>Previous studies have shown that both LRRK1 and LRRK2 bind GTP <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Korr1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, are basally phosphorylated in cells and share a similar cytoplasmic distribution <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, only mutations in LRRK2 <xref rid="pone.0043472-PaisanRuiz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Zimprich1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but not in LRRK1 <xref rid="pone.0043472-Haugarvoll1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, have been identified as a cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
      <p>Pathological LRRK2 mutations are clustered in the catalytic core of the protein (ROC-COR and kinase domains) suggesting that altered activity may be associated with disease. In support of this notion, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that mutations in the ROC/GTPase (R1441C/G) and COR (Y1996C) domains lower LRRK2 GTPase activity <xref rid="pone.0043472-Daniels1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Lewis2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, while the common G2019S mutation in the kinase domain increases kinase activity by 2â3 fold (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>). It has been suggested that there may be an intramolecular regulation mechanism between ROC and kinase domains <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-West1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

However, all these observations were made either from cell lysates or from only isolated domains only, and it is not clear if full-length proteins form dimers in the same manner.

Recently, Ito and Iwatsubo suggested that LRRK2 protein from cell lysates exists predominantly as a monomer <xref rid="pone.0043472-Ito2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Therefore, establishing whether the PD associated LRRK2 is a dimer in its active form and comparing its quaternary organization with its closest homolog LRRK1, is a crucial step to understand how these complex proteins are regulated and activated during signal transduction.</p>
      <p>To address this we developed a heterologous mammalian expression system and affinity purification protocol to obtain highly purified, folded and functional LRRK1 and LRRK2 full-length proteins and used them to conduct the first characterization of their quaternary organization by imaging single molecules via transmission electron microscopy.</p>

        <title>Generation of HEK293T cells stably expressing full-length LRRK1 and LRRK2 using lentiviral vectors</title>
        <p>Sequence analysis of LRRK1 and LRRK2 revealed an overall identity/similarity of 16/29%, whereas homology is higher in the LRR, ROC, COR and kinase domains than in other domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to characterize the biochemical properties and quaternary organization of LRRK1 and LRRK2, we generated lentiviral vectors for expression of 3xFlag full-length LRRK1 and LRRK2 in mammalian cells. Despite the large size of LRRK1 and LRRK2 (227 kDa and 286 kDa respectively), it was possible to generate functional LVs. We used these vectors to generate stable HEK293T lines expressing the two wild-type proteins and a set of mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Both expression levels and number of positive cells of LRRK1 wild-type and K1269M were significantly higher compared to LRRK2 proteins whereas mutants disrupting GTP binding (K650A for LRRK1 and T1348N for LRRK2) displayed significantly decreased steady state expression levels. The cellular distribution of all proteins was predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results suggest that stable HEK293T lines represent an appropriate source of recombinant LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins.</p>

        <title>Full-length LRRK1 and LRRK2 from HEK293T cells are folded</title>
        <p>Previous studies have employed full-length LRRK2 protein in solution for biochemical testing <xref rid="pone.0043472-Jaleel1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Covy1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, however these proteins were purified using large GST tags. To address whether our proteins behaved as expected based on previous data, we purified 3xFlag fusion full-length proteins from HEK293T cells with Flag M2 resin and subsequently eluted them by a molar excess of 3xFlag peptide. To remove the free peptide, we used centrifugal ultrafiltration with a 100 kDa cutoff membrane. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows a silver stained SDS-PAGE of LRRK1 and LRRK2 purifications after peptide removal by centrifugal ultrafiltration. The estimated purity by densitometric analysis is &gt;90%. Where possible, we used peptide-free proteins for the subsequent characterization described below. To verify that purified proteins are properly folded, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence. CD analysis of LRRK1 and LRRK2 wild-type shows that both proteins are folded with similar content of predicted secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Protein concentration was calculated by densitometry of protein stained gels using BSA standards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Specifically, LRRK1 possesses about 79% of alpha helices, 14% of beta sheets and 7% of random coils, whereas LRRK2 displays 75% content of alpha-helix, 15% of beta sheet and 10% of random coils. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g001">figure 1B</xref>, the two GTP-deficient binding mutants, namely LRRK1-K650A and LRRK2-T1348N, consistently display lower steady state levels. One possibility is that lack of GTP binding prevents the nucleotide-binding pocket to fold correctly, resulting in a partially unfolded protein. To assess this, we compared CD spectra of wild-type vs GTP-deficient binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). CD analysis did not revealed major conformational perturbations for the GTP-deficient binding mutants, although it is important to point that CD is not the most suitable technique to investigate small changes in secondary structure. Small folding variations could account for the observed reduced stability of these mutants.</p>

        <p>Next, given the presence of 31 and 26 tryptophan residues in LRRK1 and LRRK2 respectively, we exploited the intrinsic fluorescence properties of this amino acid to assess protein folding.

Upon addition of 6M guanidinium chloride (GdHCl), a concentration at which any protein becomes randomly coiled, both samples exhibited a red-shifted emission peak at about 355 nm typical of unfolded proteins with increased exposure of the tryptophan to aqueous environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

        <p>Since we could not assess whether the purified LRRK1 was kinase active due to the lack of validated LRRK1 model substrates, we measured the ability of LRRK1 to bind ATP and compared it to LRRK2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g004">figure 4G</xref>, we confirm binding of both proteins to ATP using different ATP agarose beads. Binding to the beads was inhibited by the addition of free ATP (1 mM) to the binding reaction but not GTP (1 mM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s006">Fig. S6</xref>), indicating the specificity of the binding. To further compare the properties of the LRRK1 and LRRK2 kinase domains, we performed sequence homology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s005">Fig. S5A</xref>) and comparative homology modeling (for a recent model of LRRK2 kinase, refer to <xref rid="pone.0043472-Vancraenenbroeck1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>). Based on homology modeling, LRRK1 and LRRK2 kinase display a structural organization of a typical protein kinase: an N-terminal lobe consisting of a five-stranded Î²-sheet and one Î±-helix, connected by a hinge region to a predominantly helical C-terminal lobe <xref rid="pone.0043472-Huse1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Nolen1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The ATP-binding groove lies at the interface of these two lobes. The residues important for ATP-binding and kinase activity are conserved between LRRK1 and LRRK2 with the exception of the aromatic amino acid, which normally shields the site for phosphate transfer, in the P-loop of LRRK1. However, one important difference between both kinases is the presence of an extra loop between Î²-sheet 5 and Î±-helix C1 of the N-terminal lobe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g004">figure 4G</xref>, this difference does not inhibit the binding of ATP to LRRK1, however this insertion in LRRK1 kinase may affect substrate binding and may therefore explain the divergent kinase data.</p>

        <p>Double-labeled particles are likely to represent dimeric LRRK1 and LRRK2. Single-labeled particles may either represent monomers or, alternatively, dimers with only one epitope labeled. The latter interpretation is supported by two further pieces of evidence. First, only about 20% of particles were labeled, indicating that labeling efficiency is not 100% (as expected) and, as a consequence, the predicted frequency of double-labeled molecules is the product of the probability of a single labeling event (0.20Ã0.20â=â0.004, i.e. 4%) which is close to the experimental 5% observed. To further address whether double-labeled particles could be dimeric LRRKs, we compared these distances with the mean size of the particles and imaged 293 and 395 negative stained particles for LRRK1 and LRRK2 respectively from three independent purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g005">Fig. 5CâD</xref>). For both proteins, we observed only one population of particles with a mean diameter of 145 Ã for LRRK1 and 175 Ã for LRRK2. The asymmetry of the Gaussian distributions may indicate that particles are elongated in shape. The distance of two gold particles is significantly different (Pâ=â0.001) between LRRK1 and LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>) as are the particle diameters (P&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).

        <p>To further support the formation of dimeric LRRK proteins, we performed immunogold staining of purified LRRK1 and LRRK2 before and after addition of 6M GdHCl.

        <p>Next, we assessed the presence of dimeric LRRKs for wild-type, artificial and pathological mutants by immunogold EM. Again, we calculated all possible distances among particles to obtain an unbiased dataset of measurements and normalized each group of distances (bin size 2.5 Âµm) by annulus area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g006">figure 6</xref>, all LRRK2 variants analyzed retain the ability to dimerize, although there is variation in the fraction of dimers. Specifically, the pathological mutant G2019S and the kinase dead K1906M displayed a reduced number of dimeric molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g006">Fig. 6BâC</xref>) compared to wild-type and T1348N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043472-g006">Fig. 6A and D</xref>). LRRK1 kinase dead (K1269W) and GTP deficient binding (K650A) mutants also retain the ability of forming dimers, although LRRK1-K1269W samples displayed reduced double-labeled particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). However, given that immunogold labeling is an indirect assessment of quaternary structure which depends on the epitope accessibility to the antibody, we cannot perform cross-comparisons of the relative proportions between dimers vs other conformers or speculate that pathological mutations affect the fraction of dimerized protein, but only conclude that mutations do not disrupt the ability of forming dimers.</p>
        <p>Overall, our data demonstrate that highly purified LRRK2 and its closest homolog LRRK1 form dimers.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we investigated for the first time the quaternary structure of full-length LRRK2 and of its closest homolog LRRK1 by transmission electron microscopy. A major hurdle to this type of analysis has been the obtainment of pure full-length LRRK2 in sufficient quantities suitable for structural characterization. Several attempts have been made to obtain LRRK2 fragments from prokaryotic sources <xref rid="pone.0043472-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-LuzonToro1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, however the only proteins reliably demonstrating kinase activity have been purified from eukaryotic cells as truncated proteins <xref rid="pone.0043472-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Jaleel2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Here, we developed a protocol to purify full-length recombinant soluble LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins from mammalian cells by immunoaffinity chromatography. We used a combination of spectroscopic measurements and enzymatic assays to demonstrate that LRRK1 and LRRK2 retained native folding and enzymatic activities and were therefore suitable for single particle analysis by transmission electron microscopy using negative staining and immunogold labeling.</p>
      <p>The regions of highest homology between LRRK1 and LRRK2 are in the LRR domain and the catalytic ROC-COR-kinase tridomain. Our results suggest that sequence similarity is reflected in functional similarity for some domains. GTP binding affinities of LRRK1 and LRRK2 were comparable using an isotopic displacement assay and are in the same range as previously reported for LRRK2 using a similar assay <xref rid="pone.0043472-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The only other ROCO protein for which GTP binding affinities have been measured is the <italic>C. tepidum</italic> ROCO for which a similar GTP dissociation constant was reported (0.5 ÂµM for GppNHp, 13.4 ÂµM for GDP) <xref rid="pone.0043472-Gotthardt1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While both LRRK proteins can bind to ATP as predicted for kinases, their kinase activity revealed striking differences. In particular we could not observe LRRK1 kinase activity toward itself or against generic or LRRK2 specific substrates, an observation that may be, in part, explained by the presence of an extra loop between Î²-sheet 5 and Î±-helix C1 of the N-terminal lobe. This loop possibly hinders substrate binding. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> to assess LRRK2 phosphorylation have been well characterized and include autophosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0043472-Gloeckner1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio7" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-West2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> or the phosphorylation of LRRK2 specific peptides such as LRRKtide or Nictide <xref rid="pone.0043472-Jaleel2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Nichols2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In all cases here, the phosphorylation activity of LRRK1 was below detection limits for substrate phosphorylation assays and very low for autophosphorylation activity. These results are in agreement with another recent study where the authors did not observe significant autophosphorylation activity for LRRK1 <xref rid="pone.0043472-Deng2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. It is interesting to note that in a previous study where we assessed LRRK1 and LRRK2 autophosphorylation activity using proteins bound to affinity resins <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio8" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, we observe only small differences in autophosphorylation activity, indicating the importance of working with soluble and pure protein preparations to improve the signal to noise ratio. We conclude that LRRK1 phosphorylation properties are fundamentally different from those of LRRK2, substrate specificity differs and while autophosphorylation is robust in LRRK2, it is not likely to play a significant role for LRRK1. Therefore, although the kinase domains are similar for LRRK1 and LRRK2, at a functional level the two proteins are likely to be very different.</p>
      <p>To explore whether LRRK1 and LRRK2 are dimeric, we used these biochemically validated proteins to investigate their quaternary structure. Although crystallography represents the ideal approach to gain insight into the details of a protein structure, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has the unique advantage of requiring diluted samples for image analysis and is ideal for molecules larger than 300 kDa such as LRRK1 and LRRK2. Several lines of evidence support the notion that active LRRK2 is dimeric <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio4" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043472-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. However, these studies are based on protein fractionation of cell lysates where predicting protein molecular weight, and by inference monomer vs dimer state, is difficult because of the presence of heterologous binding partners.</p>
      <p>Here we show for the first time that highly purified LRRK1 and LRRK2 are capable of forming dimers as revealed by the presence of double-gold labeled LRRK1 and LRRK2 particles imaged by TEM. The distance between two gold particles is smaller than the mean particle size of LRRK2 suggesting that the N-terminal region, which is labeled by anti-Flag antibodies, possesses a well-defined structure. In particular, the width of the half height of the curve that interpolates the distribution of distances between gold particles is around 60 Ã. Considering that the complex of primary and secondary gold-labeled antibodies is oriented randomly, the N-terminal region is likely to possess a structure that places the epitopes in a defined position. For LRRK1, the width of the half height of the curve is approximately 100 Ã suggesting that the N-terminal region is possibly more flexible. Importantly, addition of a denaturing agent such as 6M GdHCl, that induces unfolding of the protein as witnessed by the red-shift of tryptophan fluorescence emission, caused a sharp decrease in the number of double-gold labeled particles compatible with the dimer size, supporting the notion that folded proteins are compact dimers. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that LRRK proteins are capable of forming dimers in the absence of other binding partners. We also analyzed the effect of point mutations disrupting kinase activity, GTP binding or the hyperactive pathogenic G2019S mutation on dimer formation. Although we observed a reduction in the number of immunogold doublets in the G2019S and kinase dead mutants, it is difficult to conclude that these proteins are less prone to assemble in dimers rather than presenting small structural perturbations, which reflect on the antibody-antigen affinity. Interestingly, purified GTP-dead LRRK2 (T1348N) retains ability to form dimers, indicating that loss of GTP-binding capacity, although likely to perturb the three dimensional structure, is not sufficient to abolish dimerization. This is consistent with previous reports showing that LRRK2 self-interacts via multiple different domains <xref rid="pone.0043472-Greggio4" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have also been able to visualize dimeric LRRK2 particles from chromatographic fractions corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 600 kDa, which have been probed for endogenous LRRK2. There are now several proteins that have been shown to interact with LRRK2, including 14-3-3, HSP-90 and tubulin and whether these contribute to the â¼600 kDa peak has not been addressed. Given that immunogold EM was performed on enriched protein fractions rather than highly pure sample due to technical limitations on purifying endogenous material, we cannot rule out whether the chromatographic peak contains both dimeric and monomeric LRRK2 with binding partners. A recent paper by Ito and Iwatsubo presents intriguing observations supporting the conclusion that LRRK2 from lysates is predominantly monomeric <xref rid="pone.0043472-Ito2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. As the SEC profiles and immunogold particle distance distributions are comparable in the stable lines compared to endogenous LRRK2 in NIH-3T3 lysates, we can conclude that LRRK2 forms dimers in cells, probably co-existing with monomers.</p>
      <p>The next key steps will be to pursue in more detail the structure of LRRK proteins and its links to their biology. The validated LRRK proteins presented here can be used to investigate their conformation by cryo-electron microscopy, in order to obtain more detailed structural information to model their tridimensional structure. The correlation of more detailed structural information of LRRK1 and LRRK2 to their cell biological properties such as how dimerization is linked to cellular complex formation will allow a better understanding of how LRRK biochemical properties impact LRRK mediated cellular functions. This is of particular interest for LRRK2 whose biochemical properties, such as its kinase activity, have been proposed as potential targets for disease modifying Parkinson's disease therapy.</p>

Briefly, anti-Flag agarose beads containing equal amounts of 3xFlag-LRRK1 and 3xFlag-LRRK2 as calculated by densitometry using a standard curve with bovine serum albumin (BSA), were rinsed in loading buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.02% Triton X-100) and incubated with GTP-Î±-<sup>33</sup>P alone or with 200 ÂµM CTP, ATP, GDP or non-hydrolysable GppCp for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. After incubation, excess nucleotide was removed by rinsing beads three times in kinase buffer. The amount of bound isotopic GTP was measured by scintillation counting.</p>
        <p>Aliquots of 3xFlag-LRRK1 and 3xFlag-LRRK2 on agarose beads were preincubated in the presence of GTP-Î±-<sup>33</sup>P (10 nM) and then equilibrated with different amounts of non-radiolabeled GTP (100 nMâ1 mM in tenfold concentration increments).</p>

        <title>Binding to ATP-sepharose beads</title>
        <p>ATP binding of LRRK1 and LRRK2 was assessed by pulldown from cell lysates with four different types of ATP-agarose (Aminophenyl-ATP-Agarose, C10-spacer (AP-ATP-Agarose), 8-[(6-Amino)hexyl]-amino-ATP-Agarose (8-AH-ATP-Agarose), N6-(6-Amino)hexyl-ATP-Agarose (6-AH-ATPAgarose), 2â²/3â²-EDA-ATP-Agarose (EDA-ATPAgarose), according to manufacturer's instructions (Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany). In brief, HEK293T cells with stable expression of 3xFlag-LRRK1 and 3xFlag-LRRK2 were lysed in ice cold lysis buffer B (Tris 25 mM pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mM, MgCl2 5 mM, DTT 1 mM, NP-40 0,2%, glycerol 10%) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science, Vilvoorde, Belgium) and cleared by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 14000Ãg and 4Â°C. Cleared lysates were depleted of ATP by triple dialysis against lysis buffer B using dialysis membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 6â8 kDa (Spectrum laboratories, Breda, The Netherlands) and with a sample-to-dialysis-buffer volume ratio of at least 1â¶100 per dialysis step. 200 Âµg lysate was used per binding reaction to the 4 abovementioned forms of ATP-agarose, as well as for empty agarose beads (negative control) or gamma-aminohexyl-GTP-agarose (Jena) as a positive control. As additional negative controls, binding reactions were also performed in the presence of excess nucleotide (1 mM ATP or GTP). Binding was performed by end-over-end mixing for 1 hour at 4Â°C after which beads were washed 4 times in lysis buffer B. Proteins were eluted using 2Ã SDS loading buffer B (Tris-HCl 160 mM pH 6.8, SDS 2%, DTT 0.2 M, glycerol 40%, bromophenol blue 2 mg/ml) and analyzed via western blot as described above.</p>

        <title>Electron microscopy analysis and gold-labeling</title>
        <p>3x-Flag-LRRK1/2 purified proteins or endogenous LRRK2 enriched fractions were examined by electron microscopy (EM) followed by immunogold analysis. LRRK-enriched fractions were diluted 20 times in lysis buffer (LB) and purified proteins were diluted to 5 ng/Âµl in EB (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20 or 0.02% Triton X-100 and 150 ng/Âµl of 3xFlag peptide). Negatively stained LRRK1 and LRRK2 samples were prepared using previously described methods <xref rid="pone.0043472-Ohi1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. A 30 Âµl drop of sample solution was adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid, washed with two drops of deionized water, and stained with two drops of freshly prepared 1% uranyl acetate. To gold-label, samples were incubated for one hour with mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 for 3xFlag-tagged proteins or anti-LRRK2 rabbit monoclonal antibodies <xref rid="pone.0043472-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> for endogenous proteins in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts. After 3 washing steps, samples were incubated with 5 nm gold-labeled anti mouse or 10 nm gold-labeled anti rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 30 minutes. Proteins were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grid and stained following the same procedure used for the non-labeled particles.</p>
        <p>Samples were imaged at room temperature using a Fei Tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament and operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Images were taken at calibrated magnifications in the range 11,000Ã to 26,000Ã. Per each field analyzed (500 nmÃ500 nm), reciprocal distances among immunogold labeled proteins were obtained using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Distances greater than 200 nm (2000 Ã) were not included in the analysis. Frequency distribution of particles distances was carried out using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) setting 2.5 nm as bin size. Because the random probability of finding a second gold particle at a given distance from the first particle increases as a linear function of the distance, we introduced a normalization factor to weigh the probability of each event equally. Each data set was therefore normalized by the annulus area within which the particles were counted (thickness corresponds to the bin size, 2.5 nm):<disp-formula id="pone.0043472.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0043472.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>n<sub>d</sub> represents the number of gold-labeled particles counted inside the annulus area (2 Ïr<sup>2</sup>
<sub>d</sub>)â(2 Ïr<sup>2</sup>
<sub>d-(d-2.5)</sub>) and d is a given distance from the analyzed particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043472.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Finally, each data set was normalized by the total number of measured distances (about 800 per sample). The distribution of distance is depicted in plots showing the normalized frequencies per inter-immunogold-dot distance.</p>
        <p>We also investigated the size of purified LRRK1 and LRRK2 samples without immunogold labeling to optimally visualize particle borders. Size distribution was obtained using the following procedure: particle images were manually extracted from micrographs using the semi-automatic procedure implemented in the BOXER program of EMAN software package <xref rid="pone.0043472-Ludtke1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Clearly defined isolated particles were selected and boxed in 60Ã60 to 150Ã150 pixel images. Large and amorphous aggregates were manually excluded from the analysis. The particles were subsequently centered and aligned by cross-correlating the individual images to a rotationally averaged image. Once aligned, all images were rotationally averaged to obtain a one dimensional radial intensity profile. Center alignment and rotational averaging were done using SPIDER image processing system <xref rid="pone.0043472-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Since in negative stain the particles are bright surrounded by a dark halo of stain, the intensity profiles were fitted by a piecewise function which starts as a constant value (particle intensity) followed by half period cosine drop (simulating the stain halo) and again raising by a half period cosine function until a plateau is reached (constant medium-light background intensity). Particle half-length was taken as a pixel position at the midpoint of the cosine intensity drop. Intensity profile fits and particle size distribution histograms were calculated using MATHEMATICA (Wolfram Research Inc., Champaign, USA).</p>
