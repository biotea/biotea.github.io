      <abstract>
        <p>Agrin is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is required for the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions. During development, agrin is secreted from motor neurons to trigger the local aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and other proteins in the muscle fiber, which together compose the postsynaptic apparatus. After release from the motor neuron, agrin binds to the developing muscle basal lamina and remains associated with the synaptic portion throughout adulthood. We have recently shown that full-length chick agrin binds to a basement membrane-like preparation called Matrigelâ¢. The first 130 amino acids from the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus are necessary for the binding, and they are the reason why, on cultured chick myotubes, AChR clusters induced by full-length agrin are small. In the current report we show that an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment of agrin containing these 130 amino acids is sufficient to bind to Matrigelâ¢ and that the binding to this preparation is mediated by laminin-1. The fragment also binds to laminin-2 and -4, the predominant laminin isoforms of the muscle fiber basal lamina. On cultured myotubes, it colocalizes with laminin and is enriched in AChR aggregates. In addition, we show that the effect of full-length agrin on the size of AChR clusters is reversed in the presence of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal agrin fragment. These data strongly suggest that binding of agrin to laminin provides the basis of its localization to synaptic basal lamina and other basement membranes.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Efficient synaptic transmission requires a high local specialization of pre- and postsynaptic cells. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ),<sup>1</sup> these specializations include aggregates of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the muscle cell membrane and accumulated vesicles containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the nerve terminal (for review see <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hall and Sanes, 1993</xref>). Differentiation of both pre- and postsynaptic cells is directed by molecules that are localized to the synaptic portion of the muscle cell basal lamina (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sanes et al., 1978</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burden et al., 1979</xref>). The capability of the synaptic basal lamina to control and maintain synaptic differentiation makes it distinct from the extrasynaptic basal lamina.</p>
    <p>Collagen type IV and laminin are the major components of cell basement membranes. Both molecules assemble from three separate chains. Individual chains are encoded by a family of homologous genes giving rise to collagen type IV and laminin isoforms that differ in their chain composition (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Timpl, 1996</xref>). The collagen type IV molecules and the laminins are thought to form independent networks by self assembly that are linked by entactin/nidogen (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Yurchenco and O'Rear, 1994</xref>). This scaffold builds the framework with which several other proteins like perlecan, fibulin-1, and fibulin-2 associate (for review see <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Timpl and Brown, 1996</xref>). While perlecan and nidogen are found both at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites of the muscle basal lamina, specific isoforms of collagen type IV and laminin are localized to the NMJ (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Sanes, 1995</xref>). Other molecules that are concentrated at the NMJ include the neuregulins, AChE, and agrin, some of which have been shown to regulate different aspects of synapse formation (for review see <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ruegg, 1996</xref>).</p>
    <p>Among the best characterized molecules associated with synaptic basal lamina is agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) with an apparent molecular mass on SDSPAGE of 400â600 kD (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). When added to cultured muscle cells, agrin induces the aggregation of AChRs and several other proteins that are also enriched at the NMJ in vivo (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Nitkin et al., 1987</xref>). Several lines of evidence have led to the hypothesis that agrin is released from the nerve terminal of motor axons and causes the local accumulation of AChRs and other postsynaptic proteins in muscle fibers (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">McMahan, 1990</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, agrin-deficient mutant mice lack AChR clusters, and no functional NMJs are formed (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>). In chick agrin, three sites of alternative splicing have been described. One site is located near the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>b</italic>
</xref>), and two sites, called A and B (y and z in rodents), are located in the COOH-terminal half of the protein. Splicing at site B strongly influences agrin's AChR-aggregating activity. Agrin isoforms with amino acid inserts at the B-site are highly active in inducing myotubes to aggregate AChRs, while agrin isoforms lacking inserts at this site are only marginally or not at all active (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Ruegg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ferns et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1995</xref>). Transcripts encoding the individual splice variants are differentially distributed. While AChR-aggregating isoforms are selectively expressed by neuronal cells, isoforms lacking inserts at site B are predominantly expressed by nonneuronal cells (for review see <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">McMahan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bowe and Fallon, 1995</xref>).</p>
    <p>The local immobilization of motor neuronâderived agrin in the developing muscle basal lamina is thought to be important to maintain postsynaptic structures throughout adulthood (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">McMahan, 1990</xref>). This becomes evident as AChR-aggregating activity and agrin-like immunoreactivity remain localized to synaptic basal lamina for several weeks after degeneration of the cells at the NMJ (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burden et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Reist et al., 1987</xref>). In addition to the NMJ, agrin-like immunoreactivity is also detected in basement membranes of other nonneuronal tissues, such as blood capillaries, kidney, and lung (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Reist et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey et al., 1988<italic>a</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Magill-Solc and McMahan, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Rupp et al., 1991</xref>). Hence, agrin must strongly bind to components of synaptic basal lamina and other basement membranes.</p>
    <p>In a first attempt to characterize the binding of agrin to extracellular matrix (ECM), we have recently shown that full-length chick agrin binds selectively to Matrigelâ¢ (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kleinman et al., 1982</xref>), a solubilized basement membrane extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma. This binding required a 130âamino acidâlong region at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of agrin (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). AChR clusters on cultured myotubes were also affected by this region as clusters induced by full-length agrin were more numerous but considerably smaller than those induced by any fragment of agrin without this NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). We now show that a fragment comprising this region of agrin is sufficient to bind to Matrigelâ¢ and that the binding to this basement membrane preparation is mediated by laminin-1. The fragment also binds to laminin-2 and -4, the laminin isoforms expressed by muscle fibers, and it is concentrated in AChR clusters on cultured chick myotubes. Moreover, an excess of this fragment is sufficient to reverse the effect of full-length chick agrin on the size of AChR clusters. Searches on databases revealed that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region is highly conserved in mouse and human agrin. Based on these data, the 130 amino acids from the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of agrin define a laminin-binding domain.</p>

        <title>Expression Constructs</title>
        <p>cDNA constructs pcAgrin and pcÎN15Agrin have been described previously (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). The sequence encoding parts of the constant region of mouse immunoglobulin gamma heavy chain (Fc) were obtained by PCR using the primers sFc_XhoI_BamHI (GGCAGCTCGAGGATCCTCGTGCCCAGGGATTGTGGTTG) and asFc_XbaI (GGCCCTCTAGATCATTTACCAGGAGAGTGGG). As template, the Fc part of mouse immunoglobulin (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 1996</xref>) was used. Amplification introduced an XhoI and a BamHI site at the 5â² end and a XbaI site at the 3â² end. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI and ligated into the expression vector pcDNAI (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA) to yield pFc. To generate pcN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, a second PCR was performed using EcoRI_s-289 (GCATAGAATTCGGCTGCGGGCGATGGG) and as469_BamHI (CACGAGGATCCCCTCTGCACAGGGGTCCTTG) as primers and pcAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>) as template. The product coded for the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of chick agrin and contained an EcoRI site at the 5â² end and a BamHI site at the 3â² end. The BamHI site enabled the subsequent in-frame fusion of this PCR fragment to the Fc sequences by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI and ligation into pFc. pr21Fc was similarly constructed. The cDNA part encoding ray agrin was isolated by PCR using the primers EcoRI_s3426 (AGCTTGAATTCAGCCAGTGGAAGTGAATC) and as3967_BamHI (CACGAGGATCCCTTTCTTGGCTGGACAGTG), and r100<sub>A4B8</sub> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1995</xref>) as template. After digestion of the PCR product with EcoRI and BamHI, it was ligated into pFc. The sequence of pcN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and r21Fc was verified by DNA sequencing.</p>

        <title>Antiserum against Î² and Î³ Chains of Chick Laminins</title>
        <p>Antiserum 648 against the Î²/Î³ chains of chick laminin-2 and -4 was generated as follows. 1 mg of chick heart laminin-2 and -4, purified as described (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberger and Chiquet, 1995</xref>), was loaded on a preparative 3â15% gradient SDS-PAGE, run under reducing conditions, and blotted onto nitrocellulose (BA-85; Schleicher &amp; Schuell Inc., Keene, NH). The protein band of 200 kD, containing the Î² and the Î³ chains, was cut out, suspended in 0.2 ml PBS, and sonicated on ice until homogenization. The sample was mixed with 0.2 ml Freund's complete adjuvant (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>, Gaithersburg, MD) and injected intracutaneously into one rabbit. The rabbit was boosted 1 mo later with the same preparation, suspended in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antiserum 648 was obtained 14 d later. In immunoblots, the antiserum recognized the 200-kD band of laminin isoforms from chick heart, chick gizzard, and mouse laminin-1 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberger and Chiquet, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Perris et al., 1996</xref>). As the only chain common to all these laminins is the Î³1 chain, antiserum 648 must recognize at least this subunit. As the immunogen also contained the Î² chain, the antiserum is likely to recognize this subunit as well.</p>

        <title>Protein Purification</title>
        <p>Recombinant cAgrin<sub>7</sub> was obtained from stably transfected HEK 293 cells, whereas VF agrin was derived from eyes of day 14 chick embryos (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ruegg et al., 1989</xref>). 100 ml of serum-free conditioned medium or 50 ml of vitreous fluid was passed over a Mono QâSepharose (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content> Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 500 mM to 2 M. Individual fractions with agrin immunoreactivity, as determined by an ELISA (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1995</xref>), were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (3â12% gradient) and visualized by silver staining (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Morrissey, 1981</xref>). Agrin-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed three times against PBS. Agrin concentration of such a preparation was determined by ELISA. cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and r21Fc from transiently transfected COS-7 cells were purified with protein AâSepharose (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content>) according to the manufacturer's advice. Purity of recovered protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The protein concentration was determined as described (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lowry et al., 1951</xref>), using the DC Protein assay kit (BioRad Labs, Hercules, CA) and BSA as a standard. Mouse laminin-1, purified from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma as described (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Timpl et al., 1979</xref>), was provided by Th. Schulthess (Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland).

Human collagen type IV (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ries et al., 1995</xref>) was obtained from Dr. K.

        <p>Proteins were diluted to 10 Î¼g/ml with 50 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6 (coating buffer), and immobilized on 96-well plates (Becton-Dickinson, Bedford, MA) by incubation overnight at 4Â°C. Remaining binding sites were blocked for 1 h with TBS containing 3% BSA, 1.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (blocking solution). <sup>125</sup>I-cAgrin<sub>7</sub> or <sup>125</sup>I-cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, diluted in blocking solution, was added and incubated for 3 h. After washing with TBS, 1.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> four times, bound radioactivity in each well was counted with a gamma counter. Solubilization with SDS sample buffer and subsequent analysis on SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining confirmed that the proteins were indeed coated onto the plastic surface.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, mAb 5B1 diluted to 10 Î¼g/ml in coating buffer was first immobilized by overnight incubation at 4Â°C. Remaining binding sites were saturated with blocking solution for 1 h. Then 3 Î¼g/ml agrin was added. After 1 h of incubation, the plates were washed three times with blocking solution and processed with <sup>125</sup>Iâlaminin-1 as described above.</p>
        <p>To calculate half-maximal binding (EC<sub>50</sub>) of cAgrin<sub>7</sub> to laminin-1, individual data points of the dose-response were fit by the following equation: <italic>Y</italic> = (<italic>X</italic>/EC<sub>50</sub>)/(1+<italic>X</italic>/EC<sub>50</sub>) Ã <italic>P1.</italic> This equation assumes a single class of equivalent and independent binding sites, where <italic>Y</italic> represents cpm, <italic>X</italic> represents the concentration of agrin, and <italic>P1</italic> represents cpm at saturation.</p>

        <p>Double staining of agrin in COS-7 cells: COS cells, transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding cAgrin<sub>7</sub> and cÎN15Agrin, were grown on Matrigelâ¢ (Becton-Dickinson) and stained for agrin as described elsewhere (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). Cells transfected with cDNAs encoding cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and r21Fc were also stained as described in Denzer et al. (1995), except that fluorescein-conjugated goat antiâmouse IgG (1:200; Cappel, Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) was used for the extracellular staining and that, before permeabilization and staining with rhodamine-conjugated goat antiâmouse IgG (1:200; Cappel), residual binding sites were blocked with unlabeled goat antiâmouse IgG (1:50; Cappel).</p>
        <p>Primary chick myotubes were incubated with 200 nM c21<sub>B8</sub> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1995</xref>) for 16 h at 37Â°C. To localize cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, 20 nM of this fragment was included. Cultures were rinsed with culture medium, and to visualize individual components, they were stained with the following reagents: AChRs with 4 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup> M rhodamineâÎ±-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc with 5 Î¼g/ml biotinylated goat antiâmouse IgG (Molecular Probes) followed by 3 Î¼g/ml fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA); Î²/Î³ subunits of laminin with antiserum 648 (1:1,000) followed by Cy3â¢-conjugated goat antiârabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.); and Î²2 chain of laminin with mAb C4 (10 Î¼g/ml) followed by 5 Î¼g/ml biotinylated goat antiâmouse IgG and 3 Î¼g/ml fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin. The first incubation was done for 1 h at 37Â°C. Cultures were then washed with culture medium and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, 11% sucrose in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. After rinsing the cells with PBS and PBS + 20 mM glycine, the cultures were incubated for 1 h with the secondary reagents indicated before, diluted in PBS + 2% normal goat serum (PBSN). After rinsing the cells with PBS, cultures were either dehydrated with 95% ethanol at â20Â°C or incubated once more with the tertiary reagent diluted in PBSN. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashieldâ¢ (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and cultures were examined with a microscope equipped for epifluorescence (Leica Inc., Deerfield, IL).</p>

        <title>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal End of Agrin Is Sufficient to Bind to ECM</title>
        <p>We have recently shown that recombinant full-length chick agrin (cAgrin; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>) binds to a solubilized mixture of ECM molecules, called Matrigelâ¢. In contrast to fulllength agrin, a fragment that lacks the first 130 amino acids from the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (cÎN15Agrin; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>) did not bind to this ECM preparation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). In this 130âamino acidâlong stretch, a site of alternative mRNA splicing is found (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>b</italic>
</xref>). Both splice variants are capable of binding to Matrigelâ¢, although with different binding strengths (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). In the current report we have investigated the binding of the splice variant that includes the sevenâamino acidâlong insert (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). This splice variant is selectively expressed by embryonic chick motor neurons (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>) and is also highly expressed in embryonic chick brain (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>b</italic>
</xref>).</p>
        <p>To see whether the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of agrin alone is sufficient to bind to Matrigelâ¢, we engineered a cDNA construct that encodes an agrin fragment comprising the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region and the first follistatin-like domain. To facilitate detection and purification of the fragment, it was fused to the constant region of a mouse IgG (Fc; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 1996</xref>), giving rise to the fragment termed cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). A chimeric construct of the most COOH-terminal, 21-kD fragment of agrin from the marine ray (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1992</xref>) and the Fc part (r21Fc; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>) was used as a control. All recombinant proteins were efficiently synthesized and secreted from COS cells as shown by precipitation of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled proteins from conditioned medium of transiently transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). The high apparent molecular mass of 400â600 kD of cAgrin<sub>7</sub> and cÎN15Agrin on SDS-PAGE is a result of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG) chains that are attached to the 225-kD core protein (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). The chimeric constructs, cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and r21Fc, were also secreted from the transfected cells, and they displayed the expected molecular mass of â¼69â65 and 61 kD, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). SDSPAGE of the chimeric proteins under nonreducing conditions demonstrated that the intermolecular disulfide bonds of the Fc region dimerize the fragments (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The binding to Matrigelâ¢ was assayed using transiently transfected COS cells that were grown on tissue culture dishes coated with this basement membrane preparation. As previously shown (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>), cAgrin<sub>7</sub> was deposited on Matrigelâ¢ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>a</italic>â²), and no extracellular agrin-like immunoreactivity was observed with COS cells expressing cÎN15Agrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>b</italic> and <italic>b</italic>â²). Extracellular deposits of the recombinant proteins, cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and r21Fc, were visualized with fluorescein-conjugated goat antiâmouse IgG antibodies added to nonfixed, nonpermeabilized cells. The cells were subsequently permeabilized and stained with rhodamine-conjugated goat antiâmouse IgG antibodies to identify transfected cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>c</italic> and <italic>c</italic>â², cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc was deposited on Matrigelâ¢ around the transfected COS cells, which demonstrates that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region is sufficient to bind to this ECM mixture. The binding is not caused by the Fc part, as no deposits were seen with r21Fc-transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <italic>d</italic> and <italic>d</italic>â²). </p>

        <title>Laminin-1 Is a Binding Partner for Agrin</title>
        <p>Matrigelâ¢ consists of a mixture of several ECM molecules, such as collagen type IV, laminin-1, nidogen/entactin, and perlecan (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kleinman et al., 1982</xref>). To identify the components to which agrin binds, a solid-phase radioligand binding assay was used (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1996</xref>). Laminin-1 and perlecan were purified from the Engelbreth-HolmSwarm mouse tumor (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Timpl et al., 1979</xref>), and collagen type IV was isolated from human placenta (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Ries et al., 1995</xref>). After coating the purified proteins onto the plastic surface of a microtiter plate, wells were incubated with 5 nM <sup>125</sup>I-cAgrin<sub>7</sub> or <sup>125</sup>I-cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and bound radioactivity was measured. Both agrin constructs bound to laminin-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), while no or only little binding was seen to perlecan and collagen type IV (data not shown). Since laminins bind to nidogen with high affinity (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> â¼1 nM; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1991</xref>), most laminin preparations also contain nidogen (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Paulsson et al., 1987</xref>). To test whether the binding of agrin to laminin-1 was due to nidogen, we also measured binding of cAgrin<sub>7</sub> and cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc to recombinant mouse nidogen, expressed in stably transfected HEK 293 cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1991</xref>). No binding was observed for both agrin constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Hence, the binding of agrin to the lamininânidogen complex is based on a direct interaction with laminin-1. As expected from previous experiments (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bowe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Campanelli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Sugiyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1996</xref>), cAgrin<sub>7</sub> also bound to Î±-dystroglycan, purified from chick skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brancaccio et al., 1995</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). In contrast, the NH<sub>2</sub>terminal fragment, cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, did not bind (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). This is consistent with the notion that the binding site to this peripheral membrane protein resides in its COOH-terminal half of agrin (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bowe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Campanelli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Sugiyama et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1996</xref>). Accordingly, only the laminin-binding site is common to cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and cAgrin<sub>7</sub>. In addition, no binding of <sup>125</sup>I-r21Fc was observed to any of the components tested (data not shown), which excludes a contribution of the Fc part in the binding of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc to laminin-1. </p>
        <p>The strength of the binding of agrin to laminin-1 was measured by dose-response curves using <sup>125</sup>I-cAgrin<sub>7</sub>. On immobilized laminin-1, half-maximal binding (EC<sub>50</sub>) was reached at â¼5 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting a rather strong interaction of agrin with laminin-1. This binding is of similar strength as the binding of laminin-1 to nidogen (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> â¼1 nM; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 1991</xref>). At 4 nM <sup>125</sup>I-cAgrin<sub>7</sub>, 90.3 Â± 0.5% (mean Â± SEM; <italic>n</italic> = 3) of the binding was competed with 100 nM unlabeled cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, indicating that the majority of the binding of full-length agrin to laminin-1 is mediated by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end. Since agrin is an HSPG (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>a</italic>
</xref>) and laminin-1 is known to bind to heparin (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Ott et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Yurchenco et al., 1993</xref>), the residual binding of cAgrin<sub>7</sub> to laminin-1 could be due to the binding of the HS-GAG side chains of agrin to the heparin-binding site of laminin-1. Indeed, only the HS-GAG side chain-carrying construct cAgrin<sub>7</sub>, but not cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, binds to the elastase fragment E3, which contains the major heparin-binding site of laminin-1 (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Ott et al., 1982</xref>; data not shown). In summary, our data show that laminin-1, the laminin isoform present in Matrigelâ¢, is a basement membrane binding partner for agrin. Furthermore, they show that the interaction is mediated by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of agrin, and we therefore propose that this part of agrin forms a structural unit (see also Discussion). </p>

        <title>Agrin Expressed in Developing Chick Retina Binds to Laminin-1</title>
        <p>The results presented so far show that recombinant chick agrin, expressed in mammalian cells, binds to laminin-1. If this binding were important for agrin's function in vivo, agrin purified from tissue should have the same binding properties. To test this, agrin was isolated by anion exchange chromatography from the vitreous fluid of embryonic day 14 chick eyes, a rich source for agrin and other molecules secreted from retinal cells (e.g., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ruegg et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Halfter, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). As a control, cAgrin<sub>7</sub> from conditioned medium of stably transfected HEK 293 cells was purified by the same procedure. When agrin-containing fractions were assayed by Western blot, agrin-like protein from vitreous fluid and cAgrin<sub>7</sub> had a high apparent molecular mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>a</italic>, <italic>left</italic>), which is consistent with previous results (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). The bands with an apparent molecular mass of â¼115 kD are probably due to proteolytic degradation similar to what has been reported elsewhere (e.g., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Nitkin et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Rupp et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). The same samples were also probed with antiserum 245, raised against native chick heart laminin (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brubacher et al., 1991</xref>). No laminin-like immunoreactivity was observed in the samples containing cAgrin<sub>7</sub>, derived from stably transfected HEK 293 cells, whereas immunoreactive bands were visible in the sample containing agrin from the vitreous fluid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>a</italic>, <italic>right</italic>). The strong immunoreactive band with the apparent molecular mass of 200 kD most likely corresponds to the Î²/Î³ subunits of laminin isoforms, while the faint bands with the molecular masses of 400 and 150 kD could represent Î± subunits and nidogen, respectively (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brubacher et al., 1991</xref>). The copurification of chick laminin isoforms from the vitreous fluid with agrin by a procedure that is selective for highly charged anions is unexpected and may reflect the binding of laminin to agrin. Consistent with this idea, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Halfter (1993)</xref> reported copurification of laminin with a chick HSPG, which later was shown to be agrin (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>a</italic>
</xref>). </p>
        <p>To test directly whether VF agrin is capable of binding to laminin-1, we performed a modified solid-phase radioligand binding assay. In this assay, purified cAgrin<sub>7</sub> or VF agrin was immobilized on microtiter plates that had been first coated with the antiagrin mAb 5B1 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Reist et al., 1987</xref>). To these wells, 5 nM of <sup>125</sup>Iâlaminin-1 was added and bound radioactivity was measured. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>b</italic>, <sup>125</sup>Iâlaminin-1 bound to cAgrin<sub>7</sub> and VF agrin. In both cases, binding was competed by more than 97% by including 100 nM of unlabeled cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc during the incubation with <sup>125</sup>Iâlaminin-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). These experiments show that agrin synthesized and secreted by cells of the chick retina can bind to laminin-1 and that this binding is also mediated by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of agrin. Although the same amount of agrin was added to the 5B1-coated microtiter wells, the amount of <sup>125</sup>Iâlaminin-1 bound to VF agrin was only half of that bound to cAgrin<sub>7</sub>. The most likely explanation for this difference is that some of the binding sites in VF agrin may already be occupied by laminin isoforms from the vitreous fluid that copurified with VF agrin (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). In summary, chick agrin synthesized in vivo has the same laminin-binding properties as recombinant agrin, and its binding is also mediated by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain.</p>

        <title>The Laminin-binding Domain Is Highly Conserved in Mouse and Human Agrin</title>
        <p>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region required for the binding of agrin to laminin-1 has so far only been described in chick (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). Full-length cDNA encoding rat agrin lacks this region and instead, the first follistatin-like domain is preceded by a sequence that has been proposed to serve as signal sequence (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Rupp et al., 1991</xref>). To see whether the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of chick agrin is found in other species, we searched for homologous sequences using the BLAST algorithm (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>). Four expressed sequence tags, isolated from different tissues in mouse and in human (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lennon et al., 1996</xref>), closely matched this amino acid sequence. Sequencing of the clones confirmed that the deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and human agrin are highly homologous to each other and to chick agrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The homology starts at residue 26 of chick agrin, which corresponds to the predicted cleavage site for the signal sequence (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). In the stretch from residue 26 to 149, 96% of the amino acids are identical between mouse and human, and 90% are identical between chick and the mammalian sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This is by far the most highly conserved region in agrin (see also <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Tsim et al., 1992</xref>), suggesting that this domain may also confer binding to laminin in mammals. </p>

        <title>Agrin Binds to Laminin Isoforms Expressed at the NMJ</title>
        <p>The data presented so far show that agrin binds to mouse laminin-1. The laminins are a family of heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of Î±, Î², and Î³ chains (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Burgeson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Timpl, 1996</xref>). Each laminin is characterized by its chain composition, for example laminin-1 is a trimer with the Î±1, the Î²1, and the Î³1 chains. Recent data suggest that laminin-1 is not expressed in muscle basal lamina but instead is replaced by laminin-2 and -4 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Schuler and Sorokin, 1995</xref>). Laminin-2 (Î±2, Î²1, Î³1) is present early in development throughout the extracellular matrix of muscle fibers. In adult muscle, it is expressed in the extrasynaptic region of the basal lamina. Laminin-4 (also called s-laminin; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 1989</xref>), in which the Î²1 chain is replaced by the Î²2 chain, is expressed later in development and localizes to the synaptic portion of the muscle cell basal lamina (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Sanes et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since we were interested in whether agrin's NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain would also mediate the tethering to muscle cell basal lamina, we measured binding of cAgrin<sub>7</sub> and cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc to laminin-2 and -4. The source for laminin-2 and -4 was a laminin preparation isolated from adult chick heart after EDTA extraction and sequential purification by wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose and immunoaffinity chromatography (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberger and Chiquet, 1995</xref>). As shown by Western blot analysis using antiagrin antibodies, this laminin preparation contained substantial amounts of agrinlike protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). As this laminin preparation did not contain Î±-dystroglycan, detected by a transfer overlay assay using iodinated chick agrin (data not shown), we conclude that the copurification of agrin with laminin isoforms from cardiac muscle is most likely a consequence of the association of agrin with the laminins. To test directly whether laminin-2 and -4 are binding proteins for agrin, we performed a solid-phase radioligand binding assay using purified laminin isoforms. With the same amount of laminin-2 and -4 coated on the microtiter wells, 5 nM of <sup>125</sup>I-cAgrin<sub>7</sub> gave a clear signal on laminin-2 and a fivefold stronger signal on laminin-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). Like cAgrin<sub>7</sub>, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment, cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, also bound approximately four times more strongly to laminin-4 than to laminin-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>c</italic>). The weaker signal on laminin-2 was not due to a contamination with laminin-4, since this isoform represents less than 5% in the laminin-2 preparation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberger et al., 1996</xref>). A difference in the coating efficiency between laminin-2 and -4 was also excluded because equal amounts were immobilized when tested with an mAb specific for the Î±2 chain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberger et al., 1996</xref>). In summary, full-length chick agrin binds to both laminin-2 and -4, but at this particular concentration the interaction with the extrasynaptic laminin-2 is of lower apparent affinity. </p>
        <p>Many proteins that are highly concentrated at the NMJ in vivo are also found in AChR clusters in vitro (for review see <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bowe and Fallon, 1995</xref>). These include proteins of the ECM, such as HSPG (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Wallace, 1989</xref>) and laminin (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nitkin and Rothschild, 1990</xref>). Consequently, the laminin-binding fragment, cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, should colocalize with AChR clusters. To test this, AChR aggregation was induced on cultured chick myotubes with 200 nM c21<sub>B8</sub>, the minimal COOHterminal agrin fragment required for AChR aggregation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1995</xref>), and 20 nM of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc was included. After 16 h, AChR clusters were visualized with rhodamineâÎ±-bungarotoxin and myotube-bound cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc was stained with biotinylated goat antiâmouse IgG followed by fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> (<italic>first row</italic>), cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc localized to the agrin-induced AChR clusters. cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc also displayed a more widespread distribution, often along the edge of the myotubes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>arrowhead</italic>). In myotubes, where AChR aggregation had been induced with c21<sub>B8</sub>, but no cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc was included, no specific staining was seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>second row</italic>). These results illustrate that binding sites for the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment of agrin are concentrated in AChR clusters but are also found on the remaining surface of the myotube. </p>
        <p>To look at the relationship between the localization of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and laminin, antiserum 648, directed against the Î² and Î³ chains of laminin-2 and -4, was used. Examination of many myotubes showed that the distribution of myotubebound cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc matched laminin-like immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>third row</italic>). In addition, staining with the mAb 11B7, directed against the Î³1 chain of chick laminins (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberger and Chiquet, 1995</xref>), gave the same staining pattern (data not shown). Since these antibodies do not distinguish between laminin-2 and -4, we also applied mAb C4, recognizing the Î²2 chain, to localize the synapse-specific laminin isoform on myotubes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 1989</xref>). In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> (<italic>fourth row</italic>), staining with the Î²2-specific mAb C4 is shown. As reported for spontaneous AChR clusters on mouse C2 myotubes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 1995</xref>), the Î²2 chain was concentrated in AChR clusters on chick myotubes. Interestingly, no or only little laminin Î²2-like immunoreactivity was detected outside of the clusters. This differs from the pattern obtained with mAbs specific for the Î³1 or the Î±2 chain of laminin, where immunoreactivity was also seen along the edge of myotubes (data not shown). In summary, these experiments demonstrate that the binding sites for agrin coincide well with the distribution of laminin on cultured myotubes, and they suggest that laminin-4 mediates binding of agrin to AChR clusters.</p>

        <title>Binding of Agrin to Laminin Alters the Size of the AChR Aggregates</title>
        <p>AChR aggregates induced by the active full-length splice variant cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub> are more than twofold smaller than those induced by the fragment cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub> lacking the first 130 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). Aggregation of AChRs induced by agrin is mainly based on the lateral migration of diffusely distributed molecules (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey et al., 1984</xref>). We have speculated that the binding of cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub> to ECM influences this process by immobilizing agrin in the ECM. If this were so, inhibition of the binding of cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub> to muscle laminins should result in AChR clusters with the same size as AChR clusters induced by cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub>. Myotubes incubated with cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub> had considerably smaller AChR aggregates than those incubated with cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). When available laminin-binding sites for full-length agrin were blocked by 500 nM cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub>-induced AChR clusters became indistinguishable from those induced by cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). In contrast to this, 500 nM of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc did not alter the shape of AChR aggregates induced by cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub>. Quantification of this effect with a computerized image analysis system confirmed that the presence of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc increased the average size of AChR aggregates induced by cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub> approximately twofold, while the average size of cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub>induced AChR clusters was not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>
<italic>b</italic>). These experiments provide evidence that the smaller size of the AChR clusters induced by full-length agrin is mainly based on its binding to laminin isoforms expressed by the myotubes. </p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Agrin is a large, multidomain protein that is associated with basement membranes in many tissues (for review see <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1996</xref>). In the current study, we investigated the molecular basis of agrin's binding to basement membrane. We found that agrin binds with high affinity to laminin isoforms, including those that are concentrated at the NMJ, and we have mapped the main laminin-binding site to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of agrin. Agrin has been shown to be a key regulator of synaptic differentiation at the NMJ (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">McMahan, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>), and thus we will mainly discuss the significance of the binding of agrin to laminin in this process.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>The Laminin-binding Domain of Agrin Defines a Novel Module</title>
        <p>At the outset of the current work, it was known that the binding of recombinant chick agrin to Matrigelâ¢ requires the first 130 amino acids at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of full-length agrin (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>). We now find that laminin-1, one component of Matrigelâ¢, serves as a binding partner for chick agrin. The binding of recombinant cAgrin<sub>7</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>) to laminin-1 is of high affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> of â¼5 nM; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and is mainly carried by the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of agrin as an excess of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment, cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc, competes the binding of full-length agrin by more than 90%.</p>
        <p>Although cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc includes the first follistatin-like domain, this domain is not necessary for the binding to laminin-1 (Denzer, A.J., and M.A. Ruegg, unpublished observation). The stretch preceding the follistatin-like domain is the most highly conserved region of agrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This high homology and the fact that this region in chick agrin mediates binding to all laminin isoforms so far tested (i.e., laminin-1, -2, and -4) strongly suggest it being important for the integration of agrin into the scaffold of ECM molecules formed by the self-assembled laminins and collagen type IV. Since no homology to any so far defined modules was found using BLAST or FASTA algorithms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pearson and Lipman, 1988</xref>), we propose to call this novel module NtA domain (for NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain in agrin; see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
<italic>a</italic>).</p>
        <p>The binding of the NtA domain of agrin to laminin-1 is confined to a particular region in the upper part of the triple coiled-coil domain of laminin-1, as shown by the binding of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc to proteolytic fragments of laminin-1 and visualization of this interaction by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing (Denzer, A.J., T. Schulthess, C. Fauser, B. Schumacher, J. Engel, and M.A. Ruegg, manuscript in preparation). These results show that the binding of agrin to laminin-1 is mediated by specific domains in both molecules and they support the result of this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) that the agrinâlaminin interaction is of high affinity.</p>

        <title>Binding of Agrin to Laminin and Its Role in AChR Aggregation</title>
        <p>Induction and maintenance of postsynaptic differentiation at nerveâmuscle contacts in vivo is triggered by neural agrin in a restricted area of muscle fibers (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">McMahan, 1990</xref>). The simplest explanation for this local action of neural agrin is that it becomes trapped in the extracellular matrix near its release site, the tip of the motor neuron's axon. Although we cannot exclude that other molecules are also involved in this process, we propose that the local immobilization of neural agrin is mainly mediated by its binding to laminin isoforms expressed by muscle fibers. Consistent with this view, the fragment cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc binds to purified laminin-2 and -4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), the two main laminin isoforms expressed in developing muscle fibers (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chiu and Sanes, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Sanes et al., 1990</xref>). In addition, agrin-like protein copurifies with laminin isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>
<italic>a</italic>), and cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc colocalizes with laminin and AChR clusters on cultured myotubes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Similarly, laminin-like immunoreactivity colocalizes with agrin-like protein in chick embryo hindlimb muscle in vivo and in vitro, and both proteins are enriched in AChR clusters (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey et al., 1988<italic>b</italic>
</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nitkin and Rothschild, 1990</xref>). The binding of neural agrin to laminin would also explain earlier observations that motor neuronâderived agrin associates with the earliest AChR clusters in frog nerveâmuscle cocultures (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Godfrey, 1992</xref>) and that it is deposited onto culture substrates containing laminin (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
        <p>We have shown that the size of agrin-induced AChR aggregates is affected by the NtA domain of agrin (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). On cultured chick myotubes, the size of cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub>-induced AChR clusters is indistinguishable from the size of the clusters induced by c21<sub>B8</sub>, the minimal fragment required for AChR aggregation that does not bind to Î±-dystroglycan (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Gesemann et al., 1996</xref>). Hence, unlike the binding of agrin to Î±-dystroglycan, the NtA domain has a clear effect on the size of the AChR clusters. One explanation for this phenomenon may be that agrin becomes immobilized on the muscle cell surface by its binding to laminin and thereby prevents small AChR clusters from fusing (see also Discussion in <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also think that the binding to laminin is the molecular basis that, after degeneration of the nerve terminals and the muscle fibers, AChR-aggregating activity and agrinlike immunoreactivity is maintained at former synaptic sites for several weeks (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burden et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Reist et al., 1987</xref>). At least in vitro, the tight association of agrin with muscle cell basal lamina requires the NtA domain; cultured chick myotubes that are incubated for only 30 min with AChR-aggregating full-length agrin (cAgrin<sub>7A4B8</sub>), subsequently washed and further incubated for 15 h in agrin-free culture medium, show agrin-induced AChR aggregates. In contrast to this, no AChR clusters are induced with the same paradigm using cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub> or any other active, COOH-terminal agrin fragment (Denzer, A.J., and M.A. Ruegg, unpublished data). Our observation that cÎN15Agrin<sub>A4B8</sub> is not capable of inducing AChR clusters by short-term incubation is similar to results of Wallace (1988), who showed that maintenance of AChR clusters in vitro needs the continuous presence of agrin. Since his agrin preparation mainly contained proteolytic fragments of the COOH-terminal half of agrin (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Nitkin et al., 1987</xref>), these fragments also lack the NtA domain.</p>

        <title>Binding of Agrin to Laminin Isoforms and Neuromuscular Junction Development In Vivo</title>
        <p>Upon formation of primary muscle fibers, Î²1-containing laminin isoforms are expressed throughout the muscle cell basal lamina (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chiu and Sanes, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Schuler and Sorokin, 1995</xref>). At later stages of synaptogenesis, the Î²2 chain of laminin (s-laminin) accumulates in synaptic basal lamina, and the Î²1 chain is displaced from this region and continues to be expressed extrasynaptically (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chiu and Sanes, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Sanes et al., 1990</xref>). In contrast to the Î² chains, the Î±2 and Î³1 chains are found throughout the muscle fiber basal lamina (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Sanes et al., 1990</xref>). These results strongly suggest that laminin-2 (Î±2, Î²1, Î³1) and laminin-4 (Î±2, Î²2, Î³1) are the laminin isoforms in the extrasynaptic and synaptic basal laminae, respectively. We find that, at one particular concentration, laminin-4 binds more strongly to agrin than laminin-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Hence, agrin may preferentially bind to laminin-4, and this may be the basis of the tight association of neural agrin with synaptic basal lamina throughout adulthood.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the phenotype of mice that are deficient of the Î²2 chain of laminin may, at least partially, be based on alterations of agrin. In these mice, NMJs are formed on schedule, but maturation of pre- and postsynaptic specializations is impaired, and terminal Schwann cells penetrate partially the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Noakes et al., 1995</xref>). Although the loss of the Î²2 chain is compensated by continued expression of the Î²1 chain at the NMJ (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 1996</xref>), this may not be sufficient to tether agrin to the NMJ. Since agrin has been shown to influence the formation of presynaptic specializations (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Campagna et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>), alterations in the binding of agrin to the NMJ may also explain the abnormalities in presynaptic specialization in the Î²2-deficient mice.</p>
        <p>For the current studies, we used agrin isoforms that include a 7âamino acid insert at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal splice site. Motor neurons in the developing chick spinal cord contain agrin transcripts encoding this agrin variant, whereas the majority of agrin mRNA in nonneuronal cells codes for agrin without the insert (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Tsen et al., 1995<italic>b</italic>
</xref>). Interestingly, the cDNA clones encoding mouse and human agrin, which are derived from nonneuronal tissue, all encode the splice variant lacking the insert (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Preliminary results show that both splice variants bind to laminin-1 (Denzer, A.J., and M.A. Ruegg, unpublished observation). Since there appears to be a difference in the binding of the two splice variants to Matrigelâ¢ (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>), it will be interesting to see whether splicing at this site influences binding of agrin to different laminin isoforms.</p>
        <p>Little is known about the function of agrin isoforms without AChR-aggregating activity. Since these inactive isoforms bind more strongly to Î±-dystroglycan than AChRaggregating isoforms and since they also bind to laminin, the inactive isoforms might have a structural role to link the basement membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton via the dystrophinâglycoprotein complex (for reviews see <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Campbell, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Worton, 1995</xref>). We have now generated the tools that will enable studies on the physiological significance of the binding of agrin to laminin isoforms and to the different binding proteins expressed on the muscle cell membrane, like Î±-dystroglycan.</p>

        <p>Chick agrin synthesized in vivo contains the laminin-binding domain.

Transferred protein were stained with antiagrin antibodies (Î± <italic>agrin</italic>) or antilaminin antibodies (Î± <italic>laminin</italic>). Agrin purified from vitreous fluid has approximately the same apparent molecular mass as recombinant full-length agrin. The band detected at â¼115 kD most likely results from proteolytic degradation. No laminin-like immunoreactivity is associated with recombinant agrin (<italic>right</italic>). In contrast to this, the agrin-containing fractions from vitreous fluid are positive for laminin-like protein. Based on their apparent molecular mass and the specificity of the antiserum used (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brubacher et al., 1991</xref>), they may represent nidogen (â¼150 kD), the Î² and Î³ chain (200 kD), and Î± chain (400 kD).

Deduced amino acid sequences of the expressed sequence tags (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lennon et al., 1996</xref>) from mouse and human agrin were aligned to the first 173 amino acids of chick agrin. In addition, the first 67 amino acids of rat agrin are shown. Amino acids identical to chick agrin are denoted with dots. The small letters in the chick sequence represent the proposed signal sequence (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Denzer et al., 1995</xref>) with the initiator methionine (<italic>bold</italic>) and the proposed signal sequence cleavage site (*). Underlined amino acids show the position of the tryptic peptide derived from a HSPG of bovine kidney (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Hagen et al., 1993</xref>). Homology between chick and human starts after the signal sequence cleavage site of chick (Cys 26). Amino acids between Cys 26 and Glu 149 are almost 90% identical between human, mouse, and chick. Note that the amino acid sequences of mouse and human agrin that precede the proposed signal peptide cleavage site (*) are not homologous to chick and consist mainly of hydrophobic amino acids. Thus, as in chick these stretches might be part of a signal sequence (<italic>lowercase letters</italic>). The homology between chick and rat begins at Asp 157 immediately after the boundary where chick is alternatively spliced. The human and mouse sequences lack the sevenâamino acidâlong insert at this splice site (<italic>dashes</italic>). These sequence data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession number U84406 (human agrin) and U84407 (mouse agrin).</p>

Agrin-like protein with the same apparent molecular mass as cAgrin<sub>7</sub> is detected in the laminin preparation. Since no Î±-dystroglycan was detected in the same laminin preparation (data not shown), the copurification of agrin suggests that laminins are associated with agrin in muscle tissue. (<italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic>) Agrin binds directly to purified chick laminin-2 and -4. Equal amounts of the two laminins were immobilized on microtiter plates and incubated either with 5 nM of iodinated cAgrin<sub>7</sub> (<italic>b</italic>) or cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc (<italic>c</italic>). Values given are the result of one representative experiment and represent the mean Â± SD of three measurements where the background (BSAcoated wells) has been subtracted.

Note that the difference in the counts measured with <sup>125</sup>I-cAgrin<sub>7</sub> and <sup>125</sup>I-cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc is due to different iodination efficiencies.</p>

        <p>Binding sites for agrin on cultured chick myotubes colocalize with AChRs and laminin. Cultured chick myotubes were induced to form AChR clusters with 200 nM c21<sub>B8</sub>. Simultaneously, 20 nM cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc were included. AChR aggregates were stained by rhodamineâÎ±-bungarotoxin, and cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc bound to the myotubes was visualized with biotinylated goat antiâmouse IgG followed by fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin. cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc is concentrated in AChR clusters and is distributed along the edges of the myotubes (<italic>arrowhead</italic>). No staining is seen in the absence of this fragment (â<italic>cN25<sub>7</sub></italic>Fc). Consistent with the idea that cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc binds to laminin, the distribution of myotube-bound cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc resembles the staining pattern obtained with anti-Î²/Î³-specific antiserum 648 (<italic>Î²</italic>/ <italic>Î³</italic>). The Î²2 chain of laminin, also called s-laminin, is concentrated in AChR clusters. In light of the colocalization of cN25<sub>7</sub>Fc and AChR clusters, laminin-4 (Î±2, Î²2, Î³1) is a binding partner of agrin in these clusters. Bar, 40 Î¼m.</p>
