          <title>Background</title>
          <p>15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH, EC 1.1.1.141) is the key enzyme for the inactivation of prostaglandins, regulating processes such as inflammation or proliferation. The anabolic pathways of prostaglandins, especially with respect to regulation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes have been studied in detail; however, little is known about downstream events including functional interaction of prostaglandin-processing and -metabolizing enzymes. High-affinity probes for 15-PGDH will, therefore, represent important tools for further studies.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Principal Findings</title>
          <p>To identify novel high-affinity inhibitors of 15-PGDH we performed a quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) by testing &gt;160 thousand compounds in a concentration-response format and identified compounds that act as noncompetitive inhibitors as well as a competitive inhibitor, with nanomolar affinity. Both types of inhibitors caused strong thermal stabilization of the enzyme, with cofactor dependencies correlating with their mechanism of action. We solved the structure of human 15-PGDH and explored the binding modes of the inhibitors to the enzyme <italic>in silico</italic>. We found binding modes that are consistent with the observed mechanisms of action.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Low cross-reactivity in screens of over 320 targets, including three other human dehydrogenases/reductases, suggest selectivity of the present inhibitors for 15-PGDH. The high potencies and different mechanisms of action of these chemotypes make them a useful set of complementary chemical probes for functional studies of prostaglandin-signaling pathways.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Eicosanoids are arachidonic acid derivatives that comprise distinct functional classes including prostaglandins (PGs), lipoxins and leukotrienes <xref rid="pone.0013719-Samuelsson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0013719-Samuelsson3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These bioactive fatty acids control a multitude of physiological functions including inflammation and differentiation. Dysregulation of the enzymes responsible for the generation and metabolism of active prostaglandins and lipoxins is associated with malignant transformation and progression in a variety of cancer types, such as breast, colon, lung and bladder cancers <xref rid="pone.0013719-Sheng1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0013719-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The intracellular levels of prostaglandins are controlled mainly by the interplay between the cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) on the one hand, and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH, EC 1.1.1.141) and other inactivating enzymes, on the other. COX-1 and COX-2 are bifunctional enzymes that, through their fatty acid cyclooxygenase- and prostaglandin hydroxyperoxidase activities, ultimately catalyze the generation of prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> (PGH<sub>2</sub>) from arachidonic acid <xref rid="pone.0013719-Buczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The other prostaglandins are then generated and transformed into one another by several isomerases and synthases, producing, e.g., prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) or thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TX) <xref rid="pone.0013719-Buczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-FitzGerald1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The wide variety of effects of prostaglandins in many different cell types derives from binding to a variety of mainly G-protein coupled receptors, of which eleven are currently known <xref rid="pone.0013719-FitzGerald1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, prostaglandins also interact with nuclear hormone receptors, thereby eliciting direct transcriptional effects <xref rid="pone.0013719-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Rizzo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>15-PGDH represents the key enzyme in the inactivation of a number of active prostaglandins, leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) (e.g., by catalyzing oxidation of PGE<sub>2</sub> to 15-keto-prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, (15k-PGE)) <xref rid="pone.0013719-Tai2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus far, two forms of 15-PGDH have been identified: NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent type-I 15-PGDH, and the NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent type-II 15-PGDH <xref rid="pone.0013719-Tai2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, also known as carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1, SDR21C1) <xref rid="pone.0013719-Wermuth1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The preference for NADP<sup>+</sup> and the high <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> values of CBR1 for most PGs suggest that the majority of the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity can be attributed to type-I 15-PGDH <xref rid="pone.0013719-Tai2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Human type-I 15-PGDH is encoded by the <italic>HPGD</italic> gene and belongs to the evolutionarily conserved superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes (SDRs) <xref rid="pone.0013719-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, within which it is classified as SDR36C1 <xref rid="pone.0013719-Persson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The enzyme has been purified from human placenta and its primary structure determined by Edman degradation <xref rid="pone.0013719-Krook1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; it was subsequently cloned <xref rid="pone.0013719-Ensor1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and characterized as a homodimer with subunits of a size of 29 kDa <xref rid="pone.0013719-Ensor1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Ensor2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The critical importance of 15-PGDH for the inactivation of prostaglandins makes the enzyme an attractive target for studying the details of interactions and signaling events in inflammation and cancer. However, all inhibitors that have been identified so far lack potency and specificity. Several thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) agonists, including pioglitazone and ciglitazone, have been shown to inhibit recombinant human placental 15-PGDH. Ciglitazone showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.7 ÂµM <xref rid="pone.0013719-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, while an optimized derivative, CT-8, had a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> of â¼90 nM <xref rid="pone.0013719-Cho2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Other clinically approved drugs that also act as inhibitors of 15-PGDH with micromolar potencies include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX inhibitors, e.g., indomethacin, sulindac, and niflumic acid <xref rid="pone.0013719-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Finally, a group of compounds called sulphasalazines have also been shown to inhibit human 15-PGDH, with the most effective compound, CAY10397, having a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> of 110 nM <xref rid="pone.0013719-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we describe the identification of chemotypes that potently inhibit human 15-PGDH, with either competitive or noncompetitive kinetics, and strongly stabilize the enzyme in a cofactor-dependent manner. The lead compounds show remarkable selectivity based on accumulated data from a large number of high-throughput screens against a wide range of targets. The determination of the crystal structure of 15-PGDH, also reported in this work, enabled us to propose a binding mode for the competitive inhibitor in the active site pocket that confirms its mechanism of inhibition. For the other inhibitors, the observations from the 15-PGDH crystal structure characterized the mechanism of inhibition as being noncompetitive.</p>

        <title>High-throughput identification of inhibitors of 15-PGDH</title>
        <p>To screen for inhibitors in a high-throughput format, we adopted the standard assay used for this enzyme which involved monitoring the increase in sample fluorescence corresponding to the conversion of the non-fluorescent NAD<sup>+</sup> cofactor into the fluorescent NADH upon oxidation of the 15-PGDH substrate 15-hydroxyprostaglandin type-E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The assay was miniaturized to a 4-ÂµL volume in 1536-well format: enzyme (3 ÂµL) was dispensed first, followed by a pintool transfer of library compounds dissolved in DMSO. After equilibration, a substrate dispense (1 ÂµL) initiated the enzymatic reaction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, for detailed protocol description). A robotic validation run consisting of a concentration-response screen of the LOPAC<sup>1280</sup> library, performed in triplicate, yielded excellent assay statistics and hit reproducibility (supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s003">Figures S1A and S1B</xref>). The concentration-response screen of the entire collection comprising 895 1536-well plates was completed in 5 days. The Z' screening factor <xref rid="pone.0013719-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> associated with each plate remained high and stable throughout the screen (average Z'â=â0.86, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A concentration response of the control inhibitor GW5074, identified in an earlier pilot screen (PubChem AID 894, supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s003">Figure S1C</xref>), added as a 16-point dilution series in duplicate between 57.5 ÂµM and 3.5 nM into the second column of every assay plate displayed consistent inhibition throughout the screen (supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s003">Figure S1D</xref>): the average IC<sub>50</sub> was 10.4 ÂµM and the associated minimum significant ratio was 1.5, indicating a highly stable run according to the definition given by Eastwood and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0013719-Eastwood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The hits identified ranged in inhibitory potency from submicromolar to double-digit micromolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to progress only the highest-confidence primary screening hits to the subsequent investigations, samples exhibiting weak/noisy responses, as well as those representing potential false positives, were eliminated during the initial analysis. The testing of each library compound in dose-response mode (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g001">Figures 1C and 1D</xref>) permitted a detailed examination of the type and quality of the inhibition response (IC<sub>50</sub>, concentration-response curve shape, efficacy, presence of asymptotes). Hits associated with low-efficacy (&lt;40% maximum inhibition), incomplete curves, as well as those displaying only a single-point inhibition at the top concentration tested were eliminated from further consideration. Similarly, the collection of real-time kinetic data allowed the autofluorescence of each compound to be evaluated by comparing the initial fluorescence read at top concentration with the mean value of uninhibited assay controls: compounds whose top-concentration initial well fluorescence exceeded six standard deviations over the mean were flagged as potential autofluorescent artifacts <xref rid="pone.0013719-Jadhav1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Simeonov1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (see example in supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s003">Figure S1E</xref>). The complete screening and followup results are available in PubChem (PubChem Assay ID 894).</p>

        <title>Compound stabilization of 15-PGDH</title>
        <p>To investigate the ability of the inhibitors to thermally stabilize 15-PGDH, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF <xref rid="pone.0013719-Niesen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>) was performed on the above 50 prioritized hits in the absence and in the presence of the cofactor in its oxidized or reduced state (NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">4</xref>). The melting point, T<sub>m</sub>, of ligand-free 15-PGDH at pH 8.0 was 41.2Â±0.3Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The stability was increased by more than 4Â°C in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> (T<sub>m</sub>â=â45.9Â±0.1Â°C) and by more than 10Â°C in the presence of NADH (T<sub>m</sub>â=â52.5Â±0.4Â°C). The substrate PGE<sub>2</sub> failed to stabilize without cofactor, but stabilized by 2.4Â°C in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, no stabilization was observed in the presence of NADH. Similarly to PGE<sub>2</sub>, none of the inhibitors stabilized the protein in the absence of cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s001">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that the cofactor may be necessary for the enzyme to assume a ligand-competent conformation. This observation is also in general concordance with the ordered bi-bi mechanism of the enzymatic reaction of short-chain dehydrogenases including 15-PGDH <xref rid="pone.0013719-Filling1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the presence of cofactor, the 50 selected hits elicited a range of thermal stability enhancements up to 12.2Â°C in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> and up to 13.5Â°C in the presence of NADH (expressed as a shift in the transition midpoint temperature, ÎT<sub>m</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A correlation between the ÎT<sub>m</sub> and the inhibitory potency has been shown in a number of protein-ligand systems, particularly for kinases <xref rid="pone.0013719-Kroe1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0013719-Fedorov1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In the case of 15-PGDH, the correlation between inhibitory pIC<sub>50</sub>s and ÎT<sub>m</sub> in the presence of cofactor appears to depend on chemotype: across the multiple clusters the correlation is generally weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>), while for individual chemotype clusters a meaningful correlation is observed. For the largest cluster 1, a moderate correlation is apparent in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>, while the correlation in the presence of NADH is more robust (R<sup>2</sup>â=â0.886): in general, compounds in this cluster show greater T<sub>m</sub> shifts with NADH than with NAD<sup>+</sup>, as exemplified by the most potent analogue, compound <bold>13</bold>, [1-(3-methylphenyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-benzimidazol-5-yl)(piperidin-1-yl)methanone (a.k.a. ML148), (IC<sub>50</sub> of 56 nM, ÎT<sub>m</sub>â=â7.3Â±0.2Â°C or 13.5Â±0.9Â°C with NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH, respectively). Compound <bold>72</bold> (a.k.a. ML149), belonging to a different cluster, showed a similar profile with a significantly larger ÎT<sub>m</sub> in the presence of NADH. Conversely, members of the smaller cluster 5 showed the reverse profile: the most potent analogue <bold>61</bold> (a.k.a. ML147) gave an IC<sub>50</sub> of 141 nM and T<sub>m</sub> shifts of 12.2Â±0.1Â°C or 2.9Â±0.5Â°C with NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH, respectively.</p>

        <title>Verification of inhibitor activity after re-synthesis</title>
        <p>The contrasting stabilization profiles alerted us to the possibility of differing mechanisms of inhibition, and we selected compounds <bold>13</bold>, <bold>61</bold> and <bold>72</bold> for further study. In order to definitively confirm identity and activity and to provide high quality material for in-depth kinetic studies, these three compounds were re-synthesized (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The effects of the re-synthesized compounds on the protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) were found to be similar to the results obtained previously. To achieve an optimal signal window in the detailed kinetic measurements with the new compounds, a higher enzyme concentration was employed and the reactions were run at a lower percent substrate conversion than used in both the qHTS and the re-tests. As a result, higher apparent potencies were observed for all three compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">Figure 4B</xref>): The IC<sub>50</sub> for compound <bold>13</bold> was 7.9Â±0.8 nM, compared to 56 nM calculated according to the re-test results, and for compounds <bold>61</bold> and <bold>72</bold>, respectively, values of IC<sub>50</sub> of 26.4Â±2.4 and 15.0Â±1.2 nM were determined (compared to 141 nM and 82 nM, respectively).

The maximal rate, <italic>V</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0013719-Segel1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Global fitting of the results to the four possible modes of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive and mixed-type inhibition) returned the highest probability for the mixed-type mode (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0013719-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, the fitting results are also consistent with a competitive mode for inhibition by compound <bold>61</bold>, particularly when the residual Chi<sup>2</sup> value for this mode is compared to those of the other two compounds. Together with the observation from the Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the data (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), the most consistent mode of inhibition for compound <bold>61</bold> is competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate PGE<sub>2</sub>.

This interpretation was confirmed by the results of comparative fitting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0013719-t002">Table 2</xref>) that showed uncompetitive inhibition with respect to the cofactor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the most likely mode of inhibition for both compounds.</p>

        <title>Crystal structure of the 15-PGDH homodimer</title>
        <p>We were interested to explore whether the structure of 15-PGDH could provide insights into the observed mechanisms of the newly discovered inhibitors. After several unsuccessful crystallization attempts with constructs bearing different tags fused to the N- or C-terminus, respectively, it was possible to grow crystals in presence of NADH from a construct purified with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag and to determine for the first time the structure of the homodimer of 15-PGDH in a complex with its cofactor at a resolution of 1.65 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g005">Figure 5</xref> and Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s002">Table S2</xref>). This resolution is not high enough to distinguish the reduced state of the cofactor from its oxidized form <xref rid="pone.0013719-deKok1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It is, however, unlikely that the structure of 15-PGDH contained NADH considering the time necessary to generate the crystals and the known short half-life of NADH in solution, despite the addition of the cofactor in its reduced state. The protein shows the Î±/Î² folding pattern that is highly conserved among the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR), where a central Î²-sheet consisting of 8 strands is flanked on either side by two arrays of Î±-helices (Rossmann fold) <xref rid="pone.0013719-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Jornvall1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the crystallized construct the last ten amino acids from the 15-PGDH sequence are missing, leaving Tyr256 as the last native amino acid. Instead, the cloning procedure resulted in the fusion of nine non-natural amino acids (Gly-Ser-Lys-Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln) to the C-terminus remaining after cleavage of the tag. In the structure of the dimer the artificial C-terminus of one protomer is folded over the top of the opposing protomer (highlighted in orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g005">Figure 5</xref>), with a number of residues engaging in interactions with side chains of the other protomer, notably between Phe264 and Tyr217. One cofactor molecule per protomer is located in the center of the molecule (in ball-and-stick representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The acidic residue Asp36 forms hydrogen bonds to the 2â²- and 3â²-hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose moiety, while Asp64 forms a hydrogen bond to the amino group of the adenine moiety (supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s004">Figure S2</xref>). The nicotinamide moiety of NAD<sup>+</sup> is positioned close to the catalytic tetrad (Asn107, Ser138, Tyr151 and Lys155), competent for the hydride transfer from the S-side of C4 to the substrate following the reaction mechanism conserved among all SDRs <xref rid="pone.0013719-Filling1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Jornvall1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0013719-Kallberg1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Docking of inhibitors to the 15-PGDHâ¢NAD<sup>+</sup> complex</title>
        <p>All attempts to co-crystallize the inhibitors with 15-PGDH were unsuccessful. Therefore, we explored the inhibitor binding modes by computational docking of the compounds to the structure of the 15-PGDHâ¢NAD<sup>+</sup> complex. Docking experiments were carried out using the structure of a single protomer, to avoid the artifactual occupancy of the substrate pocket by the C-terminus of the opposing protomer (see above). This structure offers a large volume for binding of the inhibitors, notably a hydrophobic pocket close to the nicotinamide moiety of the NAD<sup>+</sup>, flanked by Ile195, Leu192, Ile211 and Ile215 (indicated by a green mesh in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g006">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>).

        <p>We identified plausible binding modes with well-defined side chain interactions which, interestingly, were similar for all three inhibitors, despite their structural differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g006">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>, supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s005">Figure S3</xref>). Binding of compound <bold>61</bold> appears to be driven by interaction of the imidazo-pyridine ring with the catalytic Ser138 and Tyr151 residues, while the bromo-substituent projects into the hydrophobic pocket. The cyanobenzyl group is accommodated in the substrate tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). For compound <bold>13</bold>, the amide carbonyl also interacts with the catalytic residues Ser138 and Tyr151, while the piperidine ring fits snugly into the adjacent hydrophobic pocket. The remainder of the molecule is accommodated along the tunnel towards solvent, with the side chain of Phe185 providing a stacking opportunity for the central benzimidazole moiety of <bold>13</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The binding mode found for compound <bold>72</bold> is similar, with the triazole moiety mimicking the amide carbonyl of compound <bold>13</bold> in accepting hydrogen bonds from both Ser138 and Tyr151 (supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s005">Figure S3</xref>). The fused azepine ring occupies the proximal hydrophobic pocket, and the remaining biaryl moiety extends into the substrate tunnel, again with the possibility for stacking between the pyrrole ring of <bold>72</bold> and Phe185.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Selective, high-affinity inhibitors for human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) are desirable as tools to facilitate the mapping of prostaglandin signaling pathways <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a quantitative high-throughput screen approach we have found several new chemotypes that inhibit 15-PGDH with high affinity. Detailed biophysical analyses have demonstrated the strong stabilizing effect of these molecules on the enzyme. Based on the results from our detailed kinetic analyses a number of inhibition modes appeared possible, but the data are consistent with compounds <bold>13</bold> and <bold>72</bold> not inhibiting competitively, while a competitive mechanism of inhibition appeared likely for compound <bold>61</bold>.</p>
      <p>In order to gain better understanding of the distinct mechanisms of action of the inhibitors, it is helpful to examine the catalytic mechanism of 15-PGDH. The SDR enzymes have been shown to follow a common sequential ordered bi-bi-reaction mechanism, involving sequential cofactor binding, substrate binding, catalysis, product release, and finally release of co-product <xref rid="pone.0013719-Filling1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013719-Jornvall1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, as shown in the reaction coordinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In analogy with other SDRs, binding of the NAD<sup>+</sup> cofactor is expected to alter the local electrostatic environment of the catalytic Tyr151 residue, favoring the deprotonated state. After substrate binding, the reaction proceeds by deprotonation of the substrate 15-OH group by Tyr151, facilitating hydride transfer from the substrate to NAD<sup>+</sup>, and forming the product complex consisting of protonated Tyr151, NADH, and ketone.</p>

      <p>One of the inhibitor chemotypes identified from the high throughput screen is a series of imidazopyridines, represented by the most potent analogue <bold>61</bold>, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 25 nM and an estimated <italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> of 5 nM. The biophysical data show a strong preference for <bold>61</bold> in stabilizing 15-PGDH complexed with NAD<sup>+</sup> as compared with NADH.</p>
      <p>The results of the docking experiments provide support for a competitive mechanism of inhibition by compound <bold>61</bold>. The docking directs the imidazopyridine group into hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic residues Tyr151 and Ser138. In the co-complex with NAD<sup>+</sup>, as discussed above, the deprotonated form of Tyr151 is favored: the resultant oxyanion is able to interact with the protonated form of the pyridine ring, while the hydroxy group of Ser138 is able to donate a hydrogen bond to the adjacent imidazole nitrogen. The much weaker stabilization observed with NADH implies that the protonated form of Tyr151 interacts considerably more weakly with the pyridyl nitrogen.</p>
      <p>In addition to providing a convincing basis for interaction of the heterocyclic motif with the enzyme's catalytic machinery, this binding orientation also favorably directs the bromo-substituent into the nearby hydrophobic pocket, and places the S-linked cyanobenzyl group into the substrate tunnel leading towards the exterior of the protein, which contains side chains available for stacking interactions (Phe185, Tyr217). Taken together, the data argue that the position for binding of compound <bold>61</bold> along the reaction coordinate of 15-PGDH is at step 2, i.e., occurs to the complex of 15-PGDHâ¢NAD<sup>+</sup> (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with the observed uncompetitive mechanism of action with respect to NAD<sup>+</sup>, since the higher affinity of the inhibitor compared to the substrate is expected to increase the affinity for NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p>
      <p>The majority of the remaining inhibitor hits fall into three structural clusters (clusters 1, 2 and 4; supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s001">Table S1</xref>), all containing an amide moiety as the common feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Structure-activity relationships indicate that activity is favored when the nitrogen of the amide forms part of a saturated heterocycle, most commonly piperidine. In all of the active amides identified, the carbonyl is linked to a ring, which is aromatic in the most potent analogues. The highest potency is achieved when this ring is linked to a further aryl ring, with a variety of linkers being tolerated. In compound <bold>13</bold>, this linker is incorporated into the central fused benzimidazole ring system.</p>
      <p>The results of the docking experiments are consistent with the observed structure-activity relationships and provide help with the decision about which of the mechanisms of inhibition that are possible according to the kinetic analyses would be most likely for the inhibitors. In the model of compound <bold>13</bold> docked into 15-PGDH, the oxygen of the amide carbonyl presents two lone pairs that can accept hydrogen bonds from both the catalytic Ser138 and Tyr151 residues, mimicking the ketone product of oxidation of the PGE<sub>2</sub> substrate. Tyr151 is only able to donate this hydrogen bond when protonated, which is favored by binding of NADH, while binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> favors the deprotonated state. Hence, compound <bold>13</bold> acts as a product analogue in the sequential ordered bi-bi catalysis mechanism, and a noncompetitive mode of inhibition with respect to PGE<sub>2</sub> and an uncompetitive mode with respect to NAD<sup>+</sup> would be expected <xref rid="pone.0013719-Rudolph1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Our kinetic analysis is consistent with this mode, identifying uncompetitive inhibition with respect to the cofactor, while equal probability was found for noncompetitive, uncompetitive and mixed-type inhibition with respect to the substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0013719-t002">Table 2</xref>). Uncompetitive inhibition by the compounds of the series with respect to NAD<sup>+</sup> is, furthermore, consistent with the observed enhanced stabilization of 15-PGDH when the latter is bound to NADH as compared with NAD<sup>+</sup>; this stabilization of product-bound 15-PGDH ultimately results in a suppression of enzymatic turnover.</p>
      <p>The preference for small alicyclic amides is also explained by the docking model: the piperidine moiety of compound <bold>13</bold> is relatively tightly accommodated in the hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with this binding mode, inhibitory potency is weaker for secondary or tertiary straight-chain amides, and further diminished or abolished with bicyclic amides that can clearly not be accommodated in this pocket (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As described above, the structure-activity relationships indicate that activity is retained with a variety of groups attached to the amide carbonyl carbon atom, although there is a preference for aromatic groups, and in general these groups are substituted in such a way as to be able to adopt an extended conformation. Such a conformation is consistent with the docking mode, placing the extended group into the substrate tunnel leading towards the exterior of the protein. The availability of side chain groups capable of stacking interactions (Phe185, Tyr217) adds further support to this proposed binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Compound <bold>72</bold> shares aspects of its mechanism with compound <bold>13</bold>, notably a strong preference for NADH in co-stabilization of 15-PGDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g004">4A</xref>) and a cofactor-uncompetitive inhibition mechanism. With respect to the substrate PGE<sub>2</sub> the kinetic analysis favored the noncompetitive mode, consistent with the expectation for a product-analogous binding mode (see above). Although compound <bold>72</bold> does not contain an amide group, the fused 1,2,4-triazole is capable of acting as a bioisostere, with a lone pair of electrons on each of the adjacent nitrogen atoms mimicking the two lone pairs of the carbonyl oxygen in <bold>13</bold> (Supplementary Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013719.s005">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, in the docking experiments, the triazole moiety accepts two hydrogen bonds from Ser138 and the protonated form of Tyr151; the remaining hydrophobic and stacking interactions are remarkably similar to those modeled for compound <bold>13</bold>. Therefore, both compounds <bold>13</bold> and <bold>72</bold> bind at step 4 along the 15-PGDH reaction coordinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013719-g007">Figure 7</xref>), mimicking the product, favoring co-complex formation with NADH and behaving in an uncompetitive manner with respect to the PGE<sub>2</sub> substrate.</p>
      <p>The compound library used for screening of 15-PGDH in this study has been, so far, tested in screens against over 320 targets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). This list includes two other proteins that are involved in prostaglandin signaling, the EP2 prostaglandin-E<sub>2</sub> receptor and the M1-muscarinic receptor. The list also includes two SDR enzymes, hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase (HADH2, also known as type-10 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, HSD17Î²10; PubChem Assay ID 886) and type-4 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17Î²4; PubChem Assay ID 893), and a medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1; PubChem Assay ID 1030), each of which was tested using a similar experimental protocol to that used for 15-PGDH. As the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0013719-t003">Table 3</xref> show, all lead inhibitors identified in this study were largely inactive against ALDH1A1: compounds <bold>61</bold> and <bold>72</bold> showed a flat response, while compound <bold>13</bold> displayed only a shallow curve with an approximate IC<sub>50</sub> of 36 ÂµM. Against the two hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD17Î²10 and HSD17Î²4), both compounds <bold>13</bold> and <bold>72</bold> were inactive up to the top concentration of 57.5 ÂµM.</p>

      <p>In summary, the new inhibitor chemotypes identified in this study provide a set of tools, with complementary mechanisms of inhibition, for functional studies on the role of 15-PGDH in prostaglandin signaling pathways. The lead compounds that have been characterized in detail exhibit nanomolar affinities. The existence of disease scenarios involving over-activation of 15-PGDH and in which selective inhibition of the enzyme would be beneficial, is currently unclear. Work published by Tai and co-workers suggested that certain prostate cancers might involve higher-than-normal activity of 15-PGDH <xref rid="pone.0013719-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, and for such cases application of inhibitors based on the chemotypes identified in this study may prove useful. The potential utility of the probes is reinforced by the low cross-reactivity of these compounds in screens against multiple targets, among them receptors with a role in prostaglandin signaling and dehydrogenase enzymes utilizing the same cofactors, suggesting selectivity of the inhibitors for 15-PGDH. The availability of multiple inhibitors with diverse chemical structures for cellular studies enhances confidence in any response observed being due to on-target effects; the likelihood for such diverse compounds having an identical off-target activity profile is very small. While it is difficult to anticipate differences in the cellular response between inhibitors showing contrasting modes of action, one might expect the noncompetitive compounds to demonstrate inhibition independently of the substrate concentration. This may help to avoid problems similar to those encountered, for example, with ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitors, where high inhibitor concentrations are required in cells to compete against the endogenous co-factor. Finally, in this work we present the novel crystal structure of human 15-PGDH, which will serve as a basis for further studies on the function, mechanism and inhibitor design for this enzyme.</p>

        <p>Docking was performed using GLIDE (Schrodinger, LLC) <xref rid="pone.0013719-Friesner1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> and the structure of 15-PGDH was prepared using the software's default minimization protocols. Docking grids were generated using a box around Ser138 in the catalytic site. For docking to the NAD<sup>+</sup> complex, Tyr151 was kept de-protonated; for docking to the NADH complex NAD<sup>+</sup> was changed to NADH with a OPLS-2005 force field <xref rid="pone.0013719-Jorgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> and a hydrogen constraint to Tyr151 was used. Ligands (substrate and inhibitors) were prepared with the LIGPREP and IONIZER tools in GLIDE, at pH 7.0+/â2.0, to determine the ionization states of the ligands. All inhibitors were docked using GLIDE-SP and the top 5 scored poses were kept. The binding poses were visually inspected and hydrogen bond patterns were analyzed in order to determine the best pose.</p>
