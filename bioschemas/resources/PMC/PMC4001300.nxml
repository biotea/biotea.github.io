      <abstract>
        <p>Loss of the nucleus is a critical step in keratinocyte terminal differentiation. To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we focused on two characteristic events: nuclear translocation of N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin and caspase-14-dependent degradation of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD). First, we demonstrated that epidermal mesotrypsin liberated a 55-kDa N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin (FLG-N) and FLG-N was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, these cells became TUNEL positive. Mutation in the mesotrypsin-susceptible Arg-rich region between FLG-N and the first filaggrin domain abolished these changes. Furthermore, caspase-14 caused limited proteolysis of ICAD, followed by accumulation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) in TUNEL-positive nuclei. Knockdown of both proteases resulted in a significant increase of remnant nuclei in a skin equivalent model. Immunohistochemical study revealed that both caspase-14 and mesotrypsin were markedly downregulated in parakeratotic areas of lesional skin from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Collectively, our results indicate that at least two pathways are involved in the DNA degradation process during keratinocyte terminal differentiation.</p>

    <p>Persistent presence of undigested nuclei in cornified cells (parakeratosis) is correlated with impaired barrier function, as shown by higher values of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), an indicator of barrier function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Although this is an important issue in connection with formation of the protective barrier of the skin, the mechanisms of DNA degradation during keratinocyte terminal differentiation remain unclear.</p>
    <p>It has long been suggested that DNase 1L2 is responsible for denucleation in epidermis. However, DNase 1L2-deficient mice have a unique phenotype, with undigested nuclei being present only in hair shaft and nail plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> DNase 2, the predominant DNase on the mammalian skin surface, primarily targets exogenous DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Caspases are cysteine proteases that regulate apoptosis and inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Executioner caspases cause limited proteolysis of ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase), releasing CAD (caspase-activated DNase) that is translocated into the nucleus, where it causes DNA degradation. However, proapoptotic caspases are not activated during terminal differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Unlike other caspase family members, caspase-14 shows restricted expression, being found only in epidermis, skin appendages and thymic Hassall's bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> It has been suggested that caspase-14 is not involved in apoptosis or inflammation, but participates in keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Denecker <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> reported that although caspase-14 knockout mice showed defects in filaggrin (FLG) degradation, there was no effect on denucleation. However, the same group recently reported that caspase-14-deficient mice are prone to development of parakeratosis (persistent presence of nuclei in the cornified layer) in conditions triggering epidermal hyperproliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Another characteristic event related to the nuclear changes during terminal differentiation is translocation of the N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin into the nucleus. This translocation is associated with triggering of morphological changes of nuclei,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> although the mechanisms are not established.</p>
    <p>In order to clarify the mechanism of denucleation of keratinocytes, we focused on two characteristic events that are associated with nuclear changes. One of our targets was the liberation and translocation of N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin, and the other was caspase-14, as its activation occurs at the onset of denucleation. Using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), we found that the N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin interacts with epidermal mesotrypsin (trypsinogen 5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and caspase-14. Our results suggest that these proteases work cooperatively as well as independently via different pathways. Thus, at least two pathways appear to be involved in the DNA degradation process, and downregulation of both caspase-14 and mesotrypsin is associated with persistent presence of nuclei in the cornified layer.</p>

        <title>N-Terminal fragment of profilaggrin, consisting of A domain, B domain and truncated FLG repeat, is translocated into the nucleus</title>
        <p>First, we examined the presence of N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin in nuclear fractions of cultured keratinocytes. Profilaggrin itself was detected at day 5 and strongly expressed at day 7 of prolonged culture after confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Anti-A+B domain antibody (H-300) detected a fragment of 55âkDa in the nuclear extract as well as in the cytoplasmic extract obtained from the day 7 culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating that a large fragment consisting of the AâB domains together with a truncated domain is translocated into the nucleus after profilaggrin processing. Then, we prepared an expression vector with a 1392âbp insert encoding a 464-amino-acid N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin (FLG-N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This N-terminal region was selected based on the observed fragment size and the presence of possible cleavage sites for serine proteases around Arg<sup>464</sup> of profilaggrin, as there is an Arg-rich region located at Arg<sup>455</sup>-Arg<sup>464</sup>. The molecular weight of FLG-N expressed in keratinocytes was similar to that of the fragment detected in nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). FLG-N was also recognized by anti-FLG monoclonal antibody (mAb). A time-lapse study using a construct of fluorescent protein Keima-Red (KR) fused to FLG-N (KR-FLG-N) showed that fluorescence emerged from 7âh after transfection and subsequently accumulated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). The transfected cells showed the increase of fluorescence and it gradually disappeared. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that after FLG-N transfection in the growth phase, only HA-positive and FLG mAb-positive cells exhibited DNA degradation, as judged in terms of TUNEL positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Translocation of FLG-N into the nucleus was confirmed with two different antibodies: anti-A+B domain antibody (H-300) and anti-FLG mAb that recognizes only the FLG repeat. These results show that FLG-N in the nucleus contains not only the A and B domains, but also a truncated FLG domain. Next we tried to identify which domain is responsible for DNA degradation. We constructed expression vectors for A domain (FLG-A), A domain with NLS (FLG-A+nls), B domain (FLG-B) and B domain+truncated FLG repeat (FLG-BT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). After transfection of FLG-A, only cytoplasm was stained with anti-HA antibody (Ab), and TUNEL staining was completely negative. In contrast, cells expressing FLG-A with nuclear localization signal (NLS) showed accumulation of this fragment in the nucleus and became TUNEL positive. FLG-B- or FLG-BT-transfected cells did not develop TUNEL positivity, although the fragments were translocated into the nucleus. Thus, B domain by itself can enter the nucleus, in accordance with the observation of Pearton <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> However, our results indicate that the A domain is responsible for DNA degradation.</p>

        <title>N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin interacts with trypsinogen 5 and caspase-14</title>
        <p>To identify molecules interacting with the N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin, we carried out affinity purification-mass spectrometry. An N-terminal fragment consisting of the A and B domains of profilaggrin was prepared as a glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-fusion protein (GST-N-FLG), following Pearton <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> GST-N-FLG was incubated with five kinds of extracts from keratinocytes and cornified cells, and interacting molecules were subjected to LC/MS/MS analyses. Molecules interacting with GST alone were also identified for exclusion as nonspecific binders. Structural proteins and ribosomal proteins were also excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We finally selected two proteases, trypsinogen 3 and caspase-14, as candidate interactors. These proteases were commonly detected in nuclear extracts of keratinocytes and in cornified cell extracts. Interestingly, the sequence identified by the analysis is identical with one that we have previously cloned, a specific isoform of the PRSS3 gene products that we named trypsinogen 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> After activation, identical mesotrypsin is produced from all three isoforms (trypsinogens 3â5). These proteases are of particular interest because their activation coincides spatiotemporally with denucleation.</p>

        <title>N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin is released by mesotrypsin, and caspase-14 may contribute to this reaction</title>
        <p>We constructed expression vectors for constitutively active mesotrypsin, caspase-14, kallikrein-related peptidase-5 (KLK5), and KLK7. KLK5 was chosen as it is suggested to be an initiator protease in desquamation protease cascades, and KLK7 was selected to examine the effect of a chymotrypsin-like enzyme. As caspase-14 is not activated in the monolayer culture system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> we used constitutively active caspase-14 generated by reversing the large and small subunits (revC14), prepared in our laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> The revC14 showed equivalent enzyme activity to caspase-14 purified from the extract of human cornified cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). We used two kinds of promoters. The CMV promoter made it possible to express revC14, as well as other active proteases, in proliferating keratinocytes. On the other hand, the involucrin promoter enabled us to express these proteases in differentiated keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were transfected with these expression vectors and continuously cultured after confluency. Expression of the proteases was confirmed by means of western blotting with anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). Mesotrypsin alone liberated an N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin with a molecular weight of 55âkDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), to a small extent. However, neither caspase-14 nor KLK5 and KLK7 alone produced the N-terminal fragment. Interestingly, we found that this fragment was efficiently generated when active caspase-14 and mesotrypsin were coexpressed. When constitutively active mesotrypsin was introduced into keratinocytes, the N-terminal fragment was accumulated in nuclei that became TUNEL positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Only mesotrypsin-expressing cells showed DNA degradation after confluence had been reached, as judged by colocalization of HA- and TUNEL-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). We confirmed that expression of active mesotrypsin itself did not induce DNA degradation in the growth phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>). As KLK5 is a trypsin-like protease, it may influence mesotrypsin activity. We tested this possibility, but found that KLK5 had no effect on mesotrypsinogen activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to HA-positive cells. Most of the revC14-expressing cells were TUNEL positive (95%). Active mesotrypsin-expressing cells showed rather lower TUNEL positivity (72%). Coexpression of these proteases resulted in 95% TUNEL positivity. Possible reasons why revC14-expressing cells showed a higher rate of TUNEL positivity would be a higher efficiency of DNA degradation by the ICADâCAD system and/or a slower rate of degradation by the FLG-Nâmesotrypsin system. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) suggested interaction between mesotrypsin and active caspase-14 as well as between mesotrypsin and filaggrin in normal human epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These results are consistent with a physiological role of epidermal mesotrypsin as an N-terminal-processing enzyme in differentiated keratinocytes.</p>

        <title>Mutation in the Arg-rich region abolished mesotrypsin-induced nuclear translocation of FLG-N</title>
        <p>There are four arginines present in 10 residues (Arg<sup>455</sup>, Arg<sup>457</sup>, Arg<sup>461</sup> and Arg<sup>464</sup>) near the C-terminal end of FLG-N. These were changed to Leu (FLGmut), and various expression vectors (FLG-N-KR, AG-FLGmut and FLGmut-KR) were constructed in addition to KR-FLG-N for elucidation of the physiological role of mesotrypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). When fluorescent proteins were fused to the N-terminal of FLG-N (KR-FLG-N) or FLGmut (AG-FLGmut), the fusion proteins were translocated into nuclei and the cells became TUNEL positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Accumulation of KR-FLG-N as well as AG-FLGmut in nuclei was evident in both cases. In contrast, fusion of the fluorescent proteins to the C-terminal of FLG-N (FLG-N-KR) or FLGmut (FLGmut-KR) completely suppressed the translocation and TUNEL staining was negative. Next, we co-transfected the active mesotrypsin construct into these cells. In the presence of active mesotrypsin, FLG-N-KR-expressing cells became TUNEL-positive, whereas coexpression of FLGmut-KR and active mesotrypsin had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The results of quantitative analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. Expression of KR-FLG-N and AG-FLGmut gave similar results, showing 88.3% and 91.1% nuclear localization, respectively. More than 95% of these cells were TUNEL positive. In contrast, FLG-N-KR or FLGmut-KR remained almost entirely in cytoplasm, and nuclei showed &lt;1% TUNEL positivity. When FLG-N-KR was co-transfected with mesotrypsin, 63% of FLG-N-KR-expressing cells showed nuclear localization, and 69% of those cells became TUNEL positive. In the case of FLGmut-KR, coexpression caused no observable change. Furthermore, we performed biochemical analysis. Using recombinant FLG-N and FLGmut proteins as substrates, cleavage of the linker region by mesotrypsin was investigated. If the linker region of FLG-N (55âkDa) is cleaved, â¼3âkDa less peptide would be generated. Our results clearly showed that a 52-kDa peptide was generated from the recombinant FLG-N by the incubation with mesotrypsin. The recombinant FLGmut protein, where four Arg residues in the linker region were changed to Leu residues, did not show any changes in the incubation with mesotrypsin, showing insusceptible nature against mesotrypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3D</xref>). These results indicate that liberation of the FLG N-terminal is essential for translocation into the nucleus, and is sufficient to initiate DNA degradation. Epidermal mesotrypsin appears to be involved in the cleavage of the Arg-rich linker region.</p>

        <title>Caspase-14 alone induces DNA degradation in cultured keratinocytes</title>
        <p>Keratinocytes were transfected with the CMV promoter-driven revC14 vector, and expression of revC14 was monitored by immunostaining with h14D146 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although active caspase-14 was expressed in only â¼4.5% of keratinocytes, these cells in the growth phase did not show positive in TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Control proliferating keratinocytes synthesized little or no caspase-14, as detected with anti-caspase-14 mAb. In another experiment, keratinocytes were transfected with the involucrin-promoter construct and cultured to confluency, then a further differentiation stimulus was applied (addition of 2âmM calcium). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> shows that involucrin promoter-driven revC14 emerged in the transfected cells after prolonged culture. In a typical experiment, revC14-positive cells amounted to â¼5.3% of the total, as judged by h14D146 antibody staining. Interestingly, most of the cells stained with these antibodies were found to be TUNEL positive (88% of the revC14-positive cells), indicating that DNA degradation occurred in the active caspase-14-expressing differentiated keratinocytes. The results of quantitative analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, confirming that active caspase-14 has the ability to induce DNA degradation in differentiated keratinocytes. Time-lapse study further confirmed that caspase-14-induced changes occurred only in differentiated keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Among proliferating keratinocytes, caspase-14-expressing cells were actively moving, and some even showed cell division. In confluent culture, however, most of the keratinocytes transfected with the involucrin promoter-driven revC14 showed marked morphological changes after the induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). As keratinocytes express many proteases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> we further examined the effects of various protease inhibitors on the TUNEL positivity. DNA degradation was significantly suppressed only in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that in the presence of z-VAD-fmk, TUNEL-positive cells were markedly decreased to 21.5% of the number in the absence of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Leupeptin, chymostatin and antipain, which are serine proteinase and lysosomal cysteine proteinase inhibitors, had no significant effect. Furthermore, we tested the effect of the enzyme-dead revC14 (revC14mut: 228Cys to 228Ala) in order to avoid nonspecific cell death. Expression of the inactive revC14 did not cause any significant effect and these expressing cells were TUNEL negative. Thus, DNA degradation was caspase-14 activity dependent.</p>

        <title>Caspase-14 cleaves ICAD and liberates CAD</title>
        <p>We further examined whether the ICADâCAD system is involved in this pathway. Purified caspase-14 from human cornified cell extracts caused limited proteolysis of ICAD, releasing three major degradation products of 32, 27 and 11âkDa that appear to be similar to those generated by caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Prolonged incubation (3âh) increased the formation of the cleavage products. Interestingly, similar degradation bands were also observed in extracts of human cornified cells. We also tested the ICAD-degrading activity of revC14, and found that revC14 catalyzed time-dependent ICAD degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Addition of zVAD-fmk strongly suppressed ICAD degradation by revC14. ICAD-degrading activity of caspase-14 was observed only in the presence of kosmotropic salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) that is essential for enzymatic activity of caspase-14.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> However, in the presence of kosmotropic salt, ICAD degradation by caspase-3 was significantly suppressed compared with that by caspase-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). We next addressed the questions of whether CAD is liberated in this reaction and, if so, whether it is translocated into the nucleus. Keratinocytes transfected with revC14 expression vector were cultured for 2 days after confluency. Most CAD-expressing cells showed CAD accumulation in nuclei, and CAD-positive nuclei were also positive for TUNEL reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Expression of revC14 was confirmed with anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). HA-positive cells were also TUNEL positive. Close association between active caspase-14 and ICAD was demonstrated at the granular layer of normal human epidermis using PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). As profilaggrin is neither expressed nor processed in day 2 culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), DNA degradation was caspase-14 activity dependent. Collectively, these results suggest that caspase-14 has the ability to degrade ICAD, liberating CAD and thereby leading to DNA degradation, although its action is restricted to differentiated keratinocytes.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of both caspase-14 and mesotrypsin increased DNA remnants in the cornified layer</title>
        <p>Our results suggested that both the caspase-14-dependent ICADâCAD pathway and a FLG N-terminal fragment-dependent pathway may be involved in DNA degradation during terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Thus, we examined the effect of siRNA knockdown of caspase-14 and mesotrypsin in a skin equivalent model. These siRNA treatments efficiently knocked down expression of the corresponding proteases to 9.9% and 24.0% of the control levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). We detected considerable numbers of undegraded nuclei in the cornified layer after either caspase-14 knockdown or mesotrypsin knockdown. When both caspase-14 and mesotrypsin were knocked down together, many undigested nuclei were observed in the cornified layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Numbers of nuclear remnants were counted in each 450â<italic>Î¼</italic>m field and a total length of 4.5âmm was examined in each model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Interestingly, the number of remnants was increased significantly in the skin model with mesotrypsin knockdown and further increased in that with caspase-14 knockdown. The greatest effect was consistently observed in the model with double knockdown.</p>

        <title>Caspase-14 and mesotrypsin were markedly downregulated in parakeratotic areas of diseased skin</title>
        <p>Finally, we examined the expression of mesotrypsin and caspase-14 in skin from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, as such skin frequently shows abnormal differentiation and parakeratosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Normal skin showed strong immunostaining for mesotrypsin in the granular layer and for caspase-14 in the spinous to granular layers. Immunostaining clearly demonstrated strong downregulation of procaspase-14 in the lesional skin with psoriasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Immunostaining of mesotrypsin was also significantly decreased in the same area. Nuclear staining revealed persistent presence of undigested nuclei in the areas where both enzymes were hardly detectable. Similar results were obtained for skin with AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Thus, the FLG-N pathway is likely to be suppressed in parakeratotic areas. We further investigated whether the ICADâCAD pathway was concomitantly impaired in parakeratotic skin. Skin surface staining for ICAD showed isolated regions of various sizes that were positive for ICAD in AD skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Nuclear staining with propidium iodide (PI) showed that parakeratotic nuclei were always present in these patchy islands. Bright field microscopy of the superficial cornified layer showed a bumpy and rough surface compared with the smooth surface of normally keratinized areas. The merged images demonstrate that the parakeratotic areas coincided with ICAD-positive areas. These results indicate that suppression of the two pathways is associated with persistent presence of nuclei in the cornified layer.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Loss of nuclei is a critical event in epidermal barrier formation. Our results indicate that at least two pathways are involved in the denucleation process during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, that is, profilaggrin N-terminal fragment-dependent and caspase-14-mediated CAD-dependent DNA degradation pathways.</p>
      <p>First, we searched for molecules that interact with the N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin by means of LC/MS/MS analyses, and identified epidermal mesotrypsin and caspase-14 as interactors in extracts from keratinocytes and cornified cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Identification of these interactions is consistent with the idea that profilaggrin is a natural substrate for these proteases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Mesotrypsin shows a distinct substrate specificity from the PRSS1 gene product, anionic trypsin, or PRSS2 gene product, cationic trypsin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> It is not susceptible to intrinsic trypsin inhibitors, but instead has the ability to degrade them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, its proteolytic activity is quite limited, and it does not digest large protein substrates into small fragments, as other trypsins do. Mesotrypsin is required for the processing of FLG-N and liberated FLG-N is translocated into the nucleus because of the presence of NLS in the B domain. We also found that the translocated N-terminal of profilaggrin contained not only A and B domains but also a truncated FLG domain. This conclusion was also supported by the results of our mutation study. Our finding is contrary to that of Pearton <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> who reported that only the A and B domains enter into the nucleus. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may be because of the difference in cell lines used for assays, that is, human keratinocytes and COS-7, as human keratinocytes express epidermal-specific mesotrypsin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Although several proteases have been reported to be involved in the profilaggrin processing cascade leading to filaggrin, our findings strongly suggest that epidermal mesotrypsin and caspase-14 are key profilaggrin-processing molecules.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we also established that caspase-14 has the ability to degrade ICAD, generating peptides similar to those formed by caspase-3. Indeed, expression of constitutively active caspase-14 (revC14) liberated CAD that was accumulated in nuclei. As expected, the resulting cells became TUNEL positive. In addition, we compared the TUNEL-positive rate in revC14-expressing cells and mesotrypsin-expressing cells. Most revC14-expressing cells were TUNEL positive (95%), whereas active mesotrypsin-expressing cells showed lower TUNEL positivity (72%). The reason why revC14-expressing cells showed a higher rate of TUNEL positivity may be higher efficiency of the ICADâCAD system for DNA degradation and/or slower reactivity of the FLG-Nâmesotrypsin system. We recently showed that mesotrypsin plays multiple roles in keratinocyte terminal differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> For example, it is secreted to interstitial areas of the cornified layer and is involved in proKLK activation. Thus, its availability may vary at different stages of differentiation. The PLA method demonstrated association of active caspase-14 and ICAD at the boundary area between the granular layer and the cornified layer, where nuclear loss takes place. Involvement of epidermal mesotrypsin and caspase-14 in the denucleation process is also supported by findings in skin equivalent models with siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteases and in PLA interaction assays using skin samples. Downregulation of both enzymes resulted in a significant increase of undigested nuclei in the cornified layer. Furthermore, it was found that both caspase-14 and mesotrypsin were absent in areas where parakeratotic nuclei were evident. Therefore, these proteases appear to play major roles in denucleation during keratinocyte terminal differentiation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we found that caspase-14 promotes the conversion of mesotrypsinogen to mesotrypsin. This is probably accomplished by cleavage near the enterokinase recognition sequence (DDDDKI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> as caspase-14 cleaves only after Asp residues. Indeed, our unpublished data support the idea that active caspase-14 promotes mesotrypsinogen activation, even though enterokinase was several times more potent than caspase-14 as an activator. However, this does not exclude a role of caspase-14 as a possible activator, considering that the catalytic efficiency of enterokinase is 34â000-fold greater than that of trypsin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Collectively, our results indicate the presence of two distinct pathways of epidermal denucleation that appear to work both cooperatively and independently, depending upon the differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, a defect of even a single pathway may affect the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis, because it has been shown that a defect of caspase-14 predisposes to the development of parakeratosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Because the mechanisms of parakeratosis have been unknown, there has been no effective treatment directly targeting parakeratosis. Here, we have shown that at least two pathways are involved in denucleation during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, acting cooperatively for the formation of fully differentiated corneocytes. Simultaneous treatment directed toward both pathways might be effective to improve parakeratosis, as well as barrier disruption.</p>

In addition, a PCR product (HA+revC14) was amplified using the common forward primer with <italic>Not</italic>I recognition sequence+HA sequence and the specific reverse primer with <italic>Not</italic>I site. It was inserted into pH3700-pL2 vector at the <italic>Not</italic>I site (pInv-HA-revC14). Two kinds of expression vectors (pCMV-HA and pInv-HA) for constitutively active KLK5 and active KLK7 were similarly prepared from full-length cDNA clones (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Expression vectors for FLG N-terminal domains were also prepared using pCMV-HA. These were A domain construct (FLG-A), A domain with NLS (FLG-A-nls), B domain construct (FLG-B), B domain+truncated FLG repeat (FLG-BT) and N-terminal fragment with A domain+B domain+truncated FLG repeat (FLG-ABT).

        <p>Involvement of multiple pathways in the denucleation process during keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Two distinct pathways are involved in epidermal denucleation. Activated caspase-14 degrades ICAD and liberated CAD is translocated into the nucleus, resulting in the degradation of chromosomal DNA. On the other hand, activated mesotrypsin cleaves profilaggrin, releasing its N-terminal domain. The free N-terminal domain enters the nucleus and induces DNA degradation. Mesotrypsinogen can be activated by both enterokinase and caspase-14. Thus, these systems appear to work cooperatively, as well as independently, depending on the differentiation conditions</p>
