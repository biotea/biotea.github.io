      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Amino acids are a key input, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Multiple protein complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein for RagA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Here, we identify a four-membered protein complex (KICSTOR) composed of the KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2 gene products as required for amino acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured cells. In mice lacking SZT2, mTORC1 signaling is increased in several tissues, including in neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds to GATOR1 and recruits it, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Interestingly, several KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signaling<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Thus, KICSTOR is a lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling that, like GATOR1, is mutated in human disease<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>

    <p id="P2">To search for GATOR1-interacting proteins that may have escaped prior identification, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to engineer the <italic>DEPDC5</italic> gene in HEK-293T cells to express a FLAG-tagged version of DEPDC5, a GATOR1 component, at endogenous levels. Mass spectrometric analysis of FLAG-immunoprecipitates prepared from these cells revealed the presence of GATOR2, as well as four proteins of unknown function encoded by the <italic>KPTN</italic>, <italic>ITFG2</italic>, <italic>C12orf66</italic>, and <italic>SZT2</italic> genes and of predicted molecular weights of 48, 49, 50, and 380 kDa, respectively (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). As shown below, these proteins form a complex, which we named KICSTOR for <underline>K</underline>PTN, <underline>I</underline>TFG2, <underline>C</underline>12orf66, and <underline>S</underline>ZT2-containing regulator of m<underline>TOR</underline>C1. KICSTOR components are conserved in vertebrates but not fungi (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Some non-vertebrates, like <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, encode homologues of <italic>SZT2</italic> but not of <italic>KPTN</italic>, <italic>ITFG2</italic>, or <italic>C12orf66</italic>, while others, including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, lack all four KICSTOR components (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">Endogenous KICSTOR was present in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates prepared from cells expressing endogenously FLAG-tagged DEPDC5 or WDR59, a GATOR2 component (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Importantly, an anti-KPTN antibody co-immunoprecipitated SZT2, ITFG2, and C12orf66, as well as GATOR1 and GATOR2 components (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Amino acid starvation and stimulation of cells did not significantly affect the interactions between any complex components (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b, c</xref>). Thus, GATOR1 and GATOR2 associate with KICSTOR in an amino acid insensitive fashion.</p>
    <p id="P4">Using HEK-293T cells transiently expressing recombinant versions of the KICSTOR components, we explored how they interact with each other. KPTN and ITFG2 associated even in the absence of the co-expression of either C12orf66 or SZT2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting that they form a heterodimer on their own. Indeed, KPTN and ITFG2 associated in cells deficient for SZT2 or C12orf66, and loss of ITFG2 severely reduced KPTN levels and vice versa (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e, f, g</xref>). The KPTN-ITFG2 heterodimer co-immunoprecipitated C12orf66 only when SZT2 was also expressed and did not compete with C12orf66 for interacting with SZT2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d, h</xref>). In size-exclusion chromatography analyses of cell lysates, C12orf66, KPTN, and ITFG2 fractionated into two main pools, one that co-migrated at a very high molecular weight with SZT2 and was absent in SZT2-deficient cells, and a more abundant pool that migrated at lower molecular weights (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the four KICSTOR proteins form a large complex in which SZT2 serves as the link between the other three.</p>
    <p id="P5">We readily detected endogenous KICSTOR in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from HEK-293E cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Nprl2, a GATOR1 component, but FLAG-tagged WDR24, a GATOR2 component, co-immunoprecipitated much lower amounts of KICSTOR (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Consistent with the GATOR2-KICSTOR association being indirect, loss of GATOR1 strongly reduced it (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), while that of GATOR2 did not significantly affect the GATOR1-KICSTOR interaction (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). SZT2 co-immunoprecipitated with GATOR1 even in cells lacking other KICSTOR components (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>) and was required for GATOR1 or GATOR2 to co-immunoprecipitate the KPTN-ITFG2 heterodimer (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>). Moreover, KPTN-ITFG2, C12orf66, and GATOR1 co-immunoprecipitated three fragments of the 380 kDa SZT2 to different extents and the integrity of KICSTOR did not depend on either GATOR complex (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c, d, e, f</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that KICSTOR is a distinct four-protein complex that uses its SZT2 component to interact with GATOR1, which in turn binds to GATOR2 (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Consistent with this model, the very high molecular weight pool of Nprl3 detected by size-exclusion chromatography was absent in SZT2-deficient cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Because much of the nutrient sensing machinery upstream of mTORC1, including the Rag GTPases, localizes to the lysosomal surface<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, we asked if KICSTOR is also there. Indeed, examination of HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged ITFG2 (as a marker of KICSTOR) at levels 2â3 fold above the endogenous protein, revealed that KICSTOR localizes, at least in part, to lysosomes in an amino acid-insensitive fashion (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>, and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>). The GATOR complexes have been reported to localize to the lysosome<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, which we confirmed in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged components of GATOR1 (Nprl2) or GATOR2 (Mios and WDR24) (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h, i</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b, c</xref>). Consistent with these results, amino acids did not affect the amounts of endogenous GATOR1, GATOR2, or KICSTOR present on immunopurified lysosomes, but, as expected, did regulate that of mTORC1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). The lysosomes were not contaminated with mitochondria, Golgi, ER, or peroxisomes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Given the strong interaction between KICSTOR and GATOR1, an inhibitor of the Rag GTPases, we reasoned that KICSTOR might be required for the control of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids. Indeed, in HEK-293T cells lacking any KICSTOR subunit, amino acid deprivation did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling, as detected by the phosphorylation of S6K1, 4E-BP1, and ULK1, or induce autophagy (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5a, b, c</xref>). In HeLa cells loss of either SZT2 or ITFG2 had similar effects on S6K1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d, e, f</xref>). Although less is known about how glucose is sensed upstream of the Rag GTPases<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, loss of any KICSTOR component in HEK-293T cells also rendered mTORC1 signaling insensitive to glucose starvation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Glucose did not affect the lysosomal localization of GATOR1 and serum deprivation and insulin stimulation still regulated mTORC1 in HeLa cells lacking KICSTOR components (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5g, h, i, j</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">To determine if KICSTOR also inhibits mTORC1 signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> we analyzed previously generated mice in which the <italic>Szt2</italic> gene was disrupted by a gene trap (<italic>Szt2<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Compared to wild-type littermates, mTORC1 signaling was increased in the liver and skeletal muscle of fasted <italic>Szt2</italic> gene trap mice as assessed by the phosphorylation of S6, a substrate of S6K1, and of 4E-BP1 (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). Immunohistochemical detection of phospho-S6 in tissue slices from the brain as well as liver and heart revealed increases in mTORC1 signaling in cerebellar and cortical neurons and hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes of the <italic>Szt2<sup>GT</sup></italic><sup>/</sup><italic><sup>GT</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>). Thus, loss of the SZT2 component of KICSTOR increases mTORC1 signaling in multiple mouse tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
    <p id="P9">To define where KICSTOR acts in the mTORC1 pathway, we performed epistasis experiments between KICSTOR and established components of the pathway. Expression of the dominant negative Rag GTPases (RagB<sup>T54N</sup>-RagC<sup>Q120L</sup>) still inhibited mTORC1 in SZT2-deficient cells, indicating that KICSTOR is upstream of the Rag GTPases (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). While great overexpression of GATOR1 suppressed mTORC1 signaling in both wild-type and SZT2-deficient cells (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), much lower levels of GATOR1 overexpression reduced mTORC1 signaling to a lesser extent in the SZT2-deficient than wild-type cells, suggesting that GATOR1 requires SZT2 to efficiently exert its inhibitory effects (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Loss of GATOR2 strongly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in wild-type cells, but did not affect the constitutive signaling of cells deficient for SZT2 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) or Nprl3 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Thus, KICSTOR, likely acting in concert with GATOR1, functions downstream of or in parallel to GATOR2 to negatively regulate Rag GTPase signaling to mTORC1. Consistent with this interpretation, loss of KICSTOR, like that of GATOR1<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, was sufficient to drive mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface in cells starved of amino acids (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">While Ragulator tethers the Rags to the lysosomal surface<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, it is unknown what recruits GATOR1 there and so we considered such a role for KICSTOR. This was the case as in cells deficient for KICSTOR, GATOR1 no longer localized to lysosomes and instead was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>, and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). In contrast, loss of KICSTOR had little effect on the lysosomal localization of GATOR2 or the Rag GTPases (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b, c</xref>). In agreement with the imaging results, loss of SZT2 very strongly decreased the amount of GATOR1, but not GATOR2, on purified lysosomes (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Consistent with the amino acid-insensitive lysosomal localization of mTOR in cells deficient for SZT2 (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), amino acid starvation did not reduce the amount of mTORC1 on lysosomes isolated from these cells (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Given the importance of KICSTOR for localizing GATOR1 to lysosomes, we reasoned that KICSTOR should be necessary for GATOR1 to interact with its substrates the Rag GTPases, as well as with GATOR2. Indeed, loss of SZT2 strongly reduced the amounts of RagA and RagC and GATOR2 that co-immunoprecipitated with GATOR1 (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a, b, c, d</xref>). As previously reported<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, amino acid stimulation reduced the interaction of GATOR1 with the Rag GTPases in wild-type cells (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, KICSTOR has at least two molecular functions that can explain its loss of function phenotype: KICSTOR targets GATOR1 to the lysosomal surface where its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and its potential regulator, GATOR2, reside (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). KICSTOR is a large complex so it likely has additional roles in mTORC1 signaling beyond those we have defined, but the protein sequences of its components do not suggest any biochemical functions. It was not possible to ascertain if tethering of GATOR1 to the lysosomal surface bypasses the need for KICSTOR for the control of mTORC1 signaling by nutrients because the addition to any GATOR1 component, on its N- or C-terminus, of the lysosomal targeting sequence of LAMTOR1 prevented formation of GATOR1 or its interaction with GATOR2.</p>

        <p id="P83">Immunofluorescence assays were performed as described previously<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Briefly, 300,000 HEK-293T or 150,000 HeLa cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates. Twenty-four hours later, the slides were rinsed with PBS once and fixed for 15 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. The slides were rinsed three times with PBS and cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 minutes. After rinsing three times with PBS, the slides were blocked for 1 hour in Odyssey blocking buffer, and then incubated with primary antibody in Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature, rinsed three times with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies produced in donkey (diluted 1:1000 in Odyssey blocking buffer) for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark and washed three times with PBS. The primary antibodies used were directed against GFP (Rockland Immunochemicals; 1:500 dilution), LAMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:300 dilution), mTOR (CST; 1:100-1:300 dilution), and RagC (CST; 1:100 dilution). Slides were mounted on glass coverslips using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI.</p>
        <p id="P84">Images were acquired on a Zeiss AxioVert200M microscope with a 63Ã oil immersion objective and a Yokogawa CSU-22 spinning disk confocal head with a Borealis modification (Spectral Applied Research/Andor) and a Hamamatsu Orca-ER CCD camera. The MetaMorph software package (Molecular Devices) was used to control the hardware and image acquisition. Images were captured in the Cy3, Cy5, and DAPI channels. Although the DAPI channel is not shown in the main images, it is in the insets as a blue signal.</p>
        <p id="P85">For quantitative analyses, the raw image files were opened in the Fiji software package<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and a maximum intensity projection of a z-stack of ~6â8 contiguous focal planes (â¼0.5 Î¼m each) was used. In each cell analyzed, a cytoplasmic region of interest containing lysosomes (high LAMP2 signal) was chosen and in this area the mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of the Cy5 (LAMP2) and Cy3 channels (GFP, mTOR, or RagC) were measured. In the same cell an equivalently sized area in a region of the cytoplasm not containing lysosomes (low LAMP2 signal) was chosen and the MFIs of the Cy5 and Cy3 channels were also measured in this area. For each channel, the MFI of the non-lysosomal area was subtracted from that of the lysosomal area. The value obtained for the Cy3 channel was then divided by the analogous value for the Cy5 channel to give the lysosomal enrichment factor shown in the bar graphs in the figures. A lysosomal enrichment factor close to 1 indicates that the Cy3 signal was enriched in a region of the cell containing lysosomes over one that does not. A lysosomal enrichment factor closer to 0 indicates that the Cy3 signal was not enriched at the lysosomes, indicating no specific co-localization with the Cy5 signal. For each condition studied, images of at least 3 distinct fields were captured and within each 2â5 cells were analyzed as described above so that at least 10 cells were analyzed per condition. The mean lysosomal enrichment factor was calculated for each field analyzed, and the mean of the means of these fields is shown (bar graphs show mean Â± standard error of the mean). In our experiments, the MFIs in the Cy3 and Cy5 channels were of similar magnitudes and so we obtained equivalent results regarding lysosomal co-localization whether we subtracted or divided the MFIs of the two areas in calculating the lysosomal enrichment factors. Two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests were used for comparisons between conditions. All comparisons were two-sided, and p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Variance was similar across groups.</p>

A total of 8 mice were used across experiments â four wild-type females, three <italic>Szt2<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic> females and one <italic>Szt2<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic> male. Sample size was determined based on variation in mTORC1 signaling observed in wild-type mice. Mice were sacrificed and the liver, gastrocnemius muscle, heart, and brain were harvested. Portions of the liver and muscle were analyzed by immunoblotting for phospho-S235/236 S6, S6, phospho-S65 4E-BP1, and 4E-BP1 levels as described<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> except that tissues were disrupted with a homogenizer instead of a sonicator. Small portions of the liver, heart, and brain were fixed in formalin and processed for phospho-S235/236 S6 immunohistochemistry as described<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. All mice were housed in a barrier facility with standard 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic> until the 8-hour fast. Animal studies were performed under AAALAC and NIH guidelines and were approved by institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). No randomization or blinding was performed.</p>

        <p id="P87">A confluent 15 cm plate of wild-type or SZT2-defiicient HEK-293T cells (~40 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells) was lysed in a CHAPS-containing buffer (50 mM NaHEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, and 0.3% CHAPS). The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 Ãg for 30 minutes, to completely remove non-lysed cells and insoluble aggregates. The cleared lysate was normalized to a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml, and 1 ml of it was loaded onto a tandem Superose 6 gel filtration column. The elutant was fractionated and the proteins in each fraction were precipitated separately with trichlorocacetic acid (TCA). The precipitants were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with acetone to remove residual TCA. The protein pellets were re-dissolved in 2xSDS loading buffer. Equal amounts of each were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for indicated antibodies.</p>

        <p>a) mTORC1 signaling is insensitive to amino acid starvation in cells lacking any KICSTOR component. HEK-293T cell clones deficient for each KICSTOR component were starved of amino acids for 50 min or starved and restimulated with amino acids for 10 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels and phosphorylation states of the indicated proteins. See <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref> for validation of the KICSTOR deficient cells.</p>
        <p>b) Activation of autophagy induced by amino acid starvation requires KICSTOR. The HEK-293T cell clones as in (a) were monitored for LC3B processing and accumulation after one hour of amino acid starvation in the absence or presence of chloroquine.</p>
        <p>c) mTORC1 signaling is insensitive to glucose starvation in cells lacking KICSTOR. Experiment was performed as in (a) except that cells were starved of and stimulated with glucose.</p>
        <p>d) SZT2 inhibits mTORC1 signaling in mouse liver. Mice with the indicated genotypes were fasted for 8 hours and liver lysates analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels and phosphorylation states of the indicated proteins.

Wild-type or SZT2-deficient HEK-293Ts expressing the indicated cDNAs were starved of amino acids for 50 min or starved and restimulated with amino acids for 10 min. FLAG immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels and phosphorylation states of the indicated proteins.</p>

        <title>The lysosomal localization of GATOR1 requires KICSTOR</title>
        <p>a) SZT2 loss renders GATOR1 dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Nprl2-deficient HeLa cells were reconstituted with GFP-Nprl2 and subsequently modified with the CRISPR/Cas9 system to create SZT2-deficient cells expressing GFP-Nprl2. These cells were starved or starved and restimulated with amino acids for the noted times prior to the detection of GFP and LAMP2 by immunofluorescence. Insets depict selected fields magnified 3.24Ã and their overlays. Scale bars represent 10 Î¼m.</p>
        <p>b) Loss of C12orf66 or KPTN also disrupts the localization of GATOR1 to the lysosome. Cell lines were generated, treated, and analyzed as in (a).</p>
        <p>c) In SZT2-deficient cells, GATOR1 is not present on immunopurified lysosomes. Lysosomes were immunopurified from wild-type or SZT2-deficient HEK-293T cells expressing HA-tagged LAMP1 and starved of and stimulated with amino acids as in (a). Lysosomes and whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels of the indicated proteins.</p>
        <p>d) Loss of SZT2 disrupts the GATOR1-Rag GTPase interaction. Control or SZT2-deficient HEK-293T cells with or without the stable expression of HA-Nprl3 were starved of amino acids for 50 min or starved and restimulated with amino acids for 10 min. Lysates and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels of the indicated proteins.</p>
