        <p>The linking of integrin to cytoskeleton is a critical event for an effective cell migration. Previously, we have reported that a novel integrin-linked kinase (ILK)âbinding protein, affixin, is closely involved in the linkage between integrin and cytoskeleton in combination with ILK. In the present work, we demonstrated that the second calponin homology domain of affixin directly interacts with Î±-actinin in an ILK kinase activityâdependent manner, suggesting that integrinâILK signaling evoked by substrate adhesion induces affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction. The overexpression of a peptide corresponding to the Î±-actininâbinding site of affixin as well as the knockdown of endogenous affixin by small interference RNA resulted in the blockade of cell spreading. Time-lapse observation revealed that in both experiments cells were round with small peripheral blebs and failed to develop lamellipodia, suggesting that the ILKâaffixin complex serves as an integrin-anchoring site for Î±-actinin and thereby mediates integrin signaling to Î±-actinin, which has been shown to play a critical role in actin polymerization at focal adhesions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cell motility is a basic element for many cellular activities such as leukocyte migration, wound healing, and development (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Brugge, 1995</xref>). In general, cell motility is divided into several processes, namely the extension of the cell process at the cell front, formation of the ECM linkage, force generation, and release from adhesion at the rear end (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sheetz et al., 1998</xref>). In particular, the former two processes at the cell front play a critical role in cell spreading. Membrane protrusions that adhere to the substratum during the extension process can develop into a dominant lamellipodium and generate forward cell movement (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sheetz et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, when the membrane protrusions fail to adhere to the substratum, the extension will fold back upon itself. Thus, it is important for cells to establish stable adhesion between protrusions and ECM for effective migration (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Condeelis, 1998</xref>). This substrate adhesion is largely due to the integrin family among the ECM receptor (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>). Several reports that liganded integrins increase their avidity by their cytoskeleton binding indicate that integrins participate as an important interface between ECM and cytoskeleton in the adhesion process (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Choquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Nishizaka et al., 2000</xref>). The integrins bind to a number of cytoskeletal proteins through their cytoplasmic domain, including talin, Î±-actinin, and filamin, all of which bind F-actin (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). These integrin-binding proteins bind to another cytoskeletal or scaffold protein, and these hierarchical multiple protein complexes are considered to mediate the attachment of integrins to actin filaments (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Miyamoto et al., 1995</xref>). However, the complex mechanisms underlying integrinâcytoskeletal linkage regulation remain to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase capable of interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin Î²1 and Î²3 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hannigan et al., 1996</xref>). Several reports have demonstrated that ILK is involved in the integrin-dependent cell adhesion, spreading, and cell shape change in cultured cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hannigan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Wu, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002b</xref>). Recently, we have shown that ILK binds to a novel focal adhesion (FA) protein, named affixin (Î²-parvin), that consists of two tandem calponin homology (CH) domains and belongs to a novel family of FA proteins, together with other homologous proteins such as actopaxin/CH-ILKBP/Î±-parvin (Î±-parvin) and Î³-parvin (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Olski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2002</xref>). In CHO-K1 cells replated on fibronectin (FN), affixin and ILK are concentrated on the cell surface in blebs and then recruited into nascent substrate adhesion sites in advance of other FA components. In well-spread cells, affixin is then distributed at FA and leading edge with ILK as well as along stress fibers (SFs; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with these subcellular localizations, affixin, as well as Î±-parvin, were suggested to mediate integrinâILK signaling for actin organization and thus have roles in cell spreading and adhesion. For example, the overexpression of the COOH-terminal region of affixin, which is phosphorylated by ILK in vitro, blocks cell spreading at the initial stage. The coexpression of ILK enhances this effect. Thus, we suggested that affixin is involved in integrinâILK signaling required for the development of nascent cellâsubstrate adhesion structures to mature FAs (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). In platelets, we noted that ILK stably forms a complex with affixin, and thrombin stimulation induces their association with integrin Î²3, which is followed by ILK activation and their subsequent incorporation into the Triton X-100âinsoluble membraneâcytoskeletal fraction (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2002</xref>). On the basis of these results, we suggested that ILK and affixin play critical roles in cell spreading, particularly for the initial formation of FA and integrinâcytoskeletal linkage. Interestingly, Î±-parvin was reported to form a complex with not only ILK, but also with PINCH and paxillin, and the analysis of the binding-defective point mutant revealed that a correct complex formation is essential for their FA localization (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002a</xref>). Although these results indicated that affixin and its family are closely correlated with the initial formation of FA via integrinâILK signaling, the downstream target and the precise roles of affixin in the initial maturation process of FA are unknown.</p>
      <p>In the present work, we demonstrated that affixin interacts with Î±-actinin through its second CH domain. Their association depends on kinase activity of ILK in vitro and the FN-induced integrin stimulation in vivo. The overexpression of the specific Î±-actininâbinding site of affixin fused with GFP (GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup>) resulted in the unique inhibition of affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction and the perturbation of Mena localization, which in turn resulted in the blockade of cell spreading. Furthermore, we designed small interference RNA (siRNA) that specifically down-regulated affixin expression, and noted that affixin knockdown cells formed multiple blebs, which was followed by the inhibition of FA formation and cell spreading as observed in GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup>âoverexpressing cells. These results suggest that affixin plays a critical role in integrinâcytoskeletal linkage during maturation of nascent FA and SF extensions.</p>

        <title>Affixin interacts with Î±-actinin via COOH-terminal CH domain in the yeast two-hybrid assay</title>
        <p>To identify the downstream target of affixin that induces FA formation, we screened a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system as described previously (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). As a bait, we used affixin 53â272 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain because full-length affixin causes weak self-transactivation in the system. Two positive independent clones (clones 21 and 94) were isolated, both of which corresponded to Î±2-actinin cDNA (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM001103">NM001103</ext-link>) fragments lacking the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) and a part of spectrin repeat 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The specificity of this interaction was further confirmed by Î²-galactosidase assay in the other yeast strain, Y187(a) (unpublished data). Using clone 94 (Î±2-actinin 300â896), we searched the specific binding site of Î±-actinin on the affixin molecule by the yeast two-hybrid assay. As a result, 23 amino acids (aa 249â272) within the CH2 domain of affixin were revealed to be necessary and sufficient for their binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Notably, another affixin-binding protein, ILK, which has been shown to interact with the CH2 domain, did not bind to this Î±2-actininâbinding region (aa 249â272), and the narrowed ILK-binding site of affixin (aa 258â364) did not exhibit interaction with Î±2-actinin. On the other hand, the deletion of aa 258â291 of the narrowed ILK-binding site disrupted ILK binding (see mutant aa 292â364), suggesting that these amino acids, some of which are included in the Î±2-actininâbinding region, are indispensable for ILK binding. Together, these results suggest that the binding sites for Î±2-actinin and ILK are differentiated on the affixin molecule, even if they are not completely independent.</p>

        <p>To date, many types of Î±-actinin paralogues have been reported (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">de Arruda et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Witke et al., 1993</xref>). Because Î±2-actinin identified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A is a muscle-specific type variant, we tested whether affixin also binds to the nonmuscle-type Î±-actinin, Î±1-actinin. For this purpose, we used a full-length construct of chicken Î±1-actinin showing 97% identity with human Î±1-actinin (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="P05094">P05094</ext-link>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, affixin<sup>249â272</sup> was revealed to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with full-length Î±1-actinin.</p>

        <title>Endogenous affixin binds to Î±-actinin in a substrate adhesionâdependent manner</title>
        <p>Next, we examined whether affixin endogenously interacts with Î±-actinin in mammalian cells. Recently, we have reported that in resting platelets, affixin is recruited into the integrin complex together with ILK in response to thrombin stimulation. The tripartite complex then gradually translocates to the Triton X-100âinsoluble fraction, biochemically corresponding to the actin-based membraneâcytoskeletal fraction (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2002</xref>). On the basis of these observations, we speculated that the interaction of affixin with Î±-actinin may be dependent on integrin stimulation. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, CHO-K1 cells were cultured on FN-coated dishes or remained in suspension on nonadhesive plastic dishes for 3 h, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using the anti-affixin antibody. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, a moderate amount of Î±-actinin was coimmunoprecipitated with affixin from the cells cultured on FN dishes, but not from those cultured on plastic dishes. In contrast, paxillin, which was reported to interact with Î±-parvin, as well as actin and vinculin, failed to coimmunoprecipitate with affixin under either condition. These results indicate that affixin interacts with Î±-actinin, but not with paxillin, in an adhesion-dependent manner in mammalian fibroblasts.</p>

The anti-affixin antibody and control IgG immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Î±-actinin, -affixin, -paxillin, -actin, and -vinculin antibodies. Note that lysate from FN-coated dishes (but not nonadhesive plastic dishes) exhibited coimmunoprecipitation of Î±-actinin with endogenous affixin. On the other hand, the negative interaction between affixin and actin (or paxillin and vinculin) demonstrates that the association is specific and is not the result of contamination of large cytoskeletal pellets. (B) HT1080 cells were trypsinized, washed three times in PBS, and replated on FN-coated dishes. After the cells were collected by lysis buffer at times indicated, the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation assay by anti-affixin antibody. Note that the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous affixin and Î±-actinin increases gradually after replating with a peak at 60 min.</p>

        <p>To further analyze the adhesion dependence of the affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction, we observed the time course of their coimmunoprecipitation during cell spreading on FN-coated dishes after replating.

        <title>Affixin binds to Î±-actinin in vitro in an ILK kinase activityâdependent manner</title>
        <p>To confirm the direct interaction between affixin and Î±-actinin, we performed an in vitro pull-down assay using bacterially purified GST-affixin, or GST-CH2 (affixin<sup>213â364</sup>; previously called RP2). For this purpose, the GST fusion proteins were incubated with purified Î±-actinin, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with the anti-Î±-actinin antibody. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A, the results reproducibly did not exhibit any interaction between purified affixin and Î±-actinin. However, the result that the endogenous interaction between affixin and Î±-actinin was only observed when cells were plated on FN-coated dishes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A) made us hypothesize further that some post-translational modification may be required for the interaction. In this respect, it should be noted that ILK has been shown to be acutely activated in response to integrin signaling (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delcommenne et al., 1998</xref>), and that the CH2 domain of affixin can be effectively phosphorylated by ILK in vitro (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). Together with the present results that the Î±-actininâbinding site of affixin is very close to the ILK-binding site, it is plausible that the affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction is induced by the phosphorylation of the CH2 domain of affixin by ILK. The results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (B and C) strongly support this notion: when preincubated with immunoprecipitated ILK under a condition in which GST-affixin was effectively phosphorylated by ILK (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>), GST-affixin as well as GST-CH2, but not GST alone, became competent to interact with Î±-actinin. Importantly, similar effects were not observed when a kinase-dead mutant of ILK, ILK(K220M), was used for preincubation instead of ILK (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). Considering that ILK (K220M) can associate with affixin (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>), these results indicated that the interaction of affixin with Î±-actinin is dependent on ILK kinase activity, but not on its ability to associate with ILK. To further confirm direct interaction between affixin and Î±-actinin, we purified GST-affixin by SDS-PAGE after preincubation with in vitroâtranslated ILK in the presence or absence of ATP, and examined its binding to purified Î±-actinin by blot overlay assay. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D shows again that GST-affixin specifically interacts with Î±-actinin, only when it was preincubated with ILK in the presence of 10 Î¼M ATP in phosphorylation buffer. These results indicate that affixin directly associates with Î±-actinin only when its CH2 domain is phosphorylated by ILK.</p>

        <title>Both the NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal regions of Î±-actinin bind to affixin</title>
        <p>Î±-Actinin is composed of three domains, an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal ABD, spectrin-like repeats (SP), and a COOH-terminal region containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs (EF hands; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Puius et al., 1998</xref>). To identify the binding region of Î±-actinin for affixin, we constructed various deletion mutants of Î±1-actinin and tested their interaction with affixin<sup>53â272</sup> by yeast two-hybrid assay. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A shows that the most COOH-terminal region of Î±1-actinin outside of the second half of EF hand motifs is essential for the interaction. However, the most surprising result was that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region from ABD to SP-1, which was almost lacking in the initially cloned Î±-actinin fragment (clones 22 and 94), demonstrated strong interaction with affixin. The results were further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays performed using Cos-7 cells: flag-tagged full-length and ABD of Î±-actinin were coimmunoprecipitated with T7-tagged full-length affixin by the anti-T7 antibody, whereas a truncated mutant (SR) lacking ABD showed only a very weak coimmunoprecipitation activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). These results suggest that the two distinct regions of Î±-actinin, which correspond to the ABD and the COOH-terminal region, are involved in the interaction with affixin. Considering that Î±-actinin forms an anti-parallel dimer (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Puius et al., 1998</xref>), the present results may suggest that affixin recognizes the terminal structure of the Î±-actinin dimer in which the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal and COOH-terminal regions are located in close vicinity. We also observed that flag-Î±-actinin overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous affixin by anti-affixin antibody (unpublished data).</p>

        <title>Î±-Actinin colocalizes with affixin in FA, leading edge, and along fine SFs</title>
        <p>Previously, we had demonstrated that affixin and ILK are colocalized with Î±-actinin at the striated structures distributed on the sarcolemma of human skeletal muscles, to which Z-bands anchor. On the other hand, both affixin and Î±-actinin have been shown to localize at FA, the tip of the leading edge, and SFs in fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lazarides and Burridge, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). To confirm their colocalization in a single fibroblast, we doubly immunostained for overexpressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, AâC) as well as endogenous (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, DâI) Î±-actinin and affixin in CHO-K1 cells. In cells with prominent SFs and FAs, their overall distribution rather differed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, AâF). However, a close inspection revealed that affixin and Î±-actinin exhibited partial colocalization in particular structures, such as the tip of leading edge (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, AâC; arrows) and the junction between SFs and FAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, AâF, arrowheads). They also showed colocalization in fine SFs, but not in the well-developed thick SFs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, AâC; unpublished data). Importantly, their colocalization was clearly observed at the tip of leading edge in a population of cells with well-developed lamellipodia and completely lacked FAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, GâI; arrows). These results are well consistent with the biochemical coimmunoprecipitation assay shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, and suggest that affixin and Î±-actinin interact in the nascent cellâsubstrate complex in the leading edge. Affixin may remain to interact with Î±-actinin in mature FAs and nascent fine SFs, but may be excluded from mature SFs in which Î±-actinin is considered to cross-bridge actin filaments.</p>

        <title>Affixin<sup>249â272</sup> specifically disrupts affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction and thus inhibits spreading of mammalian cells</title>
        <p>To examine the physiological importance of affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction within cells, we next overexpressed GFP-tagged affixin<sup>249â272</sup> in CHO-K1 cells, which contain the minimum Î±-actininâbinding site of affixin in yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and actually binds to Î±-actinin in CHO-K1 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Immunoprecipitation analysis using the anti-affixin antibody revealed that the coimmunoprecipitation of Î±-actinin, but not ILK with affixin, was significantly reduced in GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup>âoverexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). When quantified, the signal intensity of coprecipitated Î±-actinin in GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup>âoverexpressing cells is &gt;10-fold lower than those in control GFPâoverexpressing cells reproducibly. These results indicate that GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup> can be used as a dominant-negative mutant to specifically disrupt affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction in vivo.</p>

        <p>It has been shown that Î±-parvin binds to paxillin through its paxillin-binding sequence embedded in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the CH2 domain. Because affixin also has conserved sequence of paxillin-binding sequence, which is partially overlapped by the affixin<sup>249â272</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), the observed effects of affixin<sup>249â272</sup> may be due to the interference of endogenous interaction between Î±-parvin and paxillin. To exclude this possibility, we constructed affixin<sup>249â262</sup>, an affixin fragment completely devoid of paxillin-binding sequence, with the GFP tag, and confirmed that this shorter fragment of affixin also exhibited similar deleterious effects on cell spreading to the affixin<sup>249â272</sup> (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To obtain further insight into the roles of affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction in cell spreading, cells overexpressing GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup> were observed by time-lapse video microscopy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A; Videos 1â4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200308141/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200308141/DC1</ext-link>). 24 h after transfection, cells overexpressing GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup> with a round shape were noted to actively protrude many blebs peripherally. However, these blebs did not further develop into lamellipodia as observed in normal cells, but were retracted into the cell body within 30 min (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, d; indicated by arrows). It should be noted that these round cells still attached on the slides and actively moved in a very limited area, indicating that this round morphology did not reflect the process of apoptosis. These effects of GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup> suggest that affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction does not contribute to the initial formation of the cell protrusions in itself, but rather to their stabilization and further development into lamellipodia, which establish firm and broad interaction with the substrate.</p>

        <title>Loss of affixin expression results in the blockade of FA formation, lamellipodial development, and cell spreading</title>
        <p>To further confirm the essential role of affixin in cell spreading, we next used the siRNA to monitor the effects of knockdown of affixin expression. We synthesized and introduced three affixin siRNAs or an irrelevant control RNA into human fibroblasts (HT1080 and IMR-90) or HeLa cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, the two affixin-targeted siRNAs #1 and #3 specifically suppressed the expression of affixin in HT1080, IMR-90 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A), and HeLa cells (unpublished data), whereas the expression of other affixin-interacted or cytoskeletal proteins such as ILK, Î±-actinin, vinculin, and actin were not affected. The differential interference contrast (DIC) images of these affixin-deficient cells transfected with affixin siRNA #3 revealed a marked increase in the number of multiple blebbing cells compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figs. 8, B and C</xref>). Time-lapse observations by DIC microscopy revealed that these blebs were repeatedly protruding from and retracting into the cell bodies, but could not develop into mature lamellipodia, which was quite similar to those of CHO-K1 cells overexpressing GFP-affixin<sup>249â272</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> C; Videos 5 and 6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200308141/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200308141/DC1</ext-link>). We also confirmed by TUNEL staining that affixin RNA interference does not induce apoptosis within 48 h after siRNA transfection (unpublished data). In the immunofluorescence microscopy, well-developed thick SFs and FAs were not observed in these affixin-deficient cells, but actin condensation in the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> E) and diffuse staining of Î±-actinin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> K) and vinculin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> Q) in cytosol were detected instead.

        <title>Affixin mediates anchoring of Î±-actinin to FAs in an adhesion-dependent manner</title>
        <p>Î±-Actinin is an actin cross-linking protein abundant at FAs (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Maruyama and Ebashi, 1965</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lazarides and Burridge, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Podlubnaya et al., 1975</xref>), and has been suggested to play important roles in nascent FA assembly and SF extensions from the integrin-based cellâsubstrate adhesion complex. For example, recent analyses of the GFP-Î±-actinin dynamics revealed that once the interaction between the tips of protrusions and ECM stabilizes, Î±-actinin begins to localize in small foci at the leading edge, which then grow in size and extend small fiberlike structures toward the cell body (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Edlund et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Laukaitis et al., 2001</xref>). On the other hand, Î±-actinin was demonstrated to be critical for the correct positioning of zyxin at FAs, which is suggested to induce actin polymerization at FAs independent of the Arp2/3 complex by forming a complex with a mammalian member of the Ena/VASP family, Mena (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Drees et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Reinhard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fradelizi et al., 2001</xref>). Despite these lines of evidence on the role of Î±-actinin in FA development, the molecular mechanism underlying Î±-actinin recruitment to nascent adhesion sites is less understood. One of the possible mechanisms underlying Î±-actinin targeting suggested to date is its direct interaction with integrins because Î±-actinin was revealed to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domains of the Î²1 subunit in vitro (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Otey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pavalko and Burridge, 1991</xref>). <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Greenwood et al. (2000)</xref> further demonstrated that the binding of PtdIns (3,4,5)-P3 to Î±-actinin disrupts its interaction with the integrin Î²1 and Î²3 subunits in PDGF-treated cells, providing a modification mechanism underlying the interaction of Î±-actinin at FAs.</p>
        <p>In this work, we demonstrated that an ILK-binding protein, affixin, directly interacts with Î±-actinin through its second CH domain; thereby providing a novel molecular basis of Î±-actinin targeting to FAs. Previously, we demonstrated that during cell spreading observed after replating, ILK and affixin are both recruited into cell surface blebs formed at a very early stage before FAK and vinculin. Later, affixin localizes as small dots in the lamellipodia from which short actin bundles emanate. These features of affixin localization during the initial establishment of integrin-based adhesion are well consistent with the dynamics of Î±-actinin stated in the previous paragraph, suggesting a possibility that both proteins cooperate to transmit initial integrin signal to F-actin organization. In the present work, we confirmed that affixin and Î±-actinin are mainly colocalized at the tip of lamellipodia, where nascent cellâsubstrate interactions intensively occur. Furthermore, we also revealed biochemically that in vivo interaction between endogenous affixin and Î±-actinin was dependent on integrin-mediated substrate adhesion, and peaked at an initial phase of cell spreading. The functional importance of the affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction in the initial integrin signaling was then demonstrated by the observation that introduction of the minimum Î±-actininâbinding sequence of affixin, affixin<sup>249â272</sup>, which disrupts endogenous interaction of affixin with Î±-actinin, severely interfered with cell spreading. The resultant round cells lacked FAs, well-developed lamellipodia, and SFs, but manifested peripheral small blebs in which F-actin often aggregates. Observation by time-lapse video microscopy revealed that these cells showed jerky movement and actively protruding small blebs, but failed to spread by developing lamellipodia from these blebs. These results are essentially reproduced in siRNA experiments in which affixin expression was specifically knocked down. Together, these data strongly support the notion that the affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction plays an essential role in the recruitment of Î±-actinin to nascent FAs, where Î±-actinin is considered to trigger robust actin polymerization by interacting with a zyxinâMena complex and thus induces the stabilization of the nascent substrate adhesion, lamellipodial development, and formation of SFs (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Drees et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fradelizi et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

        <title>Kinase activity of ILK is essential for affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction</title>
        <p>ILK has been demonstrated to be activated by integrin signaling evoked by the interaction with the substrate (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delcommenne et al., 1998</xref>). Our analysis of thrombin-activated platelets revealed that its kinase activity is acutely enhanced within 90 s after the stimulation, which is followed by the incorporation of the integrinâILKâaffixin complex into 1% Triton X-100âinsoluble, membrane-skeletal structures (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2002</xref>). Because the CH2 domain of affixin is efficiently phosphorylated by ILK in vitro, and because the binding regions of ILK and Î±-actinin on affixin are located close to each other (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>), it is plausible that the interaction between Î±-actinin and affixin is triggered by phosphorylation of affixin by ILK in response to substrate adhesion. Indeed, we demonstrated here that the direct interaction between the CH2 domain of affixin and Î±-actinin was only observed when the CH2 domain was preincubated with ILK, but not with the kinase-dead mutant of ILK, in vitro. Although further analyses including the determination of ILK phosphorylation sites on affixin are required to completely verify our hypothesis, the present results are well consistent with the concept that ILK activation by integrin signaling and the subsequent phosphorylation of affixin is critical to the initial establishment of cellâsubstrate adhesion. It should be also noted that the time course of the increase in affixinâÎ±-actinin interaction after cell replating (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B) well correlates with that of ILK activation induced by cellâsubstrate adhesion (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Delcommenne et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previously, we demonstrated that the overexpression of affixin<sup>258â364</sup> corresponding to the entire CH2 domain in well-spread CHO-K1 cells does not severely interfere with cell adhesion unless ILK, but not the kinase-defective point mutant of ILK (K220M), is coexpressed or the cells are subjected to replating. On the other hand, we observed here that the overexpression of the smaller affixin fragment, affixin<sup>249â272</sup>, corresponding to the first portion of the CH2 domain and lacking ILK-binding activity, exerts significant deleterious effects on cellâsubstrate adhesion even without ILK coexpression or replating. This may indicate that phosphorylation of the CH2 domain by ILK induces a conformational change of the CH2 domain of affixin, which enables affixin to interact with Î±-actinin to evoke the subsequent maturation of the FA complex.</p>

        <title>Functional divergence between affixin and actopaxin/CH-ILKBP/Î±-parvin</title>
        <p>In the course of the present work, we also noted that affixin does not interact with paxillin. This is in sharp contrast with Î±-parvin, which has been demonstrated to interact with paxillin through the paxillin-binding sequence domain located in the first half of the CH2 domain. Considering that Î±-parvin does not interact with Î±-actinin (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), these results provide very interesting functional divergence between the two closely related members of the parvin family, both of which bind to ILK. It was reported that Î±-parvin directly interacts with F-actin, but affixin does not (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). This functional divergence may explain the difference in the effect of the CH2 domain overexpression on cell spreading: in contrast with affixin, the morphological effect of the overexpression of the Î±-parvin CH2 domain was revealed to be rather weak (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the Î±-parvin mutant, F271D, which exhibits impairment in binding to paxillin, has not been reported to cause any morphological changes without the inhibition of the correct FA localization of this mutant (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Nikolopoulos and Turner, 2002</xref>). Finally, Î±-parvin siRNA have revealed no obvious effect on their morphology and FA formation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2003</xref>). These results suggest that affixin has some distinct roles from Î±-parvin in cell spreading despite their close similarity in their amino acid sequence.</p>

        <title>Role of affixin during early FA formation</title>
        <p>Recently, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberger et al. (2003)</xref> have reported that affixin interacts with Î±PIX, a PAK-interacting protein that has GEF activity for Rac1 and possibly for Cdc42. In a previous report, we demonstrated that, in contrast to the CH2 domain, overexpression of the CH1 region of affixin promotes cell spreading of CHO-K1 cells, and speculated that this region may be the site that interacts with the downstream target of ILKâaffixin signaling (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yamaji et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, we confirmed that the CH1 domain is the site that interacts with Î±PIX, and the overexpression of CH1 enhances Rac and Cdc42 activities via Î±PIX (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Mishima et al., 2004</xref>). These results suggest that affixin also participates in the activation of Rac and Cdc42 by associating with Î±PIX through its CH1 domain. This activity of affixin should result in enhanced actin polymerization through the activation of various downstream effectors of Rac1/Cdc42, including Mena/VASP and WASP-Arp2/3. In addition, PIX was suggested to be responsible for the recruitment of PAK1 to integrin-based focal contacts, which is activated by Rac1/Cdc42 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Manser et al., 1998</xref>) and causes filopodia formation and membrane ruffles via the LIM kinaseâADF/cofilin pathway (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Zebda et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that affixin is not only a downstream mediator of integrinâILK signaling, but is also a scaffold protein on which all these key players of actin polymerization converge in concert with Î±-actinin and PIX (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). This protein complex formed around the initial integrin-based substrate adhesion site may synergistically evoke acute actin polymerization, which results in the rapid stabilization of the nascent cellâsubstrate interaction, lamellipodia development, and SF formation. Dramatic effects of affixin knockdown on cell spreading are consistent with this hypothesis on the central role of ILKâaffixin signaling in initial integrin signaling. Then, the fact that the introduction of the minimum Î±-actininâbinding site caused essentially similar effects on affixin siRNA suggests that the interaction between affixin and Î±-actinin is one of the critical components of this nascent integrin signaling mediated by the ILKâaffixin system.</p>

<bold>Schematic illustration of the role of affixin.</bold> The integrinâECM interaction acutely activates ILK, which is considered to induce phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal CH domain of affixin. It triggers the interaction between affixin and Î±-actinin, which promotes the recruitment of Î±-actinin into these nascent FAs. Zyxin and its binding partner, Mena, are recruited into FAs by their interaction with Î±-actinin. On the other hand, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal CH domain of affixin is considered to transmit integrinâILK signals to activate Cdc42/Rac1 through interaction with Î±PIX, which results in the recruitment of PAK to FAs. Affixin-mediated formation of the signaling complex at nascent FAs should cooperatively promote actin polymerization and lead to cell spreading.</p>
