<article-title>A Molecular Link between Albinism and Visual Deficits</article-title>
</related-article>
      <abstract>
        <p>Albinism is a genetic defect characterized by a loss of pigmentation. The neurosensory retina, which is not pigmented, exhibits pathologic changes secondary to the loss of pigmentation in the retina pigment epithelium (RPE). How the loss of pigmentation in the RPE causes developmental defects in the adjacent neurosensory retina has not been determined, but offers a unique opportunity to investigate the interactions between these two important tissues. One of the genes that causes albinism encodes for an orphan GPCR (OA1) expressed only in pigmented cells, including the RPE. We investigated the function and signaling of OA1 in RPE and transfected cell lines. Our results indicate that OA1 is a selective <sc>L-</sc>DOPA receptor, with no measurable second messenger activity from two closely related compounds, tyrosine and dopamine. Radiolabeled ligand binding confirmed that OA1 exhibited a single, saturable binding site for <sc>L-</sc>DOPA. Dopamine competed with <sc>L-</sc>DOPA for the single OA1 binding site, suggesting it could function as an OA1 antagonist. OA1 response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA was defined by several common measures of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation, including influx of intracellular calcium and recruitment of Î²-arrestin. Further, inhibition of tyrosinase, the enzyme that makes <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, resulted in decreased PEDF secretion by RPE. Further, stimulation of OA1 in RPE with <sc>L-</sc>DOPA resulted in increased PEDF secretion. Taken together, our results illustrate an autocrine loop between OA1 and tyrosinase linked through <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, and this loop includes the secretion of at least one very potent retinal neurotrophic factor. OA1 is a selective <sc>L-</sc>DOPA receptor whose downstream effects govern spatial patterning of the developing retina. Our results suggest that the retinal consequences of albinism caused by changes in melanin synthetic machinery may be treated by <sc>L-</sc>DOPA supplementation.</p>

          <p>Albinism is the loss of pigmentation caused by mutations in one of several different genes that alter pigment synthesis by different mechanisms. In the eye, albinism impairs sensory retina development and causes significant vision problems. Regardless of the genetic mutation that causes albinism, the associated vision problems are the same. Interestingly, none of the pigmentation genes are expressed by the sensory retinal cells affected by albinism but by neighboring, retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). Furthermore, loss of pigmentation in RPE somehow leads to imprecise retinal development. To investigate this cellular relationship, we studied OA1, which is encoded by a gene in which mutations cause ocular albinism. OA1 is unique among proteins involved with albinism because OA1 is a potential receptor that could participate in signal transduction rather than being a direct member of the pigment synthesis machinery. We show that the ligand for OA1 is <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, thus removing OA1 from orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) status. <sc>L-</sc>DOPA is a by-product of pigment synthesis, indicating that pigment synthesis and OA1 signaling are intertwined. OA1 signaling is highly selective for <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, and we show that two closely related molecules, dopamine and tyrosine, bind to OA1 but fail to stimulate signaling. We also show that OA1 signaling controls secretion of a potent neuron survival factor. Taken together, our data suggest that all forms of albinism produce the same retinal defects because of a final common pathway through OA1 signaling with downstream effects on RPE neurotrophic factor secretion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Albinism is a group of inherited genetic diseases in which there is a variable loss of pigmentation in the eye, hair, or skin. When the eye is affected, there are significant alterations in neurosensory retina development that lead to low vision [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There are two broad classes of albinism, ocular-cutaneous albinism (OCA) and ocular albinism (OA). OCA occurs when all pigmented tissues exhibit hypopigmentation and involves genetic mutations that result in defects in the melanin synthetic machinery [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. OA occurs when cutaneous tissues pigment normally, but the ocular tissues are hypopigmented [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since the same proteins produce pigment in all tissues, OA most likely results from lack of expression of the melanogenic enzymes in ocular tissue rather than an inability to synthesize melanin, because the other tissues pigment normally.</p>
      <p>OA can be linked to at least one gene, <italic>Oa1</italic>, which is found on the X chromosome. <italic>Oa1</italic> encodes a 404âamino acid protein likely to be an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), OA1 (GenBank GPR143) [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] based upon sequence analysis [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Schiaffino et al. have demonstrated that OA1 associates with several G<sub>Î±</sub> subunits as well as G<sub>Î²</sub>, adding further evidence that OA1 is a GPCR [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, Innamorati et. al. used a combinatorial expression strategy to illustrate GPCR-like activity from OA1, as well as Î²-arrestin association, even in the absence of a ligand [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This work suggested that OA1 could signal through a GÎ±q subunit through phospholipase C and inositol triphosphate second messengers. In a yeast-based expression system, Staleva and Orlow have demonstrated GPCR signaling from OA1 that appeared to be activated by a component in the melanosomal compartment [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite the significant amount of circumstantial evidence that OA1 is a GPCR, confirmation is lacking because no ligand has been identified. Other data have called into question the idea that OA1 is a GPCR. For example, the localization of OA1 as a fully intracellular protein is not typical of GPCRs and suggests that it would be a unique member of the family [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. OA1 is primarily localized to the endolysomal compartment [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and melanosomes [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] rather than the cell surface.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the function of OA1 as a potential GPCR. Our hypothesis was that the endosomal localization of OA1 in cultured cells was due to internalization of OA1 in response to an agent in the culture medium. Further, we sought a ligand for OA1 based on the observation that all forms OCA and OA appear to have the same retinal phenotype, indicating that tyrosinase activity and OA1 signaling are coupled upstream of retinal development. Thus, we tested whether tyrosinase activity produces the ligand for OA1. A by-product of melanin synthesis is <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, which is released to the retina during melanin synthesis in the RPE at a critical time in retinal development [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our data suggest that OA1 is a highly selective <sc>L-</sc>DOPA receptor, and that <sc>L-</sc>DOPA causes OA1 signaling with the downstream effect of neurotrophic factor secretion by RPE. Thus, we present the first evidence of a ligand for OA1, and provide a mechanism through which either tyrosinase or OA1 deficiency results in changes to retinal development.</p>

        <title>Cell Surface Localization of OA1</title>
        <p>OA1 has previously been localized in pigment granules in situ [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; however, using transfected cells of various types, OA1 also has been localized to both the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the endosomal fraction of cultured cells [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We began our investigation by determining where OA1 resides in the human tissue, using cell surface biotinylation/western blot strategies. In the human eye, OA1 was present on the apical cell surface of the retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) in situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Quantification of cell surface, biotinylated OA1 in five human eyes indicated that at least 3.5 Â± 0.7% of the total OA1 resided on the apical cell surface of RPE in situ. Access to the biotinylation reagent using eye cup preparations is restricted to the apical surface, so the polarity of OA1 in the epithelium cannot be determined. Further, the total cell surface OA1 is likely underestimated because of the lack of access to the basal cell surface. Blots were also probed with antibodies against actin as a control to verify that cytoplasmic proteins were not biotinylated, and in each experiment, actin was only found in the unbound fraction.</p>

        <p>Others have reported that recombinant OA1 and OA1-GFP is almost exclusively localized to the endosomal compartment in cultured cells [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, when overexpressed [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or when endocytosis is inhibited [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], OA1 accumulates at the cell surface. Our observation that OA1 protein is present on the apical surface of RPE in situ led us to explore the issue further.</p>

        <title>Effects of Tyrosine on OA1 Expression and Distribution</title>
        <p>Endosomal localization of GPCRs occurs normally after exposure to a ligand. Therefore, we investigated whether a ligand for the receptor was present in the standard incubation medium that could drive internalization of OA1. Since the standard culture medium contains 500 Î¼M tyrosine, and tyrosine is the starting material for pigment synthesis, we evaluated the effect of tyrosine on receptor distribution. To test whether tyrosine affected OA1 distribution in cultured cells, we formulated DMEM without tyrosine, and used dialyzed fetal bovine serum. In the presence of tyrosine-free medium, OA1 was detected on the plasma membrane of cultured RPE cells both in the absence (unpublished data), and in medium containing low concentrations of tyrosine (1 Î¼M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Averaged over five experiments, 4.5 Â± 1% of total OA1 protein was observed on the surface of cultured RPE maintained in 1 Î¼M tyrosine, similar to what was observed for RPE in situ. In all experiments, actin was observed in the unbound protein fraction, demonstrating the absence of any cytoplasmic protein in the cell surface assay. Similarly, OA1-GFP expressed in COS cells illustrated a cell surface expression that was tyrosine sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Quantification of six such experiments indicated significant variability in the amount of OA1 found at the cell surface using transient transfections. The range of OA1 in the bound fraction of transfected cells maintained in 1 Î¼M tyrosine ranged between 5%â40%, unlike the results with the endogenous OA1 protein that were reproducibly approximately 5%.</p>
        <p>Not only was the distribution of OA1 in transfected cells sensitive to tyrosine levels in the medium, but total OA1-GFP expression was increased 5-fold in cells maintained in 1 Î¼M tyrosine. To verify that this difference related to OA1 expression rather than cell number, we evaluated actin expression from the paired samples. The data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) presented as optical density units indicate no difference in actin. We also compared the amount of cell surface OA1 between the normal and low-tyrosine groups. Importantly, in the five RPE experiments and six OA1-GFP in COS experiments, we were unable to reproducibly detect OA1 in the plasma membrane fraction of cells in standard medium, similar to that found by others.</p>
        <p>The distribution of OA1 in RPE cells also was evaluated by confocal microscopy. OA1 has previously been characterized as an endosomal protein in cultured RPE cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g001">Figure 1</xref>E. In contrast, the distribution of OA1 in low-tyrosine medium was diffuse on the plasma membrane of cultured RPE cells, with little endosomal accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), an observation consistent with the results obtained using biochemical methods.</p>

<sc>L-</sc>DOPA as a Natural Agonist for OA1</title>
        <p>Tyrosinase function in melanogenesis begins with its activity on tyrosine to create <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, followed by a second reaction to create dopaquinone that leads to pigment formation [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Of the intermediates between tyrosine and melanin, <sc>L-</sc>DOPA has the greatest half-life, and <sc>L-</sc>DOPA is released into the subretinal space apical to the RPE when melanin synthesis occurs [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. <sc>L-</sc>DOPA is also the precursor to dopamine, a neurotransmitter produced by dopaneurgic neurons from tyrosine. The release of calcium from intracellular stores is a common downstream effect of GPCR activation by a ligand. Since the expression of OA1 on the cell surface appears to be sensitive to tyrosine, we examined whether tyrosine, or its metabolites <sc>L-</sc>DOPA and dopamine, could stimulate influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm in an OA1-dependent manner. CHO cells were transfected with an OA1 expression vector then maintained in DMEM containing 1 Î¼M tyrosine for 48 h, followed by tyrosine-free DMEM for 24 h to facilitate cell surface expression of OA1. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was evaluated using Fura-2, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was determined by ratiometric imaging [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the absence of any ligand, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was not significantly different between transfected and untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Tyrosine and several tyrosine metabolites were tested at 1 Î¼M for an effect on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. As a positive control, we ended each experiment by treatment with 20 mM KCl to depolarize the cell and increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i via activation of voltage-gated channels. This maneuver served to verify the Fura-2 loading and responsiveness of the cells being tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Only <sc>L-</sc>DOPA elicited a significant increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Tyrosine and dopamine had no positive effect on intracellular at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i concentrations up to 1 mM (unpublished data). The slight negative effect of 1 Î¼M dopamine was not statistically significant, but it was reproducible among the 11 experiments with dopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Overexpression of GPCRs in nonnative cell lines can lead to false signal transduction coupling. To verify that OA1 signaling in response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA was indeed a natural response, we expressed OA1 in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Results using transfected RPE cells were similar to those achieved with transfected CHO cells. RPE cells transfected to express OA1 responded to 1.0 Î¼M <sc>L-</sc>DOPA with an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. We next sought to determine whether RPE cells expressing the endogenous OA1 receptor, at endogenous levels exhibited <sc>L-</sc>DOPA responsiveness. Like all of the transfected cell experiments, RPE expressing OA1 demonstrated an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i after treatment with 1.0 Î¼M <sc>L-</sc>DOPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To further characterize OA1 signaling activity, we used pertussis toxin to distinguish between G<sub>q</sub> coupled [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i signaling and G<sub>i</sub> linked signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In all cells studied, pertussis toxin lowered the basal level of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, indicating its activity on inhibition of the background signaling through G<sub>i</sub> subunit activity. Pertussis toxin was used in experiments conducted in cells transfected to express OA1 including both CHO and RPE, as well as RPE expressing the endogenous OA1 protein at natural levels. In all transfected cells tested, the measured [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA was greater than in the absence of the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>), owing largely to the lower initial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. Thus, the signaling through OA1 in response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA that results in increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i is not pertussis toxin sensitive and likely G<sub>q</sub> subunit mediated. We also measured the second messenger cAMP in CHO cells transfected to express OA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Using inactive cells or a submaximal forskolin treatment, the experiments were set up to measure either an increase or decrease in cAMP in response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA. In six such experiments, no change in cAMP was observed suggesting neither G<sub>s</sub> nor G<sub>i</sub> subunits are involved in OA1 signaling.</p>
        <p>We utilized standard methods of radiolabeled ligand binding to characterize the interaction between OA1 and <sc>L-</sc>DOPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). CHO cells were transfected to express OA1, then binding of <sc>L-</sc>DOPA was quantified in a concentration-dependent manner, and the results were further characterized by Scatchard plot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, inset). Results illustrate saturable binding of <sc>L-</sc>DOPA to OA1 expressing cells with a Kd of 9.35 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup> M. No specific binding was observed in untransfected CHO cells, indicating that the cells do not have an endogenous <sc>L-</sc>DOPA receptor (unpublished data). All binding parameters, total, specific, and nonspecific, are shown as supplemental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060236-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Tyrosine exhibited the potential to interact with OA1, but neither tyrosine nor dopamine stimulated OA1 signaling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We next used competitive ligand binding to determine whether either tyrosine or dopamine competed with <sc>L-</sc>DOPA for OA1 binding. At high concentrations (1 mM), both tyrosine and dopamine competed with <sc>L-</sc>DOPA for OA1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). To further characterize this, we examined the kinetics of the competition between <sc>L-</sc>DOPA and either dopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) or tyrosine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060236-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).

        <p>Given the relatively low affinity of OA1 for <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, we sought to determine whether its signaling activity was dose dependent in the range of this binding affinity. We tested the concentrations in which binding data suggested the steepest rise in association between <sc>L-</sc>DOPA and OA1, 1.0â10 Î¼M, and results illustrate a concentration-dependent GPCR response as measured by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

        <title>Effects of 1-DOPA on PEDF Secretion</title>
        <p>Mutations in OA1 cause defects in the development of the neurosensory retina. In previous work, we have shown that pigmented RPE secrete significantly more PEDF than nonpigmented RPE [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and PEDF is a neurotrophic factor with the potential of altering neurosensory retina development [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Mutations in OA1 cause a loss of pigmentation in the RPE, suggesting that OA1 activity governs RPE pigmentation. Thus, we sought to determine whether <sc>L-</sc>DOPA stimulation of pigmented RPE cells caused increased secretion of PEDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This assay is made somewhat more difficult because pigmenting RPE cells produce <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, which is the agonist for OA1, and OA1 is not readily detectable in nonpigmented cultures of RPE. Thus, we used pigmented RPE to determine whether <sc>L-</sc>DOPA stimulation increases PEDF expression/secretion. RPE cells were placed in tyrosine-free medium for 24 h and then treated with 1 Î¼M <sc>L-</sc>DOPA for 1 h. After treatment, the cells were returned to standard medium without exogenous <sc>L-</sc>DOPA for 3 d. Control cells were not treated with <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, but the medium was changed at the same time the experimental cells were returned to normal medium. Conditioned medium was collected after 3 d, and PEDF was measured. Results illustrate a significant increase in the secretion of PEDF in pigmented cells treated with <sc>L-</sc>DOPA when compared to paired, control monolayers of pigmented RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

        <p>To determine whether pigmented RPE cells secrete PEDF through an autocrine loop involving tyrosinase activity and OA1 signaling, we used a specific tyrosinase inhibitor phenylthiourea (PTU) to inhibit pigmentation and <sc>L-</sc>DOPA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In these experiments, pigmented RPE cells were either maintained in DMEM, or DMEM containing 200 Î¼M PTU, for 3 d, then PEDF secretion was measured. Pigmented RPE secreted substantial PEDF, but PTU caused a significant decrease in PEDF secretion, indicating that tyrosinase activity is necessary for the high level of PEDF secretion observed in pigmented RPE cells. To verify that it was the lack of <sc>L-</sc>DOPA in the PTU-treated cells that caused the decreased PEDF secretion, we used three different cultures of pigmented RPE and exposed them to PTU for 48 h, then treated them with 1.0 Î¼M <sc>L-</sc>DOPA in the continued presence of PTU and measured PEDF after 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060236-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The data are presented as percent of control for this experiment because the cultures used varied in both pigmentation and PEDF expression before the experiment began. PTU-treated RPE responded to the added <sc>L-</sc>DOPA by increasing PEDF secretion, indicating that the effect of PTU on PEDF secretion is caused be the lack of <sc>L-</sc>DOPA production when tyrosinase is inhibited.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There is a complex intertissue relationship between the RPE and the neurosensory retina. One aspect of this relationship is centered on RPE pigmentation, and defects in melanin synthesis that result in significant neurosensory retina alterations [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our data suggest that OA1 and tyrosinase participate in an autocrine loop through <sc>L-</sc>DOPA that regulates the secretion of at least one potent neurotrophic factor, PEDF. We also suggest that the pathologic changes in retinal development that occur in albinism may result from changes in the activity of the OA1 signaling pathway. Reduced OA1 signaling activity can be caused either directly through OA1 mutations or indirectly through changes in <sc>L-</sc>DOPA production by tyrosinase activity. Thus, we hypothesize that the similar retinal phenotypes that accompany the diverse forms of albinism can be reconciled to a single common pathway, OA1 signaling.</p>
      <p>In our study, we observed OA1 on the apical surface of human RPE in situ. Previous reports have suggested that OA1 in mice is localized to the melanosome [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and in cultured cells to the endosomal compartment [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results from in situ RPE preparations indicate that OA1 is distributed to the apical surface of the RPE. The limited quantities of OA1 on the surface of the RPE (â¼3.5% of total OA1) may account for the lack of observation of the protein in previous studies in which immunogold electron microscopy was used. Like many cell surface GPCRs, OA1 is not an abundant protein.</p>
      <p>The endosomal localization of OA1 reported in previous studies using cultured cells was reproduced in this study for both the endogenous protein and the transgenic protein. When it was tested in normal culture medium, we found little detectable OA1 protein on the cell surface, in agreement with all previous work. However, reduction of tyrosine in the medium caused a modest increase in cell surface receptor accumulation of both the endogenous and recombinant OA1 proteins. This suggests that the distribution of OA1 to the cell surface in cultured cells is sensitive to tyrosine. A previous study has demonstrated OA1 could be localized to the cell surface when endocytosis is inhibited [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and we observed OA1 on the apical surface of human RPE in situ. We suggest OA1 is a cell surface GPCR, but is a target for endocytosis that may be stimulated by tyrosine or tyrosine metabolites. In this regard, our results differ from past reports of OA1 localization that have classified OA1 as a unique type of intracellular GPCR. Most GPCRs are cell surface proteins that are internalized by a variety of signals, and our data suggest OA1 is similar to most other GPCRs.</p>
      <p>OA1 signaling activity was stimulated by <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, but not by either its precursor, tyrosine, or its neuronal metabolite dopamine. This result suggests an exquisitely sensitive receptor activity able to distinguish between closely related molecules; after all, <sc>L-</sc>DOPA and tyrosine differ by a sole hydroxyl group. OA1 is sensitive to tyrosine, as tyrosine causes an intracellular localization of OA1 in cultured cells. However, we noted no signaling response to tyrosine, and competition binding studies suggest that tyrosine has a low affinity for OA1. Our data suggest that the continuous exposure of cells to high concentrations of tyrosine present in normal medium is sufficient to result in internalization of OA1, but it is unlikely to result in measurable OA1 activation. We found strong evidence of a single-site competitive interaction between <sc>L-</sc>DOPA and dopamine. The <italic>K</italic>
<sub>i</sub> observed for dopamine was similar to the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> observed for <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, suggesting that the affinity for the two tyrosine metabolites is similar. Our results illustrated a slight, but reproducible, decrease in OA1 signaling from dopamine, suggesting that dopamine may be an effective antagonist or inverse agonist for OA1.</p>
      <p>As an orphan GPCR, its signaling pathway has not previously been identified. In this study, we illustrate that OA1 signaling in response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA causes an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. Our data illustrate that the increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i observed in response to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA was insensitive to pertussis toxin, and we measured no effects on cAMP, indicating that OA1 is likely signaling through a G<sub>q</sub> subunit. Previous work has suggested that OA1 can associate with multiple subunits in transfected cells, including members of the G<sub>o</sub>, G<sub>i</sub>, and G<sub>q</sub> subunit families. Innamorati et al. has shown that spontaneous activity of overexpressed OA1 is likely signaled through a Gq subunit [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our data indicate that ligand-dependent signaling from endogenous OA1 in RPE most likely occurs through a G<sub>q</sub>-mediated pathway, and we observed no promiscuous coupling activities when comparing OA1 overexpression in CHO and RPE to natural OA1 expressed in RPE. Interestingly, two overactive mutant forms of Gq subunits cause hyperpigmentation in skin and hair [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but whether they have an effect in RPE is unknown. RPE and cutaneous melanocytes use the same enzymes to produce pigmentation but differ in their control of melanogenesis. A recent report suggests that OA1 may signal through GÎ±i3, because the retinal phenotype of OA1<sup>â/â</sup> and GÎ±i3<sup>â/â</sup> are similar [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. That study provided no data regarding interaction or signaling between GÎ±i3 and OA1, and our results do not support OA1 signaling through GÎ±i3. However, both OA1 and GÎ±i3 could have activity in convergent pathways that govern some part of the complex system of retinal development.</p>
      <p>The response of OA1 to <sc>L-</sc>DOPA was measured in three ways, increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, recruitment of Î²-arrestin to plasma membrane OA1, and the increased secretion of PEDF. In addition, we have inhibited the activity of tyrosinase in pigmented RPE, which inhibits <sc>L-</sc>DOPA production and observed a decreased secretion of PEDF. Taken together, these studies present a strong argument for a productive ligand:receptor relationship between <sc>L-</sc>DOPA and OA1. Further, our data suggest selectivity among tyrosine and its metabolites, with only <sc>L-</sc>DOPA being a productive ligand for OA1. We have determined the binding kinetics between OA1 and <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, and observed a typical one-site receptor:ligand relationship between the two. The binding affinity between OA1 and <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, with a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> in the micromolar range, is not uncommon for an endogenous ligand:receptor relationship. Future identification of a specific, high-affinity antagonist for OA1 will aid in further biochemical characterization of the interaction between OA1 and <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, and be useful in determining whether dopamine is an inverse agonist.</p>
      <p>We have illustrated the selective activation of OA1, an orphan GPCR, by <sc>L-</sc>DOPA, an intermediate product of melanin synthesis. We have also illustrated that OA1 activity stimulates PEDF secretion by RPE, a molecule that has the potential to support normal retinal development [<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pbio-0060236-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In humans, this suggests that pharmacologic intervention through OA1 activation could be useful for albinism caused by defects in the melanogenic machinery (OCA 1â4). Unfortunately, our data also suggest that OA1 is necessary for such pharmacologic intervention, and mutations in <italic>Oa1</italic> are the most common cause of albinism.</p>
