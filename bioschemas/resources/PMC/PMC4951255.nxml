      <abstract>
        <p>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway transmits signals downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and is one of the most dysregulated pathways in breast cancer. PI3Ks and AKTs consist of multiple isoforms that play distinct and even opposite roles in breast cancer cell growth and metastasis. However, it remains unknown how the activities of various PI3K and AKT isoforms are coordinated during breast cancer progression. Previously, we showed WDR26 is a novel WD40 protein that binds GÎ²Î³ and promotes GÎ²Î³ signaling. Here, we demonstrate that WDR26 is overexpressed in highly malignant breast tumor cell lines and human breast cancer samples, and that WDR26 overexpression correlates with shortened survival of breast cancer patients. In highly malignant cell lines (MDA-MB231, DU4475 and BT549), downregulation of WDR26 expression selectively alleviated GPCR- but not EGF receptor-stimulated PI3K/AKT signaling and tumor cell growth, migration and invasion. In contrast, in a less malignant cell line (MCF7), WDR26 overexpression had the opposite effect. Additional studies indicate that downstream of GPCR stimulation, WDR26 serves as a scaffold that fosters assembly of a specific signaling complex consisting of GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ² and AKT2. In an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of breast cancer, disrupting formation of this complex, by overexpressing WDR26 mutants in MDA-MB231 cells, abrogated PI3K/AKT activation and tumor cell growth and metastasis. Together, our results identify a novel mechanism regulating GPCR-dependent activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis in breast tumor cells, and pinpoint WDR26 as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The PI3Ks/AKTs are major effectors downstream of cell surface receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and GPCRs [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway occurs in more than 70% of breast cancers [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This pathway may be aberrantly activated by mutation or amplification of genes encoding PI3Ks or AKTs, loss or mutation of tumor suppressor PTEN, or mutation or overexpression of upstream signaling molecules such as HER2 or GPCRs. The class I PI3Ks consist of four isoforms, PI3KÎ±, PI3KÎ², PI3KÎ´, and PI3KÎ³ [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These are obligate heterodimeric proteins composed of a catalytic (p110) subunit and one of several regulatory subunits, including p85. PI3KÎ± is predominantly activated by RTKs, and was the focus of many studies because its catalytic subunit (p110Î±) shows a high mutation rate (about 26%) in cancerous breast tumors [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PI3KÎ² can be activated by RTKs or downstream of GPCRs through direct interaction with heterotrimeric G protein Î²Î³ subunits [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In cancers, no mutations in the p110Î² catalytic subunit of PI3KÎ² have been identified, but in higher grade breast cancer tumors, HER2 expression and a poor prognosis has been correlated with overexpression of p110Î² [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Also, in transgenic mice, a catalytically inactive p110Î² inhibits HER2-driven tumor development [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, PTEN-deficient breast tumor cells require PI3KÎ² (but not PI3KÎ±) to proliferate, and are more sensitive to cell-cycle arrest induced by PI3KÎ² inhibitors [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. PI3KÎ² can be activated by RTKs but, in PTEN-deficient breast and prostate cancer cells, PI3KÎ² appears to be activated primarily by GPCRs through GÎ²Î³ [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These findings indicate that under certain circumstances, a GÎ²Î³-stimulated PI3KÎ² pathway may drive breast tumor progression. However, it remains to be determined how GÎ²Î³ specifically activates PI3KÎ² in cancer cells, and how the PI3KÎ² pathway is regulated during breast cancer progression.</p>
      <p>AKT assumes three isoforms: AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3. Although these share a high sequence homology, different AKT isoforms have distinct functions in breast cancer progression [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, although both AKT1 and AKT2 are required for primary tumor growth, AKT2 appears to promote tumor metastasis, while AKT1 has an inhibitory role in tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it is unclear how various AKT isoforms are activated by different PI3K isoforms and how they perform distinct functions in breast cancer.</p>
      <p>GPCRs transmit extracellular signals and are the largest family of cell surface receptors. Experimental and clinical data indicate that breast cancer cells overexpress diverse GPCRs, such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors, chemokine receptors (such as CXCR4 and CXCR7), and protease-activated receptors (PARs), and produce high levels of GPCR ligands (such as LPA and SDF1Î±) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Aberrant activation of GPCRs stimulates cancer cells not only to proliferate in primary sites but also to migrate and form metastasis in distant organs. We and others have shown that multiple GPCRs that promote breast tumor progression use GÎ²Î³ as a point of signal convergence [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Blocking GÎ²Î³ signaling in cancer cells not only inhibited breast tumor cell growth but also dramatically blocked spontaneous lung metastasis in nude mice, suggesting that GÎ²Î³ may represent a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Upon activation, GÎ²Î³ subunits regulate the activity of a diverse set of downstream signaling targets, e.g., PI3Ks, ERKs, and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) for Rac and Cdc42 [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Still, it remains to be defined which downstream pathways mediate the function of GÎ²Î³ in breast cancer cells.</p>
      <p>We recently identified WDR26 as a novel GÎ²Î³-interacting protein that regulates the efficiency of GÎ²Î³ signaling [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. WDR26 is a member of the WD40-repeat proteins, which primarily function as scaffolds/adaptors, which coordinate formation of large and dynamic multi-protein complexes to orchestrate signaling networks [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In leukemia cells, we first showed WDR26 is required for chemokine-induced cell migration [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It exists as a highly ordered oligomer that promotes specific and efficient chemokine-stimulated GÎ²Î³ signaling by coordinating GÎ²Î³ interaction with specific effectors, such as PLCÎ²2 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These findings prompted us to ask whether WDR26 expression is perturbed in breast cancer and if it contributes to breast cancer progression. Our data showed that WDR26 is indeed upregulated in highly malignant breast tumors, and upregulated WDR26 promotes breast tumor growth and metastasis by acting as a scaffold that fosters GÎ²Î³-mediated PI3K/AKT activation. These results have identified WDR26 as a novel regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway and suggest that it may be a new prognostic marker and drug target in breast cancer.</p>

        <title>WDR26 is upregulated in human breast cancer samples</title>
        <p>Analysis of a large cancer dataset compiled from 121 cancer studies by the cBioPortal showed that breast cancers had the greatest number of genomic copies of WDR26 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>); and the basal-like breast cancer subtype had the highest frequency (27%) of WDR26 gene amplification, as compared to the luminal A (23%), luminal B (18%) and HER2 positive (16%) subtypes. Compared to normal breast tissues, breast cancer cells (from the TCGA invasive dataset, Cell, 2015) expressed significantly more WDR26 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Importantly, WDR26 overexpression correlated with shorter patient survival (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), suggesting WDR26 may be an important regulator or prognostic marker of breast cancer progression. Increased WDR26 expression in samples of malignant cancers at the protein level was verified immunohistochemically by comparing breast cancer tissues (stage II and III) to matched, adjacent, normal breast tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p>

        <title>WDR26 promotes breast cancer cell growth, migration and invasion</title>
        <p>To explore how WDR26 regulates the function of breast cancer cells, several cancer cell lines were screened for its expression. Compared to non-transformed MC10A cells, in MDA-MB231 and DU4475 cells (two highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines) WDR26 was overexpressed by 1.5 to 2 fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, downregulating WDR26 levels by siRNAs (targeting two distinct coding regions of WDR26) reduced the size of MDA-MB231 cell colonies in Matrigel by 50%, demonstrating that WDR26 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The decreased growth of WDR26-deficient cells was also shown by MTT-based cell viability assay and a 5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridine (Brdu) incorporation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B-3C</xref>). Similar results were found for DU4475 and BT549 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and data not shown).</p>

        <p>Migration of MDA-MB231 cells was also inhibited by downregulation of WDR26, as shown in a wound-healing assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). It is unlikely that cell migration decreased because of changes in cell growth, since the assay was performed in the presence of the cell proliferation inhibitor, mitomycin. Notably, cell migration was blocked by WDR26 knockdown in a transwell-based assay if the chemoattractants were GPCR ligands (i.e., SDF1Î±, LPA and a PAR2 peptide agonist) but not growth factors, such as EGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Invasion of MDA-MB231 cells into Matrigel can also be induced by LPA; and this migratory behavior was also blocked by WDR26 downregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Similarly, WDR26 inhibition significantly reduced GPCR-stimulated BT549 cell migration (data not shown).</p>

        <p>To confirm further that WDR26 plays an important role in breast cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, we examined the effects of ectopic WDR26 expression in MCF7 cells, which only express a low level of endogenous WDR26. WDR26 upregulation significantly increased the size of MCF7 cell colonies grown in Matrigel by 2 fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), and enhanced cell migration induced by LPA and SDF1Î± by 1.5 to 1.8 fold, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In contrast, EGF-induced cell migration was not significantly affected by WDR26 overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

        <title>WDR26 selectively regulates GPCR-mediated PI3K/AKT activation</title>
        <p>To probe how WDR26 regulates GPCR signaling in breast cancers, we examined the effect of WDR26 downregulation on the activation of GÎ±- or GÎ²Î³-mediated signaling pathways downstream of GPCR stimulation. Previously, we showed that, in MDA-MB231 cells, LPA and SDF1Î± stimulate AKT and ERK phosphorylation, primarily through GÎ²Î³ [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. WDR26 knockdown reduced the level of AKT phosphorylation by 2 to 6 fold at different time points that is stimulated by LPA or SDF1Î±, but had little effect on ERK phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A-5B</xref>). Moreover, WDR26 downregulation did not affect LPA stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling or a SDF1Î±-stimulated decrease in cAMP accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C-5D</xref>), which are mediated by the activation of GÎ±q/11 and GÎ±i/o subunits, respectively [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, WDR26 downregulation did not affect isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation, which is mediated by the activation of GÎ±s downstream of Î²-adrenergic receptors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). These findings indicate that WDR26 selectively regulates GÎ²Î³-mediated PI3K/AKT activation. Consistent with a specific role for WDR26 in regulating GPCR signaling, suppressing WDR26 did not affect EGF-stimulated AKT or ERK phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Similarly, in BT549 cells, suppressing WDR26 selectively alleviated LPA- and SDF1Î±-, but not EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation (data not shown). Conversely, in MCF7 cells, overexpressing WDR26 selectively enhanced LPA- but not EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation by 2 to 3 fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A-6B</xref>). Notably, in both control and WDR26-overexpressing MCF7 cells, pertussis toxin inhibited LPA-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that GÎ²Î³ released from activated Gi/o proteins stimulates the phosphorylation of AKT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A-6B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To test whether the PI3K/AKT pathway contributes to breast cancer cell growth and migration, the effects of PI3K inhibitors on MDA-MB231 cells were examined. No effect was seen after treating cells with PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors (TGX221, AS605240 and IC87114 for p110Î², p110Î³ and p110Î´, respectively) at doses known to discriminate different isoforms, whereas, MDA-MB231 growth in Matrigel was partly inhibited by the pan-PI3K inhibitor, GDC0941, or pan-AKT inhibitor, MK2206, suggesting several isoforms of PI3K and AKT work in concert to drive breast cancer cell growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In contrast, LPA-mediated transwell migration was sensitive to both TGX221 and GDC0941, but not AS605240 and IC87114, suggesting the specific involvement of PI3KÎ² in cell migration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

        <title>WDR26 fosters the interaction between GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ² and AKT2 to promote PI3K/AKT activation</title>
        <p>Previously, we reported that in leukemia cells, WDR26 fosters the interaction between GÎ²Î³ and its effector PLCÎ²2 by directly binding both proteins, thereby promoting GÎ²Î³-stimulated PLCÎ²2 activation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We therefore postulated that WDR26 similarly regulates PI3K/AKT activation in breast cancer cells by fostering the interactions between GÎ²Î³, PI3K and AKT. To test this, FLAG-tagged WDR26 was overexpressed in MDA-MB231 cells and complexes were co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (because no commercially available antibodies can efficiently immunoprecipitate endogenous WDR26). WDR26 was found to be associated with GÎ²Î³ in unstimulated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A-8B</xref>). Upon stimulation with LPA, the association of WDR26 with GÎ²Î³ increased by 2 fold within 5 minutes; and then, after prolonged stimulation for 30 minutes, the association decreased to a basal level. WDR26 also interacted with the PI3K subunit, p110Î², and AKT2 in unstimulated cells. In contrast, LPA stimulation did not affect the interaction of p110Î² and AKT2 with WDR26. Notably, although MDA-MB231 cells express other isoforms of PI3Ks and AKT (including p110Î± and p110Î´, and AKT1), these did not associate with WDR26 in either stimulated or unstimulated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), suggesting that WDR26 selectively interacts with specific isoforms of PI3Ks and AKTs.</p>

        <p>The interactions between WDR26 and AKT2 and PI3KÎ² were examined further by co-immunoprecipitation assays to assess how they might influence formation of a signaling complex containing WDR26, GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ² and AKT2. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C-8D</xref>, AKT2 and PI3KÎ² interacted individually with WDR26 and GÎ²Î³, and also formed a trimeric complex with WDR26 and GÎ²Î³. The presence of WDR26 did not affect GÎ²Î³ interaction with PI3KÎ² but enhanced GÎ²Î³ interaction with AKT2. Given that WDR26 also binds GÎ²Î³, these findings indicate that WDR26 likely serves as a scaffold that fosters interactions between GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ² and/or AKT2, thereby promoting PI3KÎ² and AKT2 activation by GÎ²Î³.</p>
        <p>To identify PI3KÎ² and AKT2 binding sites on WDR26, deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged WDR26 were co-expressed with HA-p110Î² and HA-p85 or HA-AKT2 and protein complexes were co-immunoprecipitated. A truncation mutant lacking the WDR26 N terminal, and consisting of only the LisH-CTLH and WD40 domains, appeared to bind both PI3KÎ² and AKT2, while WDR1-122, the N-terminal fragment, did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E-8F</xref>). The WDR295-661 mutant, which lacks the N-terminal half and LisH-CTLH domain but retains the WD40 repeats, bound both p110Î²/p85 and AKT2; however, the binding sites for AKT2 may involve other domains because WDR232-661 bound AKT2 better than WDR295-661, and WDR1-231 also interacted with AKT2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previously, we showed that the WDR123-661 deletion mutant can bind both GÎ²Î³ and its effector, PLCÎ²2 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, when it was overexpressed in leukocytes, it acted as a dominant-negative mutant: it inhibited full-length WDR26 from promoting GÎ²Î³-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and cell migration [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given that the WDR26 fragments, WDR123-661 and WDR295-661, could still interact with AKT2 and PI3KÎ², we reasoned that they might also interfere with the function of the full-length WDR26 in breast cancer cells. To test this, we generated stable MDA-MB231 cells expressing inducible WDR123-661 and WDR295-661, with GFP and WDR1-122 as controls. As compared to GFP, induced expression of WDR1-122 had no effect on LPA- or EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A-9B</xref>). In contrast, inducing expression of WDR123-661 and WDR295-661 in MDA-MB231 cells decreased LPA-stimulated AKT phosphorylation by 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A-9B</xref>). Consistent with their effect on AKT activation, induced expression of WDR123-661 and WDR295-661, but not WDR1-122, significantly reduced the size of MDA-MB231 cell colonies in Matrigel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>), and LPA- or SDF1Î±-induced cell migration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>). The effect of these mutants is likely to be specific since WDR123-661 and WDR295-661 neither affected EGF-stimulated AKT activation nor cell migration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B and 9D</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>In this study, we identified WDR26 as a novel regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and showed that aberrant expression of WDR26 in breast cancer cells contributes to breast cancer cell growth and metastasis. Our data indicate that WDR26 is upregulated in malignant cancer tissues and its expression strongly correlates with poor patient survival. Compared to less malignant and non-invasive cell lines, such as MCF7 and T47D, highly malignant and invasive breast cancer cell lines (i.e, MDA-MB231 and DU4475) expressed significantly more WDR26. Because we had access to only a limited number of clinical samples and cell lines, it remains to be determined whether WDR26 expression correlates with particular breast cancer subtypes or histological features. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that WDR26 overexpression is functionally significant, since knockdown of WDR26 in MDA-MB231 and DU4475 cells inhibited growth, migration, and invasion, while overexpression of WDR26 in MCF7 cells had the opposite effect.</p>
      <p>Our data argue that WDR26 promotes breast cancer growth and metastasis through the GPCR-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In breast cancer cells, downregulation of WDR26 selectively impaired GPCRs from inducing AKT phosphorylation via GÎ²Î³, but did not prevent RTKs from signaling for growth factor-mediated AKT activation. Moreover, the regulation of WDR26 on GÎ²Î³ signaling is highly specific, since downregulation of WDR26 affected neither LPA- nor SDF1Î±-stimulated ERK activation, despite that both PI3K/AKT and ERK are activated downstream of GÎ²Î³. These findings are consistent with our previous report that WDR26 is a selective regulator of GÎ²Î³-mediated signaling pathways downstream of GPCR activation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that the specificity of WDR26 in regulating the GÎ²Î³-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling likely stems from a specific interaction with multiple, key components of this pathway, and that this interaction tethers them to a signaling complex. Consistent with what we reported previously [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. WDR26 interacts with GÎ²Î³ liberated from heterotrimeric G proteins by GPCR stimulation. WDR26 also binds GÎ²Î³-specific PI3KÎ², but not RTK-specific PI3Ks, including PI3KÎ± and PI3KÎ´. Additionally, WDR26 selectively binds AKT2 but not AKT1. As with GÎ²Î³, WDR26 likely binds PI3KÎ² and AKT2 directly, since their interaction can also be demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified proteins (data not shown). Nevertheless, unlike GÎ²Î³, the interaction of PI3KÎ² and AKT2 with WDR26 was not enhanced by GPCR stimulation, suggesting that they likely exist in a preformed complex in unstimulated cells. The ability of WDR26 to interact with multiple proteins is consistent with its scaffolding function we reported previously [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but the molecular basis for its binding to specific PI3K and AKT isoforms remains to be defined. Moreover, we are unable to narrow down the exact domains of WDR26 that bind GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ² and AKT2. This might be because the WDR26 scaffold is shaped by a highly ordered oligomer and uses domains from different WDR26 monomers to bind certain proteins [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>WDR26 might tether GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ², and AKT2 in a complex, allowing PI3KÎ² and AKT2 to work in concert, and with specificity. PI3KÎ² is activated by binding to GÎ²Î³, but we found WDR26 was not required for the GÎ²Î³/PI3KÎ² interaction. Nevertheless, WDR26 may bring PI3KÎ² in the vicinity of GÎ²Î³ for more efficient activation. Our results indicate GÎ²Î³ binds AKT2 and WDR26 enhances this interaction. Thus, by recruiting AKT2 to the signaling complex containing GÎ²Î³ and PI3KÎ², WDR26 likely enhances PI3KÎ² specificity for certain AKT isoforms. Our results also suggest WDR26 integrates interactions between GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ², and AKT2, which is critical for GÎ²Î³-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and function in breast cancer cells. Thus, overexpression of WDR26 N-terminal truncation mutants, WDR123-661 and WDR295-661, blocks AKT activation and breast cancer cell growth and migration <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. As we reported previously [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], full-length WDR26 is expected to oligomerize to form a scaffold, while the N-terminal truncation of WDR26 likely disrupts oligomerization. These truncation mutants, however, still bind GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ², and AKT2, and when overexpressed, they are expected to block the ability of full-length WDR26 to form the scaffold that facilitates PI3KÎ²/AKT2 activation and function. This would explain why WDR26 mutants lacking N-terminal domains are dominant negative inhibitors of breast cancer growth and migration.</p>
      <p>Accumulating evidence indicates that distinct PI3K and AKT isoforms play different roles in breast cancer progression [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

However, recent studies indicate that inhibition of one PI3K isoform in breast cancer containing PTEN deficiency, PI3KÎ± mutation or HER2 amplification may lead to compensatory reactivation of another [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although both AKT1 and AKT2 are required for breast tumor growth, AKT1 appears to suppress, while AKT2 promotes tumor metastasis [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A recent study also showed that AKT2 but not AKT1 is required for the maintenance of PTEN-deficient breast tumor spheroids in 3D culture [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interestingly, although WDR26 selectively regulates PI3KÎ² and AKT2 signaling, its activity on breast cancer cell growth and migration does not seem to depend on the status of PI3KÎ± mutation, PTEN expression or RTK overexpression. For example, MDA-MB231 and DU4475 cells are triple-negative cell types that express wild-type PTEN, while PTEN is lost in BT549 cells. Nevertheless, they all display reduced growth and migration when WDR26 expression is inhibited. Similarly, although MCF7 cells contain mutations that activate PI3KÎ±, if they overexpress WDR26, then their growth and GPCR-induced cell migration accelerates. Nevertheless, the fact that WDR26 expression is not significantly upregulated in BT549 cells suggests that PTEN deficiency may render BT549 cells more dependent on the WDR26-regulated PI3K/AKT pathway. Notably, suppressing PI3KÎ² activity alone does not block MDA-MB231 or WDR26-overexpression MCF7 cells from growth in Matrigel. These results suggest that, in promoting breast cancers, WDR26 must do more than simply augment PI3KÎ² activity. Rather, it must also uniquely promote signal transduction from PI3KÎ² specifically to AKT2-dependent pathways. Future work will test whether WDR26 modulates the activity of AKT2 selectively, and look to target WDR26 as a way to disrupt the PI3KÎ²-AKT2 signaling axis. Such approaches may offer advantages over the inhibition of individual PI3K isoforms, which is expected to cause non-selective suppression of the activity of all AKT isoforms, and may also cause compensatory reactivation of others [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since inhibiting WDR26 blocks breast cancer cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic> and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, targeting WDR26 may also represent a novel approach for the treatment of both primary and metastatic tumors.</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrated that WDR26 is overexpressed in highly malignant breast cancer cells and patient samples, and upregulated WDR26 overactivates the GÎ²Î³-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway downstream of multiple GPCRs, promoting breast cancer cell growth, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, we showed WDR26 functions as a scaffolding protein to foster the interactions between GÎ²Î³, PI3KÎ² and AKT2, thereby promoting GÎ²Î³-mediated PI3K/AKT activation. Together, our results define an unknown mechanism of regulating GPCR-dependent activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis in breast tumor cells, and identify WDR26 as a potential novel target against breast cancer.</p>
