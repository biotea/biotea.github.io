          <p>We report here the localization of the ubiquitinated and phosphorylated active form of TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus after the stimulation of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) or Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3), due to TBK1 K63-linked ubiquitination on lysine residues 30 and 401. The ubiquitin-binding protein optineurin (OPTN) recruits ubiquitinated TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus, leading to the formation of complexes in which TBK1 is activated by <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation. Indeed, OPTN deficiency in various cell lines and primary cells impairs TBK1 targeting to the Golgi apparatus and its activation following RLR or TLR3 stimulation.

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The innate immune response is the first line of defense against microbial pathogens, including viruses. After infection, the replication of a virus within host cells generates molecular signatures known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The antiviral immune response is dependent on germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which sense the presence of viral nucleic acids and trigger a series of signaling pathways leading to the rapid production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNÎ±/IFNÎ²) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Once secreted, type I IFNs stimulate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes to prevent the virus from spreading and to activate the adaptive immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The loss of type I IFN signaling leads to severe immunodeficiency with a high susceptibility to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>The various classes of PRRs involved in virus detection include endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytosolic DexD/H-box retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and cytosolic DNA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. All antiviral PRRs induce type I IFN expression, but the signaling components involved differ between PRRs. However, one common feature of all these signaling pathways is the recruitment of adaptor proteins to form a scaffold with the cellular ubiquitin ligases TRAFs. For instance, viral dsRNA in endosomes is detected by TLR3, whereas viral RNA in the cytosol is detected by RLRs, leading to the recruitment of TRIF and MAVS (this protein being anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane), respectively. With the assistance of TRAFs and through polyubiquitination, these two adaptors then activate two cytosolic protein kinase complexes, one consisting of the ânon-canonicalâ inhibitor of nuclear factor ÎºB kinase (IKK)-related TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or its close homolog IKKÎµ, associated with various adaptor proteins, and the other containing IKKÎ±, IKKÎ², and NEMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The IKK complex activates NF-ÎºB, promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and NF-ÎºB activation requires the degradation of cytoplasmic inhibitors. By contrast, the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 are directly activated in the cytoplasm through TBK1-mediated phosphorylation, leading to their dimerization, translocation to the nucleus and the initiation of type I IFN production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>TBK1 is a key regulator of type I IFN production. Indeed, the loss of TBK1 has a profound impact on type I IFN induction after viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. TBK1 is constitutively expressed and TBK1 deficiency is embryo-lethal, due to the occurrence of high levels of hepatic apoptosis, a phenotype very similar to that of IKKÎ²-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. TBK1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the serine 172 residue within the classical kinase activation loop. The mechanisms of TBK1 activation are not clearly understood. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition studies have indicated that TBK1 can be activated by IKKÎ² but that activation by <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation is more likely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Post-translational modifications of some lysine residues of TBK1 through the addition of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains have been shown to be required for TBK1 activation and type I IFN production after viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that TBK1 autoactivation is dependent on the subcellular location of TBK1, with various adaptor proteins each directing TBK1 to discrete signaling complexes for different cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>We report here the targeting of ubiquitinated TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus after RLR or TLR3 stimulation, through interaction with optineurin (OPTN), an ubiquitin-binding adaptor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. OPTN senses the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TBK1, triggering the formation of TBK1-OPTN complexes, in which TBK1 is activated by <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation. TBK1 then phosphorylates IRF3 to promote type I IFN production to establish an antiviral response. Interestingly, the Bluetongue virus NS3 protein neutralizes OPTN activity at the Golgi apparatus, thereby decreasing TBK1 activation and downstream signaling. Our observations thus reveal an unexpected new function of the Golgi apparatus in innate immunity.</p>

        <title>The active form of TBK1 localizes to the Golgi apparatus after RLR or TLR3 activation</title>
        <p>We recently reported that ubiquitinated transmitters involved in NF-ÎºB activation accumulate at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This raised questions as to whether some endomembranes might also act as sites of accumulation for ubiquitinated transmitters involved in activation of the transcription factor IRF3. To explore this hypothesis, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with Sendai virus to stimulate the RLR signaling pathway. Differential centrifugation was then used to separate the different membrane fractions, as indicated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A. With this approach, while a significant proportion of TBK1 was found in the cytosolic fraction (S25), unexpectedly, the ubiquitinated and phosphorylated active form of TBK1 (p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup>) was detected mostly in the Golgi-enriched fraction (P25), and this TBK1 activation was associated with the phosphorylation of its substrate IRF3 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Immunofluorescence confirmed that IRF3 was activated, as it was translocated to the nucleus after infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). TBK1 staining was not affected by RLR activation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), whereas p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> was detected at the Golgi apparatus (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B), but not at mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Similarly, the infection of HeLa cells with Sendai virus led to a detection of the active form of TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>AâE). TBK1<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs confirmed the specificity of the used antibody raised against p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) and, at later time points post-infection, we observed that the active form of TBK1 accumulates very close to the Golgi apparatus, at the centrosome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>D and E). Importantly, RLR activation promoted the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1, as previously reported (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Localization of the active form of TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus after RLR stimulation. <bold>a</bold> MEFs were either left unstimulated or infected with Sendai virus (SeV) for 6 or 8Â h. MEFs were then fractionated as described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A, and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins. EEA1, kinectin, LAMP2, GAPDH, syntaxin-6, and VDAC served as loading and purity controls for endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, the cytosol, the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria, respectively.

The indicated proteins were then analyzed by immunofluorescence.

On the right, enlargement of the framed zone in the overlay. <bold>f</bold> WT or TBK1<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs were either left unstimulated (control) or infected with SeV for 6Â h (+ SeV). p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> staining was then analyzed by immunofluorescence. The Golgi apparatus was stained with an antibody raised against GM130. Scale bars, 10Â Î¼m. <bold>g</bold> Crude heavy membrane fractions from uninfected or SeV-infected MEFs were fractionated on OptiPrep density gradients (fractions range from 1 at the top to 4 at the bottom) and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins. (Ub)n, polyubiquitin. <bold>h</bold> Increased concentrations of mitochondria (P5) or Golgi (P25)-enriched fractions of unstimulated (Unst) or SeV-infected HEK293T cells were incubated with recombinant GST-IRF3 in the presence of ATP. The degree of IRF3 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12915_2016_292_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>For further confirmation of the presence of the active form of TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus after RLR stimulation, cell fractions from control or infected cells were separated on Optiprep gradients to yield fractions enriched in Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondria. Unmodified TBK1 was detected in multiple fractions, whereas the ubiquitinated and phosphorylated protein was essentially limited to fractions enriched in the Golgi protein syntaxin-6 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> was also detected, using discontinuous density gradients, in Golgi membranes isolated from Sendai virus-infected cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Finally, to demonstrate that the active form of TBK1 was mostly located at the Golgi apparatus but not at the mitochondria after RLR stimulation, increased concentrations of mitochondria- (P5) or Golgi-enriched (P25) fractions of control or Sendai virus-infected cells were incubated with recombinant IRF3 in the presence of ATP. The mitochondria-enriched fraction of infected cells triggered the phosphorylation of recombinant IRF3, but this phosphorylation was significantly weaker than that observed with the Golgi-enriched fraction, in which most of the p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> was found (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). Our results are consistent with the reports that TBK1 does not sediment in the high molecular weight fractions together with the prion-like aggregates of MAVS at the mitochondria in response to Sendai virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>Within the endosomes, viral dsRNA is detected by TLR3, and the activation of this PRR leads to TBK1 activation after recruitment of the TRIF adaptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether active TBK1 was also found at the Golgi apparatus after TLR3 stimulation. HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged TLR3 were stimulated with poly(I:C), an analog of viral dsRNA, and then differential centrifugation was performed to separate the various membrane fractions, as in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A. As observed after RLR stimulation, the ubiquitinated and phosphorylated active form of TBK1 was mostly present in the Golgi-enriched fraction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the presence of active TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus but not at the endosomes after TLR3 stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). Optiprep gradients further demonstrated that p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> was concentrated in the Golgi-enriched fraction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and that this fraction could phosphorylate recombinant IRF3 in vitro (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).

        <title>Potent RLR activation triggers TBK1 targeting and aggregation at the Golgi apparatus</title>
        <p>After RLR stimulation, TBK1 activation is initiated at the mitochondria through the essential adaptor MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, active TBK1 was detected at the Golgi apparatus following Sendai virus infection suggesting the targeting of TBK1 to this organelle.

Interestingly, transfection with low- or high-molecular weight poly(I:C) for 2Â hours triggered a TBK1 aggregation at the Golgi apparatus (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

        <p>Following our detection of ubiquitinated active TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus, we hypothesized that the targeting of TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus might be impaired in the absence of ubiquitination. We tested this hypothesis by reconstituting TBK1<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs with WT or mutant TBK1 constructs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), and then investigating TBK1 aggregation after transfection with poly(I:C). Stimulation triggered TBK1 aggregation in cells reconstituted with WT TBK1, but this aggregation was significantly impaired with the K30R/K401R polyubiquitination mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). In parallel, the expression of the IRF3 target gene <italic>IFNB1</italic> was analyzed. Transfection with poly(I:C) increased <italic>IFNB1</italic> mRNA levels in cells reconstituted with WT TBK1, but this response was abolished with the polyubiquitination mutant (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We also reconstituted TBK1<sup>â/â</sup> MEFs with the kinase-inactive mutant. TBK1 aggregation was unaffected (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), but the transcriptional response was completely inhibited (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Thus, TBK1 polyubiquitination on conserved lysines 30 and 401 targets TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus in a process linked to the phosphorylation of the Ser172 residue in the kinase activation loop after dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

        <title>OPTN is required for optimal TBK1 activation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation</title>
        <p>A structural study has also suggested that the binding of polyubiquitin chains triggers the higher-order oligomerization of TBK1-adaptor complexes, resulting in the <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As observed after RLR or TLR3 stimulation, the ubiquitinated and phosphorylated active form of TBK1 was detected at the Golgi apparatus. This suggested that an adaptor of ubiquitinated TBK1 was present at this organelle to promote the activation of TBK1. We identified optineurin (OPTN) as a likely candidate for this role. Indeed, this protein has an ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) and a C-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (ZF), and is located at the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It has also been reported to be required for optimal TBK1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Immunofluorescence studies with three different antibodies against OPTN confirmed that a part of this protein is located at the Golgi apparatus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>A), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, OPTN was also detected in isolated Golgi membranes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>C).

        <p>We then carried out assays on HEK293T cells with a luciferase reporter under the control of the IFNÎ² promoter or driven by three copies of an NF-ÎºB enhancer. We found that stimulation of the IFNÎ² promoter after RLR activation is impaired in cells in which OPTN expression was knocked down with two different siRNAs, whereas NF-ÎºB activation was unaffected (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). These results were confirmed with three other OPTN siRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>A). As a control, NEMO expression was knocked down, as this protein activates both the NF-ÎºB and IRF signaling pathways downstream from MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and its loss inhibited both pathways (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Biochemical studies in both HEK293T and HeLa cells confirmed that transfection with siRNAs against OPTN impairs TBK1 activation and subsequent signaling after RLR stimulation, but has no effect on the NF-ÎºB and ERK pathways (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>B and C). The infection of OPTN siRNA-transfected cells with another RNA virus, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus, to activate the RLRs, yielded similar results (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>D and E). Similarly, OPTN silencing in MEFs impaired TBK1 activation and IRF3 phosphorylation without altering NF-ÎºB or ERK signaling after Sendai virus infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Importantly, TBK1 aggregation at the Golgi apparatus after poly(I:C) transfection was prevented by the silencing of OPTN (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). This suggests that OPTN senses ubiquitinated TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus and promotes its activation, because the ubiquitination of TBK1 is required for its targeting to this organelle (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
        <p>OPTN expression was also abolished with CRISPR/Cas9 technology in HeLa cells and the cells were then infected with Sendai virus. As expected, the IRF3 signaling pathway was decreased in OPTN knockout cells, whereas the NF-ÎºB and ERK pathways were not (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Consequently, smaller amounts of IFNÎ² were produced and secreted, but no effect was observed on the NF-ÎºB target IL-6 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5fâi</xref>). Finally, the lack of OPTN did not affect the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 after RLR stimulation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p>
        <p>As ubiquitinated active TBK1 was uncovered at the Golgi apparatus after TLR3 stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), we also explored the possible involvement of OPTN in TBK1 activation downstream from this PRR. Hence, an increased association between OPTN and TBK1 was detected after TLR3 stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>). We then silenced OPTN, and both luciferase assays and immunoblots showed that knocking down the levels of this protein selectively inhibited the IRF3 signaling pathway (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k, l</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>F).</p>

        <title>OPTN insufficiency impairs TBK1 activation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation in primary cells</title>
        <p>For further confirmation of the requirement of OPTN for TBK1 activation, we used primary cells from mice in which both the UBD and ZF domains of OPTN had been deleted (OPTN<sup>470T</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The truncated protein was produced in smaller amounts than the WT protein, allowing to investigate the effects of both defective Ub binding and OPTN insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. First, primary MEFs were infected with Sendai virus. OPTN<sup>470T</sup> MEFs displayed weaker TBK1 activation than WT MEFs, together with lower levels of phosphorylation of IRF3, with no effect on ERK or NF-ÎºB signaling (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

During the course of pathogenâhost co-evolution, viruses have acquired an ability to inhibit the innate immune response by targeting host proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our results suggested that OPTN is important for TBK1 activation after RLR or TLR3 activation. We therefore hypothesized that there might be viral proteins capable of neutralizing the activity of OPTN, thereby preventing it from performing its function in innate immunity.</p>
        <p>Non-structural protein 3 (NS3) of the Bluetongue virus, a dsRNA virus, has been localized to the Golgi apparatus and shown to specifically modulate the type I IFN signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We confirmed that NS3 expression led to the detection of this protein at the Golgi apparatus (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>) and that, in luciferase assays, NS3 affected the stimulation of the IFNÎ² promoter but not NF-ÎºB activation after RLR stimulation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Accordingly, NS3 expression decreased the phosphorylation of both TBK1 and IRF3 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). As NS3 was targeted to the Golgi apparatus and decreased TBK1 activation, we then hypothesized that NS3 binds to OPTN to prevent it from activating TBK1. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that NS3 binds to OPTN (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>) and, in cells expressing NS3, the association between OPTN and TBK1 was impaired after viral infection (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>), accounting for the lower levels of TBK1 activation observed (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Finally, TBK1 aggregation was inhibited in the presence of the viral protein, confirming its ability to neutralize the activity of OPTN (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Thus, the fact that OPTN is targeted by a viral protein to dampen type I IFN signaling reinforces our findings that OPTN is an important effector in TBK1 activation.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>OPTN is targeted by the NS3 protein of the Bluetongue virus to dampen IRF3 signaling. <bold>a</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding NS3-GFP; 16Â h later, the NS3-GFP localization was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Viral RNAs in endosomes are detected by TLR3, whereas those in the cytosol are detected by RLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The stimulation of either of these PRRs leads to TBK1 activation and this kinase plays a crucial role in innate antiviral immunity through the phosphorylation of IRF3, which is required for the production of type I IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying TBK1 activation are unclear. Surprisingly, after the stimulation of cells with IL-1Î² or TNFÎ±, after mitophagy induction or in cancer dependent on KRAS signaling, TBK1 is phosphorylated whereas IRF3 is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It has been therefore suggested that TBK1 autoactivation and substrate specificity are both dependent on the subcellular distribution of TBK1, with various adaptor proteins each directing TBK1 to discrete signaling complexes for different cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the active form of TBK1 is present at the Golgi apparatus after the stimulation of RLRs or TLR3, and that its substrate, IRF3, is phosphorylated. In the case of mitophagy, p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> is recruited to depolarized mitochondria without IRF3 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. No significant accumulation of active TBK1 was detected at the Golgi apparatus after the treatment of cells with IL-1Î² or TNFÎ± (data not shown), further suggesting that the presence of p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> at the Golgi apparatus is a prerequisite for the phosphorylation of IRF3 by this kinase.</p>
      <p>A recent study has elegantly demonstrated that the adaptor proteins MAVS and TRIF (but also STING) harbor conserved domains that are phosphorylated by IKKÎ² and/or TBK1 in response to stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Phosphorylated adaptor then binds to a positively charged surface of IRF3, thereby recruiting this transcription factor for its phosphorylation and activation by TBK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. While localized at the Golgi apparatus, active TBK1 does have the possibility to phosphorylate either MAVS or TRIF to promote IRF3 recruitment and ensuing activation of this transcription factor. Indeed, mitochondria (where MAVS anchors) and endosomes (where TRIF is recruited after TLR3 stimulation) through their dynamics or through their trafficking, respectively, are always in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus therefore permitting TBK1 to phosphorylate the adaptor proteins, a process required for IRF3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. IFR3 phosphorylation around the Golgi apparatus, an organelle bordering the nucleus where this transcription factor migrates after activation, therefore reduces the possibility of IRF3 to meet phosphatases or E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate signaling.</p>
      <p>A K63-linked polyubiquitination on lysines 30 and 401 is required in the process of TBK1 activation to permit this kinase to phosphorylate IRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our demonstration that this ubiquitination leads to the targeting of TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus for activation suggests that the ubiquitination sites of TBK1 (this kinase possesses more than 50 lysine residues conserved between humans and mice) might affect the subcellular distribution of this protein and the resulting signaling. It would be interesting to determine whether TBK1 is ubiquitinated after mitochondrial depolarization and, if so, on which lysine residues, for its targeting and activation at the mitochondria for mitophagy, as recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>One key finding of this study is that ubiquitinated TBK1 is sensed by OPTN at the Golgi apparatus, promoting its <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation. The binding of the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TBK1 to the UBD of OPTN probably triggers the oligomerization of TBK1-OPTN complexes, resulting in <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation and TBK1 activation, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). OPTN therefore appears to be a positive regulator of TBK1 activation through its polyubiquitin binding activity, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, two other studies have suggested that OPTN negatively regulates TBK1 activation after RNA virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We currently have no explanation for this discrepancy. Indeed, OPTN silencing with multiple siRNAs in HEK293T, HeLa cells, or MEFs, and OPTN knockout with CRISPR/Cas9 technology in HeLa cells, MEFs, and BMDMs from OPTN-deficient mice clearly demonstrated an important role of this adaptor in TBK1 activation after RLR and TLR3 stimulation. Consistent with the involvement of OPTN in TBK1 activation, it has recently been reported that OPTN, again through its polyubiquitin binding activity, is required for TBK1 activation in response to mitochondrial depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, during the preparation of this manuscript, a study reported that osteoclast precursors from OPTN mutant mice produced abnormally low levels of IFNÎ² in response to RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Additionally, another study reported that BMDM from OPTN<sup>â/â</sup> mice displayed impaired IRF signaling and low levels of type I IFN production in response to poly(I:C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Finally, further evidence for the involvement of OPTN in TBK1 activation is provided by our finding that the NS3 protein of the Bluetongue virus targets OPTN at the Golgi apparatus, decreasing TBK1 activation and the resulting IRF3 signaling. Thus, this RNA virus prevents OPTN from activating TBK1 as part of a strategy to modulate the innate immune response to facilitate its replication after infection. Consistent with this finding, other viruses have evolved strategies for targeting the adaptor proteins involved in TBK1 activation. The Vaccinia virus protein C6 binds TBK1 adaptor proteins (TANK, NAP1, and SINTBAD), thereby inhibiting the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the Gn protein of hantaviruses disrupts the formation of TBK1 complexes, thereby blocking downstream responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>In addition to acting as a sensor for ubiquitinated TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus for the kinase activation, OPTN has also been reported to be a substrate of TBK1. Indeed, phosphorylation of the Ser177 residue of OPTN by TBK1 increases the association of OPTN with LC3 during xenophagy for the clearance of cytosolic <italic>Salmonella</italic> and the restriction of intracellular bacterial proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Two independent studies have reported that RNA polymerase III detects DNA of viral or bacterial origin in the cytoplasm and induces type I IFNs via the RLR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It therefore seems possible that stimulation of the RLR pathway after bacterial infection promotes TBK1 activation by OPTN at the Golgi apparatus and that, on the one hand, p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> triggers the production of type I IFNs and, on the other, the active kinase phosphorylates OPTN to induce the xenophagy of the invading bacteria.</p>
      <p>OPTN is associated to Golgi apparatus through an interaction with Rab8 and the interacting domain of OPTN is localized between amino acids 141â209, comprising therefore Ser177 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. After TBK1 activation, the phosphorylation of OPTN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] may disrupt the association between OPTN and Rab8, therefore allowing TBK1-OPTN complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] to leave the Golgi membranes to phosphorylate MAVS or TRIF at the mitochondria or endosomes, respectively, for IRF3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our observation that p-TBK1<sup>S172</sup> accumulates at the centrosome at late time points after RLR activation strongly suggests that the active kinase is released from the Golgi membranes after its initial <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation at this organelle.</p>
      <p>Other adaptors, such as NAP1 or SINTBAD, have been reported to be involved in TBK1 activation during innate antiviral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We found that, like OPTN, both NAP1 and SINTBAD were partially localized at the Golgi apparatus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>C), providing further evidence for a critical role of this organelle in TBK1 signaling during innate immunity. Further studies are required to determine whether and how these adaptors act in concert at the Golgi apparatus to promote TBK1 activation. Indeed, the weak but nevertheless present, IFN-Î² response in OPTN-deficient cells suggests that factors other than OPTN contribute to TBK1 activity.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>At the Golgi apparatus, we propose that, after RNA viral sensing, OPTN recruits ubiquitinated TBK1 via its UBD, leading to the <italic>trans</italic>-autoactivation of this kinase for the production of type I IFNs after IRF3 phosphorylation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Our recent report that the Golgi-anchored E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF121 is a new player in the signaling leading to NF-ÎºB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] suggests that the Golgi apparatus, in addition to its other known roles, acts as a hub for the formation and/or maturation of signalosomes, leading to activation of the IRF3 and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. It remains to be determined whether other signaling pathways are relayed by the Golgi apparatus.</p>
