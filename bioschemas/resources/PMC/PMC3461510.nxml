        <p>Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein binds to and stabilizes CIITA at PML nuclear bodies, which promotes expression of the MHC class II gene locus in response to interferon-Î³ exposure.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies selectively associate with transcriptionally active genomic regions, including the gene-rich major histocompatibility (MHC) locus. In this paper, we have explored potential links between PML and interferon (IFN)-Î³âinduced MHC class II expression. IFN-Î³ induced a substantial increase in the spatial proximity between PML bodies and the MHC class II gene cluster in different human cell types. Knockdown experiments show that PML is required for efficient IFN-Î³âinduced MHC II gene transcription through regulation of the class II transactivator (CIITA). PML mediates this function through protection of CIITA from proteasomal degradation. We also show that PML isoform II specifically forms a stable complex with CIITA at PML bodies. These observations establish PML as a coregulator of IFN-Î³âinduced MHC class II expression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, also known as the PML oncogenic domain or ND 10 (nuclear domain 10), are multiprotein subnuclear structures that were first observed 50 yr ago by electron microscopy as nuclear-dense granular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de ThÃ© et al., 1960</xref>). PML bodies are present in cell nuclei of almost all human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gambacorta et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 1998</xref>). Usually, nuclei of cultured cells contain â¼5â30 PML bodies, ranging in size from â¼0.2 to 1 Âµm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascoli and Maul, 1991</xref>). It has been suggested that PML bodies act as dynamic nuclear organizing centers for the coordinated regulation of different cellular functions, including DNA damage response, apoptosis, senescence, and antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sternsdorf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Negorev and Maul, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007</xref>). This variety of functions may be attributable to regulated traffic at PML bodies of a selected number of nuclear proteins, which play key roles in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boisvert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wiesmeijer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weidtkamp-Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brand et al., 2010</xref>). Six nuclear PML isoforms sharing the same N terminus but containing variable C termini generated by alternative splicing have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fagioli et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>) and are present at all PML bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Condemine et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because components of the ubiquitinâproteasome and SUMO pathways accumulate in or adjacent to a subset of PML bodies, they have also been proposed as sites of specific protein turnover within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fabunmi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lallemand-Breitenbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rockel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saitoh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scharf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). The expression of the PML gene and other genes encoding PML body components is strongly increased by interferons (IFNs) in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, PML isoforms and PML bodies have also been implicated in IFN response and immune surveillance pathways, including antiviral responses and inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Terris et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tavalai and Stamminger, 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>According to a recently curated PML body interactome, 166 different proteins can be physically and/or functionally linked to PML. Strikingly, one half of these factors are involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van Damme et al., 2010</xref>). Many transcription factors transiently associate with PML bodies, in which their activity is modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). This may result in either activation or repression of specific genes, depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhong et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, sites of nascent mRNA transcription and transcriptionally active specific genomic loci were found to be associated with the periphery of PML bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grande et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boisvert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Mikecz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">FuchsovÃ¡ et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">KieÃlich et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie and Pombo, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Most cell types do not express major histocompatibility (MHC) II genes constitutively, but their expression can be stimulated by IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 1984</xref>). The MHC II expression pattern is controlled primarily by transcriptional regulation at the conserved MHC II gene promoters. The MHC II enhanceosome contains the constitutively expressed transcription factors regulatory factor X (RFX), nuclear factor-Y, and cAMP response element binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). MHC II gene expression is completely dependent on the expression of the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), which is recruited in a coactivator-like fashion to the MHC II promoters through proteinâprotein interactions with RFX, cAMP response element binding protein, and nuclear factor-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steimle et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reith et al., 2005</xref>). CIITA expression is induced by IFN-Î³ through the Janus kinase (JAK)âsignal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and expression of exogenous CIITA is sufficient to induce MHC class II expression in many different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiels et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al. (2004)</xref> have previously demonstrated a highly nonrandom spatial association of the MHC locus with PML bodies, raising the hypothesis that PML (bodies) may be directly involved in transcriptional regulation of selectively associated genes. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al. (2010)</xref> have found that the MHC II gene <italic>DRA</italic> relocates to PML bodies upon induction with IFN-Î³ and that PML protein isoform IV may function to maintain a sustained transcription-permissive epigenetic state of the <italic>DRA</italic> gene. Here, we analyze potential functional relationships between PML (nuclear bodies) and CIITA-dependent MHC class II gene expression.</p>

        <title>IFN-Î³ increases the spatial proximity between PML bodies and the MHC II gene cluster</title>
        <p>IFN-Î³ induces a stable relocation of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II <italic>DRA</italic> gene to PML bodies in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we confirm and extend these observations for HEp-2 cells, the primary human lung fibroblast line MRC-5, and primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) using a MHC IIâspecific FISH probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To quantify the spatial proximity between PML bodies and the MHC II gene cluster, we assessed the frequency of lacking association (no contact), association (contact), and colocalization (considerable overlap) between the two signals in confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The definition colocalization included both considerable overlap and complete colocalization. This approach revealed an increase of association and colocalization events between PML bodies and the MHC II probe in HEp-2, MRC-5, and HFF after IFN-Î³ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Quantification was based on the MHC II signal closest to the next PML body. However, the second MHC class II signal was also associated or colocalized with the PML body signal in &gt;80% of MRC-5 cells or HFF in which the first signal was already associated or colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, white circles; and not depicted). We also calculated the theoretical probability for random associations between PML bodies and the MHC class II signals by applying a self-developed algorithm that considers nuclear volume and number and size of objects in the nucleus. The probabilities for random signal overlap varied between 0.30 and 0.59% in MRC-5 and 4.48 and 8.77% in HEp-2 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201112015/DC1" id="supp1">Table S1</ext-link>) and were thus substantially lower than the measured values. Centromeric chromatin of chromosome 6 was not in spatial proximity to PML bodies, although IFN-Î³ induced a low degree of nonrandom signal overlap in HFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Currently, we have no explanation for this phenomenon. It might be related to a dynamic, cell cycleâregulated connection between centromeres and PML bodies as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Everett et al., 1999</xref>). To exclude that elevated numbers of PML bodies after IFN-Î³ treatment caused random proximity between PML bodies and genomic regions, we determined the association frequency between PML bodies and centromeres in MRC-5 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Although the number of PML bodies increased three- to fourfold during IFN-Î³ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), there was no increase of their signal overlap rate with the centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Signal overlap events between PML bodies and centromeres in IFN-Î³âtreated HEp-2 cells, or HFFs never exceeded 1 or 2%, respectively (unpublished data). The latter result appears to be contradictory to the data for HFF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, in which PML bodies were not found to be in close proximity to the centromere 6 region. Although we have no ready explanation for this phenomenon, the discrepancy might be explained by using HFFs from different population doublings. Despite this inconsistency, it is safe to conclude that IFN-Î³ specifically induces an increase of the spatial proximity between the MHC II gene cluster and PML bodies in HEp-2 cells as well as in primary human lung and skin fibroblasts.</p>

Fluorescence signals were acquired from the entire nuclear volume by confocal sectioning. Images display projections of the z stacks. Association was defined as touching or âkissingâ of the red and the green signal, whereas colocalization displayed a considerable overlap indicated by yellow color. This definition was only applied to single confocal sections from the image stacks. Adjacent signals without touching were not scored. In the majority of primary fibroblasts (&gt;80%) with association or colocalization events, the second MHC II signal was also found in the vicinity of a PML body (white circles). Insets show enlarged views of the areas indicated by white rectangles. Bars: (main images) 5 Âµm; (insets) 1 Âµm. (B) HEp-2, MRC-5, and HFFs were double labeled as described in A to detect either the MHC class II gene locus or the centromere 6 sequence. Association and colocalization events were scored as described in A. Bars show mean values in percentages from four independent experiments with <italic>n</italic> = 200 cells each. Standard deviation (not depicted) was in all cases &lt;12% of the mean value. (CâE) Up-regulation of PML does not increase the association frequency between nuclear bodies and centromeres. Untreated and IFN-Î³âtreated MRC-5 cells were stained with anti-PML and anticentromere (Cen) antibodies. DNA was stained with DAPI.

        <title>PML is required for efficient IFN-Î³âinduced MHC II expression</title>
        <p>To investigate whether PML plays a role in MHC II expression, HFF stably expressing control or PML small hairpin RNA (shRNA) were treated with IFN-Î³, and MHC II expression was monitored at different time points by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using monoclonal antibodies against various class II proteins. In the presence of PML, IFN-Î³âinduced expression of HLA-DR/DP/DQ became visible after 24 h, and after 48 h, most cells were positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Coimmunostaining with anti-PML antibodies confirmed an IFN-Î³âinduced increase in the number of nuclear bodies. In contrast, cells expressing the PML-specific shRNA had no PML bodies and showed a strongly reduced induction of class II molecule expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). A similar result was obtained in HEp-2 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201112015/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Quantification revealed that the number of MHC IIâpositive cells was diminished by a factor of â¼4 in HFF in the absence of PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). To determine whether PML depletion interferes with MHC II expression at the transcript level, RT-PCR was performed. As expected, <italic>CIITA</italic> and <italic>MHC II</italic> mRNAs were undetectable in unstimulated cells. Transcription of IFN-Î³âstimulated genes within the MHC II locus, including <italic>TAP1</italic>, <italic>LMP7</italic>, and MHC II antigens <italic>DRA</italic> and <italic>DMB</italic>, was clearly detected after 24 h of IFN-Î³ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). <italic>TAP1</italic> is activated by IFN-Î³ but not via CIITA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wright, et al., 1998</xref>). LMP7 expression appears to be regulated by CIITA-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Londhe et al., 2012</xref>). Depletion of CIITA strongly diminished IFN-Î³âinduced transcription of the MHC II genes but not of <italic>TAP1</italic> or <italic>LMP7</italic>. Importantly, IFN-Î³âinduced MHC II mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in PML-depleted HFFs, whereas transcription of <italic>TAP1</italic> and the MHC class I gene <italic>HLA-F</italic> was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Interestingly, expression of <italic>LMP7</italic> mRNA was up-regulated twofold in PML-depleted cells, which may be explained by PML-mediated selective gene regulation within the MHC class I cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that down-regulation of PML leads to a decrease in IFN-Î³âinduced MHC II molecule expression at the transcriptional level.</p>

        <title>PML regulates CIITA mainly at the posttranslational level</title>
        <p>MHC class II mRNA expression is quantitatively dependent on the amount of CIITA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otten et al., 1998</xref>). CIITA was up-regulated by IFN-Î³ at concentrations as low as 10 U/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), and induction peaked between 6 and 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4 B</xref>). By Western blotting, various PML isoforms were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, lane 1). IFN-Î³ induced up-regulation of all PML-specific bands with similar efficiency, indicating no increase of particular PML protein products through IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, lanes 2, 4, and 5). The IFN-Î³âinduced CIITA protein level was reduced to 59 Â± 11% in HEp-2 cells, in which PML was down-regulated by siRNA to 13 Â± 6% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Down-regulation of CIITA had no effect on PML protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). SP100, another constitutive IFN-Î³âinducible PML body component, was also efficiently depleted in HEp-2 cells using specific siRNA, but this had no effect on the CIITA protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In HFFs stably expressing shRNAs against PML, the amount of PML protein is reduced to a very low level (3.4 Â± 0.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Under these conditions, the CIITA protein level decreased to 41 Â± 15% compared with control shRNA-treated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Consistent with published data, we also found a reduction of the Sp100 level in PML knockdown fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Everett et al., 2006</xref>). We also analyzed the protein level of RFX5 and NFY-C, two of the constitutive components of the MHC II enhanceosome. This showed that PML depletion has no effect on the protein amount of these factors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201112015/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S2</ext-link>), suggesting that PML knockdown does not result in reduced protein levels of all components of the MHC II enhanceosome.</p>

The allocation of PML isoforms and SUMOylated isoforms was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Condemine et al. (2006)</xref>. The data were obtained by loading samples on two large-well gels (one including the samples shown in lanes 1 and 2 and the other including the samples shown in lanes 3â5), transferring the gels to a membrane, cutting the membrane section for each sample into equal-sized strips, and probing of these strips in parallel for the indicated antibodies.

(D) PML isoform II is more efficient than other isoforms to stabilize CIITA at the protein level. HEp-2 cells were cotransfected with constant amounts of vector GFP-CIITA (300 ng) and increasing amounts (100, 300, and 600 ng) of vectors encoding RFP-tagged PML isoforms as indicated. Plasmid DNA concentration was kept constant by adding GFP control vector to a final amount of 1 Âµg. Western blots of whole-cell lysates from transfected cells were probed with anti-GFP, anti-RFP, and antiâÎ³-tubulin antibodies as indicated. Tubulin serves as a loading control for the GFP-CIITA data, whereas the band at 72 kD on the RFP-PML isoform blot is a cross-reacting band that serves as an internal control for equal loading. (E) Overexpressed RFP does not result in stabilization of GFP-CIITA at the protein level. HEp-2 cells were cotransfected with constant amounts of vector GFP-CIITA and increasing amounts of vectors encoding RFP alone or the RFPâPML I isoform as described for D. Western blots of whole cell lysates from transfected cells were probed with anti-GFP, anti-RFP, and antiâÎ³-tubulin antibodies as indicated. (F) PML depletion renders CIITA more sensitive to protein degradation. shControl- and shPML-expressing cells were treated with 20 Âµ/ml IFN-Î³ for 12 h to induce expression of endogenous CIITA.

        <p>Next, we asked at which level PML might regulate the CIITA protein amount. IFN-Î³ induces transcription of the CIITA gene through the JAKâStat pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 1999</xref>). Because it was demonstrated recently that PML depletion leads to reduced STAT1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El Bougrini et al., 2011</xref>), we tested whether <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA expression is affected through the JAKâSTAT signaling pathway. Although overall STAT1 levels remained unchanged during the first 2 h of IFN-Î³ activation, phosphorylation of STAT1 at Serine 727 and Tyrosine 701 was reduced in PML-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). These results confirm and extend previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El Bougrini et al., 2011</xref>). At later time points (6â48 h), IFN-Î³ induced an up-regulation of STAT1, which was similar in shControl and shPML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This observation suggests that the IFN-Î³ activation site/IFN-stimulated response elementâdependent activation of the <italic>STAT1</italic> gene is independent of PML. However, the CIITA protein amount was higher between 6 and 36 h of IFN-Î³ stimulation in cells proficient for PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The increase in CIITA level was accompanied by a subsequent induction of HLA-DR protein expression, which was clearly reduced in shPML cells compared with shControl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Measuring the <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA level showed that the PML status of cells is directly linked to the induction of <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA in the early response to IFN-Î³ stimulation for â¤3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). This observation shows that PML regulates transcription of the <italic>CIITA</italic> gene by modulating the early STAT1 phosphorylation level. However, between 6 and 24 h after IFN-Î³ stimulation, the <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA level was not significantly different in PML-proficient and -deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). It is during this period of time that the lack of PML leads to decreased protein level of CIITA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, blot CIITA, compare lanes 2â4 with lanes 8â10). This strongly suggested that PML stabilizes CIITA at the posttranscriptional level, in addition to its early regulatory effect on <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA transcription via the JAKâSTAT pathway.</p>
        <p>To test whether PML can regulate the stability of CIITA, we performed cotransfection experiments. When constant amounts of the GFP-CIITA plasmid were cotransfected with increasing amounts of RFP-tagged PML isoforms, expression of GFP-CIITA was increased in a PML-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). PML isoforms I to IV induced increased expression of GFP-CIITA, with PML isoform II yielding the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). This result was obtained in three independent assays (unpublished data). Increased expression of RFP alone resulted in a decrease of the amount of GFP-CIITA indicating that PML and not RFP or increased plasmid concentration is responsible for the observed effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). CIITA has a short half-life caused by rapid proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schnappauf et al., 2003</xref>). This allowed us to test whether PML also stabilizes CIITA at the endogenous level. The protein amount of CIITA was analyzed at various time points in cycloheximide-treated cells. This approach revealed rapid disappearance of the CIITA protein band within 2 h in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). The decrease of the CIITA protein level after cycloheximide was stronger in PML-depleted fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Quantitation of signals confirmed that degradation of CIITA was significantly stronger in cells lacking PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). These data demonstrate that also at the endogenous level, PML can regulate the amount of CIITA through protection from degradation.</p>

        <title>CIITA forms a complex with PML isoform II at nuclear bodies</title>
        <p>We then analyzed CIITA distribution in the nucleus in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). All anti-CIITA antibodies tested in this study resulted in a cellular background immunofluorescence staining pattern even without IFN-Î³ treatment and IFN-Î³ induced only a slight increase of the anti-CIITA immunofluorescence signals (unpublished data). These observations indicated that the epitopes recognized by these antibodies are only partially accessible. We therefore tested several different established immunofluorescence protocols to find conditions, which result in more accessible epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guillot et al., 2004</xref>). This approach showed that only those protocols, which included a prepermeabilization step produced specific anti-CIITA immunofluorescence staining in IFN-Î³âtreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and not depicted). When cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 before fixation, endogenous CIITA was found in a dotlike pattern in the nucleus in addition to a microspeckled diffuse distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The dotlike pattern of CIITA completely colocalized with PML bodies, showing that a subpopulation of endogenous CIITA resides at PML bodies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201112015/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S3</ext-link>). We therefore conclude that epitopes recognized by the anti-CIITA antibody used here are inaccessible in normally fixed PML bodies but become accessible by detergent treatment before fixation. The same method did not lead to accumulation at PML nuclear bodies of the unrelated protein Bcl-x (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To circumvent the limitations of anti-CIITA antibody staining, we used GFP-tagged CIITA. Expression of GFP-CIITA induced a dose-dependent expression of MHC class II genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201112015/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S4 A</ext-link>). Thus, the GFP-CIITA fusion protein is functional, confirming our published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hake et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camacho-Carvajal et al., 2004</xref>). Within the nucleus, GFP-CIITA was distributed homogenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, left). Upon IFN-Î³ treatment, GFP-CIITA also accumulated in a dotlike pattern in the nucleus of some but not all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, right; and not depicted). The dots represented PML bodies as revealed by anti-PML coimmunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Coexpression experiments revealed that all PML isoforms colocalized with GFP-CIITA in the nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). The accumulation of GFP-CIITA in PML bodies varied with overexpression of different PML isoforms but appeared most efficient in cells coexpressing RFPâPML II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). We obtained similar results in PML knockout mouse fibroblasts transfected with the different PML isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Quantification demonstrated that RFPâPML II most efficiently attracted GFP-CIITA into nuclear bodies of HEp-2 cells. Because the same result was obtained in PML knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>), we conclude that the observed interaction is specific for PML isoform II. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to confirm complex formation. IFN-Î³âtreated HEp-2 cells were cotransfected with GFP-tagged CIITA and RFP-tagged PML isoform II. RFPâPML II was coimmunoprecipitated by GFP-CIITA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, blot 2, lane 4), and reciprocally, GFP-CIITA was coimmunoprecipitated by RFPâPML II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, blot 1, lane 7).

Another set of coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that GFP-CIITA most efficiently formed a complex with GFP-tagged PML II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, blots 2 and 3, lane 8).

        <p>FRAP was used to determine protein complex formation at PML nuclear bodies in living cells. GFP-CIITA fluorescence was bleached at PML nuclear bodies or within the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Fluorescence recovery of GFP-CIITA after the bleach pulse was rapid within the nucleoplasm as well as at PML bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Quantification of the FRAP data demonstrated that GFP-CIITA fluorescence recovered to â¼90% already after 5 s, and prebleach values were reached after 20 s in cells cotransfected with RFP-tagged PML isoform I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). This indicates that the complete pool of GFP-CIITA molecules exchanges rapidly at nuclear bodies and at chromatin.

        <p>In contrast, exchange of GFP-CIITA at PML bodies was substantially reduced in cells coexpressing RFPâPML II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). To quantify this difference, FRAP curves were fitted with exponential functions assuming two differently mobile GFP-CIITA populations as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hemmerich et al., 2008</xref>). The relative fractions and the recovery halftimes of GFP-CIITA in RFP-PMLâcoexpressing cells were determined from the two-component exponential fit functions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201112015/DC1" id="supp6">Table S2</ext-link>). The existence of at least two differently mobile fractions is consistent with previous analyses of transcription factor mobility in living cells. The initial fast recovery in FRAP experiments represents freely diffusing molecules, whereas the late phase of the FRAP curve is dominated by association/dissociation kinetics at chromatin. We determined the residence time of the slow exchanging population of GFP-CIITA from its exponential term of the fit function as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>). This approach revealed residence times of a few seconds for GFP-CIITA in chromatin as well as at nuclear bodies after cotransfection with RFP-tagged PML I and III to VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>, red bars). Similar results were obtained in IFN-Î³âtreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>, green bars). In contrast, the residence time of GFP-CIITA at nuclear bodies containing overexpressed RFPâPML II was 38 (Â±7) s, and this value increased to 226 (Â±22) s after IFN-Î³ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). These data confirm that CIITA can directly or indirectly interact with PML isoform II at nuclear bodies and that this interaction is strongly enhanced by IFN-Î³. All PML isoforms exchange at nuclear bodies with mean residence times of several minutes in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weidtkamp-Peters et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brand et al., 2010</xref>). We tested whether IFN-Î³ also had an effect on the exchange rate of PML II at nuclear bodies. Evaluation of the FRAP results indeed revealed that the exchange rate of GFPâPML II was decreased upon IFN-Î³ treatment compared with untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). The residence time of the slow exchanging fraction of GFPâPML II was decreased almost eightfold in the presence of IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>). Thus, the interaction between GFP-CIITA and RFPâPML II at nuclear bodies occurs on a hyperstable RFPâPML II scaffold to which GFP-CIITA can bind with residence times of several minutes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The MHC II gene cluster is subject to rapid and massive conformational and epigenetic changes upon IFN-Î³ treatment in cells without constitutive MHC class II molecule expression. IFN-Î³ treatment induces a rapid looping of the MHC gene cluster away from CT-6 followed by complete decondensation of the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Volpi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MÃ¼ller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco and Pombo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christova et al., 2007</xref>). Evidence for a direct role of PML bodies in transcriptional regulation of MHC II genes was recently established by the observation that the HLA class II <italic>DRA</italic> gene is specifically relocated to PML bodies in HeLa cells upon IFN-Î³ induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>). PML bodies were proposed in this study as coactivators of <italic>DRA</italic> transcription by maintaining H3K4me2 levels at the <italic>DRA</italic> gene promoter through complex formation between the K4 methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein and PML isoform IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we confirm that IFN-Î³ specifically evokes an increase of the spatial proximity between PML bodies and the MHC II gene cluster in human cells lines and extend these observations to primary human fibroblasts. We show for the first time that PML regulates IFN-Î³âinduced MHC II mRNA expression mainly through stabilization of the CIITA at the protein level. We also demonstrate that PML II, but no other PML isoform, forms a complex with CIITA at PML bodies. Our quantitative FRAP data indicate that the (overexpressed) PML IIâCIITA complex can be stabilized at PML bodies for several minutes by IFN-Î³. Compared with other isoforms, PML II also exhibited the strongest effect with respect to CIITA stabilization. These observations suggest that PML bodies may act as coregulators of IFN-Î³âinduced MHC II expression through a functional interaction between PML II and CIITA.</p>
      <p>There is accumulating evidence for transcriptional control of nuclear bodyâassociated genes through PML: During programmed in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells via neural precursor cells into postmitotic neurons, PML bodies are tightly associated with the <italic>Oct3/4</italic> locus when this gene is active in embryonic stem cells. Shut down of <italic>Oct3/4</italic> mRNA transcription in neural precursor cells and postmitotic neurons is directly correlated with the loss of contact between PML bodies and the <italic>OCT3/4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoto et al., 2006</xref>). A high association rate (50%) was also observed between PML bodies and the p53 gene in interphase Jurkat cells, but the functional relevance of this interaction was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2003</xref>). Specific associations of genomic regions with PML bodies has led to the idea that they act as anchoring points for specific chromatin regions, where they have a function analogous to that postulated for matrix attachment regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ching et al., 2005</xref>). This idea has been substantiated recently by the demonstration of the organization of the <italic>MHC class I</italic> locus into distinct higher-order chromatin loop structures based on the physical and functional interaction between PML and the matrix attachment regionâbinding protein SATB1. These studies indicated that a SATB1âPML body network intersects at the MHC I locus to coordinate expression of MHC I genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, it was shown that a CTCFâCIITAâRFX network complex mediates an IFN-Î³âinducible long-range interaction between <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>, <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic>, and the <italic>XL9</italic> enhancer positioned between these two MHC II genes. These interactions are believed to form 25- and 15-kb loop-type structures connecting the promoter regions of <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Majumder et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequently, the same group showed that CTCF is required for a structural reorganization of the complete MHC II locus into distinct loop structures in a CIITA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Majumder and Boss, 2010</xref>). However, endogenous CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacPherson et al., 2009</xref>) and GFP-tagged CTCF (our unpublished data) do not accumulate at PML bodies. The structural and functional relationship between CTCF-mediated loop formation and CIITAâPML-mediated transcriptional control of MHC II mRNA expression remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>The nonrandom close proximity between PML bodies and the MHC II cluster is not restricted to genomic subregions of this locus because FISH probes from different regions of the MHC II cluster are in similarly close proximity to PML bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiels et al., 2001</xref>). We also observed that in &gt;80% of IFN-Î³âtreated human fibroblasts showing a close proximity between a PML body with one MHC II allele, the second allele was also in close proximity to another PML body. MHC II genes are not subject to allelic exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Majumder and Boss, 2010</xref>). Because of the stochastic nature of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suter et al., 2011</xref>) and dynamic conformation changes of the activated MHC II genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MÃ¼ller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christova et al., 2007</xref>), its close proximity to PML bodies may be detected in only a fraction of cells at a given time. In addition, PML bodyâassociated genes within the <italic>MHC II</italic> locus are transcriptionally active as revealed by RNA FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) and quantitative PCR (qPCR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that PML bodies have no default transcription-repressive effect on genes in close proximity. Collectively, it is safe to say that PML bodies are in very close proximity to transcriptionally active MHC II genes in a considerable fraction of IFN-Î³âtreated cells. However, it should also be pointed out that a physical association between PML bodies and the MHC II locus is not an absolute requirement for MHC II gene transcription because cells without PML nuclear bodies still express detectable amounts of <italic>MHC II</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>) from which MHC II molecules are being translated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast to our study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al. (2004)</xref> did not detect differences in the expression level of genes in the proximity of PML bodies after PML knockdown. In the current study, we have specifically analyzed the expression of CIITA-dependent genes, which have not been investigated in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al. (2004)</xref> study. Therefore, the results obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al. (2004)</xref> cannot be directly compared with our findings. Furthermore, the PML knockdown in the Wang study yielded â¼50% of the cells without PML bodies, and a considerable amount of PML protein was still detected by Western blotting after siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). It cannot be fully excluded that the PML knockdown was not efficient enough to reveal a PML-mediated influence on the expression of the genes analyzed in this study.</p>
      <p>The transcription of <italic>MHC II</italic> genes is quantitatively controlled by the level of CIITA (Fig. S4 A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otten et al., 1998</xref>). We uncovered here that PML is able to modulate CIITA expression at the transcriptional level through the JAKâSTAT signaling pathway at an early time point (3 h) after IFN-Î³ induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Subsequently, there was no significant difference of the <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA level between control and PML knockdown cells. Because the protein half-life of CIITA is only â¼30 min as a result of rapid proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schnappauf et al., 2003</xref>), one can assume that the reduced <italic>CIITA</italic> mRNA level after 3 h of IFN-Î³ induction has only a little effect on the CIITA protein amount produced from mRNA during the 6â24-h interval. Consistent with the idea of a PML-mediated stabilization of CIITA at the protein level, we observed substantially reduced CIITA protein amounts in PML-depleted cells between 6 and 24 h after IFN-Î³ addition and increased degradation of endogenous CIITA in the absence of PML. These observations indicate that PML functions to protect CIITA from proteasomal degradation. In a similar fashion, PML also protects other nuclear factors, such as the transcription factors p53 and p73, and the DNA damage response protein TopBP1 from proteasomal degradation by sequestration into PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Louria-Hayon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernassola et al., 2004</xref>). This is solid evidence to suggest that one major function of PML bodies is stabilization of specific nuclear factors at the protein level.</p>
      <p>We have shown previously that GFPâPML II is stably bound to PML bodies with a mean residence time of 6.2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weidtkamp-Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brand et al., 2010</xref>). Because PML II is able to physically tether CIITA to PML bodies for several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), they might serve as a structural hub or surface at which CIITA is stabilized through protection from degradation. Currently, we do not know whether the IFN-Î³âinduced relocation of the MHC II gene cluster to PML bodies is functionally connected to the stabilization of CIITA. PML bodies may facilitate efficient assembly of CIITA into MHC II enhanceosome complexes, and the transcriptional activity of these complexes may be increased by more spatial proximity between MHC II genes and the nuclear bodies. This model is consistent with our observation that GFP-tagged RFX-AP, RFX-B, and NFYa can also bind to PML bodies and that a small but significant amount of MHC II promoter chromatin coimmunoprecipitates with endogenous PML (our unpublished data). Interestingly, IFN-Î³ also induced tighter binding of GFPâPML II to PML bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>), whereas exchange of GFPâPML V and GFPâPML VI was unaffected (not depicted). The IFN-Î³âinduced increased residence time of PML II at nuclear bodies may be one mechanism for prolonged retention and stabilization of CIITA at PML bodies. The activity of CIITA is regulated by PTMs, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). PML bodies are potential hot spots for such PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007</xref>). Acetylation of CIITA by CBP at K141 and K144, which up-regulates CIITA activity at MHC II promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spilianakis et al., 2000</xref>), could be mediated by the acetyltransferase CBP, which is also a PML body component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boisvert et al., 2001</xref>). It will be interesting to reveal which PML bodyâlocalized PTMs contribute to CIITA stability.</p>
      <p>The SATB1âPML, the MLLâPML IV, and the CIITAâPML II interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>; and this study, respectively) provide compelling evidence for a direct role of PML bodies in the transcriptional regulation of the human <italic>MHC</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiels et al., 2001</xref>). In all of these studies, specific PML isoforms were shown to contribute to transcriptional regulation of MHC genes. The underlying mechanisms share common features such as close proximity between the PML body and MHC genes, but they are clearly different in nature, including regulated chromatin loop formation (SATB1âPML), epigenetic marking (MLLâPML IV), and regulation of CIITA protein levels (CIITAâPML II). Future studies will further unravel the molecular details of how PML or the PML nuclear bodies participate in these multilevel mechanisms underlying the control of MHC molecule expression.</p>

For each precipitation, â¼25 Âµl GFP- or RFP-Trap bead slurry (ChromoTek) was equilibrated in washing buffer, added to the dilution, and incubated for â¼3 h with gentle end-over-end mixing at 4Â°C. After centrifugation (2 min at 2,700 <italic>g</italic> and 4Â°C) and discarding the supernatant, the beads were washed twice, resuspended in 50 Âµl SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min at 95Â°C.</p>

        <p>FRAP experiments were performed at 37Â°C in Hepes-buffered medium on a confocal microscope (LSM 710/ConfoCor3) essentially as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weidtkamp-Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brand et al., 2010</xref>), using a 63Ã oil objective (numerical aperture of 1.3) and ZEN software. 5â10 images were taken before the bleach pulse, and 50â200 images were taken after bleaching of regions of interest containing one nuclear body each at 0.05% laser transmission to minimize scan bleaching. Image acquisition frequency was adapted to the recovery rate of the respective GFP fusion protein. The pinhole was adjusted to 1 airy unit. Quantitation of relative fluorescence intensities was performed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weidtkamp-Peters et al. (2008)</xref> using Excel (Microsoft) and Origin software (OriginLab). Recovery halftimes and relative amounts of the two differently mobile populations of molecules exchanging at PML bodies were determined from the fitted two-component exponential functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>). Assuming that FRAP of the slower exchanging component is unaffected by free diffusion and therefore reaction dominant, the dissociation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) of the slower component is identical to the decay constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>slow</sub>) of its exponential term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the residence time was calculated as (<italic>k</italic><sub>slow</sub>)<sup>â1</sup>.</p>

        <title>Theoretical association probability</title>
        <p>To calculate the theoretical probability for a colocalization event between sphere-shaped objects (PML bodies and gene loci) in the nucleus, the volume of the nucleus and the number and volume of the objects were taken into account. These data were determined from the 3D image stacks of FISH experiments. In case of a colocalization (or association) event of a genomic locus and a PML body, the distance between the centers of the two colocalizing distinct spheres within the nucleus is equal or less than the sum of the sphereâs radii: d &lt; r<sub>g</sub> + r<sub>p</sub>, in which r<sub>g</sub> is the radius of the genomic locus, and r<sub>p</sub> is the radius of a PML body. Considering one single nucleus of radius R with m PML bodies of radius r<sub>p</sub> each, and n genomic loci with radius r<sub>g</sub> each, we assume that the positions of all genomic loci are equally distributed within the nucleus and that no two genomic loci are closer than 2 r<sub>g</sub> + 2 r<sub>p</sub>, which guarantees that a specific PML body does not colocalize with more than one genomic locus at a time. Then, considering the volume of the nucleus and the total volume of the spheres around all genomic loci, which define a colocalization event, the colocalization probability p for one PML body is given by p = n (r<sub>g</sub> + r<sub>p</sub>)<sup>3</sup>/R<sup>3</sup>. As for m PML bodies, the probability p<sub>m</sub> that no PML body colocalizes with any genomic locus is p<sub>m</sub> = (1 â p)<sup>m</sup>. We get the final result for the probability p<sub>A</sub> to find at least one colocalization between a PML body and a genomic locus within the whole nucleus with m PML bodies and n genomic loci: p<sub>A</sub> = 1 â (1 â n (r<sub>g</sub> + r<sub>p</sub>)<sup>3</sup>/R<sup>3</sup>)<sup>m</sup>. This model contains the explicit assumption that two genomic loci have a minimum distance of 2(r<sub>p</sub> + r<sub>g</sub>), which is a plausible assumption regarding the size of genomic elements and of PML bodies. On the contrary, PML bodies are allowed to intersect in this probability model, which does not coincide with our experimental findings. Nevertheless, for the numbers of PML bodies in our experiments, the effect of this approximation on the true probability is very small.</p>
        <p>From the colocalizing probability p<sub>A</sub> within one nucleus, one can compute the probability p<sub>k</sub>(j) for the event to find among k investigated cells j cells with at least one colocalization caused by chance: p<sub>k</sub>(j) = (k/choose j) p<sub>A</sub><sup>j</sup> (1 â p<sub>A</sub><sup>j</sup>)<sup>(k â j)</sup>. If in an experiment with k cells there are q cells with at least one colocalization, the p-value for this event is the sum of the probabilities p<sub>k</sub>(j) to find q cells or more with at least one colocalization: p-value = SUM(q â¤ I â¤ k) p<sub>k</sub>(i).</p>

        <p>Fig. S1 shows by immunostaining that a transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of PML in HEp-2 cells leads to reduced cellular IFN-Î³âinduced MHC class II molecule expression. Fig. S2 shows by Western blotting that lack of PML protein does not affect the protein level of the MHC class II enhanceosome components RFX5 or NFY-C. Fig. S3 shows by immunostaining that a subfraction of CIITA accumulates at all PML bodies at the endogenous level. Fig. S4 shows by qPCR and immunofluorescence that the fusion protein GFP-CIITA is functional with respect to induction of MHC II mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Table S1 shows the theoretical probability of association between PML bodies and genomic loci based on our self-developed software model. Table S2 provides a complete list of all dynamic parameters obtained from FRAP analyses of GFP-CIITA at PML bodies in nuclei of living cells dependent on coexpression of individual PML isoforms.
