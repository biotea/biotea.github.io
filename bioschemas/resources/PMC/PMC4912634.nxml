      <abstract>
        <p>Centrioles and cilia are microtubule-based structures, whose precise formation requires controlled cytoplasmic tubulin incorporation. How cytoplasmic tubulin is recognized for centriolar/ciliary-microtubule construction remains poorly understood. Centrosomal-P4.1-associated-protein (CPAP) binds tubulin via its PN2-3 domain. Here, we show that a C-terminal loop-helix in PN2-3 targets Î²-tubulin at the microtubule outer surface, while an N-terminal helical motif caps microtubule's Î±-Î² surface of Î²-tubulin. Through this, PN2-3 forms a high-affinity complex with GTP-tubulin, crucial for defining numbers and lengths of centriolar/ciliary-microtubules. Surprisingly, two distinct mutations in PN2-3 exhibit opposite effects on centriolar/ciliary-microtubule lengths. CPAP<sup>F375A</sup>, with strongly reduced tubulin interaction, causes shorter centrioles and cilia exhibiting doublet- instead of triplet-microtubules. CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> that unmasks the Î²-tubulin polymerization surface displays slightly reduced tubulin-binding affinity inducing over-elongation of newly forming centriolar/ciliary-microtubules by enhanced dynamic release of its bound tubulin. Thus CPAP regulates delivery of its bound-tubulin to define the size of microtubule-based cellular structures using a âclutch-like' mechanism.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Centrioles are microtubule-based eukaryotic structures that build centrosomes and cilia, which are required for accurate cell division and cellular signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Centrioles have highly conserved architecture displaying defined numbers and lengths of microtubules. Tubulin heterodimers (hereafter tubulin) are the building blocks of centriolar- and ciliary-microtubules. During cilium construction, intraflagellar transport (IFT) machineries mediate the transport of ciliary building blocks of tubulin from the cytoplasmic ciliary base to the tip<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, it remains poorly understood how a fraction of tubulin is selected from its large cytoplasmic pool and the mechanisms that operate to deliver these specialized tubulin to construct defined lengths of centriolar- and ciliary-microtubules.</p>
    <p>Since cilium templates from a centriole that resides within a centrosome, it is conceivable that a centrosomal protein that can directly interact with cytoplasmic tubulin could play a role in selective regulation of tubulin incorporation during centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule construction. Among the centrosomal proteins, CPAP and its ortholog Sas-4 plays roles in centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Data have shown that these functions require CPAP-tubulin interaction. Specifically, a CPAP/Sas-4 mutant that does not bind tubulin caused shortening of centrioles and primary cilia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. These data suggest the possibility that CPAP could play a role in delivering its bound tubulin at the site of centriole assembly and/or building centriolar-microtubules.</p>
    <p>Free tubulin is ubiquitously present in high amounts in cells in contrast to CPAP, which has lower expression levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. It is known that CPAP <italic>via</italic> its conserved PN2-3 domain (amino acids 319â394) sequesters free tubulin into a non-polymerizable 1:1 complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus at equilibrium, the amount of CPAP bound cytoplasmic tubulin that is unavailable for polymerization would only be a small fraction of the free tubulin. This suggests that the small fraction of CPAP-bound tubulin is required in certain CPAP-specific processes that are regulated in a spatiotemporal manner such as centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule size control. While recent studies have substantially improved our understanding on the significance of CPAP-tubulin interaction in centriole biogenesis and pericentriolar material recruitment, its significance in centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule construction remains unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of PN2-3-tubulin interaction is crucial in dissecting how cytoplasmic tubulin is sequestered by CPAP for the controlled delivery to define centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule lengths in cells.</p>
    <p>In this study, we therefore investigated the structural basis of CPAP-tubulin interaction and identified that CPAP via its conserved PN2-3 domain forms a high affinity complex with GTP-tubulin and prevents it from polymerization. Our functional studies in human cells and flies then identified that, through the different facets of its PN2-3 domain, CPAP defines centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule lengths, firstly, through the sufficient binding of cytoplasmic tubulin and secondly by regulated release of its bound tubulin to define centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule lengths.</p>

        <title>Molecular basis for PN2-3-tubulin interaction</title>
        <p>The PN2-3 domain, at the N-terminus of CPAP, is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we determined a 25.6ânM binding affinity between PN2-3 and tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and found PN2-3<sub>C</sub> (PN2-3's C-terminus, aa 372-394) is sufficient to bind tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). By adopting a DARPin strategy, in which DARPin molecule didn't affect binding of PN2-3<sub>C</sub> to tubulin, we solved the 2.1âÃ crystal structure of bovine tubulin bound to PN2-3<sub>C</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In this structure, a loop-helix motif spanning residues 372â386 of PN2-3<sub>C</sub> targets an acidic microtubule outer surface on Î²-tubulin, although the last eight C-terminal residues (aa 387â394) were not traceable in the density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). A GTP molecule is identified in the Î²-tubulin nucleotide-binding pocket despite tubulin exhibiting a curved conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Recognition specificity arises from a number of water-mediated and direct interchain hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic contacts between Î²-tubulin and PN2-3<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Key interacting residues within PN2-3<sub>C</sub> were then confirmed by structure-guided mutagenesis and ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Notably, F375A caused a drastic 109-fold drop in affinity from 25.6ânM to 2.8âÎ¼M, indicating its significance in forming a high-affinity CPAP-tubulin complex. We observed a perfect shape complementarity between the crouched PN2-3<sub>C</sub> loop-helix and its binding groove along the vertical axis for tubulin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
        <p>The N-terminal helical region of PN2-3 (PN2-3<sub>N</sub>, aa 323â361) alone has weak tubulin binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>=68.0âÎ¼M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, together with PN2-3<sub>C</sub>, it contributes a â¼140-fold increased binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>=25.6ânM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As the PN2-3<sub>N</sub>-tubulin co-crystal structure could not be resolved, we used cross-linking mass spectrometry (CL-MS) to identify PN2-3<sub>N</sub> contacts with tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). CL-MS analysis indicates that PN2-3<sub>N</sub> wraps around the microtubule Î±-Î²-tubulin interface and makes contacts at the Î²-tubulin's microtubule-lumen surface, as a majority of cross-linking peaks were identified between PN2-3-N-terminal amine and lysine 372 in proximity to the Î²-tubulin M-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Such a binding mode is further supported by competition nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) titration, where the weakly binding PN2-3<sub>N</sub> region can be displaced by the high affinity ligand vinblastine, which is known to bind to the microtubule Î±-Î²-tubulin interface, but not by colchicine, which binds to the Î²-Î± interface within a tubulin dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Arginine substitutions of the conserved PN2-3<sub>N</sub>'s E343 and E344 (hereafter EE343RR) caused a 8-fold reduced interaction (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>=194.2ânM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then compared the NMR spectra of wild type and mutant (PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup> and PN2-3<sup>EE343RR</sup>) PN2-3 fragments, which exhibited numerous chemical shift differences between PN2-3<sup>WT</sup> and PN2-3<sup>EE343RR</sup>. This suggests a potential disruption of the helix, which extends from residues F338-E368 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). On the other hand, we noticed similar spectra of PN2-3<sup>WT</sup> and the PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup>, which is further confirmed by the comparison of PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup> and PN2-3<sup>EE343RR</sup> spectra. Upon addition of unlabeled tubulin at equimolar ratio to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled PN2-3<sup>WT</sup>, PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup> and PN2-3<sup>EE343RR</sup> mutants, we observed line broadening/disappearance of the peaks, which is suggestive of binding. Exchange broadening can become obvious in low affinity (Î¼M <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) binding events. Accordingly, we observed that line broadening increases from PN2-3<sup>WT</sup> to PN2-3<sup>EE343RR</sup> and is the highest with the PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup> mutant, as the affinity for tubulin decreases in the same order agreeing with our ITC titrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, our structural and mutagenesis data indicate that PN2-3 wraps around Î²-tubulin like a necklace with its PN2-3<sub>N</sub> covering the microtubule Î±-Î² and lumen surfaces of Î²-tubulin and its PN2-3<sub>C</sub> occluding the Î²-tubulin microtubule outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). This unique binding mode suggests that PN2-3 could prevent the polymerization of its bound tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>

        <title>PN2-3 prevents its bound tubulin from polymerization</title>
        <p>To test if PN2-3 could bind tubulin and prevent the bound tubulin from polymerization, we performed microtubule-pelleting assays using free tubulin and PN2-3 variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Tubulin at a high concentration self-polymerizes into microtubules. While polymerized tubulin could be pelleted by centrifugation, free tubulin remains in solution in the supernatant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. When we included PN2-3 variants in this assay, we found that in contrast to PN2-3<sup>WT</sup>, PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup> did not prevent tubulin polymerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). This could be due to the presence of F375, which is required for the formation of high affinity CPAP-tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, F375-containing PN2-3<sub>C</sub> domain binds the Î²-tubulin at the microtubule outer surface, which might allosterically disrupt microtubule formation by inducing or stabilizing a curved tubulin dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Supporting this notion, PN2-3<sub>C</sub> alone was sufficient to prevent tubulin from polymerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). PN2-3<sub>N</sub> caps Î²-tubulin and conceivably has intrinsic microtubule depolymerization activities. However, compared to PN2-3<sub>C</sub>, PN2-3<sub>N</sub> is not sufficient to prevent microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). This is likely due to the weak binding affinity observed for PN2-3<sub>N</sub> and tubulin (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>=68âÎ¼M) as compared to the case of PN2-3<sub>C</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>=4.8âÎ¼M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similarly, PN2-3<sub>C</sub><sup>F375A</sup> failed to prevent tubulin from polymerization due to loss of PN2-3-tubulin binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5c and 6a</xref>). We then tested the effects of PN2-3 variants in cytoplasmic microtubules by overexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PN2-3 variants in HeLa cells. In contrast to PN2-3<sup>WT</sup>, overexpression of PN2-3<sup>F375A</sup> did not cause the collapse of cytoplasmic microtubules indicating that <italic>in vitro,</italic> the ability of PN2-3 to bind tubulin and prevent it from polymerization is F375-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>

        <title>CPAP-tubulin regulates centriole and cilium lengths</title>
        <p>First, we tested the functional significance of CPAP's F375-tubulin interaction in centrosome biogenesis. To test this, we established stable HeLa lines expressing RNAi-resistant GFP-tagged CPAP, and CPAP<sup>F375A</sup> using bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering (BACs). This system allows expression of gene products under their own endogenous promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. As described previously, treating cells with CPAP-specific siRNA depleted endogenous protein, retaining the RNAi-resistant CPAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Expressing wild type siRNA-resistant CPAP completely rescued the effects of siRNA-mediated CPAP depletion as cells proliferated without centrosome duplication defects. In contrast, RNAi-resistant CPAP<sup>F375A</sup> failed to rescue the centrosome duplication phenotype caused by wild type CPAP depletion. Specifically, when cultured for prolonged periods of time, we noticed a proportion of cells displaying less than two centrosomes reaffirming previous findings that CPAP-tubulin interaction is required for centrosome duplication in cultured human cells<sup>11,12</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>)</p>
        <p>Since, depleting endogenous CPAP perturbs centrosome duplication, we took an alternative approach to study the role of CPAP-tubulin interaction in regulating centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule lengths. We overexpressed GFP-tagged CPAP<sup>WT</sup> and CPAP<sup>F375A</sup> in RPE1 cells using lentiviral-transduction. We analyzed ciliated cells and determined daughter centrioles from mother centrioles by immunostaining CP110, a centrosomal protein that localizes to the distal end of daughter centrioles providing a cap-like structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. CP110 predominantly localizes to the daughter centriole, which does not template the formation of cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Compared to CPAP<sup>WT</sup> expression, CPAP<sup>F375A</sup>, which fails to efficiently bind tubulin, resulted in shorter centrioles. These data suggest the need of a high-affinity CPAP-tubulin interaction for centriolar-microtubule elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3ai-ii</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then expressed CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> that perturbs PN2-3's N-terminal helix, which caps the microtubule lumen surface of Î²-tubulin and possibly unmasks the Î²-tubulin surface for polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. To our surprise, CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> expression caused overly long mother and daughter centrioles. In contrast to most of the CPAP<sup>F375A</sup> centrioles, which were shorter in length, we could readily distinguish and measure the lengthy centrioles induced by CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup>. The finding that CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> causes longer daughter centrioles, suggests that CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> can affect newly forming microtubule-based structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3aiii-iv</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we analyzed the significance of CPAP-tubulin interaction in ciliogenesis. Although CPAP<sup>F375A</sup> expressing cells could assemble cilia, they were shorter in length. Serial sectioning-electron microscopy (EM) identified that they appear structurally normal until the transition zone where they displayed abnormal axonemes with distorted doublet-microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). On the other hand, expressing CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> resulted in structurally normal but overly long cilia also causing â¼10% of cells to be biciliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 9 and 10a</xref>). EM analyses revealed that biciliated cells contained four centrioles, in which two of them template cilium formation consistently displaying centriolar-appendages, indicating that they are either the mother and/or matured daughter centriole. This data suggests that CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> not only favors centriolar-microtubule elongation but also promotes daughter centrioles to form cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 9 and 10b,c</xref>).</p>
        <p>To exclude that overly long cilia in cells expressing CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> is due to defective ciliary disassembly, we synchronized RPE-1 cells expressing doxycycline inducible CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> at G<sub>0</sub> by serum starvation for 96âh (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The doxycycline inducible system prevented cells from forming long cilia caused by constitutive expression of CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup>. Upon serum stimulation and doxycycline induction, the percentages of cells expressing CPAP<sup>WT</sup> and CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> re-entering cell cycle concurrent with cilium disassembly did not differ. This excluded the involvement of defective ciliary disassembly in causing long cilia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>).</p>

        <title>CPAP via PN2-3 controls dynamic release of its bound tubulin</title>
        <p>Based on the above findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>), we speculated that in the cytoplasm, CPAP binds GTP-tubulin forming a high-affinity cytoplasmic complex and prevents the bound-tubulin from spontaneous polymerization until targeted to centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule elongation sites during the early phase of centriole/cilium formation. The experiment that supports this idea is the finding of shorter centriolar- and ciliary-microtubules upon CPAP<sup>F375A</sup> expression, a variant with strongly reduced tubulin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). At the site of centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule elongation, a mechanism that operates to control tubulin release could then regulate microtubule growth. One factor that could contribute to this regulation to facilitate tubulin release is the uncapping of CPAP's PN2-3<sub>N</sub> from Î²-tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>). It is also known that CPAP/Sas-4 is a dynamically regulated cell cycle protein with cytoplasmic and centriolar pools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Thus, centriolar CPAP could be an atypical centriolar-microtubule builder, regulating microtubule growth to define centriolar lengths. This is demonstrated by the overly long centrioles observed upon CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> expression, a variant with reduced tubulin affinity and unmasking Î²-tubulin surface making it available for tubulin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). If this were true, CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> would exhibit an enhanced release of its bound-tubulin via a âclutch-like' mechanism so as to favor microtubule growth at the onset of centriolar-microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test PN2-3's bound-tubulin releasing ability <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed microtubule-end tracking assays using GMPCPP (a non-hydrolysable GTP analog) stabilized microtubules and PN2-3 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4aâc</xref>). PN2-3, which can bind tubulin dimers at high affinity but not microtubules, has a microtubule-destabilizing activity primarily harbored in PN2-3<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, we measured the rate of PN2-3-mediated microtubule-destabilization as a function of its bound-tubulin releasing ability, with the assumption that PN2-3 is dynamically recycled for continuous microtubule disruption. Consistently, adding PN2-3<sup>WT</sup> destabilized microtubules at a slower rate compared to PN2-3<sup>EE343RR</sup>, implying a faster rate of bound-tubulin release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1â3</xref>). Importantly, these <italic>in vitro</italic> microtubule destabilization activities do not reflect how full-length CPAP functions in cells to regulate centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule growth with excess GTP-tubulin.</p>
        <p>To directly analyze CPAP in elongating centrioles of living cells, we expressed inducible CPAP<sup>WT</sup> and CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> in RPE1 cells. Real time measurements reveal CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> to have faster centriole elongation rates of â¼0.014âÎ¼mâmin<sup>â1</sup> (CPAP<sup>WT</sup>=0.0017âÎ¼mâmin<sup>â1</sup>) reaching up to 3.7âÎ¼m in centriolar length. This suggests that CPAP regulates microtubule growth for defined centriolar-microtubule lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 4â7</xref>). Consistently, our fixed experiments also revealed that CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> caused a faster rate of ciliary-microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12c</xref>). It thus appears that CPAP regulates the growth of microtubule-based structures through controlled release of its bound tubulin and its ability to function as a centriolar-microtubule builder, both of which occur at the site of centriole assembly.</p>

        <p>In order to prove the microtubule polymerization activity of CPAP <italic>in vitro</italic>, we recombinantly prepared an extended CPAP frame spanning from PN2-3 to a C-terminal coiled coil (CC) motif (aa 121â1060, PN2-3<sub>EX</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) using mammalian cell expression system and conducted microtubule polymerization assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 8â11</xref>). In an optimized microtubule growth condition in the presence of 15âÎ¼M GTP-tubulin, we could observe background microtubule growth at an average rate of â¼0.0106âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup> without PN2-3<sub>EX</sub>. After adding 1âÎ¼M wild type PN2-3<sub>EX</sub>, the microtubule growth rate was increased to â¼0.014âÎ¼mâs<sup>â1</sup>, suggesting a role of PN2-3<sub>EX</sub> in prompting microtubule polymerization.

In consistence with our live imaging experiments of CAPA<sup>EE343RR</sup>, PN2-3<sub>EX</sub><sup>EE343RR</sup> displayed an enhanced microtubule growth with a rate of â¼0.018 Î¼m s<sup>â1</sup>. In addition, GFP-tagged EB1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) was used to trace the plus end of growing microtubule. We observed active and dynamic plus end microtubule growth in the presence of PN2-3<sub>EX</sub>, especially in its EE343RR mutant form. These data suggest wild type and EE343RR mutant PN2-3<sub>EX</sub> may localize at the plus end during the process of microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 8â11</xref>).

        <title>Sas-4-tubulin controls centriole and cilium lengths <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>We then confirmed whether the Sas-4-tubulin interaction (the fly counterpart of CPAP) has a conserved function in controlling centriolar and ciliary length <italic>in vivo.</italic> To do this, we generated transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> expressing endogenous levels of GFP-tagged Sas-4<sup>WT</sup>, Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> (corresponding to CPAP<sup>F375A</sup>) and Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup> (corresponding to CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup>) in Sas-4 null flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12d</xref>). In contrast to Sas-4<sup>WT</sup> and Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup>, Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> failed to rescue the uncoordination and sterile phenotypes of null flies indicating that Sas-4<sup>F112</sup>-tubulin interaction is required to form functional sensory cilia and sperm flagella<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p>
        <p>However, Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> flies displayed correct centrosome numbers in spermatogonia indicating that Sas-4-tubulin interaction in flies is dispensable for centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This allowed us to specifically study the significance of Sas-4-tubulin interaction in centriole length determination <italic>in vivo</italic>. Analyzing mature spermatocytes of Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> flies, we found centrioles with significantly reduced lengths. On the other hand, Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup> flies displayed overly elongated centrioles, consistent with observations in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,d</xref>). Examining Sas-4's localization at the elongating centrioles of spermatocytes, we consistently found a concentrated proximal localization of Sas-4<sup>WT</sup>. In contrast, Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup> that causes elongated centrioles displayed an extended localization along the length of its overly elongated centrioles, coherent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggesting that CPAP binds at the plus end of microtubule during polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5b,c</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then performed EM analyzes of Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> centrioles to analyze centriolar architecture when Sas-4-tubulin interaction is significantly perturbed. In contrast to Sas-4<sup>WT</sup> and Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup>, the spermatogonium and spermatocyte centrioles of Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> mostly contained doublet instead of triplet centriolar-microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). This finding indicated that Sas-4<sup>F112</sup>-tubulin interaction is not required for nucleating centriolar-microtubules <italic>per se</italic> but for the formation of third centriolar-microtubules suggesting insufficient tubulin delivery by perturbed Sas-4-tubulin interaction. Indeed, Î³-TuRC has been suggested to nucleate the A-microtubule that subsequently templates B-and C-microtubule elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>
        <p>When analyzing primary cilia of spermatocytes, we identified that flies expressing Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup> resulted in long cilia.

Furthermore, EM analyses revealed that Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup> cilia displayed incomplete and distorted ciliary microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). These findings indicate that Sas-4-tubulin interaction is required to form structurally stable and defined lengths of ciliary microtubules.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In cells, how a fraction of specialized tubulin from a large cytoplasmic pool is specifically recognized and licensed to form defined numbers and lengths of centriolar- and ciliary-microtubules is poorly understood. In this work, we have undertaken an integrated approach to dissect the conserved function of CPAP-tubulin interaction, which represents a crucial step in understanding centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule length control. Our results support a model in which CPAP/Sas-4 through the different facets of its PN2-3 domain, defines centriolar- and ciliary-microtubule lengths. Our structural studies reveal that PN2-3 embraces a ânecklace-like' mode for tubulin recognition, in which, CPAP via its PN2-3<sub>N</sub> targets the lumen surface of Î²-tubulin, and PN2-3<sub>C</sub> loop-helix motif occupies the Î²-tubulin microtubule outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This unique binding mode practically approves the formation of a high-affinity CPAP-GTP-tubulin complex and simultaneously prevents the polymerization of its bound GTP-tubulin, which is reactive, unstable, and ready for microtubule build-up once released. Noticeably, the last eight C-terminal residues of PN2-3<sub>C</sub> were not visible in the electron density map. However, these residues together with F385, seem to play important roles in microtubule depolymerization, as the PN2-3<sub>C2</sub> variant with truncation of its last ten residues, almost failed to depolymerize GTP-stabilized microtubules, when compared with full length PN2-3<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>).</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, CPAP is the first centrosomal protein shown to form a high-affinity complex with tubulin, making it unavailable for polymerization. Although, we do not yet fully understand the mechanisms by which how the CPAP-bound tubulin is released at the sites of centriole assembly, it appears that controlled delivery of tubulin is essential for constructing defined numbers and lengths of centriolar- and ciliary-microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). One of the potential mechanisms that could facilitate tubulin release at the site of centriole assembly is perhaps uncapping of CPAP's PN2-3<sub>N</sub> from the Î²-tubulin surface. Thus, the cleared tubulin surface is then available for polymerization into micrometer scale centriolar-microtubules. This is supported by our experiments with CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> / Sas-4<sup>EE78RR</sup> and CPAP PN2-3<sub>EX</sub><sup>EE343RR</sup> variants with reduced tubulin affinity and unmasking of the Î²-tubulin surface causing overly long centriolar-microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6d</xref>).</p>
      <p>The finding that CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> causes overly long daughter centrioles and enhances ciliary lengths without affecting mother centrioles suggests that CPAP specifically acts on growing microtubule-based structures. Although, these experiments indirectly suggest that CPAP could function as a centriolar-microtubule builder, currently we are unable to dissect centriole-specific CPAP functions. Thus, it is unknown how CPAP spatiotemporally exerts both its tubulin binding and polymerization activities. Since CPAP is a cell cycle regulated protein, it is likely that cell cycle-dependent posttranslational modifications and its interaction partners including centriolar-microtubule length determining factors are required to modulate CPAP's tubulin binding and polymerization activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> As centriolar-microtubules markedly differ from cytoplasmic microtubules, experiments employing tools that allow inducible expression of centriole-specific CPAP or its microtubule bound atomic structure are additionally required to solve the puzzle of how CPAP acts on centriolar-microtubules.</p>
      <p>CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> expression causes enhanced ciliogenesis. This finding is strikingly similar to phenotypes observed when Kif24, a centriolar kinesin is depleted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Interestingly, Kif24 specifically acts on mother centrioles and possesses microtubule-depolymerizing activity. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that an enhanced expression of CPAP<sup>EE343RR</sup> could counteract endogenous Kif24 to promote ciliogenesis. Taken together, several questions remain, requiring future studies.</p>
      <p>Although, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest a possible role for CPAP functioning as an atypical centriolar-microtubule builder, our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in flies seem to support Sas-4's role mainly as a regulator of tubulin release at the onset of centriolar-microtubule elongation. The experiment that highlights this aspect is the proximal localization of endogenous Sas-4 at the elongating spermatocyte centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. This finding supports an idea that Sas-4 has a tendency to release tubulin to control centriolar-microtubule growth independent from its localization at the distal end of centrioles. CPAP at the distal end of the centriole could play a role in regulating the growing end of centriolar-microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6d</xref>). The tubulin incorporation ability of Sas-4 is further supported by our EM experiments revealing doublet instead of triplet centriolar-microtubules in flies expressing Sas-4<sup>F112A</sup>, a variant that strongly reduces its interaction with tubulin. These findings not only support the tubulin incorporation aspect of Sas-4 but also highlight the requirement of other factors for centriolar-microtubule growth.</p>
      <p>How does CPAP/Sas-4 play a role in ciliary microtubule growth control? It is known that during cilium construction, IFT machineries transport ciliary building blocks of tubulin from the cytoplasmic ciliary base to the tip<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. As CPAP/Sas-4 mainly localizes to the ciliary base, it rules out a direct role for CPAP in ciliary microtubule elongation at the ciliary tip. Thus, CPAP/Sas-4 likely controls cilia growth indirectly by regulating the available pool of unpolymerized soluble tubulin at the ciliary base. This diffusible tubulin is then concentrated and transported by intraflagellar transport proteins for cilia elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. If this is true, there could be an interaction between CPAP-tubulin complex and a subset of IFT particles. Future experiments revealing these molecular interactions will help in linking cytoplasmic tubulin recognition and their subsequent transport within the cilium by IFTs.</p>
      <p>As free tubulin is ubiquitously present in cells, this raises the possibility of forming increased numbers and lengths of centriolar and ciliary structures. However, cells have strict mechanisms to prevent this. One such mechanism is CPAP/Sas-4-tubulin in the cytoplasm. Under physiological conditions, CPAP/Sas-4 has lower expression levels in contrast to free tubulins in cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Thus, at equilibrium, the amount of cytoplasmic tubulin bound by CPAP/Sas-4 making it unavailable for polymerization would only be a small fraction of the free tubulin pool. Therefore, it makes sense that CPAP/Sas-4 has a dedicated function in binding limited amounts of cytoplasmic tubulin and licenses them for centriolar- and ciliary-microtubules, which is then spatiotemporally regulated for constructing defined numbers and lengths of centriolar and ciliary structures.</p>
