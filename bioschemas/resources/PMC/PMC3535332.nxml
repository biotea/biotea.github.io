      <abstract>
        <p>NAD kinase is the sole NADP<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme. Despite the great significance of NADP<sup>+</sup>, to date no mitochondrial NAD kinase has been identified in human, and the source of human mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> remains elusive. Here we present evidence demonstrating that a human protein of unknown function, C5orf33, is a human mitochondrial NAD kinase; this protein likely represents the missing source of human mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup>. The C5orf33 protein exhibits NAD kinase activity, utilizing ATP or inorganic polyphosphate, and is localized in the mitochondria of human HEK293A cells. C5orf33 mRNA is more abundant than human cytosolic NAD kinase mRNA in almost all tissues examined. We further show by database searches that some animals and protists carry C5orf33 homologues as their sole NADP<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme, whereas plants and fungi possess no C5orf33 homologue. These observations provide insights into eukaryotic NADP<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, which has pivotal roles in cells and organelles.</p>

    <p>NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADP<sup>+</sup> and their reduced forms (NADH and NADPH) function as cofactor involved in oxidativeâreductive reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH mainly function in catabolic reactions, whereas NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADPH are involved in anabolic reactions and defence against oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> are also known to function as substrates in several reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. NAD kinase (NADK; EC 2.7.1.23) is the sole NADP<sup>+</sup>-biosynthetic enzyme known to catalyse phosphorylation of NAD<sup>+</sup> to yield NADP<sup>+</sup>, using ATP or inorganic polyphosphate (poly(P)) as the phosphoryl donor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, and has a vital role in the cell. Poly(P) is a linear polymer of orthophosphate residues linked by energy-rich phosphoanhydride bonds; it has been found in bacteria, fungi and tissues of higher plants and animals, including humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Some bacterial and archaeal NADKs utilize both poly(P) and ATP as a phosphoryl donor, although all characterized eukaryotic NADKs use ATP, not poly(P)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Moreover, some bacterial and eukaryotic NADKs also catalyse the phosphorylation of NADH by utilizing ATP to yield NADPH (NADH kinase (NADHK; EC 2.7.1.86) reaction)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. NADKs that have higher NADHK activity than NADK activity have also been identified, and in some cases classified as NADHK. So far, only mitochondrial Pos5 of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and peroxisomal NADK3 of the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> have been experimentally defined as NADHK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
    <p>In the case of yeast, in addition to the gene (<italic>POS5</italic>) encoding mitochondrial Pos5, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has other two NADK genes (<italic>UTR1</italic> and <italic>YEF1</italic>) encoding cytosolic Utr1 and Yef1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).

The phenotypes of the <italic>POS5</italic> mutant (<italic>pos5</italic>), which are probably caused by decreased mitochondrial NADPH, indicate that Pos5 is responsible for mitochondrial NADP(H) synthesis and again emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial NADP(H)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Moreover, in addition to the gene (<italic>NADK3</italic>) encoding peroxisomal NADK3, <italic>NADK1</italic> and <italic>NADK2</italic> have been identified as NADK genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The products of these genes, NADK1 and NADK2, are localized in the cytosol and chloroplast, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In pea leaf, NADP<sup>+</sup> enters the plant mitochondria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>; thus, the NADP<sup>+</sup> transporter, which is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria, is responsible for the supply of plant mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup>. In phylogenetic tree analysis, the plant NADK3 homologues, including <italic>A. thaliana</italic> NADK3, are distinguishable from NADK homologues, including Pos5 and Utr1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). However, the structural features of NADK3 homologues have not been reported.</p>
    <p>In contrast to yeasts and plants, only a single gene encoding NADK has been found in the human genome; the product of this gene, human NADK, is localized to the cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. No mitochondrial NADK has been found in human. Pollak <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> stated that given the vital role of at least two NADK isoforms in yeast, one would certainly expect more than one mammalian NADK isoform; furthermore, any additional NADK isoforms in mammals should have primary structures substantially different from virtually all previously identified enzymes, at least according to the currently available information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. An influx of NAD<sup>+</sup> through human and mammal mitochondrial membrane has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, but the source of human mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> has remained elusive despite its great significance.</p>
    <p>In this study, we identified C5orf33, a human protein of unknown function, as an NADK3 homologue, based on homology search using the primary structure of NADK3 of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> as a query. The C5orf33 protein is a novel human mitochondrial NADK that is responsible for the missing source of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> in human cells.</p>

        <p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> NADK3 homologues are distinguishable from NADK homologues on the phylogenetic tree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, although there has been no report of the features of the primary structure of NADK3. To obtain more information, we performed a BLASTP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> search using the primary structure of NADK3 as a query against all organisms in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>); 1,127 proteins were detected as NADK3 homologues (<italic>E</italic>-values, e-179 to 9.9) with <italic>E</italic>-values less than 10. Human C5orf33 protein was unexpectedly detected as the 134th homologue (<italic>E</italic>-value, 9e-06), whereas human NADK was detected as the 833rd homologue (<italic>E</italic>-value, 0.25). When BLASTP search was conducted using the primary structure of human NADK as a query, human C5orf33 protein was not included in the detected human NADK homologues (total 1,854 proteins; <italic>E</italic>-values ranging from 0.0 to 6.1) as reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, although the C5orf33 protein contains an NADK motif (Pfam, PF01513 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). NADK3 was detected as the 1,817th homologue (<italic>E</italic>-value, 0.49) among human NADK homologues.</p>
        <p>BLASTP analysis showed that the primary structure of human C5orf33 protein (442 amino-acid residues) is 25% identical (37% similar) to that of NADK3 (317 residues). Moreover, using Mitoprot, we identified a mitochondrial-targeting sequence in the N-terminus of the primary structure of the C5orf33 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These features of the primary structure suggested that the C5orf33 protein is a novel candidate human mitochondrial NADK.</p>

        <p>Two complementary DNAs corresponding to mRNAs from the human <italic>C5orf33</italic> gene, transcript variant 1 (accession no. NM_001085411.1) and transcript variant 2 (accession no. NM_153013.3), are deposited in the NCBI database. Transcript variant 1 encodes full-length C5orf33 protein (442 residues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Transcript variant 2 encodes the C5orf33 protein lacking N-terminal 163 amino acids (Î163C5orf33 protein, 279 residues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Note that variant 2 also is encompassed by Î100C5orf33 protein (342 residues; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The NADK activity of C5orf33, Î62C5orf33, Î100C5orf33 and Î163C5orf33 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) were examined using the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> NADK triple mutant <italic>utr1 yef1 pos5</italic>. Î62C5orf33 protein lacks the 62-residue predicted mitochondrial-targeting sequence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, MK1598 cells (an NADK triple mutant having YCplac33-<italic>UTR1</italic>) carrying pRS415 alone were inviable on synthetic complete (SC)+5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) due to the loss of YCplac33-<italic>UTR1</italic> and the lethality of the resultant <italic>utr1 yef1 pos5</italic> cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, MK1598 cells carrying an additional <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial NADHK gene (<italic>POS5</italic>) on pRS415 (pMK2127) were viable on SC+FOA, although YCplac33-<italic>UTR1</italic> was dropped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating that the NADHK activity of Pos5 rescued the lethality of the <italic>utr1 yef1 pos5</italic> cells. MK1598 cells carrying the gene encoding either the full-length C5orf33 protein (pMK3269) or the Î62C5orf33 protein (pMK3270) were viable on SC+FOA medium, but those carrying the <italic>Î100C5orf33</italic> gene (pMK3243) or the <italic>Î163C5orf33</italic> gene (pMK3244) were not, indicating that the C5orf33 and Î62C5orf33 proteins exhibit NADK or NADHK activity.</p>

        <title><italic>In vitro</italic> NAD(H)K activities of purified C5orf33</title>
        <p>To confirm the NADK or NADHK activity of C5orf33 protein <italic>in vitro</italic>, we expressed recombinant C5orf33 and Î62C5orf33 proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta-gami(DE3)pLysS as described in Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. C5orf33 was expressed as an insoluble protein, whereas Î62C5orf33 protein was partially soluble: ~28% of Î62C5orf33 protein was soluble and 72% was insoluble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). We purified the soluble Î62C5orf33 protein using TALON column chromatography; the resulting product is referred to hereafter as âpurified C5orf33 proteinâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). SDSâPAGE analysis showed that the molecular mass of the purified C5orf33 protein was 43âkDa, in agreement with the predicted mass (45âkDa; His-tag (1.4âkDa) plus Î62C5orf33 protein (43.3âkDa)). We assayed the NADK activity of C5orf33 protein using ATP and poly(P) (metaphosphate) as a phosphoryl donor; by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, we detected the formation of NADP<sup>+</sup> from NAD<sup>+</sup> and of ADP from ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), showing that C5orf33 protein has NADK activity using ATP and poly(P) as phosphoryl donors.</p>
        <p>The kinetic properties of C5orf33 protein were determined by assay of NADK activity using the continuous method (see Methods), and compared with those of human NADK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Both <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (for NAD<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of C5orf33 protein (0.022Â±0.001âmM and 0.091Â±0.001âUâmg<sup>â1</sup>) were significantly lower than those of human NADK (1.07âmM and 18.5âUâmg<sup>â1</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). However, at the physiological concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> found in human mitochondria and cytosol, the NADK activity of C5orf33 protein would be comparable to that of human NADK, as described in the Discussion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). With regard to the substrate specificity of C5orf33 protein, the NADHK activity of C5orf33 protein was only 10% of its NADK activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), although the primary structure of C5orf33 protein is similar to that of NADHK (NADK3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>)). ATP-dependent nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) kinase activity of C5orf33 protein was not detected by TLC. NAAD phosphate (NAADP), the phosphorylated NAAD, is a calcium-mobilizing second messenger in human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Although NADKs (Utr1 and Yef1) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> catalyse NAADP synthesis by phosphorylation of NAAD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, human NADK has no NAAD phosphorylation activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, TLC analysis detected no phosphorylation of either ADP-ribose, adenosine or 5â²-AMP by C5orf33 protein. Sphingosine kinase, diacylglycerol kinase and 6-phosphofructokinase activities of purified C5orf33 protein were assayed by monitoring formation of ADP, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>. Although formation of ADP was observed in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> even in the presence of vehicle alone (16% (v/v) dimethylformamide or 10% (v/v) ethanol), formation of ADP in the presence of sphingosine, diacylglycerol (1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol) and fructose 6-phosphate was not, indicating that purified C5orf33 protein exhibits no sphingosine kinase, diacylglycerol kinase or 6-phosphofructokinase activity, although these kinases have been suggested to be weakly related to NADK with respect to structure and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, as phosphoryl donors, C5orf33 protein could use ATP, other nucleotide triphosphates and poly(P) (metaphosphate, hexametaphosphate and tetrapolyphosphate), but neither ADP, trimetaphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate nor phosphocreatine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). It should be noted that C5orf33 protein exhibits a poly(P)-dependent NADK activity comparable to that of its ATP-dependent activity, as it has been postulated that only a subset of bacterial or archaeal NADKs exhibit high poly(P)-dependent NADK activity, whereas eukaryotic NADKs do not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Moreover, C5orf33 protein exhibited a saturation curve with ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), whereas human NADK exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with ATP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although human NADK is inhibited by NADH and NADPH, but not NADP<sup>+</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), the NADK activity of C5orf33 protein was inhibited by NADH, NADPH and in particular NADP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mitochondrial localization of C5orf33 protein</title>
        <p>C5orf33 protein was predicted to be localized in mitochondria because of the presence of a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). An <italic>in vivo</italic> assay of C5orf33 protein localization in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> indicated that the C5orf33 protein is localized in mitochondria of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, whereas Î62C5orf33 protein that lacks the mitochondrial-targeting sequence is not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). To confirm the localization of C5orf33 protein in mitochondria of human cells, HEK293A cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing C terminally FLAG-fused C5orf33 protein or Î62C5orf33 protein, and observed by fluorescence microscopy after immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). This observation demonstrated that the C5orf33 protein is localized in mitochondria, whereas Î62C5orf33 protein is not, confirming that C5orf33 protein is a mitochondrial NADK, and that its N-terminal 62 residues contain a functional mitochondrial-targeting sequence. Moreover, we separated the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of siRNA-transfected HEK293A cells and confirmed using anti-C5orf33 antibody that C5orf33 protein was localized in the mitochondrial fraction but not in the cytosolic fraction as below (Fig. 5e).</p>

        <p>To determine whether <italic>C5orf33</italic> gene is transcribed in human tissue under physiological conditions, tissue-specific transcription of mRNAs encoding C5orf33 protein, human NADK and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were examined by absolute qPCR. The gene encoding GAPDH was selected as a housekeeping gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. For absolute qPCR, standard curves were created using synthesized mRNAs of the genes encoding C5orf33 proteins, human NADK and GAPDH. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the presence of mRNAs encoding C5orf33 protein, human NADK and GAPDH were confirmed in all examined tissues. The relative levels of transcripts of the GAPDH gene in testes, small intestine, colon, stomach and placenta were in agreement with those reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, guaranteeing the quality of the RNAs at least in these tissues. The mRNA levels of C5orf33 protein and human NADK were only a few per cent of the levels of GAPDH (for example, only 2.1% (human <italic>NADK</italic> gene) and 7.8% (<italic>C5orf33</italic> gene) in brain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). However, levels of C5orf33 mRNA were higher than those of the human <italic>NADK</italic> gene in all tissues examined except for colon, spleen and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In particular, C5orf33 mRNA levels were significantly higher than human NADK mRNA levels in heart, liver, testes and small intestine. The mRNA levels of both genes were low in skeletal muscle, possibly reflecting the virtual absence of both the pentose phosphate and the fatty acid synthetic pathways in this tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>

        <title>C5orf33 affects mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation</title>
        <p>To obtain information regarding the physiological role of C5orf33 protein, we knocked down the human <italic>C5orf33</italic> gene by siRNA transfection of HEK293A cells. Of the six siRNA duplexes we tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), transfection with siRNA#2 resulted in maximum C5orf33 knockdown (~70% reduction) and siRNA#2 was selected for subsequent knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
        <p>At 2 or 3 days after transfection with siRNA#2, we observed substantial knockdown at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). At 3 days after transfection with either siRNA#2 or MISSION siRNA Universal Negative Control #1 (control siRNA), C5orf33 mRNA levels were higher than those in the corresponding samples that had been incubated for 1 or 2 days after transfection. We also made observations at the protein level, using anti-C5orf33 antibody. We detected obvious knockdown of C5orf33 protein levels at 2 days and especially 3 days after transfection, but not after a 1-day incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In accordance with the relative increase in C5orf33 transcript level 3 days after transfection, the absolute level of C5orf33 protein was highest at this time point. The anti-C5orf33 antibody was specific for purified C5orf33 protein, and did not detect purified human NADK, guaranteeing that the signal we detected accurately represented C5orf33 protein rather than a cross-reaction with NADK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). By contrast, the anti-human NADK antibody was nonspecific, detecting both C5orf33 protein and human NADK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we evaluated the effect of the C5orf33 knockdown. Mitochondrial morphology was not affected by knockdown of C5orf33 for 3 days after transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). During this period, cell viability was also unaffected by knockdown, even in the presence of menadione (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). However, intracellular ROS levels were obviously increased 3 days after knockdown of C5orf33, but not 1 and 2 days, either in the absence or presence of menadione, although ROS levels were higher following menadione treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Menadione is cytotoxic to various cell lines, including HEK293 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), and induces apoptosis of cultured cells via elevation of peroxide and superoxide radical levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Moreover, we separated the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of HEK293A cells that had been incubated for 3 days after transfections with siRNA#2 and control siRNA, and again confirmed the mitochondrial localization of C5orf33 protein as well as the knockdown of C5orf33 protein level in mitochondrial fraction of siRNA#2-transfected cells, using anti-C5orf33 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). NADK activity of the mitochondrial fraction was decreased to 47% upon knockdown of C5orf33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). These observations indicate that C5orf33 protein, that is, human mitochondrial NADK is involved in the regulation of the generation of mitochondrial ROS.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Only a single gene encoding NADK has been previously reported to exist in the human genome; the product of this gene, human NADK, is localized in cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Until now, no mitochondrial NADK had been identified in human. Thus, the source of human mitochondrial NADP(H) has been elusive despite its great significance. In this study, it was revealed that the C5orf33 protein is a novel human mitochondrial NADK that is responsible for the missing source of mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup> in human cells. In HEK293 human cells, the concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup> in whole cells and mitochondria are 0.37 and 0.25âmM, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Given that mitochondria occupy 15% of the volume of a neuron<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, we estimated the cytosolic concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup> to be 0.39âmM. On the other hand, the concentration of ATP, which complexed with magnesium, is estimated to be 2 and 8âmM in mitochondria and cytosol of HeLa cell, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. From a saturation curve determined in the presence of 2âmM ATP (the physiological concentration within mitochondria)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, we estimated the NADK activity of C5orf33 protein at 0.25âmM NAD<sup>+</sup> to be 3.5âU per 1âÎ¼mol of C5orf33 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In the same manner, the activity of human NADK at 0.39âmM NAD<sup>+</sup> was estimated to be 12âU per 1âÎ¼mol of human NADK subunit in the presence of 8âmM ATP (cytosolic concentration of ATP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Moreover, C5orf33 mRNA levels were higher than those of human NADK in almost all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Collectively, although the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of C5orf33 protein is significantly lower than that of human NADK (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), under physiological conditions the NADK activity of the C5orf33 protein would be comparable to that of human NADK.</p>
      <p>BLASTP analyses using each of the primary structures of human C5orf33 protein and human NADK as a query in eukaryotic protein databases detected 107 C5orf33 homologues and 316 human NADK homologues, all of which contain the NADK motif. Phylogenetic trees constructed based on the structures of the 107 proteins as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> gave three clades: (i) animal and protist proteins including the human C5orf33 protein (total 65 proteins; <italic>E</italic>-values from 0.0 to 0.074); (ii) plant proteins including NADK3 (18 proteins; <italic>E</italic>-values from 8eâ11 to 0.049); and (iii) other proteins from several eukaryotes (24 proteins; <italic>E</italic>-values from 0.017 to 5.4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). These clades were, respectively, designated as (i) C5orf33 homologues, (ii) plant NADK3 homologues and (iii) NADK homologues. The 24 other proteins from several eukaryotes were found in 316 human NADK homologues, gave much lower <italic>E</italic>-values ranging from 0.0 to 4eâ51, and hence were designated as NADK homologues. Predicted mitochondrial-targeting sequences were detected in the primary structures of 38 of 65 C5orf33 homologues, and 4 of 18 plant NADK3 homologues, but not in 24 NADK homologues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Given that eukaryotes consist of animals (for example, vertebrates and insects), protists, plants and fungi, we concluded that animals and protists, but not plants and fungi, have C5orf33 homologues. C5orf33 homologues were found in almost all animals and many protists; 48 of 52 animals and 13 of 29 protists. Although 42 of 52 animals and 5 of 29 protists possess both C5orf33 and NADK homologues, some carry only either a C5orf33 homologue or NADK homologue; one protist (<italic>Naegleria gruberi</italic>) has none (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). It is noteworthy that six animals (for example, pig and horse) and eight protists (for example, those in genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>) possess the C5orf33 homologue as sole NADP<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme.</p>
      <p>We performed multiple alignment of the primary structures of human C5orf33 protein, plant NADK3 and nine NADKs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). The GGDG motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, NE/D short motif<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and the Asp, Thr and Tyr residues (corresponding to Asp-189, Thr-200 and Tyr-202 of Ppnk (NADK of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>) and taking part in the creation of NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding site) in the NADK-conserved region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> are completely conserved in the primary structures of the nine NADKs. In the structure of the C5orf33 protein, although the GGDG motif and NE/D short motif were completely conserved, the Asp, Thr and Tyr residues were not, corresponding instead to Ser-306, Lys-317 and Trp-319. We also found an additional region, termed the C5orf33 additional region, in the structure of the C5orf33 protein. In the sequence of NADK3, the GGDG motif and NE/D short motif are conserved; the Asp, Thr and Tyr residues were Ser-209, Thr-220 and Ala-222; and the NADK3 additional region, which does not correspond to the C5orf33 additional region, is found.</p>
      <p>In the aligned structures of 65 C5orf33 homologues, the GGDG motif was conserved in 58 of 65 structures; the NE/D short motif was completely conserved (that is, in 65 of 65 structures) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). With regard to the Ser-306, Lys-317 and Trp-319 of the human C5orf33 protein, the Ser-306 was conserved as Ser/Thr, the Trp-319 was completely as Trp, although the Lys-317 was not conserved and corresponded to Lys/Ser/Thr/Arg. In the aligned structures of C5orf33 homologues, we found two conserved sequences, motif 1 and motif 2. Motif 1 is PX-GXN(T/S)DP; motif 2 is S-G-X(C/M), where X and hyphen (-) mean hydrophobic (Ile, Phe, Val, Leu and Met) and any amino-acid residues, respectively. Of the aligned 65 sequences, 50 possessed both motifs; of the remaining 15 sequences, 3 contained motif 1 alone, 8 contained motif 2 alone and 4 contained neither. The sequences corresponding to the C5orf33 additional region were also found in 62 of the 65 aligned sequences.</p>
      <p>In the aligned structures of 18 plant NADK3 homologues, the GGDG motif, the NE/D short motif and motif 1 were completely conserved (in 18 of 18 sequences); motif 2 was almost completely conserved (in 17 of 18 sequences). The Ser-209, Thr-220 and Ala-222 residues of NADK3, corresponding to Asp-189, Thr-200 and Tyr-202 of Ppnk, were conserved as Ser, Thr/Ser and Ala residues. Sequences corresponding to the NADK3 additional region were found in 17 of the 18 sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Taken together, these structural features may contribute to the unique properties of human C5orf33 protein, that is, high capacity to utilize poly(P), as well as low <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and low <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>, and inhibition by NADP<sup>+</sup> and of plant NADK3, that is, low <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and high <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> for NADH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, possibly by using a different set of active-site side chains.</p>

Horseradish peroxideâconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (HRPâanti-rabbit IgG; Amersham Biosciences) and HRPâanti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) were diluted in Can Get Signal solution 2 (Toyobo) at dilutions of 1:2,000 and 1:10,000, respectively. MagicMark XP Western Standard (Invitrogen) or Precision Plus Protein Standard (Bio-Rad) was used as the standard. For proteins in lysates of transfected HEK293A cells, cells in 4 Ã 0.6âml transfection-mixture were collected by treatment with trypsin/EDTA solution (Nacalai Tesque), suspended and boiled for 10âmin in 48âÎ¼l 1 Ã SDS buffer. Signal intensities were estimated using ImageQuant TL.</p>
