      <abstract>
        <p>The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and its activator dynactin drive vesicular transport and mitotic spindle organization. Dynactin is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes, but a G59S mutation in the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin results in the specific degeneration of motor neurons. This mutation in the conserved cytoskeleton-associated protein, glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain lowers the affinity of p150<sup>Glued</sup> for microtubules and EB1. Cell lines from patients are morphologically normal but show delayed recovery after nocodazole treatment, consistent with a subtle disruption of dynein/dynactin function. The G59S mutation disrupts the folding of the CAP-Gly domain, resulting in aggregation of the p150<sup>Glued</sup> protein both in vitro and in vivo, which is accompanied by an increase in cell death in a motor neuron cell line. Overexpression of the chaperone Hsp70 inhibits aggregate formation and prevents cell death. These data support a model in which a point mutation in p150<sup>Glued</sup> causes both loss of dynein/dynactin function and gain of toxic function, which together lead to motor neuron cell death.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and its activator dynactin, which mediate minus endâdirected movement, have important roles in both interphase and dividing cells. In interphase cells, the dyneinâdynactin complex is essential for vesicle and organelle transport, such as ER-to-Golgi vesicular trafficking (for review see <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Schroer, 2004</xref>). The dyneinâdynactin motor complex also transports RNA particles (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carson et al., 2001</xref>), aggresomes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2002</xref>), and virus particles along microtubules (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dohner et al., 2002</xref>). During cell division, dynein and dynactin play a critical role in both nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation (for review see <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Schroer, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Consistent with these multiple cellular roles, dynein and dynactin function are required in higher eukaryotes. Loss of dynein or dynactin is lethal in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gepner et al., 1996</xref>), and mice homozygous for loss of cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain die early in embryogenesis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Harada et al., 1998</xref>). Cells cultured from dynein heavy chainânull embryos show fragmented Golgi and a dispersal of endosomes and lysosomes throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Harada et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>Neurons appear to be particularly susceptible to defects in dyneinâdynactin complex function. The dominant-negative mutation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Glued, which encodes a truncated form of the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin, shows defects that are most profound in neurons (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Harte and Kankel, 1983</xref>). Two <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosureaâinduced point mutations in cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain cause slowly progressive motor neuron disease in mice (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hafezparast et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Legs at odd angles</italic> (<italic>Loa</italic>) and <italic>Cramping</italic> (<italic>Cra1</italic>) mice each carry missense mutations in a highly conserved domain of cytoplasmic dynein that mediates subunit interactions. When homozygous, these mutations are lethal; heterozygous mice exhibit progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hafezparast et al., 2003</xref>). A similar phenotype is observed in transgenic mice with a targeted disruption of dynactin in motor neurons (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">LaMonte et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>In humans, a G59S missense mutation has been identified in the gene encoding p150<sup>Glued</sup> (DCTN1) in a kindred with slowly progressive motor neuron disease (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2003</xref>). Affected patients develop adult-onset vocal fold paralysis, facial weakness, and distal-limb muscle weakness and atrophy. Clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological investigations have confirmed the selective loss of motor neurons in this disorder (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2005</xref>). p150<sup>Glued</sup> is the dynactin subunit responsible for binding to dynein and microtubules (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Waterman-Storer et al., 1995</xref>). The G59S substitution occurs in the highly conserved NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cytoskeleton-associated protein, glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain, which interacts directly with microtubules (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Waterman-Storer et al., 1995</xref>) and the microtubule plus-end protein EB1 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ligon et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined the biochemical and cellular effects of the G59S substitution in p150<sup>Glued</sup>. Our data suggest that the G59S mutation leads to both decreased microtubule binding and enhanced dynein and dynactin aggregation, suggesting that both loss of function and toxic gain of function contribute to the motor neuron degeneration observed in affected patients.</p>

        <title>The G59S mutation disrupts the binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to microtubules and EB1</title>
        <p>The G59S mutation is located within the highly conserved CAP-Gly domain of the p150<sup>Glued</sup> polypeptide, a domain that mediates the binding of dynactin to microtubules. We compared the microtubule binding affinities of wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The CAP-Gly domain of wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup>, which spans residues 1â107, bound weakly to microtubules (unpublished data). This 1â107 peptide lacks the serine-rich region of p150<sup>Glued</sup> (111â191), which may be required for efficient microtubule binding by CAP-Gly proteins (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hoogenraad et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the binding of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residues 1â333 of the wild-type protein to microtubules was robust, with a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> of 1.1 Â± 0.2 Î¼M. The 1â333 fragment of p150<sup>Glued</sup> carrying the G59S mutation bound to microtubules with a <italic>K</italic>
<sub>d</sub> of 2.6 Â± 0.5 Î¼M, indicating a modest decrease in affinity. More striking, however, was the observation that even at saturating microtubule concentrations, only half of the mutant protein was able to bind to microtubules in this assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Similar results were observed in experiments with full-length wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> (unpublished data).</p>

<bold>The G59S mutation impairs the binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to microtubules.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of p150<sup>Glued</sup>. Glycine 59 lies in the CAP-Gly microtubule binding domain. The 1â107 fragment contains the CAP-Gly domain, and the 1â333 fragment contains the CAP-Gly domain, an adjacent serine-rich domain (residues 111â191), and a small part of the first predicted coiled-coil domain. (B) Wild-type (WT) and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> were expressed in vitro and incubated with increasing concentrations of microtubules. The microtubule bound and unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation and visualized by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The fraction bound, as determined by densitometry, was plotted against the concentration of tubulin Â± SEM and fitted to a rectangular hyperbola. (C) COS7 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type (top) or G59S (bottom) p150<sup>Glued</sup>. Cells were fixed after 48 h and stained for GFP (green) and microtubules (red). Bar, 10 Î¼m.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We performed sequential microtubule binding experiments, in which the unbound fraction of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> (1â333) protein was incubated for a second time with a saturating concentration of microtubules (25 Î¼M), and observed that â¼60% of the protein pelleted with microtubules (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1</ext-link>). These data suggest that there may be a rapid equilibrium between two populations of the mutant polypeptide, one that can bind and one that cannot. Mixing of wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> at a 1:1 ratio resulted in 60% of protein pelleting with 25 Î¼M microtubules (Fig. S1 B). These data suggest that mutant protein does not significantly inhibit the binding of wild-type polypeptide to microtubules.</p>
        <p>We next investigated the effects of the mutation on the binding of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to microtubules in cells. We used transient transfection assays to compare the distribution of wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> in COS7 cells as well as MN1 cells, motor neuronâlike cells that extend neurites (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Grueso et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 1998</xref>). Although endogenous dynactin generally has a punctate cellular localization, with decoration of dynamic microtubule plus ends, overexpression of p150<sup>Glued</sup> results in the decoration of the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Waterman-Storer et al., 1995</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, 24â48 h after transfection of GFP-tagged full-length constructs of wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup>, there was decoration of microtubules, as assessed by colocalization with tubulin. In contrast, GFP-tagged full-length G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm and showed no colocalization with tubulin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using GFP-tagged NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 1â333 constructs of wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>, as well as untagged full-length wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> constructs (unpublished data). We performed microtubule binding experiments using protein extract from COS7 cells that had been transfected with GFP-tagged, full-length p150<sup>Glued</sup>. Almost all of the exogenous polypeptide from wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup>âtransfected cells pelleted with taxol-stabilized microtubules. However, only approximately half of the protein from G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>âtransfected cells pelleted with microtubules (unpublished data). This observation confirms our in vitro data that only a portion of the G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> protein population may be available for microtubule binding.</p>
        <p>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal CAP-Gly domain of p150<sup>Glued</sup> binds to EB1 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ligon et al., 2003</xref>). Crystallographic studies demonstrate that the COOH terminus of EB1 contacts p150<sup>Glued</sup> in a hydrophobic cleft of the CAP-Gly domain (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore examined the binding of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> to EB1 using affinity chromatography. The wild-type peptide bound to the EB1 column and was retained until elution with high ionic strength buffer, but the G59S peptide had decreased retention on the column, indicating reduced affinity for EB1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p>

Load (L), flow-through (F), wash (W), and eluate fractions (E1 and E2) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a polyclonal antibody to p150<sup>Glued</sup>. There is less G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> in the eluate fractions, in comparison to wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup>, indicating a decrease in G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> affinity for EB1.

        <p>Previous studies have shown that p150<sup>Glued</sup> tracks dynamically with growing microtubule ends together with EB1 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan et al., 1999</xref>). To investigate the effect of the G59S mutation on the localization of p150<sup>Glued</sup> to microtubule plus ends, we transfected COS7 cells with GFP-labeled wild-type or G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>. We selected for cells with low levels of expression, as microtubule plus-end tracking behavior is not evident at higher expression levels because of the decoration and bundling of microtubules induced by high levels of exogenous p150<sup>Glued</sup>. Wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup> tracked dynamically with growing microtubule ends (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1</ext-link>), whereas the G59S construct showed no microtubule association, even at tips (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Video 2). In cells with higher levels of expression of the G59S construct, we noted apparent aggregates of misfolded protein, but these aggregates showed no directed movement (Video 2).</p>

        <title>The G59S mutation does not alter the structural integrity of the dynactin complex</title>
        <p>To study the cellular effects of the G59S mutation in the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin, we established fibroblast and lymphoblast cell lines from two symptomatic individuals known to be heterozygous for the G59S missense allele. Control fibroblast cell lines were obtained from two age-matched control individuals, and a control lymphoblast cell line was derived from an age-matched subject.</p>
        <p>In these lines, we examined whether the G59S mutation alters the expression of dynein and dynactin. In both lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA levels showed no difference in p150<sup>Glued</sup> transcript levels between cell lines heterozygous for the G59S mutation and control cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Western blots of protein extract from patient cell lines showed up-regulation of levels p150<sup>Glued</sup>, but not of dynein or other dynactin subunits, compared with control cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and D</xref>).</p>

        <p>To determine whether the wild-type and mutant proteins are both expressed in cells cultured from patients heterozygous for the G59S mutation, we performed quantitative Western blotting using both a monoclonal antibody to the microtubule binding region of p150<sup>Glued</sup>, which binds the wild-type protein with a much higher affinity than the mutant protein, and a polyclonal antibody to p150<sup>Glued</sup>, which recognizes both forms equally well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Analysis of patient cells indicated that the total level of p150<sup>Glued</sup> expression (as determined using the polyclonal antibody) is 147 Â± 7% the level observed in control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Western blots with the monoclonal antibody demonstrated that patient cells express 82 Â± 4% of the wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup> that control cells express (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Thus, we estimate that the mutant protein makes up â¼44% of the total p150<sup>Glued</sup> population in patient cells.</p>
        <p>To examine the structural integrity of the dynactin complex, we fractionated cell extracts from the patient-derived and control fibroblast cell lines by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Intact dynactin was observed to sediment at â¼19S in both the patient and control samples, consistent with the large size of the multimeric complex. No significant pool of unincorporated p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunits was observed in the lower S value fractions from either the patient or control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>), suggesting that expression of the mutant polypeptide does not significantly disrupt dynactin structure and that the mutant polypeptide is incorporated into dynactin in these cells.</p>

        <p>Incorporation of the mutant polypeptide into dynactin might be expected to disrupt dynactin localization in patient-derived cells; however, we observed no change in the cellular localization of dynactin in fibroblasts derived from patients compared with control fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref> and Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1</ext-link>). Dynactin was present diffusely in the cytoplasm in a fine, punctate pattern, with no visible dynactin aggregates. We also noted no change in the cellular localization of cytoplasmic dynein, which was also found in a punctate cellular distribution, partially overlapping with dynactin staining in both patient and control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), or EB1, which was localized specifically to microtubule tips (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>).</p>

        <title>The G59S mutation in p150<sup>Glued</sup> impairs dynactin function</title>
        <p>To test the patient fibroblasts for dynactin function, we looked at several dynein/dynactin-dependent processes. Dynactin, as well as dynein and the dynein-interacting protein LIS1, are necessary for directed fibroblast migration (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dujardin et al., 2003</xref>). However, wounded monolayers of patient cells recovered at the same rate as control cells (unpublished data). Aggresome formation has also been shown to be dynein dependent (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al., 2002</xref>). To test the effect of the mutation on aggresome formation, an androgen receptor containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat that induces inclusion formation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Merry et al., 1998</xref>) was expressed in patient fibroblasts. These fibroblasts formed inclusions at a rate indistinguishable from control cells (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>Although a single wild-type copy of the gene for p150<sup>Glued</sup> may be sufficient to mediate dynein-dependent processes under normal conditions, conditions of cellular stress may reveal latent effects of the G59S mutation. Nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, causes dispersal of the Golgi. During recovery from nocodazole treatment, microtubules reassemble and the Golgi fragments coalesce near the centrosome in a dynein/dynactin-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Corthesy-Theulaz et al., 1992</xref>). <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hafezparast et al. (2003)</xref> have shown a slowing in the recovery of the Golgi after nocodazole treatment in fibroblasts cultured from homozygous <italic>Loa</italic> mice. Therefore, we assayed the cytoskeletal and organelle recovery rates in heterozygous G59S and control fibroblasts after nocodazole washout. Microtubules were depolymerized and the Golgi body dispersed after 1 h of nocodazole treatment. 1 h after drug washout, microtubules had reassembled in both control and patient-derived cells; however, Golgi complex morphology was significantly different in patient cells. In control cells, 75 Â± 2% of cells had an intact Golgi complex, 22 Â± 3% of cells had a partially disrupted Golgi complex, and 3 Â± 1% of cells had completely disrupted Golgi complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). In contrast, in patient-derived cells only 46 Â± 8% of cells had intact Golgi complexes, whereas 44 Â± 5% of cells showed partial disruption and 11 Â± 6% of cells showed complete disruption of the Golgi. Golgi reassembly after 24 h was essentially normal in patient-derived fibroblasts (unpublished data), indicating that expression of mutant dynactin slows but does not block the minus endâdirected transport of Golgi elements toward the microtubule organizing center.</p>

        <p>We also observed that the localization of EB1 to microtubule plus-end tips was altered in patient cells during nocodazole recovery. After microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole, EB1 demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic staining. After 30 min of recovery in conditioned growth media, EB1 was localized specifically to the plus ends of microtubules in control cells, forming comet tails that were 1.20 Â± 0.06 Î¼m long (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). In patient-derived cells, EB1 was not limited to microtubule tips but was also observed to localize along microtubules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). EB1 tail length increased significantly in patient-derived cells, often to &gt;5 Î¼m, although overlap of adjacent microtubules prevented exact measurements of the elongated EB1 tails. These data suggest a defect in the specific localization of EB1 to microtubule plus ends.</p>
        <p>To compare these data to a loss of function of dynactin, we used RNA interference to knockdown p150<sup>Glued</sup> expression levels in HeLa cells by 70â90% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). This knockdown caused dispersal of the Golgi throughout the cell body (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In addition, we observed an increase in the length of EB1 comet tails from 1.08 Â± 0.05 Î¼m in mock-transfected cells to 1.28 Â± 0.07 Î¼m in cells transfected with small interfering RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). The lengthening of EB1 comet tails is similar to what was observed in patient fibroblasts recovering from nocodazole treatment and correlates with a loss of dynactin function.</p>

        <title>The G59S mutation leads to aberrant aggregation of p150<sup>Glued</sup>
</title>
        <p>In the microtubule binding assays described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, we observed the binding of only half of the mutant p150<sup>Glued</sup> polypeptide to microtubules, suggesting that some portion of the mutant protein population is unavailable for binding to microtubules. To investigate this further, we expressed differentially tagged (T7 and His) truncated forms of wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> in vitro and performed immunoprecipitation with an antibody to the T7 tag. Although our constructs, which include amino acids 1â333, span part of the first coiled-coil domain of p150<sup>Glued</sup> hypothesized to mediate dimerization (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Schroer, 2004</xref>), we observed no association of the T7- and His-tagged wild-type polypeptides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). However, we did observe coimmunoprecipitation of the differentially tagged NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal G59S constructs. These data suggest that the G59S polypeptide, but not the wild type, has a tendency to self-associate. There was no coimmunoprecipitation after incubation of differentially tagged wild-type and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> (unpublished data), indicating that the wild-type and G59S proteins do not interact under these conditions.</p>

        <p>We next investigated whether aberrant biochemical species of the G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> protein could be isolated from protein extracts of cells overexpressing this protein. COS7 cells were transfected with full-length wild-type or G59S GFP-tagged p150<sup>Glued</sup>. 24 h after transfection, the extract from these cells was fractionated over a sucrose gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and Western blot. In cells transfected with wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup>, the peak concentration of dynamitin and endogenous p150<sup>Glued</sup> was at 19S (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). The exogenous p150<sup>Glued</sup> protein (as determined by the increase in molecular weight that is due to the GFP tag) was present at 19S, as well as at less dense fractions. This indicates that some exogenous protein is incorporated into the dynactin complex but some remains unincorporated in lower molecular weight fractions, most likely because its expression is in excess of the other subunits of dynactin. In contrast, extracts from cells transfected with GFP-tagged G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> demonstrated higher molecular weight species in fractions 2â4. This suggests the presence of aggregated forms of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> with a molecular weight well above that of endogenous dynactin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Endogenous p150<sup>Glued</sup> and dynamitin are not present in these fractions, indicating that they do not copurify with the aggregated protein. The aggregated protein remains soluble, as we did not observe the formation of detergent-insoluble aggregates (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> was cytoplasmically dispersed in COS7 cells 24â48 h after transfection, whereas wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup> decorated microtubules. At longer time points, however, we noted a centripetal localization of the proteins. Wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup> became preferentially localized along microtubules in the perinuclear region (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In contrast, G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> localized to inclusions surrounding the nucleus, which may correspond to the aggresomes of misfolded protein described by <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Johnston et al. (2002)</xref>. These structures were also observed in very highly expressing cells at earlier time points, but their frequency increased with time after transfection (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511068/DC1</ext-link>). In some MN1 cells transfected with GFP-tagged G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>, single or multiple inclusions were evident most often in the cell body (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>) and rarely in neurites. They were similar in appearance to those observed in motor neurons from the brainstem of an affected patient (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2005</xref>), and their frequency increased with time after transfection (Fig. S3). Inclusions stained positive for dynein intermediate chain (DIC), the Golgi marker GM130, and the 20S proteasome but not kinesin heavy chain, microtubules, neurofilaments, vimentin, microtubule-associated protein 2, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and survival of motor neurons, (unpublished data). Thus, in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells, mutation of the glycine 59 appears to decrease microtubule binding by the p150<sup>Glued</sup> CAP-Gly domain and leads to aggregation and inclusion formation by the mutant protein.</p>

It may be that mitochondria cannot be transported to the cell periphery because of aberrant interaction with the aggregated G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>.

        <title>Overexpression of Hsp70 inhibits formation of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> aggregates and prevents cell death</title>
        <p>Overexpression of the chaperone Hsp70 has been reported to suppress protein aggregate formation and prevent cell death in several protein misfolding disease models (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Barral et al., 2004</xref>). 56 Â± 6% of COS7 cells expressing the G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> protein for 2 d contained visible inclusions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, B and E</xref>). However, cells expressing both Hsp70 and G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> exhibited a disperse localization of both exogenous proteins and only 17 Â± 4% of transfected cells contained visible inclusions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, C and E</xref>). Hsp70 containing the T13G mutation cannot undergo the conformational change necessary for chaperone activity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sousa and McKay, 1998</xref>). In cells cotransfected with G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> and T13G Hsp70, the proportion of cells containing inclusions was not significantly different from that of cells transfected with G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> alone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, D and E</xref>). A Western blot of the cell protein lysates showed that levels of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> were decreased when wild-type, but not T13G, Hsp70 was coexpressed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 F</xref>). The chaperone function of Hsp70 may aid proper folding of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>, thereby avoiding the formation of inclusions and allowing effective degradation of the mutant protein by the ubiquitinâproteasome pathway.</p>
        <p>Transfection of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> into MN1 cells led to an increase in cell death compared with cells transfected with wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). However, coexpression of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> and wild-type Hsp70 reduced the percentage of MN1 cell death to levels similar to those of cells transfected with wild-type p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 G</xref>). This protection was not observed when MN1 cells were cotransfected with G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> and either empty vector or T13G Hsp70 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 G</xref>). These data demonstrate that expression of active Hsp70 reduces the amount of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> aggregates, decreases the amount of p150<sup>Glued</sup> expressed, and protects MN1 cells from the toxicity associated with expression of the mutant p150<sup>Glued</sup>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A key question in the analysis of many neurodegenerative diseases is the cell-type specificity observed: why would a mutation in a ubiquitously expressed protein preferentially affect a single cell type? This question is particularly critical in the study of motor neuron diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, in which multiple mutations in a ubiquitously expressed protein, SOD1, result in motor neuronâspecific degeneration and cell death. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including neuron-specific aggregation and defects in axonal transport (for review see <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bruijn et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>We focus on the cellular effects of a point mutation in the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin. Dynactin is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates, interacting with cytoplasmic dynein to serve as the major motor for microtubule minus endâdirected transport in the cell. The dyneinâdynactin complex is required for a range of cellular functions, including mitotic spindle assembly, ER-to-Golgi trafficking, and endosome and lysosome motility. Although complete loss of dynactin function is therefore likely to affect all cell types, patients expressing the G59S mutation in the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin develop an autosomal-dominant, slowly progressive degeneration specific to motor neurons (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The G59S missense mutation results in a subtle impairment of dynactin function. A subtle loss of function in a protein required for retrograde axonal transport may be sufficient to induce a slow degeneration of motor neurons. Mice with a targeted disruption in dynactin function or with point mutations in cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain exhibit a slowly progressive loss of motor neurons, resulting in muscle atrophy (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">LaMonte et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hafezparast et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>The G59S mutation also results in a toxic gain of function, as the G59S polypeptide is prone to aggregate. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Parrini et al. (2005)</xref> have shown that evolutionarily conserved glycines inhibit aggregation because of their low propensity to form Î² structure. The G59S substitution alters a highly conserved glycine residue within the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal CAP-Gly domain of the protein and is predicted to result in steric crowding and misfolding of this domain (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Comparisons of aggregate formation in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells overexpressing the G59S mutation suggest that motor neurons are uniquely vulnerable to aggregate formation, leading to enhanced cell death. One explanation for this observation is that motor neurons may not express adequate levels of chaperones to cope with the high levels of misfolded protein. Recent studies have shown that motor neurons are not able to up-regulate Hsp70 in response to cellular stress and that they are particularly vulnerable to depletion of Hsp70 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism, overexpression of Hsp70 led to decreased aggregations of the G59S polypeptide and decreased cell death.</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which aggregate formation leads to cell death remains to be determined. However, EM analysis of the aggregates demonstrates the presence of trapped organelles, including mitochondria. The aggregates may either actively trap organelles or passively disrupt microtubule-based transport via âorganelle jamsâ (for review see <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Holzbaur, 2004</xref>). The sequestration of cytoplasmic dynein in these aggregates, as observed in both transfected cells and patient motor neurons (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2005</xref>), would further disrupt axonal transport. This disruption in transport is likely to be most deleterious to motor neurons because of their overall size and extended axons.</p>
      <p>Based on our observations, we propose the following model to explain the motor neuronâspecific phenotype observed in patients expressing the G59S mutation in dynactin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). The mutation leads to a decreased efficiency in minus endâdirected transport. This subtle loss of function does not significantly perturb nonneuronal cells but may be sufficient to affect the overall efficiency of retrograde axonal transport in neurons. However, the mutation also results in a gain of function, as the G59S polypeptide has an enhanced propensity to misfold. Aggregation of the misfolded protein is concentration dependent, and the p150<sup>Glued</sup> polypeptide is highly expressed in motor neurons (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Melloni et al., 1995</xref>; unpublished data). Further, motor neurons may be specifically vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation of the G59S polypeptide because of insufficient expression of molecular chaperones. Finally, both the sequestration of active motors and the trapping of organelles by the p150<sup>Glued</sup> aggregates will further exacerbate the inhibition of axonal transport.</p>

<bold>Proposed mechanism of G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup>âmediated motor neuron toxicity.</bold> G59S p150<sup>Glued</sup> expression leads to motor neuron toxicity through three intersecting pathways that lead to cell death. The mutation causes impaired microtubule and EB1 binding, which leads to disrupted dynein/dynactin-based transport. In addition, the mutation causes misfolding of the CAP-Gly domain, which leads to aberrant self-association. The large proportion of unbound p150<sup>Glued</sup>, along with the high expression levels of p150<sup>Glued</sup> in neurons, leads to a high cytosolic concentration of misfolded mutant protein resulting in aggregates specifically in neurons. This gain of function may induce further impairment in axonal transport, either by physical blockage of the axon or by sequestration of dynein and dynactin, leading to motor neuronâspecific degeneration.</p>

      <p>Together, our data provide the foundation for a testable model for the cellular mechanisms leading to the motor neuronâspecific degeneration observed in patients expressing the G59S mutation, involving both loss of function and toxic gain of function. We anticipate that these studies will provide further insight into the mechanisms by which a mutation in an essential cellular protein can result in specific degeneration of motor neurons in vivo.</p>
