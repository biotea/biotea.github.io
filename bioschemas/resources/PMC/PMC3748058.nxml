          <title>Background</title>
          <p>In eukaryotes the genetic material is enclosed by a continuous membrane system, the nuclear envelope (NE). Along the NE specific proteins assemble to form meshworks and mutations in these proteins have been described in a group of human diseases called laminopathies. Laminopathies include lipodystrophies, muscle and cardiac diseases as well as metabolic or progeroid syndromes. Most laminopathies are caused by mutations in the <italic>LMNA</italic>gene encoding lamins A/C. Together with Nesprins (<bold>N</bold>uclear <bold>E</bold>nvelope <bold>Sp</bold>ectrin <bold>R</bold>epeat Prote<bold>ins</bold>) they are core components of the LINC complex (<bold>Li</bold>nker of <bold>N</bold>ucleoskeleton and <bold>C</bold>ytoskeleton). The LINC complex connects the nucleoskeleton and the cytoskeleton and plays a role in the transfer of mechanically induced signals along the NE into the nucleus, and its components have been attributed functions in maintaining nuclear and cellular organization as well as signal transduction.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Here we narrowed down the interaction sites between lamin A and Nesprin-2 to aa 403â425 in lamin A and aa 6146â6347 in Nesprin-2. Laminopathic mutations in and around the involved region of lamin A (R401C, G411D, G413C, V415I, R419C, L421P, R427G, Q432X) modulate the interaction with Nesprin-2 and this may contribute to the disease phenotype. The most notable mutation is the lamin A mutation Q432X that alters LINC complex protein assemblies and causes chromosomal and transcription factor rearrangements.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Mutations in Nesprin-2 and lamin A are characterised by complex genotype phenotype relations. Our data show that each mutation in <italic>LMNA</italic>analysed here has a distinct impact on the interaction among both proteins that substantially explains how distinct mutations in widely expressed genes lead to the formation of phenotypically different diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A hallmark of eukaryotes is the compartmentalization of the cell and the presence of organelles. Among them, the largest one is the nucleus that harbors the genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a continuous membrane system, the nuclear envelope (NE), that consists of two concentric membranes, inner (INM) and outer (ONM) nuclear membrane. They are separated by the perinuclear space and integrated along the nuclear pore complexes. The ONM is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Membrane invaginations that might consist of one or both nuclear membranes can reach into the nucleus to form the nucleoplasmic reticulum <xref rid="pone.0071850-Malhas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Research in the past decade revealed the existence of large macromolecular protein complexes present along or across the nuclear membranes <xref rid="pone.0071850-Taranum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0071850-Crisp1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The biological importance of these assemblies is becoming more and more evident since the number of human diseases that are known to arise from mutations in their components is continuously increasing. However, the majority is due to mutations in lamin A/C proteins which are encoded by the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene.</p>
      <p>Lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins that form a meshwork underlying the INM. They are grouped into A- and B-type lamins. The latter ones are encoded by the <italic>LMNB1</italic> (lamin B1) and <italic>LMNB2</italic> (lamin B2) gene <xref rid="pone.0071850-Worman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The <italic>LMNA</italic> gene encodes four A-type lamins (A, AD10, C and C2) that are generated by alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications. Lamins A and C represent the major isoforms. The structure of lamins follows a tripartide organization into an N-terminal head, a central rod domain and a C-terminal tail. Lamins assemble by forming parallel head to tail dimers stabilized by coiled coil structures in the central rod domain. Dimers then assemble into a head to tail polymer. Higher order structures are achieved by anti-parallel, lateral polymer assemblies, the protofilaments <xref rid="pone.0071850-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Three to four protofilaments assemble to intermediate filaments with a diameter of about 10 nm <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>So far more than 400 disease causing mutations have been reported spread along the entire <italic>LMNA</italic>gene <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Bertrand1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These mutations cause several distinct diseases that include forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, metabolic syndrome and lipodystrophy, neuropathies and progeroid syndromes. This is surprising as lamin A/C proteins are ubiquitously expressed proteins and points towards tissue or development specific interactions <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently three mutually non-exclusive hypotheses exist to explain how mutations in nuclear envelope proteins might result in the formation of laminopathies <xref rid="pone.0071850-Bertrand1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The first one is the structural hypothesis that refers to the role of LINC complex components in maintaining nuclear architecture and mechanotransduction across the nuclear envelope. Mutations in LINC complex components might cause weakened or strengthened interactions that lead to misshapen nuclei, a hallmark of laminopathies, and impaired transfer of mechanically induced signals across the NE <xref rid="pone.0071850-Kandert1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Lammerding1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The second hypothesis explains the role of NE proteins in the formation in laminopathies by their ability to regulate signaling events in a way distinct from mechanotransduction. Various NE proteins have been shown to interact, sequester and regulate transcription factor accessibility to the nucleus and chromatin and therefore control the gene expression profile of a cell <xref rid="pone.0071850-Rashmi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The third hypothesis explains the formation of laminopathies by the accumulation of mutated lamin proteins and the accompanied cell toxic gain of function of these aggregates <xref rid="pone.0071850-Capanni1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Along the nuclear envelope lamins A/C interact with integral proteins of the NE like SUN-1/-2, Emerin, with transcription factors like Fos, SREBP1 and with organizers of chromatin organization like histones or the cell cycle regulator Cyclin D3 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Clements1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0071850-Mariappan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Additionally, lamins A/C interact with Nesprin-2 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Libotte1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Nesprins (<bold>N</bold>uclear <bold>E</bold>nvelope <bold>Sp</bold>ectrin <bold>R</bold>epeat Prote<bold>ins</bold>) are proteins that mainly reside along the INM and ONM. So far four Nesprins have been described in mammals (Nesprin-1, -2, -3 and -4). Each is encoded by a single gene that gives rise to multiple isoforms. The number of identified isoforms is still increasing. So far 21 isoforms have been identified for Nesprin-1 and 14 for Nesprin-2 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Rajgor1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For Nesprin-3 two variants are known and one for the epithelial specific Nesprin-4 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Roux1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Wilhelmsen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Nesprins broadly differ in their molecular masses from the smaller Nesprin-3 (â¼100 kDa) and 4 (â¼40 kDa) to the biggest, the so called giant isoforms of Nesprin-1 and -2 that reach up to 1 MDa or 800 kDa, respectively. Structural characteristics that are shared by most Nesprin isoforms are the C-terminal KASH (<bold>K</bold>larsicht/<bold>A</bold>NC-1/<bold>S</bold>yne <bold>h</bold>omology) domain that is a transmembrane domain and spectrin repeats that form the basis of the central rod segment. Even the largest Nesprins contain only one transmembrane segment that is sufficient for connecting the proteins with the membrane. The KASH domain additionally contains a consensus motif at the C-terminus for the interaction with integral proteins of the INM, the SUN (Sad1/UNC-84) proteins. The interaction of the KASH domain of the Nesprins and the SUN domain of the SUN proteins in the PNS forms the core of the LINC complex. The LINC complex is a protein complex that traverses the nuclear envelope for the direct and mechanic coupling of nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic components <xref rid="pone.0071850-Crisp1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. At their N-termini the different Nesprins contain binding sites that mediate direct or indirect connections to the actin filament system, microtubules or the intermediate filament system and therefore an integration of the nucleus into the cytoskeleton of cells.</p>
      <p>Knowledge about nuclear envelope proteins and their involvement in the formation of large macromolecular protein complexes along the nuclear envelope is continuously increasing. However, the exact nature of the interaction sites between certain LINC complex components and the effect of distinct mutations for particular interactions are still incomplete. A detailed understanding of protein interactions will help to understand the pathological role of disease causing mutations. In the present study we have narrowed down the interaction sites between lamin A/C and Nesprin-2 and explored the impact of eight laminopathic <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations [R401C (1201C&gt;T) <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Vytopil1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Capanni2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, G411D (1232G&gt;A) <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dutour1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, G413C (1237G&gt;T) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umd.be/LMNA">www.umd.be/LMNA</ext-link>), V415I (1243G&gt;A) <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Brauch1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, R419C (1255C&gt;T) <xref rid="pone.0071850-Haque2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, L421P (1262T&gt;C) <xref rid="pone.0071850-Caron1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Decaudain1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, R427G (1279C&gt;G) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umd.be/LMNA">www.umd.be/LMNA</ext-link>), Q432X (1294C&gt;T) <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dittmer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Moller1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>] on the binding capacities of Nesprin-2 for lamin A/C and the formation of LINC complex assemblies. Mutations in lamin A/C affected the interaction with Nesprin-2 in a spectrum from increasing to decreasing. However most of the described mutations had no obvious effect on the localization of NE proteins along the NE. An exception was the truncation mutation Q432X that caused severe aggregate formations of the mutated lamin A/C protein and the sequestration of nuclear envelope proteins.</p>

        <title>C-termini of Nesprin-2 and lamin A interact</title>
        <p>We defined here the exact binding sites between lamin A/C and Nesprin-2 by performing a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> pull down experiments with purified recombinant Nesprin-2 and lamin A proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). GST tagged Nesprin-2 polypeptides we used for our studies were derived from the C-terminus encompassing aa 6146â6799 of human Nesprin-2 giant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). We have described these polypeptides before as Nesprin-2 SRs 19â22 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Libotte1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, however here we have renamed them according to a recent detailed structural analysis predicting almost the entire Nesprin-2 sequence is made from more or less well conserved spectrin repeats <xref rid="pone.0071850-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For lamin A we used polypeptides spanning amino acids 1â548 of human lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Nesprin-2 SR 52â56 coprecipitated with lamin A amino acids 345â425 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Using lamin A polypeptides 264â402 and 345â425 which share an overlapping sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) we found that Nesprin-2 SR 52â56 did not coprecipitate with lamin A 264â402, letting us conclude that the interaction site of lamin A for Nesprin-2 lies within the amino acids 403â425 of lamin A. To further define the interaction site lamin A fragments were incubated with GFP Nesprin-2 polypeptides expressed in COS7 cells. Nesprin-2 SR 52,53 showed the strongest interaction to lamin A, whereas no interaction was found for SR55, 56. A weak signal was detected for SR53, 54, 55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). To confirm the afore described interaction, we cloned the sequences containing the lamin A interaction site for Nesprin-2 (lamin A aa 403â425) into a GFP expression vector and incubated these proteins with purified Nesprin-2 polypeptides, which confirmed the interaction of lamin A to Nesprin-2 SR52,53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Finally, we addressed the question if lamin A binds to SR52 or SR53 and found that Nesprin-2 SR53 is sufficient to precipitate GFP lamin A aa 403â425 from total cell lysates. The GFP lamin A 403â425 signal for SR53 was always much weaker compared to Nesprin-2 SR52,53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Taken together aa 403â425 in lamin A and aa 6146â6347 corresponding to SR52,53 in Nesprin-2 mediate the interaction between both proteins.</p>

        <title>Influence of <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations on the distribution of interaction partners</title>
        <p>To test if mutations in lamin A cause changes in NE protein assemblies, the distribution of WT and mutated GFP lamin A and endogenous LINC complex components was studied in immunofluorescence analysis. We utilized HaCaT and COS7 cells which differ with respect to their morphology and the expression levels of Nesprins. Previous work from our group demonstrated that HaCaT keratinocytes express higher Nesprin-2 protein levels compared to fibroblast cells <xref rid="pone.0071850-Kandert1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Zhen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The fibroblasts like COS7 cells express lower levels of Nesprin-2 as compared to HaCaT keratinocytes. We found all GFP fusion proteins localizing along the nuclear envelope like WT lamin A. GFP lamin A Q423X proteins showed a different distribution. In COS7 as well as in HaCaT cells Q432X localized along the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, asterisk), additionally, GFP lamin A Q432X proteins formed aggregates that seemed to appear along the NE rather than inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, thin arrow). In HaCaT cells Nesprin-2 was largely unaffected by these aggregates and showed the typical rim staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Only when large aggregates were present Nesprin-2 was also recruited to these aggregates (data not shown). By contrast, in COS7 cells Nesprin-2 was sequestered into large lamin A aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, arrowhead). In cells with intermediate sized aggregates one can observe both, a recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, thin arrow) and an absence of Nesprin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, bold arrow) in the aggregates. Different distributions were observed for further NE components like lamin B1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0071850.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) or Emerin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0071850.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). In HaCaT cells lamin B1 was present only in large aggregates, whereas in COS7 it appeared in both small and large aggregates. Emerin was present in large aggregates formed in both cell lines to comparable extend. Endogenous lamin A was also sequestered into GFP lamin A Q432X aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0071850.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> modulate binding affinities of lamin A for Nesprin-2</title>
        <p>Next we addressed the question if the lamin A mutations analysed here modulate the affinity to GST Nesprin-2 protein complexes. For this, we first made structural predictions of the region in lamin A that interacts with Nesprin-2 and found that the interaction site in lamin A is located in a loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This loop connects the Î± helical rod domain and the globular domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The affected amino acids should therefore be accessible for interactions.

C2C12 murine myoblasts were exposed to a 15 minutes heat shock and the percentage of misshapen nuclei was assessed before and after this treatment. No significant changes were observed among WT lamin A expressing cells before (10,33%Â±4,08 misshapen nuclei) or after (14,0%Â±4,05) heat shock. Stronger increases in the number of misshapen nuclei compared to the WT were observed for the lamin A mutations V415I (17,5%Â±4,08 before and 29,0%Â±3,41 after heat shock) and Q432X (29,5%Â±4,37 before and 40,83%Â±2,86 after heat shock). The extent of nuclear deformations caused by the lamin A mutations V415I and Q432X was similar in heat shock experiments performed in primary human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0071850.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Both lamin A mutations showed nuclear deformations characteristic for laminopathies including an uneven nuclear shape and nuclear blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Nuclear deformations were even more severe in cells expressing the mutant lamin A Q432X compared to V415I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).</p>

        <title>The perinculear actin cap remains unaffected by the lamin A mutations Q432X and V415I</title>
        <p>Since the lamin A mutation Q432X shows the most severe impact on interaction partners or nuclear morphology, we additionally addressed the question if the perinuclear actin cap is altered in the presence of mutated protein.

        <title>The lamin A Q432X mutation causes alterations in the chromatin and SRBP1 misplacement</title>
        <p>The lamin A mutation Q432X showed the most variable distribution along the NE that included the formation of aggregates and the sequestration of LINC complex components combined with decreased binding affinity to Nesprin-2 polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g004">4</xref>).

NE proteins control gene expression by modulating the organization of chromatin or regulating the accessibility of transcription factors to their nuclear targets <xref rid="pone.0071850-Heessen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. To explore the impact of the aggregates formed by GFP lamin A Q432X on chromatin structures, cells transiently expressing the mutated protein were stained with the DNA dye DAPI. At sites of strong aggregates the DAPI staining showed gaps indicating alterations in the chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g007">Fig. 7A</xref> Â´, arrow). Such a staining pattern was not seen in control cells. The opposite effect was detected for SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, also SRBP1 or SREBF1 (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1)), a transcriptional activator that belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcription factors.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Laminopathies are rare heterogenic human diseases with complex genotype phenotype relationships that can be classified into muscle diseases that preferentially affect skeletal or cardiac muscles, neuropathies that involve motor and sensory neurons, lipodystrophies that cause alterations in adipose tissues and premature ageing diseases <xref rid="pone.0071850-ZarembaCzogalla1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In earlier studies we had identified the Nesprin-2 C-terminal amino acid sequence 6146â6799 corresponding to Nesprin-2 SRs 52â56 as binding site for lamin A, here we mapped it between aa 6146â6347 (SR52,53) and the binding sites of Nesprin-2 to lamin A to aa 403â425. The previously reported interaction site between lamin A aa 243â387 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Libotte1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> could not be confirmed in the present study which might be a consequence of different experimental procedures or sterical properties of the lamin A peptides that were used. Aim of this study was to analyze the impact of laminopathy causing mutations on the interaction properties between lamin A and Nesprin-2.</p>
      <p>Laminopathies often occur in tissues that are under significant mechanical stress as it occurs in skeletal or cardiac muscles. Therefore it is of particular importance to analyze the interaction among core NE proteins and their NE distributions. We describe here eight <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations. Interestingly they can be classified as lipodystrophy (G411D, R419C, L421P) and skeletal and cardiac muscular dystrophies causing mutations (R401C, G413C, V415I, R427G, Q432X). Mutations triggering premature ageing diseases or neuropathic phenotypes have not been described in this binding region to Nesprin-2 so far, but cannot be excluded based on the progress in the field of DNA sequencing. All GFP lamin A proteins that were analysed here localize along the NE. In agreement with earlier studies of ectopically overexpressed WT and mutant lamin A proteins, we observed some cells that showed altered localizations. The degree of altered localization patterns differed between HaCaT keratinocytes and COS7 fibroblasts. HaCaT cells seem to have a more stable nuclear morphology and are less prone to nuclear deformation than fibroblasts which confirms earlier findings and might be attributed to lower Nesprin expression in fibroblast cells <xref rid="pone.0071850-Kandert1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We excluded phenotypes that might be related to common morphological variations in these cells.</p>
      <p>GFP lamin A Q432X was the only mutation that caused significant alterations in the localization pattern along the nuclear envelope and formed strong aggregates. The GFP lamin A Q432X aggregates had a similar morphology as the ones caused by mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> that have been mapped at different positions along the lamin A protein. Aggregate formations have been described e.g. for the lamin A mutations D192G, N195K, M371K, R386K, R482L <xref rid="pone.0071850-Hubner1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Sylvius1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Bechert and colleagues analysed the distribution of WT, G465D, R482L and R527P lamin A and found that 24 hours after transfection the proteins localized to the nucleus or the NE. A prolonged expression resulted in the formation of aggregates with varying intensities among mutated or WT lamin A <xref rid="pone.0071850-Bechert1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. The situation was different for GFP lamin A Q432X. 24 hours after transfection the formation of aggregates in the majority of cells was observed in sharp contrast to all other mutant or WT lamin A proteins analysed here. As no primary cells were available we could not address the question if lamin A Q432X proteins in patient cells form aggregates. We analysed the distribution of further NE proteins along these aggregates and found that Nesprin-2, Emerin, Lamin B1, endogenous lamin A were sequestered into the aggregates. Considering the reduced binding ability between GFP Nesprin-2 SR 52â56 and lamin A Q432X, at first sight it appears surprising to see Nesprin-2 accumulations in these aggregates. A reasonable explanation for this is the enhanced presence of NE proteins Emerin or endogenous lamin A that might recruit endogenous Nesprin-2 into the aggregates.</p>
      <p>Even though we did not observe differences in the subcellular localization of most lamin A mutations analysed here, we further explored the effect of distinct mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> on the binding abilities between Nesprin-2 and lamin A by pull down experiments. Of note, such experiments do not examine the direct interaction between Nesprin-2 and lamin A, rather they show how mutated GFP lamin A proteins precipitate with GST Nesprin-2 polypeptides from whole cell lysates. Interestingly the binding site of lamin A to Nesprin-2 resides within a loop that harbors multiple potential phosphorylation sites <xref rid="pone.0071850-Maraldi1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> indicating that protein interactions in this part of lamin A occur highly regulated. The advantage of the experimental setting we have chosen is that GFP lamin A - GST Nesprin-2 SR52,53 protein complexes are precipitated from otherwise normal whole cell lysates which allows studying binding characteristics in the presence of additional LINC complex components expressed in these cells. Interestingly we observed a wide range of variations in the amounts of GFP lamin A proteins that were precipitated in pull down experiments that reached from enhanced (e.g. R401C, V415I) to decreased signals (e.g. Q432X) compared to WT GFP lamin A. Further mutations analysed here showed mild alterations. The truncation in Q432X does not include the amino acids 403â425 that mediate the lamin A interaction to Nesprin-2. However lamin A Q432X precipitates in lower amounts with GST tagged Nesprin-2 polypeptides. A reasonable explanation for this is that the loss of the C-terminus of lamin A causes alterations in the three dimensional protein structure which might make the interacting amino acids less accessible. Over all these findings contribute to the explanation how distinct mutations in ubiquitously expressed proteins like lamin A lead to the formation of diseases with strong variations in their clinical manifestations as it is known for laminopathies. Distinct mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> have distinct effects on the formation of NE protein assemblies as it is shown here for interaction between the core NE components Nesprin-2 and lamin A. However the impact of distinct mutations on the interaction between Nesprin-2 and lamin A is not reflected in the aspect of nuclear stability. On the protein level lamin A V415I causes an enhanced interaction with Nesprin-2, whereas the lamin A Q432X interaction is weaker compared to the WT. At the immunofluorescence level they show differential distributions as well. Lamin A V415I is indistinguishable from the control, lamin A Q432X causes the formation of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, both mutations cause cardiomyopathic phenotypes, lone atrial fibrillation is caused by lamin A V415I and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy by lamin A Q432X. When we expressed both mutations in murine myoblasts or primary fibroblasts and treated them with a heat shock at 42Â°C both mutations led to a significant increase in the numbers of misshapen nuclei which shows that each mutation has additional distinct effects on NE protein assemblies. The underlying molecular mechanisms for the discrepancy between the contradictory behavior of the mutations V415I and Q432X in pull down experiments and a similar tendency in the heat stress experiments might be related to the complexity of NE protein assemblies. Lamins exhibit tripartite organization and are composed of an N-terminal head, a central rod and a C-terminal tail. The tail region that is missing in Q432X might impair the assembly of lamins into a meshwork and thus lead to pronounced nuclear fragility. On the other side the mutation V415I precipitates stronger with GST Nesprin-2 polypeptides indicating that this mutation modulates the binding properties among the NE protein network that finally results in enhanced nuclear fragility.</p>
      <p>Nesprin-2 is an actin binding protein that connects the NE to the perinuclear cytoskeleton. Recently the Wirtz group identified a perinuclear actin cap that consists of highly organized actin fibers closely connected to the apical surface of the interphase nucleus <xref rid="pone.0071850-Khatau1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. LINC complexes physically connect the actin cap to the NE, and the actin cap is required to maintain the interphase nuclear shape and is likely involved in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. Malfunctions in the actin cap might explain the pathological role of distinct lamin A mutations. An intact lamina and LINC complexes are necessary for a functional actin cap <xref rid="pone.0071850-Chambliss1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In GFP lamin A Q432X and V415I expressing cells the overall actin cap structure remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071850-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In lamin A Q432X expressing cells we observed a subset of phalloidin positive lamin A Q432X aggregates. The fact that not all aggregates were phalloidin positive might be explained with the highly dynamic nature of the actin cap fibers that might form only in response to mechanical strain <xref rid="pone.0071850-Khatau1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. It remains to be determined if the observed changes in the actin structure lead to disturbed mechanotransduction from the extracellular milieu to the nucleus and thus contribute to the disease phenotype.</p>
      <p>Alterations in the binding affinities between Nesprin-2 and lamin A have consequences on the NE protein network that are transmitted to further binding partners. Since lamins localize along the inner surface of the INM and Nesprins as type II transmembrane proteins can be integrated into the INM or the ONM, the interaction between both proteins occurs along the INM and the functional impact of altered affinities reaches into the nucleus. Interestingly most lamin interactions have been mapped to the C-terminus <xref rid="pone.0071850-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and therefore overlap with the interaction side for Nesprin-2. Alterations in the binding affinities between both proteins therefore make lamins more or less accessible for other interactions. NE proteins have been described in maintaining chromosomal organization to provide a chromatin environment that is favorable or unfavorable for gene expression in which the position of a gene is related to its expression level <xref rid="pone.0071850-Heessen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Akhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Lamins directly interact with DNA or Histones. The DNA binding site of lamins A/C was mapped to aa 411â553 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Stierle1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> and aa 396â430 interact with histones <xref rid="pone.0071850-Taniura1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Both sites are close to or part of aa 403â425 that interact with Nesprin-2 and variations in the lamin adhesion to Nesprin-2 could thus affect chromosomal arrangements and consequentially gene expression. Mutated Q432X lamin A proteins show the most severe impact on chromosome structures by the formation of gaps that are formed in the otherwise even DNA staining at sides of aggregates.</p>
      <p>NE proteins additionally have functions in controlling the temporal and spatial accessibility of transcription factors to their nuclear targets. Lamins for example play a role in FOS or SREBP1 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Ivorra1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> signaling and Nesprins are part of SMAD, FOS and Wnt signal transduction <xref rid="pone.0071850-Rashmi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Mutated lamin A Q432X proteins form aggregates and sequester LINC complex components. To further explore the pathological role of this mutation, we analysed the impact of the mutated proteins on the subcellular distribution of the transcription factor SREBP1 that is a known interaction partner of lamin A. The interaction site of lamin A to SREBP1 lies between amino acids 389â664 and therefore overlaps with the binding lamin A site to Nesprin-2 <xref rid="pone.0071850-Lloyd1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. SREBP1 belongs to a group of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors with a wide spectrum of functions reaching from cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism to the regulation of muscle size and protein content <xref rid="pone.0071850-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dessalle1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Furthermore SREBP1 transcription factor regulate the expression of proteins involved in controlling muscle contractility like Titin or Troponins <xref rid="pone.0071850-Dessalle1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Lecomte1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. SREBP1 exists as an inactive precursor attached to the ER membrane and the NE. Cleavage of the SREBP1 precursor is initiated by sterol deficiency that releases the N-terminal part as a mature protein from the membrane that is translocated into the nucleus where it binds to the SRE1 (sterol regulatory element-1) DNA sequence in the promotor region of target genes <xref rid="pone.0071850-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Malfunctions in SREBP1 target genes lead to the formation of dilated cardiomyopathies <xref rid="pone.0071850-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071850-Herman1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. It remains to be determined to which degree nuclear instability or aggregates formed by lamin A Q432X proteins contribute to the pathological role of this particular mutation in the formation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>
