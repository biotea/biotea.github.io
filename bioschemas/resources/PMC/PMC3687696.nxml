        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is a membrane-embedded protein complex that catalyses the N-glycosylation of nascent polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a highly conserved biosynthetic process that enriches protein structure and function. All OSTs contain a homologue of the catalytic STT3 subunit, although in many cases this is assembled with several additional components that influence function. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, one such component is Ost4p, an extremely small membrane protein that appears to stabilise interactions between subunits of assembled OST complexes. OST4 has been identified as a putative human homologue, but to date neither its relationship to the OST complex, nor its role in protein N-glycosylation, have been directly addressed. Here, we establish that OST4 is assembled into native OST complexes containing either the catalytic STT3A or STT3B isoforms. Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that OST4 associates with both STT3 isoforms and with ribophorin I, an accessory subunit of mammalian OSTs. These presumptive interactions are perturbed by a single amino acid change in the transmembrane region of OST4. Using siRNA knockdowns and native gel analysis, we show that OST4 plays an important role in maintaining the stability of native OST complexes. Hence, upon OST4 depletion well-defined OST complexes are partially destabilised and a novel ribophorin I-containing subcomplex can be detected. Strikingly, cells depleted of either OST4 or STT3A show a remarkably similar defect in the N-glycosylation of endogenous prosaposin. We conclude that OST4 most likely promotes co-translational N-glycosylation by stabilising STT3A-containing OST isoforms.</p>

  <body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) is one of the most common and important covalent modifications of proteins in eukaryotic cells. The central step of this process occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), when a high-mannose oligosaccharide is transferred as one structural unit to asparagines, typically those present within Asn-X-Thr/Ser (where Xâ Pro) sequons located in flexible and surface-exposed segments of nascent polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kowarik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lizak et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to facilitating interactions of polypeptides with components of the ER-associated quality control and degradation machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Molinari, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aebi et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>N</italic>-glycans can accelerate protein folding and increase thermodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Shental-Bechor and Levy, 2008</xref>). Thus, N-glycosylation is essential to efficient protein folding and trafficking, and defects in this process lead to impaired biological function and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Schachter and Freeze, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Mohorko et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In many eukaryotes, N-glycosylation is catalysed by a hetero-oligomeric membrane protein complex of the rough ER, the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>). The OST complex associates with membrane-bound ribosomes at the Sec61 translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chavan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Harada et al., 2009</xref>), thereby functioning in concert with co-translational protein translocation across, or integration into, the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>). Although co-translational N-glycosylation appears to be mediated primarily by the catalytic STT3A isoform in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Nilsson et al., 2003</xref>), they also possess an STT3B isoform, which N-glycosylates some sites skipped by STT3A and modifies obligatory post-translational sequons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Sato et al., 2012</xref>). STT3A and STT3B are assembled with a shared set of non-catalytic subunits to form two distinct populations of OST complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>). These two classes of the OST complex differ in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity towards donor substrates with different oligosaccharide structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>); however, they can functionally complement each other to enable optimal protein N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>).</p><p>A range of different functions have been attributed to the non-catalytic OST subunits found in many eukaryotes. Hence, DAD1 and OST48, or their yeast equivalents, are required for the assembly of functional OSTs, and their perturbation destabilises OST complexes and causes severe hypoglycosylation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">te Heesen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Silberstein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). Ribophorin I selectively associates with a subset of membrane proteins and presents them to the OST active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Wilson and High, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>), whereas ribophorin II increases the N-glycosylation efficiency of the clinically important P-glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Honma et al., 2008</xref>). DAD1, OST48 and ribophorin II interact directly with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kelleher and Gilmore, 1997</xref>), and it has been suggested that the resulting subcomplex plays a role in supplying the lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor to the catalytic STT3 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Pathak et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beatson and Ponting, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kelleher et al., 2007</xref>). The novel OST subunits DC2 and KCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>) appear to be exclusive to higher eukaryotes, suggesting an increase in mechanistic complexity. Whereas KCP2 has an accessory role that is essential for the efficient N-glycosylation of a subset of precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>), the potential role of DC2 remains to be fully explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The contributions of mammalian N33 and its paralogue IAP to protein N-glycosylation are poorly characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>). However, on the basis of their apparent homology with the well studied yeast Ost3p and Ost6p components, it can be hypothesised that N33 and IAP may have disulfide oxidoreductase activity that modulates the oxidative folding of specific OST substrates, thereby promoting the N-glycosylation of defined sequons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Schulz and Aebi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Mammalian OST4 has been tentatively identified in association with the OST complex purified from canine pancreatic microsomes, and it shows clear sequence similarity to Ost4p, a small integral membrane protein subunit of the yeast OST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>). Yeast strains lacking Ost4p exhibit temperature sensitivity and impaired N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chi et al., 1996</xref>), and Ost4p forms stable, transmembrane domain (TM)-dependent, interactions with Stt3p and Ost3p/Ost6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Karaoglu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, Ost4p may perform a scaffold-like role to recruit either Ost3p or Ost6p into yeast OST complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the interacting partners of mammalian OST4 have not been investigated in detail and any potential role that it may play during protein N-glycosylation has not been addressed.</p><p>In this study, we show that human OST4 assembles into native OST complexes containing STT3A or STT3B. Co-immunoprecipitation and mutagenesis studies suggest a TM-dependent association of OST4 with endogenous ribophorin I and exogenous STT3A and STT3B. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdowns, we demonstrate that the depletion of OST4 destabilises both STT3A- and STT3B-containing OST isoforms, releasing a ribophorin I-containing subcomplex from native OST complexes. At a functional level, we provide the first direct evidence that efficient N-glycosylation of a model precursor protein, prosaposin, requires normal OST4 expression, underlining its potential contribution to effective OST function. Taken together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the structure and function of the N-glycosylation machinery of the mammalian ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Evolutionary conservation of OST4 proteins</title><p>A BLAST search using the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ost4p sequence revealed OST4 homologues in diverse eukaryotes, encompassing animal, plant, fungal and protist kingdoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Zubkov et al., 2004</xref>). Alignment of representative sequences showed that vertebrate OST4 proteins are 94% identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1</xref>). This high level of conservation is concentrated in the first 28 residues of the protein, whereas the remaining sequence is poorly conserved and of variable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1</ext-link>). Even though the human OST4 sequence is substantially divergent from that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (36% overall identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1</xref>), the hydropathy plots are very similar and suggest that both proteins contain a single TM span (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S2</ext-link>).

The TM segment of yeast Ost4p extends from residues Leu10 to Val28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Zubkov et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that residues Phe10 to Val28 of human OST4 are most likely located within the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1A</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S2</ext-link>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gayen and Kang, 2011</xref>).

We therefore transiently expressed a C-terminal FLAG-tagged human OST4 protein in COS-7 cells. Co-staining with anti-FLAG antibody and an antibody against the ER membrane protein calnexin showed substantial co-localisation of both the wild-type protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3</ext-link>, OST4-FLAG panel) and a point mutant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3</ext-link>, V23K OST4-FLAG panel; see also below) with calnexin. Although it is entirely possible that this localisation reflects an ER retention phenotype that is specific to the exogenous OST4-FLAG, these results are consistent with OST-FLAG being correctly integrated into the ER membrane where it might associate with native OST complexes.</p><p>In contrast to yeast Ost4p, the association of the presumptive mammalian OST4 with OST complexes has not been convincingly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Karaoglu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>). Based on our previous observation that the levels of OST components are comparatively high in liver-derived HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>), we examined the incorporation of endogenous OST4 into native OST complexes by blue native (BN)-PAGE analysis of digitonin-solubilised HepG2 homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>). Immunoblotting with antibodies specific for STT3A and STT3B was performed and, consistent with several previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Wang and Dobberstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>), STT3A was detected in two protein complexes of â¼470âkDa and â¼500âkDa (OSTC470 and OSTC500, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>, lane 5), whereas STT3B could be observed only in a large, heterogeneous complex of â¼520â580âkDa (OSTC550; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>, lane 1). Immunoblotting with antibodies against two previously characterised OST subunits, ribophorin I and ribophorin II, revealed clear evidence for their presence in all three distinct OST isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, using our anti-OST4 antibody, we could also observe detectable levels of endogenous OST4 present in complexes that co-migrate with both STT3A- and STT3B-containing species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A</xref>, lane 4), consistent with the association of OST4 with three previously defined mammalian OST complexes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2B</xref>).</p><fig id="f02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p><bold>OST4 assembles with core OST subunits into discrete complexes.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) HepG2 homogenates were solubilised with digitonin, resolved by BN-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane by immunoblotting. After transfer, the membrane was cut into individual strips, each representing a single lane from the original gel. Each strip was separately probed with a primary antibody recognising a known or potential subunit of the mammalian OST complex as follows: STT3B (lane 1), ribophorin I (Rib I, lane 2), ribophorin II (Rib II, lane 3), OST4 (lane 4) and STT3A (lane 5). The strips were then washed and individually probed with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Lastly, individual PVDF strips were reassembled in their original order and the fluorescent signals visualised by scanning the reassembled membrane using a Li-Cor Odyssey imager. The PVDF strips were scanned using two different sensitivity settings (low and high), and the image shown is a composite that combines data from the resulting low (lanes 1, 2, 3 and 5) and high (lane 4) sensitivity images. Some intervening strips present in the fully reassembled PVDF membrane are omitted from the final image shown.

To this end, the OST complexes of siRNA-treated HeLa cells were monitored by BN-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting using particularly effective antibodies specific for OST48 or ribophorin I.

Since the N-glycosylation of pSAP appears to be primarily a co-translational event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>), and the depletion of STT3A, OST4 and ribophorin I each induce a similar degree of pSAP hypoglycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig.â6A,B</xref>), we conclude that the effects of siOST4<sub>27</sub> and siRib I treatments most likely reflect the destabilisation of the STT3A-containing OST isoforms resulting from the depletion of these subunits (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig.â6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Whilst several biochemical and genetic studies of yeast Ost4p have been performed since its first discovery, the associations of its putative mammalian homologue, OST4, and any potential role it may play during protein N-glycosylation have not previously been addressed.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Physical interactions of OST4 with bona fide OST subunits</title><p>The purification of enzymatically active, detergent-solubilised mammalian OST complexes established the existence of distinct OST isoforms containing ribophorin I, ribophorin II, OST48 and DAD1 together with either STT3A or STT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>). Likewise, native gel electrophoresis studies demonstrated that STT3A is stably assembled into two distinct native oligomeric complexes, OSTC470 and OSTC500, whereas STT3B is present in a larger complex, OSTC550 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>). All three of these species contain ribophorin I, ribophorin II, OST48, DAD1 and DC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Shibatani et al., 2005</xref>), whereas KCP2 seems to be preferentially incorporated into OSTC500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). In this study, we show that endogenous OST4 co-migrates with all three of the major OST complexes detectable following BN-PAGE and immunoblotting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.â2A,B</xref>) thereby providing the first indication that OST4 is a true and ubiquitous constituent of these mammalian OST complexes, as provisionally suggested by Kelleher and Gilmore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kelleher and Gilmore, 2006</xref>). Epitope-tagged versions of OST subunits have been successfully used for previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Yan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chavan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>), and we have employed a C-terminal FLAG tag to study the interacting partners of human OST4. Exogenously expressed OST4-FLAG could be immunoisolated in digitonin-stable complexes with exogenous STT3A and STT3B, and may also associate with endogenous ribophorin I. These data suggest that in mammals there is a close, and potentially direct, association between OST4 and both isoforms of the enzymatic STT3 subunit that are present, a situation that mirrors the interaction between OST4 and Stt3p in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Karaoglu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Zubkov et al., 2004</xref>).

To investigate the role of the OST4 TM region (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.â1</xref>), we made two point mutations, one of which, Leu21 to Lys, was not stably expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, a Val23 to Lys mutant was exogenously expressed at similar levels to the FLAG-tagged wild-type protein and displayed substantial defects in its association with STT3A, STT3B and ribophorin I. These data are compatible with a model where the C-terminal portion of human the OST4 TM region plays a key role in mediating its direct interaction with the two mammalian STT3 isoforms, and adds yet further weight to previous studies mapping <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ost4p contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Zubkov et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>OST4 stabilises OST isoforms</title><p>A key objective of this study was to investigate the role of OST4 during protein N-glycosylation. The portion of OST4 exposed to the ER lumen is small, whereas the distance of the OST active site from the lumenal face of the ER membrane is estimated to be &gt;30âÃ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993</xref>). When combined with structural information about membrane-inserted forms of the yeast OST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Li et al., 2008</xref>) and its bacterial equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lizak et al., 2011</xref>), there is no strong indication that OST4 is likely to contribute directly to the catalysis of protein N-glycosylation. Furthermore, there is good evidence that yeast Ost4p acts as a scaffold protein to stabilise the association of either one of two non-catalytic subunits Ost3p or Ost6p with native OST complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>), a role akin to that suggested for some of the small subunits of the mitochondrial TOM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dekker et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>). We find that an siRNA-mediated knockdown of human OST4 substantially reduces steady-state levels of STT3A without noticeably affecting STT3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.â4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Tableâ1</xref>). Conversely, our provisional analysis indicates that OST4 levels are dependent upon STT3A expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S4</ext-link>). Taken together, these data strongly support a close association between STT3A and OST4 that influences the stability of both components.</p><p>Using BN-PAGE we investigated the effect of OST4 depletion upon the stability of OST complexes, and observed qualitative reductions in the level of all three major OST species, including OSTC500 and OSTC470 that we previously defined as STT3A-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Roboti and High, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). The most striking effect of OST4 depletion upon the species detectable by BN-PAGE was observed when we analysed for ribophorin I-containing complexes. The depletion of either OST4 or STT3A resulted in the appearance of a novel â¼150âkDa OST-derived component that contains ribophorin I, but not detectable levels of OST48. Thus, the depletion of OST4 and STT3A have a similar effect on OST stability, namely a reduction in the levels of the â¼500âkDa and â¼470âkDa complexes presumed to represent functional species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>), and a corresponding increase in a novel ribophorin I-containing subcomplex that lacks either of the two STT3 isoforms and OST48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.â5</xref>). This phenotype is distinct from that observed following Ost4p knockout in yeast, where the ribophorin I homologue Ost1p remained present in two higher molecular weight species, denoted complex I and complex II, that also contained the catalytic Stt3p subunit, the OST48 homologue Wbp1 and several other OST subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>). Loss of yeast Ost4p results in the absence of one of two non-catalytic subunits, Ost3p or Ost6p, that correlates with a conversion of OST complex I to OST complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, we are unable to analyse the fate of any of the mammalian equivalents of Ost3p and Ost6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kelleher et al., 2003</xref>) in the BN-PAGE system due to a lack of suitable antibodies. Our data tentatively suggest that a similar ribophorin I-containing subcomplex may also arise following STT3B depletion; however, substantial additional studies will be required to convincingly address this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>OST4 depletion perturbs protein N-glycosylation</title><p>This study provides the first analysis of mammalian OST4 function using a siRNA-mediated knockdown approach that has previously been successfully used to address the contributions of both catalytic and non-catalytic OST subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). We provide evidence that OST4 levels can influence protein N-glycosylation efficiency, in that cells depleted of OST4 using four independent siRNAs all show a clear defect in the N-glycosylation of pSAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.115410/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S6</ext-link>). In fact, the hypoglycosylation phenotype resulting from the OST4 knockdown is directly comparable to that observed in cells depleted of the catalytic STT3A subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig.â6B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). Loss of Ost4p results in the hypoglycosylation of several yeast glycoprotein precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Spirig et al., 2005</xref>), and we conclude that the principle effect of OST4 depletion upon pSAP N-glycosylation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig.â6C</xref>) occurs via a destabilisation of the OST complex and the resulting perturbation of the normal interactions between its subunits.</p><p>In order to provide a comparator for the effects of OST4 depletion on OST complex stability and function, we carried out parallel experiments using ribophorin I depletion. Although the effect of ribophorin I depletion upon steady-state levels of specific OST subunits and protein N-glycosylation has been previously studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Wilson and High, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>), the effects of its knockdown upon OST complex stability, as assessed using BN-PAGE or the N-glycosylation of endogenous pSAP in HeLa cells, had not been established. A knockdown in ribophorin I of &gt;70% at the protein level lead to a qualitative reduction in the level of OST4 and a more complex effect on STT3A levels that may reflect changes in its solubility in non-ionic detergents. Independent of its precise effects on STT3A levels or OST complex stability and assembly, at a functional level ribophorin I depletion had a robust and significant effect on N-glycosylation. In fact, the outcome of ribophorin I depletion upon pSAP N-glycosylation was strikingly similar to that following STT3A and OST4 knockdowns (this study) and OST48 and DAD1 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). In contrast, STT3B depletion has no detectable effect on pSAP N-glycosylation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Ruiz-Canada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>).</p><p>In terms of pSAP modification, to date only KCP2 depletion has been found to result in an âintermediateâ hypoglycosylation phenotype, supporting a model where KCP2 is a peripheral component and hence its loss does not destabilise STT3A-containing OST complexes per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). In contrast, it appears that the loss of any one of several other non-catalytic subunits, specifically OST4 (this study), OST48 and DAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>) and more tentatively ribophorin I (this study) result in wide-ranging perturbations of OST complex stability. In the case of HeLa cells, these perturbations in OST complex stability typically correlate with a reduction in the cellular capacity for the N-glycosylation of the endogenous precursor pSAP (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f06">Fig.â6C</xref>) that is directly comparable to a knockdown of the âco-translationalâ STT3A catalytic subunit alone (this study; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>). To date, it has not yet been possible to deplete a âcoreâ non-catalytic subunit of the mammalian OST without destabilising OST complex(es) as a whole. Hence, although it has been postulated that increasing the number of different subunits that make up an OST complex may enhance the range and complexity of the substrates that it can N-glycosylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Schwarz and Aebi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Roboti and High, 2012a</xref>), in practice this hypothesis remains to be unambiguously tested in a mammalian system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>DNA and siRNA constructs</title><p>Human OST4 cDNA sequence was optimised with proprietary OptimumGene algorithm (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for efficient expression in human cells, and the optimised gene was inserted into the <italic>Hin</italic>dIII-<italic>Eco</italic>RI sites of a pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen).
