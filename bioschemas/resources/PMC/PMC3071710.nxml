          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (Kv) mediate repolarisation of Î²-cell action potentials, and thereby abrogate insulin secretion. The role of the Kv1.1 K<sup>+</sup> channel in this process is however unclear. We tested for presence of Kv1.1 in different species and tested for a functional role of Kv1.1 by assessing pancreatic islet function in BALB/cByJ (wild-type) and <italic>megencephaly</italic> (<italic>mceph/mceph</italic>) mice, the latter having a deletion in the Kv1.1 gene.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Kv1.1 expression was detected in islets from wild-type mice, SD rats and humans, and expression of truncated Kv1.1 was detected in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> islets. Full-length Kv1.1 protein was present in islets from wild-type mice, but, as expected, not in those from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Kv1.1 expression was localized to the Î²-cell population and also to Î±- and Î´-cells, with evidence of over-expression of truncated Kv1.1 in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> islets. Blood glucose, insulin content, and islet morphology were normal in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice, but glucose-induced insulin release from batch-incubated islets was (moderately) higher than that from wild-type islets. Reciprocal blocking of Kv1.1 by dendrotoxin-K increased insulin secretion from wild-type but not <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> islets. Glucose-induced action potential duration, as well as firing frequency, was increased in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mouse Î²-cells. This duration effect on action potential in Î²-cells from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice was mimicked by dendrotoxin-K in Î²-cells from wild-type mice. Observations concerning the effects of both the <italic>mceph</italic> mutation, and of dendrotoxin-K, on glucose-induced insulin release were confirmed in pancreatic islets from <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It is established that voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (Kv) mediate repolarisation of Î²- cell action potential and thereby abrogate insulin secretion. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms and the regulation of Kv channels are however complicated by their multitude of forms, each class being recognized to have several subcategories. Alpha subunits form the actual conductance pore and have been grouped into 12 classes named Kv1-12. Among these channels, Kv2.1 has been shown to be robustly functional in Î²-cells, to the extent that in a number of species, it is regarded as the most influential Kv channel on insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0018213-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A considerable impact of this channel at the level of electrophysiology has also been documented <xref rid="pone.0018213-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is also recognized that Kv2.1 is not the only Kv channel of importance <xref rid="pone.0018213-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Kv1.1 has in animal models been found to be functional in brain, gastrointestinal muscle cells, renal tissue and heart <xref rid="pone.0018213-Hatton1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018213-Escobar1" ref-type="bibr">[ 4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018213-MacDonald2" ref-type="bibr">[ 5]</xref>. A functional role for the Kv1.1 channel in Î²-cells has been questioned and its expression in this tissue has not been consistently detected <xref rid="pone.0018213-zmen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, a systematic search for the Kv.1.1 channels has not been performed, and a role for Kv1.1 in Î²-cell function and/or development has not, to our knowledge, been tested rigorously.</p>
      <p>In this study, we first obtained preliminary results showing that isolated islets of Langerhans from BALB/cByJ-<italic>Kv1.1<sup>mceph/mceph</sup></italic> mice (called <italic>mceph/mceph</italic>), for which the Kv1.1 protein is truncated and non-functional secreted more insulin than islets from wild type mice to a glucose challenge. We then searched for and found evidence for Kv1.1 expression in islets from several strains of mice as well as in islets from rats and humans. We continued to test for functional and developmental effects of Kv1.1 on Î²-cells. We found, as expected that a full-length Kv1.1 protein was missing in islets from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Upon finding evidence for mutation-linked effects on insulin secretion we performed electrophysiological measurements to test for traits associated with Kv channel deficiency. Finally, analyses of mice in which the <italic>Kv1.1</italic> gene was knocked out (BALB/cByJ.C3HeB/FeJ-<italic>Kv1.1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>) confirmed some of the key results in this study.</p>

Kv1.1 expression was also detected in the INS-1 cell line, but not in MIN6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Importantly we in addition detected Kv1.1 expression in human islets isolated from both non-diabetic donors and donors with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Using real-time PCR no differences in Kv1.1 expression levels (relative to 18S) were observed between islets from three non-diabetic and three diabetic individuals. However, the results demonstrated a greater variability in Kv1.1 expression in islets from donors with type 2 diabetes (1.0Â±0.05 vs. 1.5Â±0.8, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.7, nâ=â3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

Islets from wild type mice (wt) (B upper panel) and <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> (<italic>m/m</italic>) mice (B lower panel) double immunostained for N-terminal Kv1.1 (green, left) and insulin (red, middle); merged to the right. The N-terminal of Kv1.1 is present in beta cells of both genotypes. Note that Kv1.1 is up-regulated in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice compared to wild type mice. Specificity of the N-terminal Kv1.1-LI was tested by determining the level of Kv1.2-LI. Strong N-terminal Kv1.1-LI and very weak Kv1.2-LI in an islet from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice assured that the Kv1.1-LI reflected presence of Kv1.1 (C).</p>

        <p>To investigate in which islet cell types the Kv1.1 protein was present we performed double immunostaining for Kv1.1 and insulin, as well as for glucagon and somatostatin. The Kv1.1 antibody used was against the N-terminal region present in both the normal and the truncated proteins. A clear-cut Kv1.1-like immunoreactivity was found to be co-localized with insulin in the Î²- cells both in wild-type and in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. The immunoreactivity was moderate in islets of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, upper panel, green), but strong in islets of mutated <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lower panel). Hence, the IHC data suggest over-expression of the truncated protein in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> islets.</p>
        <p>We also found co-localization of Kv1.1 with glucagon in the Î±-cells as well as with somatostatin in Î´-cells (data not shown).</p>
        <p>The peptide, used to generate the N-terminal Kv1.1 antibody, shares an identity with Kv1.2 consisting of a stretch of 6 out of 24 amino acids. No signal was elicited when islets from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice were incubated with an antibody against Kv1.2. This observation indicates that the signal elicited by the Kv1.1 antibody was due to the truncated (over-expressed) Kv1.1 protein and not due to cross-reactivity with Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Results in Kv1.1 null mice</title>
        <p>With limited access to <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice we tested for confirmation of some of the findings in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic>.

In perifusion experiments with islets from wild-type and <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice, in which the glucose concentration was increased from 3.3 to 7 mmol/l, insulin secretion was significantly increased in <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null islets vs. wild-type islets (0.47Â±0.06 vs. 0.19Â±0.05 ÂµU/islets/min, nâ=â3 and 4 experiments, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.037). The average insulin response from islets when glucose levels rose from 3.3 to 16.7 mmol/l in perifusion experiments was significantly elevated in both <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> and in <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null islets vs. wild type islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018213-g004">Fig. 4E, F and G</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate the presence of Kv1.1-specific transcripts in mouse, rat and human islets. Previous reports are discrepant as to the expression of Kv1.1 in primary pancreatic Î² cells <xref rid="pone.0018213-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018213-Roe1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018213-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Discrepancies may be due to the sensitivity of the techniques used. Here we examined Kv1.1 expression by an optimized PCR methodology with appropriate negative controls in all cases. Consistent Kv1.1 amplification from cDNA prepared from rodent islets required 40 cycles of amplification from template levels corresponding to 50 ng total RNA. This indicates that this gene is expressed, albeit at low levels, in mouse and rat islets. Notably, in human islets prepared from six individuals (three controls, three diabetics), Kv1.1 expression was detectable in each sample at template levels corresponding to 10 ng total RNA, and these observations were confirmed by TaqMan real-time PCR and cDNA microarray (data not shown). A previous study did not detect Kv1.1 expression in human islets, however, in that study islets from only a single individual were analyzed <xref rid="pone.0018213-London1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We found that pancreatic islets from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice secrete more insulin in response to glucose compared to islets from wild type mice. The confirmation of these findings in <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice indicates that the increase in insulin secretion is indeed due to the lack of functional Kv1.1 channels. The effects of the Kv1.1 blocker dendrotoxin-K on insulin release also strongly indicate that an enhanced insulin response to glucose in the <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice is due to a lack of functional Kv1.1 activity. Thus, both in static incubations (islets) and in perifusion experiments (islets and dispersed islet cells), dendrotoxin-K augmented insulin secretion from wild-type mice but not from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Perifusion experiments with islets from <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null animals further confirmed these findings.</p>
      <p>Our experiments give further indications of the specific impact of the Kv1.1 channel mutation on membrane electrophysiology of Î²-cells from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Importantly, glucose-induced action potentials were increased in spiking frequency and duration in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice when measured in the absence of dendrotoxin-K. The fact that <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice Î²-cells showed an increased action potential frequency at the same time as the action potential duration was increased may seem hard to understand since one would expect a slower frequency (2). At 15 mmol/l glucose there was an increase in membrane potential in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> vs. wild type Î²-cells (â32Â±4 vs. â41Â±2 mV, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.018) which could at least in part explain this finding. Increased action potential duration has also been observed in ventricular myocytes from the hearts of Kv1DN mice with over-expression of a truncated Kv1.1 23. Our results with dendrotoxin-K were in further agreement with the Kv1.1 channel being functional at the level of electrophysiology. Thus, in wild type Î²-cells dendrotoxin-K obliterated the differences between wild-type and the <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice regarding Î²-cell action potential duration.</p>
      <p>Our results concerning expression of the Kv1.1 mRNA and protein support a key role for the Kv1.1 mutation in the abnormal function of Î²-cells from <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Kv1.1 expression was thus readily detected in wild-type islets, whereas a truncated form was found in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> islets. Interestingly, the Kv1.1 protein seemed, in its truncated form in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> islets, more abundant than the normal protein in islets of wild-type mice. These observations are similar to those reported for some regions in the brain of <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Accumulation of truncated protein could theoretically have untoward and toxic effects. However, we note that there were, by histological analysis, no signs of Î²-cell toxicity in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice. Furthermore, there was no sign of change in the expression of Kv2.1 protein. Ablation of Kv2.1 also affected action potentials in a way that was not observed here <xref rid="pone.0018213-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Immunostaining showed that Kv1.1 was present also in Î±- and Î´-cells. The functional role, if any, for Kv1.1 in these cells remains to be investigated.</p>
      <p>The significantly lower levels of blood glucose and the tendency for higher serum insulin levels in <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice vs. wild type seem logical. In contrast <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice exhibit blood glucose and insulin levels that are similar to those seen in wild-type mice. <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> and <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice have a similar behavioural phenotype with body tremor, jittering and occasional forelimb paddling, and cramps. However, the phenotype of <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice appears more severe than that of the <italic>Kv1.1</italic> null mice (Lavebratt, unpublished observations). More marked severity of <italic>Kv1.1</italic> deficiency phenotype could lead to a higher stress level which in turn could result in higher blood glucose levels and increased insulin resistance. In vivo stress could also activate alpha-adrenergic receptors on the Î²-cell and thereby inhibit insulin secretion thus counteracting the increased insulin secretion from islets when tested in vitro.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is that lack of Kv1.1 in the CNS induces problems of glucose sensing in the hypothalamus that could secondarily affect the endocrine pancreas in different ways in the <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> and Kv1.1 null mice. The truncated Kv1.1 in <italic>mceph/mceph</italic> mice can assemble with other Kv1 subunits and potentially trap them in endoplasmatic reticulum with subsequent degradation <xref rid="pone.0018213-Misonou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Which importance should then be assigned to the Kv1.1 channel for Î²-cell function vis-Ã -vis other Kv channels? A large body of evidence indicates that the Kv2.1 channel is the major K<sup>+</sup>-rectifying channel in Î²-cells. Nevertheless, as highlighted by a recent study <xref rid="pone.0018213-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Kv2.1 is not the only Kv channel of importance. Hence a supplementary role for Kv1.1 channel (as well as perhaps other Kv channels) can be envisaged. Notably, our results indicate that this notion can be extended also to human beta cells.</p>
      <p>In summary Kv1.1 channels display an inter-species expression pattern. Furthermore, our results in mouse Î²-cells indicate that these channels are of functional importance.</p>
