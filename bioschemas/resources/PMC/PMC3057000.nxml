        <p>A 12Â kb haplotype upstream of the key signaling protein gene, <italic>AKT1</italic>, has been associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (Devaney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>).

One of the component SNPs of the 12Â kb haplotype metabolic syndrome haplotype changes a conserved amino acid in the predicted ZBTB42 protein, increasing the potential significance of the <italic>ZBTB42</italic> transcript unit for contributing to disease risk. Using RT-PCR of human and mouse cells, we verified that the two exon <italic>ZBTB42</italic> was expressed and correctly spliced in human skeletal muscle, and murine C2C12 cells. Production of peptide antibodies showed the expected protein in human (47Â kD) and mouse (49Â kD) immunoblots, and murine tissue distribution showed strongest expression in muscle and ovary. Immunostaining showed nuclear localization of the ZBTB42 protein in human muscle. Confocal imaging analyses of murine muscle showed ZBTB42 distributed in the nucleoplasm, with particular enrichment in nuclei underlying the neuromuscular junctions. The genetic association data of metabolic syndrome, coupled with the molecular characterization of the <italic>ZBTB42</italic> transcript unit and encoded protein presented here, suggests that <italic>ZBTB42</italic> may be involved in metabolic syndrome phenotypes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>We recently reported the discovery of three SNPs present in high LD in highly conserved regions within and upstream of <italic>AKT1</italic> (Devaney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). The H1 haplotype is composed of the three ancestral alleles at the three loci. As expected this is the predominant haplotype in most populations. The H2 haplotype is composed of the three derived alleles at the loci. We have genotyped individuals from multiple American populations and found high frequencies of H2, ranging from 10 to 35.6%. The lack of intermediate haplotypes (a mix of alleles from H1 and H2) suggests that the H2 haplotype may confer some advantage to the individuals carrying it enforcing its inheritance as a haplotype block.</p>
      <p>Due to its role as a mediator of the insulin response pathway as well as a regulator of muscle hypertrophy and muscle atrophy (Bodine et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>; Elghazi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>; Nader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>; Zdychova and Komers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>), we genotyped the H1 and H2 haplotype tagging SNP rs1130214 in four population-based cohorts as a candidate gene for metabolic risk phenotypes (Devaney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). These included the FAMUSS study of college-aged individuals (mean age 23.7Â years) who participated in supervised resistance training sessions on their non-dominant arm (Thompson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>); the SHS, a group of 2,134 middle aged (mean age 55.5Â years) Native Americans from eight different populations within the United States (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1990</xref>); the Health ABC Study of older individuals (mean age 73Â years) with the goal of studying the effects of age on a number of health indicators including cardiovascular health and development of metabolic syndrome and T2D (Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1999</xref>); and the STRRIDE Study, which was developed to study the effect of aerobic exercise on individuals expressing the endophenotypes of metabolic syndrome (Slentz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). We found significant associations with all four cohorts with H2: lower fasting glucose levels in young females (FAMUSS), lower BMI and higher LDL levels in middle-aged females (SHS), lower 2Â h fasting glucose levels and lower fasting insulin in middle-aged males (SHS); lower fasting glucose levels in older males (Health ABC) and higher Sg levels in middle aged European Americans (STRRIDE) (Devaney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). H2 was strongly associated with overall risk of developing metabolic syndrome in older subjects of the Health ABC study. H2 conferred a 40% risk reduction for the development of metabolic syndrome.</p>
      <p>The 12Â kb haplotype contained three component SNPs, with the common haplotype (H1) showing the ancestral allele at each position. These SNPs were found to have functional relevance to gene expression; promoter assays containing either allele has shown a strong tissue-specific effect on gene expression (Harmon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). One of the SNPs of the H1/H2 haplotype is present 12Â kb upstream of AKT1 in the putative coding region of an uncharacterized gene, zinc finger and BTB domain containing 42 (<italic>ZBTB42</italic>). This transcript is predicted to contain 2 exons, and is highly conserved through multiple species down to the stickleback fish. However, there has been very little EST evidence in support of gene expression and splicing of this transcript unit, and the putative protein product has not been characterized. Our interest in the <italic>AKT1</italic> H2 haplotype and its strong phenotypic associations in variable populations drew our attention to the characterization of this gene and protein.</p>
      <p>We describe the characterization of <italic>ZBTB42</italic> as a member of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein family. Zinc finger proteins are classified by the presence of zinc finger domains, which bind to target DNA sequences and regulate transcription. ZBTB42 is expressed in skeletal muscle, and localized to the myofiber nuclei.</p>

        <title>Amplification of <italic>ZBTB42</italic> in human and mouse cDNA</title>
        <p>Total RNA was extracted from 50 to 100Â mg of human skeletal muscle using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cleaned using RNeasy RNA cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Complementary DNA was reverse transcribed from 1 ug of mRNA using a cDNA synthesis kit and oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturerâs protocol (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p>
        <p>PCR was performed using a forward and reverse custom primer designed to cover the first intron in human <italic>ZBTB42</italic> causing genomic and cDNA amplicons to be different in size (5â-CGGCGACCGGAGAGGAGCTC-3â², 5â²-CTTCAACGACAGGTCCAGGG-3â²). Accuprime Taq polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to the template along with buffer and the <italic>ZBTB42</italic>-specific primers. The samples were then heat activated at 94Â°C and cycled between denaturation (94Â°C for 30Â s), annealing (60Â°C for 30Â s) and extension (68Â°C for 1Â min) 30 times. PCR products were size-separated by gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel and were visualized through ethidium bromide chelation of the DNA under UV.</p>
        <p>Custom primers (5â²-GCAGTGTCTACTTCCATCTC-3â², 5â²-CACTTGACTGCTCTGCAACC-3â²) were designed against the mouse homolog to <italic>ZBTB42</italic> (m<italic>Zbtb42</italic>) for PCR amplification using a panel of cDNAs from various mouse tissues (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Gel electrophoresis was used to verify expression and the size of the product.</p>

        <p>Specific primer pairs encompassing the ZBTB42 gene were used to sequence the amplified product described above (5â²-CGGCGACCGGAGAGGAGCTC-3â², 5â²-CTTCAACGACAGGTCCAGGG-3â²). Sequencing was done using the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide changes were identified by aligning sequences generated from both primers (forward and reverse) for comparison with corresponding sequences available in Genbank using SEQUENCHER 4.0.2 analysis software.</p>

Radioimmuno precipitation assay (RIPA) cell lysis and extraction buffer (containing DTT, and the protease inhibitors pepstatin, PMSF, antipain, and leupeptin), was used to harvest protein from C2C12 cells.</p>
        <p>Protein from human skeletal cells was harvested from muscle sections. Muscle biopsies were sectioned using a cryostat at â20Â°C. RIPA lysis buffer was used to lyse the cells and the proteins were then isolated using centrifugation at 13,000Â rpm for 15Â min. A 2-month-old female black/6 mouse was sacrificed and tissues were harvested. Tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer using a tabletop homogenizer. Total protein extract was then isolated using centrifugation.</p>
        <p>Total protein in each sample was quantified using the colorimetric assay RC DC Protein Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and BSA standards from 0Â mg/ml to 10Â mg/ml. 20Â Î¼g of protein was loaded for each sample in a NuPAGE<sup>Â®</sup> Novex 4â12% BisâTris Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk and incubated overnight with our custom antibody AX-1#3 against peptide DLSLKSGPRQERVH. Washes were done with 5% milk in TBST. The membrane was then incubated with HRP-tagged goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies.

        <p>Muscle sections were cut 10Â Î¼m thick laterally at the belly of frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies in a cryostat set at â20Â°C. The sections were arranged on Superfrost glass slides and allowed to air-dry overnight.

        <title><italic>ZBTB42</italic> is expressed as a transcript in human skeletal muscle cDNA</title>
        <p><italic>ZBTB42</italic> is predicted to contain two exons and a single intervening intron according to limited EST evidence on the UCSC genome browser. To determine if <italic>ZBTB42</italic> is transcribed into a full length mRNA in vivo, we attempted to amplify the transcript using RT-PCR with <italic>ZBTB42</italic>-specific primers in human skeletal muscle. The PCR primers were designed against the two exons; the forward primer in exon 1, the reverse primer in exon 2. The primers cover intron 1, therefore allowing us to differentiate cDNA (introns spliced out) from genomic DNA (containing introns), which was included as a control. The expected size products between the two primers are 600Â bps for cDNA and 1,500Â bps for genomic DNA. The genomic sample showed one band at 1,500Â bp corresponding to the non-spliced genomic locus. The cDNA showed a band at 600Â bp, corresponding to the predicted size between the primers. There are other larger bands that were amplified in the cDNA sample, including one at 1,500Â bp, which is probably genomic DNA contamination from the mRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis steps (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This indicated that the EST <italic>ZBTB42</italic> exists as an mRNA transcript within human skeletal muscle.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption><p><italic>ZBTB42</italic> cDNA is expressed in human skeletal muscle. <bold>a</bold> shows a schematic of the <italic>ZBTB42</italic> gene.

The <italic>black arrows</italic> above the gene are the forward and reverse primers used to amplify the transcript. The primers were designed across the intron, in exons 1 and 2, to distinguish between genomic DNA (1,500Â bp) and cDNA (600Â bp). <bold>b</bold> shows the amplification of <italic>ZBTB42</italic> from human cDNA and genomic DNA. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA isolated from a frozen human skeletal muscle biopsy (<italic>lane 3</italic>). Genomic DNA (<italic>lane 2</italic>) was isolated from human skeletal muscle. cDNA was amplified at the correct size of 600Â bp. There are additional bands in the cDNA sample including one at 1,500Â bp. This may be genomic DNA contamination. PCR products were loaded in a 1% agarose gel for size discrimination. A 100Â bp marker was used for size comparison (<italic>lane 1</italic>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="439_2010_940_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>To confirm that the cDNA PCR product was <italic>ZBTB42</italic> and not a non-specific binding event, we eluted the 600Â bp product from the gel and sequenced it. The sequence matched the sequence of <italic>ZBTB42</italic> from the UCSC genome browser database.</p>

        <title><italic>ZBTB42</italic> has C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger domains and an N-terminal POZ domain</title>
        <p>Upon sequence investigation using online protein prediction tools (ORFinder, ScanProsite), the predicted primary structure of the protein translated from <italic>ZBTB42</italic> shows four zinc finger domains at its C-terminus, which are highly homologous with other members of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> class of zinc finger proteins. In addition, there is a POZ domain (named for its prevalence in POxvirus proteins and Zinc finger proteins) at the N-terminus of the protein, which is common to most members of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> family of proteins (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The predicted size of the protein using the amino acid sequence from ORFinder is 47Â kDa. Upon comparison with the mouse homolog, Zbtb42, we observed that the two proteins share 75% amino acid identity at the protein level, with 94% amino acid identity in the zinc finger and POZ domains. These analyses indicated that ZBTB42 would be an expressed protein.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.Â 2</label><caption><p>ZBTB42 contains C2H2 zinc finger domains and shares high sequence homology with mouse.

        <title><italic>ZBTB42</italic> is translated into a protein in human skeletal muscle</title>
        <p>To directly identify whether <italic>ZBTB42</italic> is an expressed protein in vivo we produced two antibodies against two distinct peptide sequences near the predicted N-terminus (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The peptides were designed to exclude the POZ and zinc finger functional domains due to anticipated cross-reaction with other zinc finger domain and POZ domain-containing proteins (amino acids 189â202 [DLSLKSGPRQERVH] and 116â129 [GRLQEKDRSLDPGN]).</p>
        <p>Each of the four antibody preparations was tested by immunoblot using human skeletal muscle lysates as well as lysates from C2C12 mouse myoblasts. The antibody against peptide DLSLKSGPRQERVH from rabbit #3 (AX-1#3) showed the best specificity and sensitivity for the predicted 47Â kDa protein in both the human skeletal muscle and mouse myoblasts (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The antibodies raised against GRLQEKDRSLDPGN were non-specific as evidenced by large amount of non-specific binding in the immunoblot analysis of human skeletal muscle lysates and C2C12 lysates. We also observed a second band at 36Â kDa in the human protein lysates. This may be a splice variant or reflect non-specific binding of another protein. The immunoblot analysis provided strong evidence that this protein is not only transcribed into an mRNA in vivo but is also translated as a protein in human skeletal muscle.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.Â 3</label><caption><p>ZBTB42 protein is expressed in human skeletal muscle and a murine cell line C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myotubes.

        <title>ZBTB42 localizes to the nucleus in skeletal muscle, with enrichment at neuromuscular junction nuclei</title>
        <p>Zinc finger proteins typically localize to the nuclei of cells and function as transcription factors when the zinc finger domains bind to DNA targets to initiate transcription (Iuchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>). To evaluate cellular localization we co-stained human skeletal muscle cross sections with an antibody against ZBTB42 (AX-1#3), and an antibody against merosin, which is a muscle cell membrane protein (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). ZBTB42 protein was localized to the nuclei in skeletal muscle myofibers and interstitial (perimysial) connective tissue cells. The addition of 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a nuclear stain, verified that the ZBTB42 protein was present in all nuclei (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.Â 5</label><caption><p>ZBTB42 localizes to the nuclei of human skeletal muscle fibers.

        <p>To determine the localization within nuclei, the ZBTB42 protein was studied using confocal microscopy in murine skeletal fixed and teased myofibers (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The ZBTB42 protein was seen localized to myofiber nuclei superimposed on the DNA chromatin (DAPI), suggesting a localization within the nucleoplasm (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Myofibers have distinct nuclear domains within a syncytium, with myonuclei underlying the neuromuscular junction showing specialized function. Identification of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) was done using biochemical staining for acetylcholine receptors with labeled bungarotoxin, and ZBTB42 co-localized with NMJs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). This analysis showed ZBTB42 to be highly enriched in subsynaptic nuclei at the NMJ, again within the nucleoplasm (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, c).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.Â 7</label><caption><p>ZBTB42 localizes to the nuclei of mouse skeletal muscle fibers, and is enriched at the neuromuscular junction.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We recently reported strong associations between a three SNP haplotype encompassing 12Â kb upstream and inclusive of the first exon of the <italic>AKT1</italic> gene, and containing the <italic>ZBTB42</italic> gene. One of the strongly linked SNPs, rs10141867, was in the coding sequence of the <italic>ZBTB42</italic> transcript. We show that <italic>ZBTB42</italic> is transcribed into a spliced mRNA in human skeletal muscle through RT-PCR. We further demonstrated that this transcript is translated into a 47Â kD protein in vivo in human skeletal muscle immunoblots using a custom designed antibody directed against a unique peptide on the N-terminus of the predicted open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>ZBTB42</italic>.</p>
      <p>The mouse homolog mZbtb42 is homologous to <italic>hZBTB42</italic>, sharing 94% amino acid identity in the functional domains and an overall amino acid identity of 75%. We found that the mZbtb42 protein is variably expressed in mouse tissues, with skeletal muscle and ovaries showing the strongest expression. Both human and mouse immunoblots showed some heterogeneity of protein size, with possible doublets of similar molecular weight, and also a strong 36Â kD smaller signal in murine muscle and liver (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Further work is required to determine if the 36Â kD protein represents alternative processing of the mZbtb42 protein, or a cross-reactive protein specific to those tissues.</p>
      <p>The predicted ORF and putative functional domains were identified (virtual characterization) with the web tools ORFinder (NCBI) and ScanProsite. The functional domains of ZBTB42 are most similar to members of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein family. There are different families of zinc finger proteins characterized by domains at the C-terminus that contain the amino acids cysteine and histidine in a specific order to create a unique secondary structure stabilized by a zinc ion bond. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins have two cysteine and two histidine residues organized CX<sub>2-4</sub>CX<sub>12</sub>HX<sub>2-6</sub>H. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> domains bind to the DNA through a short alpha-helix domain and initiate transcription of target genes (Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1996</xref>; Iuchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>). Depending on the number of zinc finger domains, they are able to bind to different sequences of DNA, RNA and, in some instances, proteins (Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1996</xref>; Iuchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>). At the N-terminal of the ZBTB42ORF there is a POZ domain. POZ domains are named for their presence in a large number of POxvirus proteins and Zinc finger proteins (Albagli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1995</xref>; Bardwell and Treisman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>). POZ domains function as binding mediators either by aiding homodimerization or heterodimerization (Bardwell and Treisman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1995</xref>; Huynh and Bardwell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>). In the case of transcriptional regulators, such as zinc finger proteins that contain POZ domains, these domains mediate transcriptional repression through recruitment of co-repressor proteins or by altering the binding efficiency between the zinc finger domains and the target DNA (Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>The virtual evidence from ORFinder and ScanProsite described above, by way of sequence analysis and a protein domain database query is significant but the true characterization of a protein must be done through studies of expression and other functional tests. Zinc finger proteins localize to the nuclei of cells where they regulate the transcription of target genes. Immunohistochemistry of human skeletal muscle sections showed sensitive and specific binding of ZBTB42 in the nuclei of human muscle fibers. The staining of ZBTB42 co-localized with the nuclear stain DAPI. Confocal localizations within murine muscle confirmed nuclear localization, with further localization within the nucleoplasm (co-localization with DAPI nucleic acid stain) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). There are distinct nuclear domains within the syncytial muscle fibers, with nuclei underlying the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) having distinct transcriptional programs. We identified sub-synaptic NMJ nuclei using biochemical staining with labeled bungarotoxin, and showed that mZbtb42 protein was highly enriched within the nucleoplasm of NMJ nuclei (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These date bolster our hypothesis that this protein has active zinc finger domains and may function as a novel muscle-relevant transcription factor in vivo.</p>
      <p>As noted above, the <italic>ZBTB42</italic> transcript unit is contained within a 12Â kb haplotype associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (Devaney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). The component polymorphisms in this haplotype show strong activity in modulating transcriptional reporter assays, and haplotype-dependent variable transcriptional modulation of <italic>AKT1</italic>, or <italic>ZBTB42</italic>, or both provides a potential molecular mechanism for modulating insulin resistance (a muscle phenotype), and metabolic syndrome (Harmon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). <italic>AKT1</italic> has clear functional roles in muscle remodeling that are likely relevant to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The data presented here on ZBTB42 suggests that this novel protein may also have a hitherto undiscovered role in muscle and metabolic syndrome phenotypes.</p>
