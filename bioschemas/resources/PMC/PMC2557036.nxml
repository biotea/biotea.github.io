      <abstract>
        <p>The keratin intermediate filament network is abundant in epithelial cells, but its function in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is unclear. Here, we show that Albatross complexes with Par3 to regulate formation of the apical junctional complex (AJC) and maintain lateral membrane identity. In nonpolarized epithelial cells, Albatross localizes with keratin filaments, whereas in polarized epithelial cells, Albatross is primarily localized in the vicinity of the AJC. Knockdown of Albatross in polarized cells causes a disappearance of key components of the AJC at cellâcell borders and keratin filament reorganization. Lateral proteins E-cadherin and desmoglein 2 were mislocalized even on the apical side. Although Albatross promotes localization of Par3 to the AJC, Par3 and ezrin are still retained at the apical surface in Albatross knockdown cells, which retain intact microvilli. Analysis of keratin-deficient epithelial cells revealed that keratins are required to stabilize the Albatross protein, thus promoting the formation of AJC. We propose that keratins and the keratin-binding protein Albatross are important for epithelial cell polarization.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Keratin filaments are epithelial-specific intermediate filaments (IFs) whose major function is apparently to provide mechanical strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fuchs and Cleveland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coulombe and Wong, 2004</xref>). However, the expression of components of IFs is strictly regulated in cell-, tissue-, and differentiation-specific fashions, though other major cytoskeletal proteins, actin and tubulin, are highly conserved through different cell types. The keratin subfamily has &gt;20 members. In simple epithelia, keratin 8 and 18 (K8/18) are the major subtypes and form hetero-oligomeric filaments. The apparent redundancy of keratins has for a long time obscured the analysis of keratin-specific functions, but recently, several novel keratin functions have been described. For example, they may modulate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caulin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inada et al., 2001</xref>) and control cell growth through interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). It is likely that keratins have additional physiological roles.</p><p>To address this issue, we have performed searches for keratin-binding proteins. Here, we report findings for a novel protein involved in regulation of the apical junctional complex (AJC) and lateral domains in epithelial cells. In the past, we described the chaperoning protein of Mrj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Izawa et al., 2000</xref>), the TNF receptor 1âassociated protein of TRADD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inada et al., 2001</xref>) and a novel protein of trichoplein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nishizawa et al., 2005</xref>), to be keratin-binding proteins. Among these proteins, trichoplein has a unique domain, trichohyalin and plectin homology domain (TPHD), which has similarities with trichohyalin and plectin of classical keratin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Izawa and Inagaki, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The functions of the AJC are believed to: (1) act as a mechanical link between adjacent cells via adherens junctions (AJ) and desmosomes (DS); (2) provide a fence between apical and lateral plasma membrane domains to establish cell polarity by tight junctions (TJ), though TJ are actually not necessary for fence functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Umeda et al., 2006</xref>); and (3) selectively block paracellular pathways via TJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>). It is a key character of polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rodriguez-Boulan and Nelson, 1989</xref>). In this paper, we document that Albatross (also known as Fas-binding factor-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2000</xref>), a keratin-binding protein containing TPHD, regulates the AJC and lateral domains in epithelial cells. In addition, keratins stabilize Albatross and play a role in its AJC localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Albatross was initially noted as one TPHD-containing protein in a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search. To characterize this protein, we generated anti-Albatross antibodies that detected a 130-kD form upon immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This putative molecular size was calculated from cloned human Albatross (Fig. S1, A to C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803133/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803133/DC1</ext-link>). Using the antibody, we found Albatross to be expressed in various epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-Albatross antibody, K8/18 coimmunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In a yeast hybrid system, Albatross was further found to bind to these keratins, and in a cosedimentation assay, they cosedimented with Albatross, in contrast to desmin and vimentin (Fig. S1, D and E). Albatross has the unique TPHD domain (Fig. S1, A and B) and directly binds keratin 18 via this domain in a yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. S1 D). In addition, immunofluorescence revealed Albatross to be discontinuously associated with the K8/18 filament network (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The results thus strongly indicate that Albatross is a keratin-binding protein.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Albatross is a keratin-binding protein.</bold> (A) Immunoblotting with affinity-purified rabbit anti-Albatross antibodies.

Bars, 10 Î¼m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830019f01"/></fig><p>When epithelial tissues were double-stained for Albatross and keratin 8/18, Albatross was localized not only on keratin filaments but also in the vicinity of the AJC, especially in polarized epithelial cells (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803133/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803133/DC1</ext-link>). A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells form distinct surface domains with well-developed AJCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Using this cell line, we generated Albatross knockdown A549 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Immunostaining revealed that in the apical region of control cells, keratin filaments were assembled into thick bundles along the cellâcell borders. However, in Albatross knockdown A549 cells, the attachment of keratin filaments to intercellular junctions was apparently weakened (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). As it is has been found that keratin is anchored on the AJC via DS in polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jones and Green, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bornslaeger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Perez-Moreno et al., 2003</xref>), we assumed that this phenotype was caused either by affecting the anchoring of keratin filaments on DS or by affecting the AJC itself.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, immunostaining was performed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803133/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803133/DC1</ext-link>). In Albatross knockdown cells, AJC components no longer accumulated on the AJC, except in regions where residual Albatross was present: TJ, ZO-1; AJ, afadin; DS, desmoplakin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Their transmembrane proteins were similarly affected (Fig. S3 A), which strongly suggested impaired cellâcell adhesion. We therefore executed an aggregation assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Takeichi, 1977</xref>). In Albatross knockdown A549 cells, the formation of cell aggregates was indeed reduced, and single cells were increased. Thus, the cellâcell adhesive properties were weakened. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Albatross was predominantly localized in the vicinity of AJC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S3 B). From these data, we concluded that Albatross is crucial for AJC formation with respect to both components and physiological functions in A549 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired AJC formation in Albatross knockdown cells.</bold> (A) Double staining for Albatross (red) and the undercoat proteins (green) for each AJC component: TJ, ZO-1; AJ, afadin; DS, desmoplakin. Top and bottom columns show projections of x-y planes and z sections, respectively. Albatross knockdown A549 (Albatross KD) cells lack accumulation of these proteins at the cellâcell borders except in regions where residual Albatross is present. (B) Cellâcell adhesive properties evaluated by a cell aggregation assay. In the differential interference contrast images, control cells show cell aggregation. With Albatross knockdown A549 (A1050 and A1160) cells, the aggregated cell population is reduced and free cells are increased. The percentages of single cells in total cells (mean Â± SD) are: control, 36.1 Â± 3.9; A1050, 52.4 Â± 2.8; A1160 cells, 59.4 Â± 10.2. <italic>n</italic> = 4 and P &lt; 0.01.

Immunostaining of the bile canaliculi (BC) fraction and the AJ fraction revealed that Albatross was colocalized with Par3 and other AJC proteins like occludin, afadin, and desmoplakin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). On immunoblotting of BC and AJ, not only Albatross but also Par3 was enriched, in line with the concentrations of other AJC components (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). In immunoprecipitates of A549 cells with an anti-Albatross antibody, Par3 and ZO-1 were found to be present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). The association with Par3 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation with tagged proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 H</xref> and S3 C). These immunoprecipitation results indicate that Albatross also binds with ZO-1, which suggests that Albatross may have other binding partners in addition to Par3.</p><p>In Albatross knockdown cells, Par3 at AJC was certainly abolished, but Par3 at the apical domains remained (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

In our cells, ezrin was also found to be still localized on apical domains. Microvilli were also intact, presumably because of the retention of these apical proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). In Albatross knockdown A549 cells, the lateral domain components of E-cadherin and desmoglein 2 no longer accumulated on the AJC and at lateral domains, and were mislocalized even at the apical membranes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). The cortical actin bundles along the cellâcell borders were not organized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>).

The amount of Albatross was elevated according to the increase of keratins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). Furthermore, stable introduction of K8/18 in SW13 cells caused elevation of cytosolic Albatross and promoted its localization to cellâcell borders, as assessed by immunostaining (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). However, the level of Albatross mRNA was not changed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). These results indicate that keratins stabilize Albatross without altering the expression level, which results in the prompt localization of AJC components to cellâcell borders (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). This was confirmed by Albatross knockdown in K8/18-introduced SW13 cells, which exhibit disturbed AJC formation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>), indicating that K8/18-induced junction formation is dependent on Albatross. In other words, keratins function as dynamic and multipurpose scaffolds. As an explanation, disruption of the keratin cytoskeleton may be the mechanism of AJC disruption through Albatross function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Functions of keratins and AlbatrossâPar3 complexes.</bold> (AâC) The amounts of Albatross protein and mRNA were analyzed in both keratin 8 and keratin 18 (K8/18)-introduced SW13 cells.

The AlbatrossâPar3 complex regulates AJC formation and maintains lateral membrane identity. However, Par3 without Albatross regulates apical membrane formation. Keratins stabilize Albatross, which promotes formation of the AJC. Thus, keratins and the keratin-binding protein Albatross may play critical roles in the polarization of epithelial cells.
