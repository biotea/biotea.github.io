      <abstract>
        <p>DNA repair helicases function in the cell to separate DNA duplexes or remodel nucleoprotein complexes. These functions are influenced by sensing and signaling; the cellular pool of a DNA helicase may contain subpopulations of enzymes carrying different post-translational modifications and performing distinct biochemical functions. Here, we report a novel experimental strategy, single-molecule sorting, which overcomes difficulties associated with comprehensive analysis of heterologously modified pool of proteins. This methodology was applied to visualize human DNA helicase F-boxâcontaining DNA helicase (FBH1) acting on the DNA structures resembling a stalled or collapsed replication fork and its interactions with RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. Individual helicase molecules isolated from human cells with their native post-translational modifications were analyzed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Separation of the activity trajectories originated from ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated FBH1 molecules revealed that ubiquitylation affects FBH1 interaction with the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, but not its translocase and helicase activities.</p>

  <body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional diversity and the dynamic nature of the eukaryotic proteome are highly enhanced by post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B1">1</xref>). Activity switching in DNA repair enzymes is often controlled by reversible PTMs, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation and poly (ADP-ribozyl)ation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B2">2</xref>). These chemical modifications regulate activities, localizations and interactions of the proteins, their integration into larger macromolecular assemblies and, ultimately, the selection of a cellular pathway. It is foreseeable that in some cases, a few or even a single-protein molecule carrying a particular array of modifications could decide a cell fate.</p><p>A number of techniques are available for producing mimetics of post-translationally modified proteins for biochemical and structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B3">3</xref>). The alternative is to separate an endogenously modified protein from the unmodified counterparts. These approaches have been successfully implemented in deciphering the roles of PTMs in the DNA repair proteins [see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B5">5</xref>)], but they are laborious and non-optimal when the protein availability is limiting, when multiple PTMs are stochastically combined within the same protein or when only a small fraction of the protein is modified.</p><p>To expedite the quantification, analysis and comparison of distinct post-translationally modified pools of a protein, we developed a technique to simultaneously, but separately, evaluate activities of the modified and unmodified proteins extracted from the human cells. Human F-boxâcontaining DNA helicase (FBH1) was used as a model to establish and evaluate this methodology.</p><p>FBH1 helicase both promotes homologous recombination during re-establishment of blocked replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B6">6</xref>) and acts as an anti-recombinase by controlling formation of toxic recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B7 gkt056-B8 gkt056-B9 gkt056-B10">7â10</xref>). In its anti-recombinase mode, FBH1 is one of the mammalian candidates for the role of yeast Srs2 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B9">9</xref>), an anti-recombinogenic helicase that promotes Rad51 nucleoprotein filament disassembly by accelerating Rad51-mediated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B11">11</xref>). Although having a moderate effect on chromosomal break repair in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B12">12</xref>), FBH1 is important for cellular recovery from decatenation stress and for restoration of mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Pro- and anti-recombinogenic functions may require FBH1 to rapidly switch between different activities. Similar to other helicases and helicase-like nucleic acid translocation motors [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B14 gkt056-B15 gkt056-B16 gkt056-B17">14â17</xref>)], FBH1 converts the energy of ATP into directional movement along DNA and separation of the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In addition to SF1 helicase motor, FBH1 includes a large N-terminal extension containing an F-box motif, which serves as an adaptor for the Skp1, Cul1 and Roc1 components of E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B20">20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Chiolo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B9">9</xref>) proposed that FBH1 undergoes a DNA damage-induced self-degradation, which controls FBH1 abundance. Self-ubiquitylation of FBH1 may also play a regulatory role by modifying the helicase and/or translocase activities of FBH1 or by affecting its proteinâprotein interactions.
<fig id="gkt056-F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Surface-tethered FBH1 helicase displays a <italic>bona fide</italic> unwinding activity. (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of TIRFM-based assay for analysis of DNA binding and unwinding by the individual surface-tethered helicases molecules. FBH1 is immobilized on the surface of the microscope flow cell illuminated with a 530-nm evanescent wave generated by TIR. DNA substrate molecules contain two fluorescence dyes (Cy3, donor; Cy5, acceptor). Both dyes are invisible unless found within the evanescent field because of association with the surface-tethered helicase (ON state). In the presence of ATP, FBH1-mediated unwinding of the duplex region of the DNA substrate results in gradual decrease in the FRET efficiency. Substrate dissociation results in a loss of the signal. (<bold>B</bold>) Activity of an individual surface-tethered FBH1 molecule was monitored &gt;200 s in the presence of 1 mM ATP and PD1. Each spike in the fluorescence intensities of Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red) marked by the blue arrow corresponds to binding and rearrangement of a new DNA substrate. Only events featuring fluorescence of both Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were analyzed. Each experiment yielded 200â600 trajectories originated from individual surface-tethered FBH1 molecules similar to the one depicted here. (<bold>C</bold>) A magnified fragment of a representative fluorescence trajectory depicting three consecutive events where FBH1 binds and unwinds PD1.

(<bold>E</bold>) The Cy3 and Cy5 signals from the event depicted in the panel D and converted into a FRET trajectory, which can be divided into three sections: initial binding of the DNA substrate to FBH1 (flat portion), active unwinding of the duplex (linear decrease in FRET efficiency), dissociation of the displaced Cy5-labeled oligo, whereas the Cy3 (translocating) oligo remains bound to the FBH1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkt056f1p"/></fig></p><p>Here, we developed and applied a single-molecule sorting technique to quantify, as well as simultaneously probe and distinguish, activities of ubiquitylated and non-ubiquitylated FBH1 molecules. The basis of this approach is to surface-tether the helicase molecules expressed and biotinylated in the human cells. We then use total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B21">21</xref>) to follow the activities of each individual surface-tethered molecule over multiple cycles of binding and rearrangement of fluorescently labeled DNA substrates or nucleoprotein complexes. The presence of poly-ubiquitin chains on some FBH1 molecules is then revealed by fluorescence staining and is correlated to substrate binding, translocation and unwinding activities even when only a small fraction of helicase molecules are modified.</p><p>Using this technique, we probed the two activities most critical for FBH1 cellular functions: helicase activity, and its interaction with RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, a potential target of the FBH1 anti-recombinogenic function. We first analyzed the helicase activity of FBH1 on a set of DNA substrates representing different features of a stalled or a collapsed replication fork, where FBH1 helicase displays <italic>bona fide</italic> 3â²â5â² helicase activity, i.e. the physical separation of the duplex into its component single strands, as well as a repetitive shuttling behavior similar to that observed for other SF1 helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B23">23</xref>). Because RAD51 participates in repair and restart of both stalled and collapsed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B24">24</xref>), we probed the interaction between FBH1 and RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. Notably, poly-ubiquitylation virtually abolished RAD51 nucleoprotein filament binding by FBH1, but it had no significant effect on duplex separation or translocation activity of FBH1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Constructs for expression, biotinylation and ubiquitylation of FBH1 helicase</title><p>Human <italic>FBH1</italic> gene was amplified from pcDNA3âFLAGâFBH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B18">18</xref>) using primers to incorporate the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) on the N-terminus and BAP sequence on the C-terminus.

This chamber allows us changing the sample solutions during measurement without any impact on the slide. First, solution containing fluorescently labeled DNA or RAD51âssDNA nucleoprotein filament was infused in the chamber, and the functional assays were carried out. Then, the DNA solution was exchanged with the buffer containing 1:5000 dilution of TMR-TUBE2 (LifeSensors). After 2â5 min incubation, the TMR-TUBE2 solution was replaced with the buffer to remove unbound TUBE2s. Trajectories originated from Ub FBH1 molecules were distinguished from non-ubiquitylated (non-Ub) FBH1 because of the presence of bound TMR-TUBE2. The 1:5000 dilution of TMR-TUBE2 reagent was selected after testing a range of dilutions and corresponds to the inflection point of the correlation between the fraction of TMR-TUBE2 positive trajectories and the reagent concentration. Lower concentrations of TMR-TUBE2 lead to underestimation of the Ub FBH1 population. Higher concentrations, on the other hand, may cause some background fluorescence. The selectivity of TMR-TUBE2 for Ub FBH1 was confirmed by staining of the PEG-pacified TIRFM surface in the absence of FBH1 and by using unmodified FBH1.</p></sec><sec><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Single-molecule trajectories were extracted from the recorded video file using in-house IDL software.

For the protein-free DNA substrates, the extracted dwell times were binned with the bin size 0.25 s, plotted as histograms and fitted using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software to single-exponential to extract respective rate constants. Because of the smaller number of events collected for the RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments and longer dwell times, the bin size was increased to 2.5.

First, FBH1 activity was tested using simple PD containing 22-bp double-stranded region with 3â² (dT)<sub>10</sub> overhang (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt056/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt056/-/DC1">S2</ext-link>). In this substrate, the Cy3 dye was incorporated at the 3â² terminus of the translocation strand, and Cy5 was on the 5â² terminus of the displaced strand near the dsDNAâssDNA junction. The flow cell was illuminated with 532-nm laser in a TIRFM mode, resulting in direct excitation of Cy3 dyes present within the evanescent field. In this experimental arrangement, the substrate molecules outside of the excitation field are not excited; therefore, they do not contribute to the fluorescence signal. Hence, the fluorescence signal is observed only when a labeled DNA molecule binds to the surface-tethered FBH1âbio. The signal observed in the Cy3 emission channel is due to the direct excitation of Cy3, whereas the signal in the Cy5 emission channel arises from the FRET between Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. The spatial proximity of the two dyes in the intact substrate results in high-FRET efficiency (â¼0.7). During the course of the experiment, the same FBH1 molecule binds, unwinds and releases multiple DNA molecules, yielding a fluorescence trajectory such as one depicted in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F1">Figure 1</xref>B. Consistently observing such trajectories confirmed that tethering FBH1âbio helicase on the surface of the TIRFM flow cell allows following individual FBH1 helicase molecules undergoing repeating cycles of DNA binding and rearrangement over an extended period. Our experimental scheme also allowed us to account not only for productive unwinding events but also for events that did not result in significant substrate rearrangement and are typically overlooked in the traditional bulk experiments. For example, in the absence of ATP, FBH1 readily binds PD with the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 58.2 Â± 9.3 nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T1">Table 1</xref>).

In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP, the two types of events were observed: (i) binding followed by dissociation (with the <italic>K<sub>d</sub>s</italic> of 40.6 Â± 2.5 nM) and (ii) binding followed by unwinding and release of the products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Although both types of events were observed, nearly a quarter of all detected events resulted in the duplex unwinding confirming that the surface-tethered FBH1 displays a robust <italic>bona fide</italic> helicase activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T2">Table 2</xref>).

Many of the longer activity bursts on the RFL substrates showed repetitive change in the FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F2">Figure 2</xref>G).

(<bold>B</bold>) To determine whether FBH1<sup>NTD</sup> contains secondary DNA-binding site, we tested its ability to interact with ssDNA and dsDNA by following changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the aromatic residues. We observed the most profound difference between FBH1<sup>NTD</sup> fluorescence in the absence and in the presence of DNA by exciting it at 280 nm and following fluorescence at 320 nm. This fluorescence change indicates change in the hydrophobic environment of aromatic residues, and thereby it can be used as an indicator of the DNA binding.

Although less likely, FBH1 may also target RAD51 for the SCF<sup>FBH1</sup>-mediated ubiquitylation. Either of these two activities would depend on the physical interaction between FBH1 and RAD51. We expected the RAD51-binding locus to reside within the N-terminal region of FBH1. Using the Ni-NTA pull-down assays, we showed that FBH1<sup>NTD</sup> does indeed interact with RAD51 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F3">Figure 3</xref>C), which may reflect the interaction between FBH1 and RAD51 nucleoprotein filament functionally important for the anti-recombinogenic function of FBH1.</p></sec><sec><title>FBH1 forms stable complexes with RAD51 nucleoprotein filament</title><p>To probe the FBH1âRAD51 interaction at the single-molecule level, we investigated binding of RAD51 nucleoprotein filament assembled on the ssDNA dually labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes by the surface-tethered FBH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Similar to the protein-free DNA substrates described earlier in the text, binding of the individual RAD51 filaments was inferred from the appearance of the fluorescent signal in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The dually labeled substrate was used to ensure that fully formed RAD51 filaments were successfully assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F4">Figure 4</xref>A): in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP, RAD51 forms âactiveâ and stable nucleoprotein filament, which extends ssDNA 1.6-fold beyond B-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B36">36</xref>). This is reflected in a low FRET between the two dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F4">Figure 4</xref>A and C). The extended form of the RAD51 filament (stable FRET â¼0.2) was observed in most (90%) of the FBH1-bound species, suggesting that binding without remodeling of the nucleoprotein filament occurs under the selected conditions. The distribution of the ON dwell times was fitted to a single exponential, yielding the apparent dissociation rate constant <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> = 0.18 Â± 0.01 s<sup>â</sup><sup>1</sup>.

We applied our new single-molecule sorting technique to quantify, simultaneously probe and distinguish activities of Ub and non-Ub FBH1 molecules. To increase the fraction of ubiquitylated FBH1, the plasmid for expression of HA-tagged ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B25">25</xref>) was added to the co-transfections (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt056/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>). During the expression process in HEK293T cells, endogenous cellular ubiquitin ligases (likely the SCF<sup>FBH1</sup>) modify a fraction of FBH1 molecules, yielding a mixed pool of Ub and non-Ub enzymes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt056/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>). After completing the functional analysis, molecules containing poly-ubiquitin chains were identified because of their ability to bind TMR-TUBE2. TMR-TUBE2 is a TAMRA-labeled tandem ubiquitin-binding moiety, a reagent developed to bind poly-ubiquitin chains with high affinity and specificity. TMR-TUBE2 replaced the DNA substrate in the flow cell. After a brief incubation to allow binding to the poly-ubiquitin chains on the immobilized FBH1, the excess of TMR-TUBE2 was removed from the flow cell. The TMR fluorescence was then excited with the green laser. Only FBH1 molecules containing poly-ubiquitin chains were visible at this point (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C). The TMR-TUBE2 concentration used in this experimental scheme was optimized to saturate and reveal all ubiquitylated helicase molecules. Although poly-ubiquitylation is readily revealed by staining with TMR-TUBE2, fluorescently labeled antibodies can be used to visualize and quantify other types of modifications.

Each trajectory, which displayed a signal in the Cy3 channel after the DNA substrates were replaced with TMR-TUBE2, was classified as Ub FBH1 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F5">Figure 5</xref>). The percentage of Ub FBH1 and non-Ub FBH1 was approximately 30 and 70%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T3">3</xref>). The ubiquitylated molecules were able to bind, translocate and unwind the Cy3/Cy5-labeled DNA substrates in a manner essentially identical to that of the non-Ub FBH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T2">Table 2</xref>). Notably, ubiquitylation had only a minor effect on the FBH1 activities on the protein-free DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T2">Table 2</xref>); it slightly decreased the fraction of unwinding events on both PD1 and RFL substrates. In contrast, ubiquitylation affected interaction between FBH1 and RAD51. FBH1 showed a dramatically reduced affinity for the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament compared with the unmodified helicase because of the reduction in <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> from 2.7 Â± 0.12 to 0.69 Â± 0.18 s<sup>â</sup><sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F5">Figure 5</xref>D and F and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T3">Table 3</xref>). The few recorded events of RAD51 filament binding to the ubiquitylated FBH1 yielded similar <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> for the Ub-FBH1â¢RAD51 filament, suggesting that ubiquitylation interferes with FBH1 binding to the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, but not with the stability of the complex when it is formed.

PTMs tune activities and interactions of their targets and broaden the range of repairable DNA lesions. It is likely that a small fraction of a DNA repair protein carrying out an activating or modifying PTM may greatly influence cellular fate. Biochemical characterization of such an influence is commonly hampered by difficulty in isolating a small fraction of modified protein from the population of unmodified protein. As a result, an important modification as well as its effect on the protein functions and interactions may be easily overlooked when the biochemical properties are averaged over the whole-cellular pool. Here, we developed a method, which allows us to quantify the fraction of the DNA repair protein modified in the cell and to separate activities of the post-translationally modified proteins from unmodified counterparts.</p><p>The first step in our single-molecule sorting methodology is production of the protein of interest (exemplified in this study by FBH1 helicase) in human cells and its immobilization on the surface of the TIRFM flow cell. Even though the immobilized helicase is invisible to us, its location on the surface of the flow cell can be triangulated based on the activity trajectory originating from that particular location. The experimental arrangement where the helicase is immobilized and the fluorescent substrate is free in solution, allows us to overcome one of the main concerns associated with single-molecule TIRFM studies, namely, the photo-bleaching of the dyes incorporated into the substrate. When the helicase is immobilized, each DNA-binding and rearrangement event involves a new DNA substrate that has not been excited before, thus allowing one to collect long fluorescence trajectories containing multiple activity events. The substrate is then replaced with the fluorescently labeled moiety, which specifically binds and forms a stable complex with the PTM or with the modified form of the protein.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>S</italic><italic>chizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Fbh1, whose anti-recombinogenic role is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B7 gkt056-B8 gkt056-B9">7â9</xref>), human FBH1 was proposed to function as both pro- and anti-recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B6">6</xref>). The ability to antagonize recombination is generally inferred by analogy with the <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> homologues and overlaps, at least in part, with the functions of BLM helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B37">37</xref>), which protects stalled replication forks as well as FANCJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B38">38</xref>), RTEL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B39">39</xref>) and PARI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B40">40</xref>) enzymes that were proposed to antagonize homologous recombination by inhibiting or dismantling RAD51 nucleoprotein filament. The pro-recombinogenic activity is specific to vertebrate FBH1 and is associated with production of long stretches of ssDNA in response to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B6">6</xref>). It is expected, therefore, to be driven by the <italic>bona fide</italic> helicase activity of FBH1. As PTMs may directly influence activity of DNA repair enzymes, we expected that ubiquitylation of FBH1 may modify its activities and/or its interactions. We, therefore, used FBH1 to establish the sorting methodology. The presence of poly-ubiquitin chains on FBH1 molecules was revealed by staining with TMR-TUBE2 <italic>in singulo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F5">Figure 5</xref>). We demonstrated that ubiquitylation had minimal effects on either the helicase activity of FBH1 or its ability to translocate on ssDNA. This result agreed with the finding by Fugger <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B6">6</xref>) that both unmodified and poly-ubiquitylated forms of FBH1 should be able to generate ssDNA, which can serve as a substrate for RAD51 filament formation and to activate ATM-mediated signaling; both forms should also be able to use the translocase activity to protect the replication fork (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to the strand separation and translocase activities, poly-ubiquitylation of FBH1 interfered with RAD51 nucleoprotein filament binding by the modified helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt056-F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt056-T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Fugger <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that overexpression of the F-box mutant (L278A and P79A) reduced RAD51, but not RPA foci formation in the hydroxyurea-treated cells. At the same time, helicase-deficient mutant (D698N) attenuated RAD51 foci formation because of significant reduction in ssDNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B6">6</xref>). The F-box mutant likely prevents poly-ubiquitylation of FBH1 by SCF<sup>FBH1</sup>, yielding the unmodified FBH1 capable of interacting with and dismantling RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments, as only unmodified FBH1 helicase interacts with RAD51, which is consistent with the reduction in the RAD51 foci formation. In contrast, ubiquitylation does not affect the helicase activity of FBH1 and ensuing appearance of the RPA foci. By restricting the FBH1âRAD51 interaction, ubiquitylation may promote RAD51-mediated activities observed by Petermann <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt056-B24">24</xref>) on both the collapsed and on the repairable replication forks stalled by hydroxyurea treatment. Our results suggested that ubiquitylation is used both to restrict the anti-recombinogenic activity of FBH1 and its abundance in living cells.</p><p>The methodology we developed will improve our ability to quantify post-translational modifications and evaluate their effect on the activities of the DNA repair and maintenance proteins. It will also lay the ground for future reconstitutions of the DNA repair and recombination networks in their full complexity.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt056/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figure 1.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>HHMI Early Career Scientist Award</funding-source> and <funding-source>American Cancer Society</funding-source> [<award-id>RSG-09-182-01-DMC</award-id> to M.S.].
