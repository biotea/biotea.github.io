      <abstract>
        <p>Dystroglycanopathy is a major class of congenital muscular dystrophy that is caused by a deficiency of functional glycans on Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG) with laminin-binding activity. A product of a recently identified causative gene for dystroglycanopathy, AGO61, acted <italic>in vitro</italic> as a protein <italic>O</italic>-mannose Î²-1, 4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, although it was not functionally characterized. Here we show the phenotypes of AGO61-knockout mice and demonstrate that AGO61 is indispensable for the formation of laminin-binding glycans of Î±-DG. AGO61-knockout mouse brain exhibited abnormal basal lamina formation and a neuronal migration defect due to a lack of laminin-binding glycans. Furthermore, our results indicate that functional Î±-DG glycosylation was primed by AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modifications of specific threonine-linked mannosyl moieties of Î±-DG. These findings provide a key missing link for understanding how the physiologically critical glycan motif is displayed on Î±-DG and provides new insights on the pathological mechanisms of dystroglycanopathy.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Congenital muscular dystrophies and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous degenerative diseases that primarily affect voluntary muscles. Dystroglycanopathy is a group of these diseases associated with brain and eye abnormalities at the severe end of the clinical spectrum, including WalkerâWarburg syndrome (WWS), muscle-eye-brain (MEB) diseases, Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), and congenital muscular dystrophy type 1D (MDC1D). The hallmark of these diseases is hypoglycosylation of Î±-dystroglycan (Î±-DG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, which along with Î²-DG is cleaved from a precursor protein encoded for by a single gene by post-translational processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. A dystrophin glycoprotein complex that is formed from several intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular proteins including Î±- and Î²-DG subunits connects the cytoskeleton of a muscle fiber to surrounding extracellular matrix components, such as laminin, agrin, and perlecan, depending on the glycosylation status of Î±-DG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
    <p>To date, 13 genes have been identified that are associated with dystroglycanopathies, among which 8 genes have been characterized as those encoding enzymes responsible for the formation of the functional Î±-DG glycans. Protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, POMT2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, and protein <italic>O</italic>-mannose Î²-1,2-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> along with GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPPB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> are involved in the biosynthesis of <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl glycans on Î±-DG. The outer regions of laminin-binding glycans consist of Xyl-GlcA repeat sequences, the formation of which is catalyzed by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE), a causative gene product for MDC1D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation was identified on recombinant Î±-DG, the laminin-binding glycans of which were shown to be degraded by HFaq treatment that hydrolyzes phosphoester linkages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Thus, the laminin-binding region is presumably linked to Î±-DG through post-phosphoryl <italic>O</italic>-manosylation. However, the functionally relevant glycan structure of Î±-DG has not been well delineated, notwithstanding that several mutants associated with dystroglycanopathy have been identified in fukutin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, fukutin-related protein (FKRP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, UDP-GlcNAc:Î²Gal Î²-1,3-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (B3GNT1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, isoprenoid synthase domain containing (ISPD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and transmembrane protein 5 (TMEM5)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, which are associated with impaired formation of Î±-DG laminin-binding glycans.</p>
    <p>Recently, AGO61 (also known as GTDC2) was newly identified as a causative gene product associated with WWS based on the results of whole-exome sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and morpholino-mediated knockdown of an AGO61 zebrafish ortholog<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. It was subsequently characterized as a protein <italic>O</italic>-mannose Î²-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnT2) based on its <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic activities against a synthetic peptide substrate carrying a single <italic>O</italic>-Man<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Although a further Î²3GalNAc-extended and phosphorylated GlcNAcÎ²1-4Man-<italic>O</italic>- unit by Î²-1,3-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B3GALNT2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and protein kinase-like protein SGK196<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, respectively, was inferred to be essential for the formation of functional laminin binding glycans on Î±DG, the precise roles of AGO61 <italic>in vivo</italic> remain to be determined. Here, we characterized the phenotypes of AGO61-knockout mice and determined that AGO61 mediated the formation of laminin-binding glycans on Î±-DG.</p>

        <title>AGO61-knockout mice exhibit abnormal neuronal migration</title>
        <p>We subjected the mouse AGO61 locus to targeted disruption. A null allele was generated by replacing the first coding exon with a neomycin resistance gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). Mice that were heterozygous for the AGO61 mutation appeared grossly normal and were fertile. The progeny of a heterozygous intercross had an approximately 1:2:1 ratio of wild type and heterozygous AGO61, and a homozygous AGO61 ratio that was indicative of Mendelian inheritance. However, the newborns of homozygotes were slightly smaller than the other genotypes and died within the first day of birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a and b</xref>).</p>
        <p>AGO61 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. AGO61-knockout mouse brains exhibited abnormal basal lamina formation and the radial glia endfoot had detached from the basal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Moreover, nuclear staining revealed defects in neuronal migration and laminar organization in the AGO61-KO mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These neurodevelopmental abnormalities are commonly seen in dystroglycanopathy mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which suggested an essential role for AGO61 in the functional maturation of Î±-DG <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>AGO61 is indispensable for the formation of laminin-binding glycans of Î±-DG</title>
        <p>For biochemical analysis, we enriched DG from mouse embryonic brains (embryonic day 17.5) with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) beads and then performed laminin overlay and Western blot analyses using IIH6, which recognizes laminin-binding glycans on Î±-DG, and anti-Î±-DG core antibodies. AGO61-KO embryonic mouse brains exhibited Î±-DG hypoglycosylation, which indicated a lack of laminin-binding glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). An immunoreactive band of an Î±-DG core of AGO61-KO mice migrated to a position similar to that of control mouse Î±-DG treated with HFaq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between WT and KO mice brains in the expression levels of other dystroglycanopathy-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results indicated that AGO61 was involved in the formation of laminin-binding glycans on Î±-DG.</p>
        <p>To confirm these findings, we expressed the AGO61 protein in <italic>AGO61</italic>-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). AGO61 protein expression rescued the defect in laminin-binding glycans, whereas mutants with alleles associated with WWS (R158H and R445stop)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> had no rescue capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Although it has been reported that several dystroglycanopathy models with mutations in POMGnT1, LARGE, or fukutin could be recovered by LARGE overexpression, laminin-binding glycans were not rescued by LARGE overexpression in AGO-deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). LARGE is located in the Golgi apparatus and is responsible for the formation of the functional Xyl-GlcA repeats of laminin-binding glycans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, whereas AGO61 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), consistent with the previously reported result obtained with HEK293 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These results indicated that AGO61 was actively involved in an early stage of laminin-binding glycan formation.</p>

        <title>AGO61 modifies GlcNAc residues at specific sites on Î±-DG</title>
        <p>Most recently, it was reported that AGO61 had POMGnT activity, which contributed to the formation of a previously identified phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl trisaccharide [GalNAc-Î²3-GlcNAc-Î²4-(phosphate-6-)Man]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, AGO61 belongs to the GT61 family, which includes the recently identified extracellular protein <italic>O</italic>-Î²-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. To detect all likely GlcNAc modifications by AGO61, we used an anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody (clone: CTD110.6) with known wide cross-reactivity, including reactivity against terminal GlcNAc-Î²1-4GlcNAc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modification was detected by CTD110.6 but not by another anti-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc antibody (HGAC85) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Interestingly, AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modifications were detected in Î±-DG-Fc prepared from cell lysates but not in those secreted into the medium irrespective of HFaq treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>To identify the AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modification sites on Î±-DG, we generated 3 types of Î±-DG deletion mutants with C-termimal HALO tags (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modifications were detected in all these mutants, which indicated that the modification had occurred in the N-terminal 62-residue segment of the mucin-like domain. This domain contains the previously identified sites (Thr-317 and Thr-319) that display the laminin-binding glycans produced by LARGE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Using Î±-DG373 and its T317A/T319A mutant, we confirmed that these threonine residues displayed laminin-binding glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Interestingly, the T317A/T319A mutant of Î±-DG373 exhibited little GlcNAc modification despite AGO61 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
        <p>Moreover, by LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic glycopeptides derived from recombinant Î±-DG428 expressed in the presence or absence of AGO61 in COS7 cells, among other glycoforms, we detected one that carried three Hex, two HexNAc, and a phosphorylated Hex (PHex) on QIHA<sup>317</sup>TP<sup>319</sup>TPVTAIGPPTTAIQEPPSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In accordance with the substrate specificity of SGK196, which phosphorylates the trisaccharide GalNAcÎ²-3GlcNAcÎ²-4Man but not the single Man<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the detected b6 + PHex ion localized the phosphorylated trisaccharide at T317. This was corroborated by the b13 ions that carried an intact HexNAc<sub>2</sub>PHex moiety and Hex-containing y4 and y13 ions, which localized the additional <italic>O</italic>-Hex substituents at the C-terminal half distal from T317.</p>

        <title>AGO61 is a priming enzyme for the formation of laminin-binding glycans</title>
        <p>LARGE-dependent hyperglycosylation was undetectable for the T317A/T319A mutant of Î±-DG373, whereas the formation of laminin-binding glycans was slightly enhanced when LARGE was co-overexpressed with AGO61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This indicated that an alternate <italic>O</italic>-Man residue(s) within Î±-DG373 (other than T317 and T319) was utilized as the LARGE-dependent modification site by the action of AGO61. Based on this result, we hypothesized that AGO61 was a key regulator for the expression of a laminin-binding glycan on a specific <italic>O</italic>-Man residue. To test this, we used Îmucin1-Fc, an Î±-DG-Fc mutant with only one major LARGE-dependent modification site, Thr-379, as it lacked Arg311 through Ile370<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. As expected, a T379A mutant of Îmucin1-Fc (Îm1-T379A) barely exhibited any laminin-binding activity even under LARGE-overexpression conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). However, LARGE and AGO61 co-overexpression resulted in the production of an IIH6-positive laminin-binding glycan on Îm1-T379A. Moreover, this effect was not observed with an AGO61 mutant (R158H) and several other dystroglycanopathy-associated gene products, including fukutin and FKRP. This supported our hypothesis that AGO61 was the priming enzyme required for determining candidate sites where a laminin-binding glycan was formed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>AGO61-KO mice lacked laminin-binding glycans and exhibited phenotypes similar to those of known dystroglycanopathy mutants, as reflected by abnormalities in neural migration and basal lamina formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). These defects were also observed in dystroglycanopathy mouse models with mutations of DG, fukutin, B3GNT1, or ISPD, due to a lack of laminin-binding glycans displayed on Î±-DG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Our results show, firstly, that AGO61 is indispensable for the formation of laminin-binding glycans.</p>
      <p>Although it has been shown that the laminin-binding glycans of Î±-DG are extended through a phosphodiester linkage and phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-Man was identified on recombinant Î±-DG, their entire structures from the innermost <italic>O</italic>-Man to the outer post-phosphoryl moiety have not been established. It was suggested that the formation of a phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl trisaccharide, GalNAc-Î²3-GlcNAc-Î²4-(phosphate-6-)Man, as catalyzed by AGO61, B3GALNT2, and SGK196<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, served as the base for the extension of laminin-binding glycans. More specifically, AGO61 can attach a Î²-GlcNAc moiety at the 4-position of Î±-DG-<italic>O</italic>-mannose, which is followed by Î²3-GalNAc attachment by B3GALNT2 and subsequently SGK196-catalyzed mannose phosphorylation. Our LC-MS/MS data provide the first evidence for the implicated presence of this phosphorylated trisaccharide structure on Thr-317 in the mucin-like region of Î±-DG, which was previously identified as the formation site of laminin-binding glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In the present study, AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modifications were detected on Î±-DG-Fc prepared from cell lysates but not in those secreted into the medium irrespective of HFaq treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). These results suggested that additional GalNAc-modifications masked the GlcNAc residues during secretion. The elongation of laminin-binding glycans based on a phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl trisaccharide may be mediated by some uncharacterized glycosyltrasferases encoded for by some dystroglycanopathy-associated genes.</p>
      <p>While the mucin-like domain of Î±-DG possesses numerous serine/threonine residues as potential <italic>O</italic>-mannosylation sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, AGO61 promotes the GlcNAc modification of <italic>O</italic>-Man at specific sites, as best exemplified by Thr-317 and Thr-319, for the formation of laminin-binding glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, in Î±-DGs mutated at these sites (T317A/T319A-Î±-DG373 and T379A-Îmucin1-Fc), laminin-binding activity was lost even when LARGE was overexpressed, although it could be rescued solely by overexpressing AGO61. These results indicated that functional Î±-DG glycosylation was primed by an AGO61-dependent GlcNAc modification.</p>
      <p>In summary, we demonstrated that AGO61 served as an essential POMGnT by priming the formation of laminin-binding glycans on Î±-DG. Our findings provide a critical missing link for understanding the laminin-binding glycan structures displayed on Î±-DG and provide therapeutic insights for dystroglycanopathy.</p>
