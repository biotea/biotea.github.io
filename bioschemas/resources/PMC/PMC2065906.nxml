          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Diabetes is characterized by reduced thyroid function and altered myogenesis after muscle injury. Here we identify a novel component of thyroid hormone action that is repressed in diabetic rat muscle.</p>

          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>We have identified a gene, named <italic>DOR</italic>, abundantly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart, whose expression is highly repressed in muscle from obese diabetic rats. DOR expression is up-regulated during muscle differentiation and its loss-of-function has a negative impact on gene expression programmes linked to myogenesis or driven by thyroid hormones. In agreement with this, DOR enhances the transcriptional activity of the thyroid hormone receptor TR<sub>Î±1</sub>. This function is driven by the N-terminal part of the protein. Moreover, DOR physically interacts with TR<sub> Î±1</sub> and to T<sub>3</sub>-responsive promoters, as shown by ChIP assays. T<sub>3</sub> stimulation also promotes the mobilization of DOR from its localization in nuclear PML bodies, thereby indicating that its nuclear localization and cellular function may be related.</p>

          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>Our data indicate that DOR modulates thyroid hormone function and controls myogenesis. <italic>DOR</italic> expression is down-regulated in skeletal muscle in diabetes. This finding may be of relevance for the alterations in muscle function associated with this disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Thyroid hormones play a central role in metabolic homeostasis, development, cell differentiation and growth <xref rid="pone.0001183-Fowden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Yen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Disorders in thyroid function are among the most common endocrine diseases and affect 5â10% of individuals during their lifetime <xref rid="pone.0001183-Hollowell1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thyroid hormones stimulate basal metabolic rate and adaptive thermogenesis through effects on major metabolic tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue. The major effects of thyroid hormones are mediated by modulation of gene transcription. Most thyroid response elements function in such a way that thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) repress gene transcription in the absence of ligand and are activated after binding to thyroid hormones. In the presence of T<sub>3</sub>, TR undergoes a conformational change which results in the replacement of a co-repressor by a co-activator complex, which in turn triggers the transcriptional activation of TR-regulated genes.</p>
      <p>Thyroid hormone response elements have been identified in muscle-specific genes such as <italic>myogenin</italic>, <italic>Î±-actin</italic>, or <italic>GLUT4</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0001183-Downes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Santalucia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Several TR-regulated genes determine distinct aspects of muscle biology. Thus, thyroid hormones regulate muscle development and function by inducing myoblast cell cycle exit <xref rid="pone.0001183-Muscat1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, thyroid hormones exert substantial effects on myotube formation and muscle fiber composition by regulating the expression of several masters of differentiation such as MyoD or myogenin <xref rid="pone.0001183-AlbagliCuriel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Marchal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or by inducing muscle-specific genes such as the <italic>myosin heavy chain</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0001183-Izumo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001183-Schiaffino1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thyroid hormones also affect the outcome of repair in adult muscle. Thus, conditions of increased circulating T<sub>3</sub> levels are characterized by a shortening of the time in which myoblasts are in a proliferative state and by speeding up their transition to fusion; this pattern of changes reduces the number of myotubes that are produced during injury repair <xref rid="pone.0001183-Pernitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In contrast, hypothyroidism slows myoblast proliferation and reduces the number of new myotubes formed during repair <xref rid="pone.0001183-McIntosh1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we identified a novel protein, DOR, which is abundantly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues and it is markedly repressed in diabetes. We also report that DOR regulates thyroid hormone action. Taken together, our data suggest that DOR determines muscle development, function and metabolic response to hormonal cues through modulation of the expression of TR-regulated genes.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>DOR</italic>, a gene that is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart and is down-regulated in obese diabetic rats</title>
        <p>To identify potential risk factors for the alterations associated with type 2 diabetes, we screened genes differentially expressed in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and non-diabetic lean rats (control) by PCR-select cDNA subtraction. After obtaining the subtracted cDNA library, we isolated several clones using differential screening by PCR-selection. One of these clones was chosen and used as a probe, which further allowed the detection of a 4.5 kb mRNA species in various tissues. A human heart cDNA library was then screened and the full-length cDNA of human <italic>DOR</italic> was isolated. This cDNA coincided with the predicted open reading frame C20orf110 (NM021202). Given the criteria that led to its identification, we named the gene <italic>DOR</italic> for <underline>D</underline>iabetes- and <underline>O</underline>besity <underline>R</underline>egulated. Human <italic>DOR</italic> maps to chromosome 20q11.22, close to loci linked to human obesity <xref rid="pone.0001183-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Lembertas1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0001183-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Vionnet1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A comparison between the genomic and the cDNA product reveals an intronic-exonic distribution of four introns and five exons. The protein coding region starts at exon 3 and generates an ORF of 672 nucleotides. Murine and rat <italic>DOR</italic> cDNAs were also amplified and sequenced.</p>
        <p>Human, rat and mouse DOR polypeptides are well conserved (84% identity between human and mouse, 83% between human and rat, 85% between rat and mouse), and encode a protein of 220 (human) or 221 (mouse, rat) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The only homologous protein described to date is a human p53-dependent apoptosis regulator named p53DINP1/TEAP/SIP, with 36% identity with human DOR <xref rid="pone.0001183-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. DOR contains a strong positive charge in its C-terminal region, which is predicted to form an alpha-helix structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) whereas the rest of the protein is predicted to be unstructured (GLOBPLOT 2) <xref rid="pone.0001183-Linding1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

The C-terminal basic motif, indicated by a line of â+â, is predicted to form an alpha-helix structure whereas the N-terminal half is unstructured (GLOBPLOT 2). Panel B. PolyA<sup>+</sup>-RNA membrane containing human adult tissues was probed with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled rat <italic>DOR</italic> cDNA and washed in stringent conditions. The probe hybridises to a transcript of approximately 4.5 kb. Hybridisation with human glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) cDNA was used as a control probe.

        <p>The distribution of <italic>DOR</italic> mRNA in human and rat tissues was examined by Northern blot. In the two models, transcripts were predominant skeletal muscle and heart, while lower expression was detected in other tissues such as white fat, brain, kidney and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g001">Figure 1B, 1C</xref> and data not shown). These data suggest a potential role of DOR in tissues with high metabolic requirements or which respond to insulin. We also examined <italic>DOR</italic> expression in skeletal muscle from ZDF rats and found a reduction of 77% in its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), thereby corroborating the original subtraction hybridization assay.</p>
        <p>Using differential screening, we thus identified a novel protein which is strongly repressed in obese diabetic rats, and highly expressed in tissues involved in metabolic homeostasis. Next, we analyzed DOR cellular function in order to determine the contribution of alterations in <italic>DOR</italic> expression to the pathophysiology of diabetes.</p>

        <title>DOR is a nuclear protein that enhances the activity of TRs</title>
        <p>Several lines of evidence support the notion that DOR has a nuclear function, namely: a) DOR is predicted to be a nuclear protein (WoLF PSORT Prediction programme) <xref rid="pone.0001183-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and b) DOR uniquely shows homology to a nuclear protein. To test the first hypothesis, HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding DOR ORF and the protein was detected by Western Blot or immunofluorescence. DOR migrated as a 40 kDa protein in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). By subcellular fractionation assays, DOR was detected in nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Immunofluorescence data confirmed this observation since DOR was localized mainly in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Within the nucleus, DOR colocalized with PML bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This colocalization was not due to the over-expression of DOR in this cell line since the endogenously expressed protein was also detected in these PML nuclear bodies in murine 1C9 muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) derived from the immortomouse <xref rid="pone.0001183-Jat1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>

        <p>DOR was localized within the nucleus, thereby corroborating the theoretical prediction. On the basis of this observation, and given that DOR is homologous to a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation, we proposed that it also regulates transcription. Furthermore, the high DOR expression in tissues characterized by high metabolic requirements led us to speculate about a regulatory role of this protein in thyroid hormone action. To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with DNA-encoding TR<sub>Î±1</sub> and CAT or luciferase reporters gene fused to TR elements, in the presence or absence of DOR. TR<sub>Î±1 </sub>transactivated the reporter gene, whereas DOR alone showed a small stimulatory effect on reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The cotransfection of DOR and TR<sub>Î±1</sub> enhanced the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g003">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>). This effect was specific of DOR expression and transfection with a plasmid encoding the xCT amino acid transporter did not cause any effect (data not shown). The effects of DOR were also detected when using <italic>luciferase</italic> as a reporter gene (data not shown). DOR did not cause any effect on the reporter activity induced by transcription factors p53 or c-Myc (data not shown). In addition, DOR did not stimulate the activity of the chimeric protein GAL4-VP16, generated by fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the VP16 activation domain (data not shown). In all, these observations indicate that DOR specifically potentiates the activity of TRs. The effect of DOR is not a consequence of a generalized stimulation of transcription since basal reporter activity, activity driven by c-Myc or p53, and activity of GAL4-VP16 remained unaltered.</p>

Gal4-DBD fused to full-length DOR caused a moderate increase (3-fold) in reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and deletion of the C-terminal half of the protein (fragment 1â120) markedly increased this activity (8.5-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

To this end, the expression of several genes and proteins in scrambled or DOR siRNA C2C12 cells was examined during myogenic differentiation (from myoblasts to myotubes). Muscle differentiation in C2C12 cells caused a 3-fold stimulation of <italic>DOR</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), which was blocked in DOR KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001183-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have identified a novel protein, named DOR, by means of a substractive hybridization screening aimed to detect genes down-regulated in skeletal muscle from ZDF rats. <italic>DOR</italic> was abundantly expressed in tissues with high metabolic rates such as skeletal muscle and heart. The experimentally induced DOR repression in muscle cells (via siRNA) markedly reduced the action of thyroid hormones and altered muscle differentiation. In this regard, it has been reported that type 2 diabetes is characterized by reduced thyroid function <xref rid="pone.0001183-Chubb1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Smithson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In addition, skeletal muscle atrophy is a well-documented complication of diabetes and is characterized by a reduction in the diameter of myofibers and a decreased number of myonuclei <xref rid="pone.0001183-Aughsteen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Klueber1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. All these data, together with our observation of a marked reduction of <italic>DOR</italic> expression in skeletal muscle from ZDF rats, lead us to propose that DOR participates in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>We observed that DOR resides in PML nuclear bodies and shows several properties characteristics of nuclear co-activators. Thus, DOR moderately enhanced the transcriptional activity (2.5- to 5-fold) of TRs in a ligand-dependent manner and acted as an activator when tethered to DNA. In addition, DOR bound to TRs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions and to the thyroid hormone responsive <italic>dio1</italic> promoter, as shown by ChIP. The transcriptional activation capacity of DOR occurred through the N-half of the protein, and deletion of its C-terminal half further increased its activity. Whether DOR is a bona fide nuclear co-activator and whether it exerts additional cellular roles remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>More specifically, we have demonstrated that DOR participates in thyroid hormone action. The supporting evidence is as follows: a) DOR over-expression enhances the transcriptional activity of TR<sub>Î±1 </sub>4-fold, b) DOR loss-of-function represses the stimulatory effect of thyroid hormones on the expression of genes such as <italic>actin Î±1</italic>, <italic>caveolin-3</italic>, <italic>creatine kinase</italic>, <italic>IGF-II</italic>, <italic>UCP2</italic> and <italic>myogenin</italic> in muscle cells. c) DOR binds to TR<sub>Î±1</sub>
<italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of a T<sub>3</sub>-responsive promoter (human <italic>dio1</italic> promoter), and d) DOR undergoes a rapid and transient intranuclear movement from PML nuclear bodies in response to T<sub>3</sub>. The rapid changes in the nuclear localization of DOR in response to T<sub>3</sub>, may be relevant in the ligand-dependent DOR-mediated potentiation of TR<sub>Î±1 </sub>activity.</p>
      <p>DOR protein contains two functionally distinct regions. The N-terminal half with predicted random structure (GLOBPLOT 2) shows transcriptional activation capacity (mapped between amino acid residues 31 to 111). In this regard, DOR may belong to the group of proteins characterized by sizeable regions that lack a predicted well-structured three-dimensional fold, which show high conservation among species (from mouse to human in the case of DOR) and in which, contrary to the traditional view, the disordered region is functional <xref rid="pone.0001183-Dyson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The C-terminal region of DOR is predicted to form a positively charged alpha-helix structure and has no transcriptional activation capacity; in contrast, the presence of the C-terminal region reduces the transcriptional activity of the N-terminal half. This observation supports the notion that the transcriptional activity of DOR is subjected to intramolecular control. Such control of transcriptional activity has been reported for other nuclear proteins such as ATF2 or NK-2 <xref rid="pone.0001183-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001183-Watada1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thyroid hormones stimulate muscle development and differentiation <xref rid="pone.0001183-Muscat1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> as well as myogenin, and myotube formation in muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0001183-AlbagliCuriel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Marchal1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001183-Muscat2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Moreover, these hormones induce the expression of muscle-specific genes such as <italic>Î±-actin</italic> and <italic>GLUT4</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0001183-Downes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0001183-Santalucia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We have demonstrated that in C2C12 muscle cells thyroid hormones also potently stimulate the expression of other genes such as <italic>caveolin-3</italic>, <italic>creatine kinase</italic>, <italic>IGF-II</italic> and <italic>UCP2</italic>. The induction of <italic>IGF-II</italic> may be particularly relevant since it modulates the biology of muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0001183-Florini1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, and more central to our study, we have found that DOR loss-of-function markedly reduced the myogenic effect of thyroid hormones in muscle cells, as assessed by the expression <italic>myogenin</italic>, <italic>Î±-actin</italic>, <italic>caveolin-3</italic>, <italic>creatine kinase</italic>, <italic>IGF-II</italic> and <italic>UCP-2</italic>. Thus, our data implicate DOR in the specific stimulatory effects of thyroid hormones on muscle differentiation.</p>
      <p>In fact, DOR loss-of-function also affected the capacity of myoblasts to undergo myogenesis. C2C12 muscle KD cells for DOR showed a lower induction of <italic>myogenin</italic> expression, and a reduced expression of <italic>creatine kinase</italic>, <italic>Î±-actin</italic> and <italic>caveolin-3</italic>. These results indicate that DOR regulates muscle differentiation, at least in part, by controlling <italic>myogenin</italic> expression.</p>
      <p>On the basis of our findings, we propose that <italic>DOR</italic> repression participates in a deficient response of muscle to thyroid hormones and in the alterations of muscle biology associated with the diabetic condition.</p>
