        <p>Relative to vinculin, a unique 68-residue insert in the C-terminal tail of metavinculin results in a loss of actin filament-bundling activity but gain of actin filament-severing activity.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Vinculin and its splice variant, metavinculin (MV), are key elements of multiple protein assemblies linking the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. Vinculin is expressed ubiquitously, whereas MV is mainly expressed in smooth and cardiac muscle tissue. The only difference in amino acid sequence between the isoforms is a 68-residue insert in the C-terminal tail domain of MV (MVt). Although the functional role of this insert remains elusive, its importance is exemplified by point mutations that are associated with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In vinculin, the actin binding site resides in the tail domain. In this paper, we show that MVt binds actin filaments similarly to the vinculin tail domain. Unlike its splice variant, MVt did not bundle actin filaments. Instead, MVt promoted severing of actin filaments, most efficiently at substoichiometric concentrations. This surprising and seemingly contradictory alteration of vinculin function by the 68-residue insert may be essential for modulating compliance of vinculin-induced actin bundles when exposed to rapidly increasing external forces.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Vinculin is a highly conserved 116-kD protein, which links actin filaments to the cell membrane via cadherins and integrins in cellâcell and cellâmatrix adhesion junctions, respectively. It plays a crucial role in brain and heart development, in which it is required for the formation of normal cellâcell and cellâmatrix adhesive complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zemljic-Harpf et al., 2007</xref>).Vinculin interacts with a large number of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ziegler et al., 2006</xref>), but most of its binding sites are masked by an intermolecular interaction between the vinculin head and tail domain, which renders the protein inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakolitsa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgon et al., 2004</xref>). It was proposed that binding of talin to the vinculin head domain and a subsequent helical bundle conversion are sufficient to activate vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Izard et al., 2004</xref>). A combinatorial activation mechanism was also proposed in which vinculin is activated by simultaneous binding of two or more of its ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakolitsa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). Recent molecular dynamics investigations further support the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golji and Mofrad, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The existence of a vinculin splice variant, metavinculin (MV), was recognized nearly three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feramisco et al., 1982</xref>). Although extensive research has been performed on vinculin, the function of its larger isoform remains elusive. Vinculin is expressed ubiquitously, whereas MV is mainly expressed in smooth and cardiac muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feramisco et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glukhova et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belkin et al., 1988</xref>). A minor fraction of MV can also be found in skeletal muscle tissue and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turner and Burridge, 1989</xref>). The ratio of the two isoforms depends on tissue type and ranges between 1:1 and 4:1 for vinculin/MV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belkin et al., 1988</xref>). MV expression appears to be directly correlated to the ability of differentiated muscle cells to contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saga et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koteliansky et al., 1991</xref>), suggesting that MV is important for force transduction.</p><p>The sole difference between the two isoforms in humans is a 68-residue acidic insert in MV that is located between residues 915 and 916 of vinculin, a loop between the first two helices (H1 and H2) of the C-terminal tail domain (Vt; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gimona et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 1992</xref>). In both isoforms, the actin binding site resides in the respective tail domain and is masked by the head domain in the full-length molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Vt forms a five-helix bundle, H1âH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakolitsa et al., 1999</xref>), with the actin binding site primarily residing in H3, H4, and the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). A helix formed by the C-terminal part of the MV insert (H1â², residues 964â979) replaces H1 in Vt to form a new, but structurally similar, five-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rangarajan et al., 2010</xref>). The ordered âstrapâ region preceding H1 in Vt is replaced by an equivalent ordered region (residues 947â963) in the MV tail domain (MVt, residues 879â1,134). The residues preceding this region in MVt, MV879â946, are largely disordered in the crystal structures. There is little difference between the headâtail interactions of MV and vinculin. Three mutations are found in the insert region that are associated with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Ala934Val, ÎLeu954, and Arg975Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olson et al., 2002</xref>), exemplifying the functional importance of the insert region.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>F-actin organization by Vt and MVt.</bold> (A) Electron (top) and fluorescence microscopy (bottom) images show that actin filaments are organized into bundles by Vt and into short fragments by MVt.

(E) Overview of MV constructs mentioned in the text. The position of the 68-residue insert is marked in yellow.

In previous work, we have shown that Vt binds F-actin and mediates the formation of actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we show that MVt binds and severs actin filaments in a concentration-dependent manner. Unlike Vt, MVt does not bundle actin filaments. 3D reconstructions of actin filaments with bound MVt suggest that the MV879â946 region spatially obscures the vinculin dimerization site, thus preventing higher-order organization of the MVt-bound actin filaments into bundles. These properties of MVt may be essential for modulating compliance of vinculin-induced actin bundles when exposed to rapidly increasing external forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>MVt binds actin in a similar orientation as Vt</title><p>We determined the structure of actin filaments with bound MVt by EM and 3D image reconstruction. Comparison with previously determined reconstructions of actin with bound Vt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>) shows that the two tail domains bind to actin in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Extra density can be clearly identified in the MVt-actin reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, red circle). Because the structures of the Vt and MVt helical bundles are known, the difference between the F-actinâVt and F-actinâMVt reconstructions allows pinpointing the location of MV879â946 univocally. The location, as would be expected, precedes helix H1â² of MVt when the MVt crystal structure is aligned to the available F-actinâVt model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of actin filaments with bound Vt or MVt.</bold> (A) A comparison between the 3D reconstructions of actin filaments with bound Vt (blue; from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>) and F-actin with bound MVt shows that both bind actin filaments in the same orientation and that the only significant difference between the two is an extra density at the base of MVt (red circle).

Residues 879â946 at the N terminus of MVt are disordered in the available crystal structures. The cryptic actin binding site of Vt is near the C-terminal hairpin between H5 and the C terminus.

The sequences are 47% identical. Except for D944 and M945, all conserved residues (bold) in the MVt sequence are identical to the corresponding residues in the aligned gelsolin sequence. Asterisks denote identity between the compared sequences.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201111046_Fig2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>MVt does not induce bundle formation</title><p>Vt induces actin bundle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jockusch and Isenberg 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). Although Vt shows a tendency to dimerize in solution under certain conditions, the cryptic dimerization site responsible for actin bundling is a distinctly different region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AbÃ© et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). This site only gets exposed when Vt is bound to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson and Craig, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast to Vt, both fluorescence and EM provide direct evidence that the presence of MVt does not induce actin bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Differential pelleting assays support this notion. All of the actin filaments pelleted at low speed when Vt is present, supporting higher-order organization. However, at the low speed step, actin filaments remained in the supernatant in the presence of MVt. In the consecutive step of centrifugation, at high speed, all of the actin filaments pelleted, suggesting that actin remains as single filaments in the presence of MVt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MVt severs actin filaments</title><p>Fluorescence images show that filaments in the presence of MVt are significantly shorter than control actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Transmission EM of the same samples suggests that, whereas Vt organizes actin filaments into large, highly ordered bundles, the presence of MVt induces short, single actin filaments. We tested whether MVt induces depolymerization of actin filaments by adding increasing amounts of MVt to preformed F-actin. We then checked the supernatants for the presence of G-actin after centrifugation. The fact that we did not detect increases in G-actin concentration in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, top) indicates that MVt does not induce a significant amount of filament depolymerization. To test for sequestering activity, we added increasing amounts of MVt to G-actin before starting the polymerization process. Because no increase of G-actin in the supernatant was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, bottom), we conclude that MVt does not retain (sequester) G-actin. These observations indicate that MVt has no significant effect on steady-state filament concentration or filament elongation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of MVt on actin filament growth, on the initial actin polymerization rate, and on filament length distribution.</bold> (A) Pelleting assays of actin in the presence of increasing amounts of MVt. (top) Effect of MVt on depolymerization of actin filaments. MVt was added after actin polymerization. The gel shows that no F-actin depolymerization takes place upon MVt increase because there is no increase in actin in the supernatant. (bottom) Effect of MVt on actin monomer sequestering. MVt was added concurrent with actin polymerization. The gel shows that MVt does not sequester actin monomers because an increasing amount of MVt does not retain more G-actin in the supernatant.

New actin (green) grows from the ends of existing (red) actin filaments in the control but also when severed by MVt. Because the same amount of actin was added to both samples, the availability of additional filament ends in the MVt-actin sample will lead to fewer actin monomers added per filament than in the control sample. (C) The initial actin polymerization rate is dependent on the amount of actin filament ends available for nucleation, which in turn is dependent on MVt concentration.

The quantification on the right shows that the rate of pyrene fluorescence (F) increases as a function of protein concentration.

To distinguish between the two possibilities, we used a dual-color elongation assay for testing impediment of filament growth. The results show that filaments in the presence of MVt grow relatively unimpeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), indicating that capping activity at the growing end is not a major contributor to the shortening of the filaments. If severing occurs in the presence of MVt, more filament ends must become available for nucleation. We tested for this effect by using pyrene fluorescence in a polymerization assay. The experiment starts with either F-actin seeds or F-actinâMVt seeds. Adding fresh pyrene-labeled G-actin will result in actin polymerization, which will cause an increase in pyrene fluorescence. The availability of additional filament ends will then result in a higher initial polymerization rate, giving a faster increase in pyrene fluorescence signal. Indeed, the initial polymerization rate in the presence of MVt is significantly higher than in the actin control <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>), indicating that severing does take place.</p></sec><sec><title>MVt-severing activity is inversely proportional to its concentration</title><p>Using the same pyrene fluorescence assay, we determined the optimal severing concentration to be at a molar ratio of 2:1 for actin/MVt. If less MVt is present (e.g., 6:1), there is only a small penalty in fluorescence increase. However, if successively more MVt is added in the mix, the fluorescence increase gets more and more diminished and eventually drops below the level for bare actin at a ratio of 1:6. The same MVt concentration dependence of the number of filament ends was also directly observed by characterizing the length of actin filaments as a function of MVt concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Transmission EM shows that MVt is bound to the side of the severed filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Actin organization by MVt and MVÎ153.</bold> (A) EM images showing that the severed actin filaments are fully decorated by MVt (arrowheads).

As expected, Vt does not enter the gel owing to its high isoelectric point of 9.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weekes et al., 1996</xref>). MVt is highly acidic, suggesting that many of the acidic residues in the MV879â946 region are fully exposed to the environment. Despite the addition of the acidic head domains, MVÎ153 only has a slightly higher isoelectric point than MVt, only slightly lower than that of VÎ153. These data suggest that the acidic residues in the MV879â946 region are masked in the MVÎ153 construct.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201111046_Fig4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>The MV insert includes a region that is homologous to the actin-severing region of the gelsolin family</title><p>Like cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pavlov et al., 2007</xref>), MVt promotes F-actin severing most efficiently at substoichiometric concentrations. Binding of cofilin induces twist changes and tilting in the filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGough et al., 1997</xref>), which is believed to make cofilin-bound actin filaments more fragile and more susceptible to thermal fragmentation than bare filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfaendtner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCullough et al., 2011</xref>). Efficient severing occurs predominantly at the borders of cofilin-bound and bare segments of the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike cofilin, MVt does not induce changes in actin filament twist, suggesting that it follows an alternative path for severing.</p><p>The MV insert contains a 15-residue (936â950) segment that has 47% sequence identity with the actin-binding motif of gelsolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The sequence contains the DDY motif that is conserved in the severing members in gelsolin family proteins, and replacement of the corresponding residues by DDY in the nonsevering member CapG converts it into a severing protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In gelsolin, the actin-binding motif binds F-actin in the groove between subdomains 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McLaughlin et al., 1993</xref>). Marine macrolide toxins bind in the same groove and also induce severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klenchin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allingham et al., 2005</xref>), indicating the importance of this site for severing activity. The groove of the barbed-end long-pitch actin neighbor can be easily reached by the flexible region of actin-bound MVt. These facts raise the possibility that MVt residues 936â950 might bind in this groove and induce severing by presenting the DDY motif to actin in a similar manner as gelsolin family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, AâD</xref><bold>)</bold>. However, if either MVt or Vt occupies the site of a neighboring F-actin subunit, the groove would be masked and not available for binding of the MVt-severing region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, E and F</xref><bold>)</bold>. This scenario would provide an explanation for the concentration dependence of the MVt-severing activity: at substoichiometric concentrations, there is a much higher probability for the MVt-severing region to encounter an available actin groove.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Cartoon of proposed mechanism for MVt severing and its concentration dependence.</bold> (A) MVt (blue and red) binds to actin filaments in a similar manner as Vt.

Vt binding to actin promotes local conformational changes in Vt that, in turn, induce formation of large, highly organized actin bundles through opening a cryptic Vt dimerization site. In contrast, we show here that MVt binds, but does not bundle, actin filaments. Furthermore, MVt promotes F-actin severing, most efficiently at substoichiometric concentrations. Despite the replacement of H1 in Vt by H1â² of the MV insert, the binding to actin filaments of the two tail domains appears to be nearly identical as judged by EM reconstructions. Because H1 (or H1â²) does not directly participate in actin binding, this is not surprising. In contrast, the location of the MV879â946 region preceding H1â², which is disordered in the MV crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rangarajan et al., 2010</xref>), is near the cryptic dimerization site identified in vinculin near the C-terminal hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janssen et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the lack of detailed structural knowledge about MV879â946, its location alone provides an explanation for the lack of actin bundling in the presence of MVt: the MV879â946 region spatially occludes the cryptic dimerization sites that are normally exposed in filament-bound Vt.</p></sec><sec><title>Longer MV constructs induce actin filament bundle formation and abolish severing</title><p>Full-length vinculin, as well as full-length MV, adopts autoinhibited conformations. Vinculin activation exposes, among other sites, the sterically occluded actin-binding regions. To determine the contribution of full-length MV conformation to MVt function, we produced the MV deletion mutant MVÎ153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). This mutant lacks the first 153 N-terminal amino acids, which would otherwise obscure the actin binding sites in the full-length autoinhibited MV. In the context of our study, MVÎ153 is an ideal model for fully activated MV because it is consecutively active to bind actin filaments. In contrast, full-length MV activation in the presence of activating agents, such as one of the talin vinculin binding site regions, might require up to a few hundredfold excess to induce observable actin filament binding. In addition, at those vinculin binding site concentrations, the background significantly interferes with image processing as a result of high background noise in the micrographs. Transmission EM shows unambiguously that MVÎ153 does not sever F-actin but organizes the filaments into bundles similar to those induced by Vt or VÎ153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Thus, the presence of the residues N terminal of residue 879 abolishes the severing activity of MVt and reinstates bundling activity similar to Vt.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible regulation mechanism of MVt bundling and severing activities</title><p>Determination of the isoelectric focusing points of Vt, MVt, VÎ153, and MVÎ153 shows that Vt and MVt have significantly different isoelectric points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). This difference indicates that many of the charged MV879â946 residues are exposed to the environment. In contrast, VÎ153 and MVÎ153 carry very similar isoelectric points, suggesting that the charged residues in the MV879â946 region that are exposed in MVt are almost entirely masked by the additional domains present in MVÎ153. Together with the difference in severing and bundling behavior between MVt and MVÎ153, this isoelectric point analysis suggests a possible regulation mechanism that is based on masking and unmasking of the charged residues in the MV879â946 region. Interestingly, a shorter construct (MVt-pro) that contains MVt and the proline-rich region, an additional 21 residues N terminal of MVt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), has also been reported to bundle actin filaments in a similar manner to Vt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Witt et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that these 21 residues may be responsible for masking the acidic residues in the MV879â946 region and, thus, potentially regulate the bundling and severing activities of MVt. This is an attractive hypothesis because the proline-rich region contains binding sites for several binding partners of vinculin, including vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, vinexin, and Ponsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zamir and Geiger, 2001</xref>), suggesting the possibility that other binding partners may be able to regulate MVâs severing activity through binding to the proline-rich region. Another attractive possibility is that the masking of the severing site in MV is sensitive to mechanical forces.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grashoff et al. (2010)</xref> provided direct evidence for vinculin to be intimately linked to focal adhesion mechanosensitivity. The study elegantly shows, using a genetically encoded tension sensor with piconewton sensitivity, that lower fluorescence resonance energy transfer signals (higher tension) occur in instances in which vinculin bears force in the region where the MV insert is located. MV was reported to colocalize with vinculin in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feramisco et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belkin et al., 1988</xref>). It is conceivable that both isoforms work together in complying with sudden changes in tension, both acting as biosensors in cellular force transduction. In this scenario, MV would carry a regulatory role in which its severing activity is activated upon demand when the tension passes some threshold. Application of force would unmask the severing activity of MV, which, in turn, could be relieved once force is diminished. The triggering/unmasking of MVâs severing capabilities would provide a very efficient way to locally remodel F-actin in regions where fast reactions to sudden increases in force are needed. Collectively, our data suggest a plausible, but unexpected, regulatory mechanism for MV in which the ability of actin-vinculin assemblies to bear and comply to force is promoted by local disassembly/remodeling of the region under tension.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Protein preparation</title><sec><title>Preparation and storage of actin.</title><p>Actin was isolated from chicken pectoralis (skeletal muscle) acetone powder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pardee and Spudich, 1982</xref>) and further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 in Ca buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amann and Pollard, 2001</xref>).
