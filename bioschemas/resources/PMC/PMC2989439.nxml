        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited disorder that mostly affects males and is caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome. Here, we show that the XLMR protein PHF8 and a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog <italic>F29B9.2</italic> catalyze demethylation of di- and monomethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2/me1). The PHD domain of PHF8 binds to H3K4me3 and colocalizes with H3K4me3 at transcription initiation sites. Furthermore, PHF8 interacts with another XMLR protein, ZNF711, which binds to a subset of PHF8 target genes, including the XLMR gene <italic>JARID1C</italic>. Of interest, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PHF8 homolog is highly expressed in neurons, and mutant animals show impaired locomotion. Taken together, our results functionally link the XLMR gene <italic>PHF8</italic> to two other XLMR genes, <italic>ZNF711</italic> and <italic>JARID1C</italic>, indicating that MR genes may be functionally linked inÂ pathways, causing the complex phenotypes observed in patients developing MR.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Individuals affected by mental retardation are characterized byÂ impairment of intellectual functioning and deficits in adaptive behavior (<xref rid="bib2 bib27" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Vaillend etÂ al., 2008</xref>). X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited disorder mostly affecting males and is often characterized byÂ a complex phenotype. The XLMR conditions are grouped in two categories: a nonsyndromic form, in which mental retardation (MR) is the only clinical manifestation, and the syndromic form, in which MR is associated with a wide range of anomalies in various combinations, including biochemical disorders, neurological symptoms, skeletal abnormalities, and facial dysmorphies (<xref rid="bib8 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chiurazzi etÂ al., 2008; Inlow and Restifo, 2004</xref>). XLMR is a genetic abnormality of the X chromosome caused by deletions, duplications, or inversions of large gene regions. However, monogenic mutations of the X chromosome are also a common cause of XLMR. XLMR genes are distributed over the entire XÂ chromosome, and until now, around 82 XLMR genes have been identified and cloned. The XLMR gene products can be found in all cellular compartments and are involved in basic biological functions such as metabolism, DNA/RNA processing, protein synthesis, and cell-cycle regulation. However, a major part of the genes is involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation.</p>
      <p>The transcriptional regulatory factors consist of both putative DNA sequence-specific binding factorsâamong these,Â a number of zinc finger proteins, including ZNF41, ZNF81, ZNF674, and ZNF711 (<xref rid="bib8 bib15 bib21 bib24 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Chiurazzi etÂ al., 2008; Kleefstra etÂ al., 2004; Lugtenberg etÂ al., 2006; Shoichet etÂ al., 2003; Tarpey etÂ al., 2009</xref>)âand a variety of transcriptional cofactors modulating chromatin structure. For the latter, two of the XLMR proteins, JARID1C and PHF8 (<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib20 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Iwase etÂ al., 2007; Jensen etÂ al., 2005; Laumonnier etÂ al., 2005; Tahiliani etÂ al., 2007</xref>), belong to the JmjC group of proteins. This protein family has 27 members, and several of these have recently been shown to be histone lysine demethylases playing important roles in development and differentiation (<xref rid="bib9 bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Cloos etÂ al., 2008; Klose and Zhang, 2007; Lan etÂ al., 2008</xref>). Based on alignments of the JmjC domain, the family can be divided into 11 subgroups. Seven of these groups have been shown to catalyze the demethylation of methylated forms of lysines and arginines on histones H3 and H4 (H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3 R2/H4 R3). Mutations of <italic>JARID1C</italic> cause syndromic XLMR (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jensen etÂ al., 2005</xref>), manifested by microcephaly and mild dysmorphic features. JARID1C belongs to the JARID1 subgroup, which has intrinsic H3K4me3/me2 demethylase activity (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cloos etÂ al., 2008</xref>). JARID1C interacts with the Co-REST complex and is involved in the regulation of certain neuronal genes (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Tahiliani etÂ al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>PHF8</italic> gene is located at Xp11.22. The enzymatic and gene regulatory function of PHF8Â is at the present unknown. Both deletions and point mutations in the JmjC domain of PHF8 have been reported and are associated with a syndromic phenotype characterized by mild XLMR and cleft lip/palate (<xref rid="bib1 bib18 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Abidi etÂ al., 2007; Koivisto etÂ al., 2007; Laumonnier etÂ al., 2005</xref>). Based on the overall domain structure and sequence homology, PHF8 is a potential demethylase related to KIAA1718 and PHF2, a JmjC subfamily with no assigned enzymatic specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). Two closely related homologsÂ are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showing conservation of the overall domain structure and of the primary amino acid sequence in the PHD and JmjC domains, indicating an evolutionary conserved role for these proteins (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>A available online). Here, we show that PHF8 is anÂ H3K9me2/me1 demethylase, which binds H3K4me3 through its PHD domain and localizes to the H3K4me3-positive region of transcriptionally active genes inÂ vivo, including a number of XLMR genes. PHF8 interacts directly with another XLMR protein, ZNF711, and co-occupies the promoter region of common target genes, suggesting a role for this factor in the recruitment ofÂ PHF8. A <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of PHF8Â exhibits intrinsic H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 demethylase activities and is strongly expressed in neurons and is required forÂ normal locomotion. Mutation of thisÂ gene causes a global increase in H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 levels during development, specifically linking the enzymatic activity to histone methylation inÂ vivo.</p>

        <title>PHF8 Is an H3K9me2/me1 Demethylase</title>
        <p>To examine the catalytic activity of PHF8, we transfected an HA-tagged version of PHF8 into HEK293 cells and analyzed histoneÂ methylation by immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B, ectopic expression of PHF8 led to a slight decrease in dimethylated H3K9 levels, whereas the H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 levels were not significantly affected. The quantification of the H3K9me2 results showed that the observed decrease is significant and that ectopic expression of an XLMR-associated mutant of PHF8 led to a slight increase in H3K9me2 levels (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>B). Also, no significant changes were observed for global H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me2 methylation (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>C). To test for the specificity of the reduction in H3K9 levels, we generated a PHF8 mutant (H247G/I248S/D249G), in which two of the three amino acids in the JmjC domain that is believed to be involved in Fe(II) binding were mutated. When this mutant was ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells, no reduction in H3K9 methylation levels was observed. Moreover, we tested the activity of two XLMR-associated PHF8 mutant proteins: F279S, carrying a mutation in the JmjC domain (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Koivisto etÂ al., 2007</xref>) and a C-terminal truncated mutant (K177X) deleting the nuclear localization signal (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abidi etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Both of these mutants were found to have lost the ability to demethylate H3K9me2, probably by the inactivation of the intrinsic enzymatic activity and, for the latter, delocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>Câ1E). Taken together, these data suggest that the PHF8 is an H3K9me2 demethylase and that the loss of this activity is associated with the development of XLMR.</p>
        <p>To determine the intrinsic enzymatic specificity of PHF8, we affinity purified full-length recombinant his-tagged PHF8 from insect cells and tested its activity inÂ vitro (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A). Incubation of purified calf thymus histones with increasing amounts of recombinant purified PHF8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B) led to a progressive loss of H3K9me2 methylation, whereas no detectable decrease in H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 levels was observed. In these assays, we did not observe any reduction in H3K27 methylation, despite the conservation of the four amino acids (ARKS) surrounding the methylated lysine of H3K9 and H3K27. Moreover, no changes of methylation were detected for methylated H3K4, H3K36, and H4K20, suggesting that the preferred substrate for PHF8 is H3K9me2. No enzymatic activity for PHF8 was detected when a histidine involved in iron binding located in the JmjC domain was changed to arginine (H247R) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A), confirming the intrinsic enzymatic activity of PHF8. Moreover, we were not able to detect demethylation of nucleosomes as it has been observed before for other published histone demethylases (<xref rid="bib13 bib16 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Iwase etÂ al., 2007; Klose etÂ al., 2006; Whetstine etÂ al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that this is a poor substrate under standard assay conditions (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>B). However, the accurate determination of histone demethylase specificity using histones as substrate can be limited due to the unknown quantitative differences between the different methylation states of the histones and antibody specificity.</p>
        <p>Thus, to further characterize the enzymatic specificity of PHF8, we incubated increasing amounts of purified PHF8 with equimolar amounts of 40-mer peptides covering the histone H3 amino-terminal tail with the relevant methylation levels at K9(me3/me2/me1) and K27me2 position, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). The reaction products were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In agreement with the specificity observed forÂ histones, the H3K9me2 peptide was converted to the monomethylated and, to a lesser degree, the unmethylated form. Accordingly, the H3K9me1 peptide was also converted to the unmethylated peptide, albeit with less efficiency when compared to the H3K9me2 peptide. We did not observe any detectable demethylation of the H3K9me3 and the H3K27me2 peptides. However, atÂ high concentrations of PHF8 catalyzing complete demethylation of the H3K9me2 peptide to its unmethylated form, we detected a low percentage conversion of the H3K27me2 peptide to the monomethylated form (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S2</xref>C). Collectively, these results indicate that the enzymatic specificity and order of substrate preference for PHF8 is H3K9me2 &gt; H3K9me1 and that PHF8 only at very high concentrations has the ability to demethylate H3K27me2 inÂ vitro.</p>

        <title>The PHF8 PHD Finger Binds to H3K4me3/me2</title>
        <p>A common feature of the PHF family is the presence of amino-terminally localized PHD fingers. Recent studies have demonstrated that a subset of PHD fingers binds to histone tails and that the affinity is regulated by posttranslation modifications of the histone tails (<xref rid="bib5 bib7 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Champagne and Kutateladze, 2009; Chan etÂ al., 2009; Wysocka etÂ al., 2006</xref>). These interactions are functionally important for regulating transcription. To examine whether the PHD finger of PHF8 binds to histone tails, we purified the PHF8 PHD domain as a GST fusion protein. The GST-PHD fusion was analyzed for binding to a peptide array covering large parts of H2A, H2B, H3, H2AX, and H4 modified by different degrees and combinations of methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>E). The analysis demonstrated that the PHD domain binds directly to H3K4me3 and, to a lesser extent, H3K4me2. Of interest, the interaction was also observed when peptides, in addition to the H3K4me3, were modified by acetylation at the H3K9/K14 positions, modifications normally associated with transcriptionally active genes. Although we have not performed further experiments to validate the finding, we noted that the PHD domain of PHF8 was also able to bind to a peptide of H3 containing amino acids 44â64.</p>
        <p>To examine the binding specificity further in the context of both the PHD and JmjC domain, a GST fusion protein encompassing the PHD and JmjC domain was incubated with biotinylated histone H3 peptides tri- or dimethylated at either the K4 or K9 positions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>F). Whereas no binding to peptides methylated at the K9 position was detected, a strong binding to H3K4me3 was observed, supporting the peptide array mapping data. Finally, endogenous PHF8 expressed in HeLa was shown to bind H3K4me3, whereas no binding was detected for the unmodified or H3K9me3/me2-containing peptides (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>D). Together, these data demonstrate that the PHD finger of PHF8 can bind directly to H3K4me3-modified histone tails and that the JmjC domain, at least under the binding conditions, does not interfere with H3K4me3 or mediate stable binding to its substrate H3K9me2.</p>

        <title>PHF8 and H3K4me3 Colocalize at Target Genes</title>
        <p>Genome-wide analysis of H3K4me3 has revealed that this chromatin modification is preferentially associated with transcription start sites (TSS) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barski etÂ al., 2007</xref>). The affinity of PHF8 for H3K4me3 could suggest that PHF8 will bind target genes around the TSS positive for H3K4me3. To determine the genome-wide binding sites of PHF8, we performed genome-wide location analysis of PHF8 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by high-resolution ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing) analysis using antibodies specific for PHF8 and correlated this with the binding pattern of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and H3K4me3. The total number of peaks detected for PHF8 based on 9.8 million sequence reads and 9.1 million reads for H3K4me3 after IgG normalization were 17075 and 19534, respectively. Annotation of the peaks to genes using the hg18 genome database revealed that 10039 genes were positive for H3K4me3 and 7682 genes were bound by PHF8 within Â± 1000 bp of the TSS. The Venn diagram in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A illustrates the number of genes positive for PHF8 and H3K4me4 and demonstrates a major overlap of PHF8- and H3K4me3-positive genes (â¼82%), whereas 35% of H3K4me3-positive genes are PHF8 negative. In general, PHF8 either colocalizes or partly overlaps with the regions positive for H3K4me3 and covers the putative TSS of the target genes. Analysis of the distance correlation between the peaks detected for PHF8 and H3K4me3 and transcriptional start sites demonstrates that both peaks are predominantly overlapping with the TSSs containing a common peak maximum at around +200 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). Furthermore, 82% of the nucleotides bound by H3K4me3 are also bound by PHF8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). However, there is no strict correlation between PHF8 binding and H3K4me3 levels (compare, for instance, CXXC1 and MBD1; <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>A). Of interest, â¼35% of the H3K4me3-positive genes are negative for PHF8, indicating that other factors in addition to the PHD domain of PHF8 might determine gene targeting. A major part of PHF8-bound genes (â¼69%) is also RNA pol II positive, suggesting that they are either âpoisedâ for transcription or are transcriptionally active. Because we observed a slight decrease in the binding of the PHD domain of PHF8, an H3K4me3 peptide containing K9Ac and K14Ac compared to H3K4me3 alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>E), we speculated that histone hyperacetylation could influence the recruitment of PHF8 to target gene promoters. However, ChIP experiments using antibodies specific for H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K4me3 showed that PHF8 is associated with genes that are positive for all three histone marks (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S3</xref>B). This result suggests that hyperacetylation of histones is not influencing the binding of PHF8 to target genes and further supports the notion that PHF8 target genes are transcriptionally active.</p>
        <p>Because mutation of <italic>PHF8</italic> causes mental retardation, PHF8 might potentially be involved in the regulation of other XLMR genes. In SH-SY5Y cells, PHF8 bound a number of reported XLMR genes. Inspection of selected XMLR genes <italic>JARID1C</italic>, <italic>ZNF41</italic>, and <italic>ZNF81</italic> supported the localization of PHF8 at the H3K4me3-positive region surrounding the TSS site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D). These targets were validated by qChIP (ChIP followed by real-time quantitative PCR), showing the binding of PHF8 and H3K4me3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E). These genes were also positive for RNA pol II, indicating active transcription (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D). Whereas the chromatin status in terms of methylation is unknown for these genes when inactive, all genes were negative for H3K9me2, suggesting a potential role for PHF8 in the elimination of this repressive chromatin mark. The colocalization of PHF8 and H3K4me3 indicates a role for PHF8 as a positive regulator of transcription by locally reducing H3K9me2 at the TSS. Unfortunately, the current available antibodies specific for H3K9me2 are not very potent in ChIP assays, and therefore, they do not work reliably in genome-wide location studies (unpublished observations; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barski etÂ al., 2007</xref>). To test that the H3K9me2 antibodies can work in ChIP, we showed that H3K9me2 is enriched at the synaptophysin gene (<italic>SYP</italic>), which has earlier been reported to be H3K9me2 positive in SH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ekici etÂ al., 2008</xref>), and, importantly, it is not bound by PHF8. This result indicates that the lack of H3K9me2 at PHF8 target genes is due to the absence of the mark.</p>

        <title>PHF8 Binds to the XLMR Gene Product ZNF711</title>
        <p>The lack of PHF8 binding to all H3K4me3-positive genes and differential binding to H3K4me3-positive binding indicates that other factors influence PHF8 recruitment. To identify such recruiters/cofactors, we purified PHF8-interacting proteins by tandem affinity chromatography. Flag-HA-tagged PHF8 was stably expressed in human TREX 293 cells, and interacting proteins were purified from nuclear extracts by Flag- followed by HA-affinity chromatography (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Subsequently, interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. A single protein, ZNF711, was specifically highly enriched in the affinity purification of PHF8-associated proteins. The <italic>ZNF711</italic> gene is located at Xq21.1-q21.2 and encodes a zinc finger protein with unknown function. It harbors an amino-terminal potential domain followed by 12 consecutive Zn-C2H2 domains potentially involved in transcriptional activation and sequence-specific DNA binding, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). The gene is predominantly expressed in parts of the brain and retina in mice (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>B). In humans, the gene is expressed in neural tissues and highly expressed in 293 cells and in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>A). These cell lines also express high levels of PHF8 (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>C and S4D). Recently, a mutation of the zinc finger region of ZNF711 was shown to be associated with mild mental retardation in patients resembling the MR phenotype observed for mutations of PHF8 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Tarpey etÂ al., 2009</xref>). However, the cleft lip/palate phenotype associated with PHF8 mutations was not observed in these patients.</p>
        <p>To verify the PHF8-ZNF711 interaction, we coexpressed HA- and Myc-tagged versions of PHF8 and ZNF711 and analyzed complex formation by coimmunoprecipitation. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>C, immunoprecipitation of either HA-PHF8 or Myc-ZNF711 highly enriches the other factor, confirming the interaction. Consistent with this finding, endogenous ZNF711 was also immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells by an anti-PHF8, and endogenous PHF8 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-ZNF711 antibody (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). These results demonstrate that ZNF711 binds to PHF8 inÂ vivo. Furthermore, a functional interaction between the two proteins was observed in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E). The strong interaction in these assays indicates that PHF8 and ZNF711 bind directly to each other and that ZNF711 could be a PHF8 recruiter/cofactor. ToÂ investigate whether ZNF711 influenced the enzymatic activityÂ of PHF8 inÂ vitro, we purified recombinant ZNF711 (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>E)Â and titrated equimolar amounts of PHF8 into the histoneÂ demethylation assay. When compared to PHF8 alone, the inclusion of ZNF711 in the assay resulted in a slight increase in demethylation activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>F). Whereas the interpretation of the assay is complex, partly due to the instability of purified PHF8 and the subtle effect of ZNF711, the results suggest thatÂ a ZNF711-PHF8 complex is active inÂ vivo. In line with the lack ofÂ PHF8 activity on nucleosomes, PHF8 together with ZNF711 did not catalyze demethylation of nucleosomes inÂ vitro (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S4</xref>F).</p>

        <title>ZNF711 Colocalizes with PHF8 on a Subset of PHF8 Target Genes</title>
        <p>To examine the role of the interaction between PHF8 and ZNF711 in gene regulation, we generated a specific antibody against ZNF711, and, based on 9.6 million sequence reads, a genome-wide map of ZNF711 DNA-binding sites in SH-SY5Y cells was obtained by ChIP-seq analysis. The 1875 binding peaks were detected, and annotation of the peaks to genes within 1 kb of the TSS using the hg18 genome database revealed that 1204 of the peaks mapped to 1103 genes positive for ZNF711. The overlap between ZNF711- and PHF8-bound genes were â¼80%, and the majority (â¼97%) was H3K4me3 positive, as shown in the Venn diagram in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A. Similar to PHF8, ZNF711 bound its target genes in close vicinity of the TSS. Furthermore, genes strongly binding ZNF711 also bound high levels of PHF8, and the proteins showed overlapping or closely juxtaposed binding regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B). These results further support the finding that the two proteins interact. In contrast to PHF8, which binds to a number of XLMR genes in SH-SY5Y cells, ZNF711 only bound <italic>JARID1C</italic>. To validate the ChIP-seq mapping of ZNF711 and determine chromatin modifications, we analyzed the binding of ZNF711, PHF8, and the chromatin status for H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 for <italic>JARID1C</italic> and two highly scoring ZNF711 targets <italic>C2orf34</italic> and <italic>PCBP2</italic> by qChIP using primer sets covering the ZNF711 binding region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C). The genes showed high enrichment for ZNF711, PHF8, and H3K4me3, whereas H3K9me2 methylation was not detected, indicating a role for PHF8 in the removal of this mark at TSS.</p>
        <p>To understand whether ZNF711 is involved in the recruitment of PHF8 to target genes, we downregulated ZNF711 expression in 293 cells using shRNA and analyzed ZNF711 and PHF8 binding to <italic>JARID1C</italic> and <italic>C2orf34</italic>. As expected, the binding of both ZNF711 and PHF8 was reduced. In addition, the levels of H3K4me3 were reduced, further supporting a role for the complex in active transcription. An increase in H3K9me2 levels upon decreased binding of PHF8 to the analyzed gene loci was not observed. Moreover, analysis of H3K9me2 levels associated with <italic>JARID1C</italic> and <italic>C2ORF34</italic> 500 bp downstream and 1000 kb upstream of the transcription start site did not showÂ a significant increase in H3K9me2 levels after knockdown of PHF8 (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>A). As shown below, the PHF8 homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic> F29B9.2 demethylates both H3K9me2 and H3K27me2, and we therefore tested whether knockdown of PHF8 could affect H3K27me2 levels at target genes even though PHF8 did not show activity toward this mark in inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo assays. H3K27me2 ChIP experiments did not lead to any detectable increase in H3K27me2 levels at the transcription start sites of <italic>JARID1C</italic> and <italic>C2ORF34</italic> upon knockdown of PHF8 (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>B). To test whether redundancy with the other two related PHF8 homologs PHF2 and KIAA1718 might explain the lack of a change in H3K9me2 levels at target gene promoters, RNAi experiments against all three genes were performed. We did not observe any effect on H3K9me2 levels after single or combined downregulation of PHF8, PHF2, and KIAA1718 expression levels on the PHF8 target genes <italic>JARID1C</italic> and <italic>C2ORF34</italic> (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S5</xref>C and S5D).</p>
        <p>To test whether the downregulation of ZNF711 and PHF8 would lead to a change in transcription of target genes, we tested the expression of nine different ZNF711/PHF8 target genes by qPCR following shRNA-mediated knockdown of ZNF711 and PHF8 expression. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E, the expression of all of the tested target genes was significantly decreased in 293 cells expressing shRNAs to ZNF711 or PHF8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>E). A similar decrease in expression levels of ZNF711-PHF8 target genes was also observed in SH-SY5Y cells following siRNA-mediated inhibition of PHF8 expression (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S5</xref>F).

        <title>A PHF8 Homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Has H3K9/27me2 Demethylase Activity and Modulates Coordinate Locomotion</title>
        <p><italic>C. elegans</italic> has two closely related sequences, <italic>F29B9.2</italic> and <italic>F43G6.6</italic>, that have strong homology to the human PHF family (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">FigureÂ S1</xref>). To identify the inÂ vivo role of this class of demethylases, we characterized the function of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). Similarly to the human counterpart, recombinant full-length <italic>F29B9.2</italic> (cePHF8) demethylates H3K9me2 inÂ vitro (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B). We also noticed that H3K27me2 was reduced in these conditions, suggesting that <italic>F29B9.2</italic> may have a dual specificity not identified in the human PHF8. To investigate the role ofÂ <italic>F29B9.2</italic> inÂ vivo, we analyzed a mutant allele of <italic>F29B9.2</italic>, <italic>tm3713</italic>, generated by the Japanese National BioResource Project. The <italic>tm3713</italic> allele carries a deletion of 575 bp spanning the fourth and fifth exon of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A), and the predicted protein, if produced, would therefore lack the PHD domain. In agreement with the results obtained inÂ vitro, protein lysates from mutant animals showed an increase in global levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me2, compared to wild-type animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C). Furthermore, inhibition of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> expression byÂ RNA interference also led to an increase in H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 levels. These results strongly suggest that <italic>F29B9.2</italic> is an H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 demethylase.</p>
        <p>To obtain information regarding the functional role of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we analyzed the expression pattern of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> by generating a translational fusion between the <italic>F29B9.2</italic> genetic locus and GFP. Transgenic animals bearing <italic>F29B9.2::GFP</italic> in an extrachromosomal array exhibited strong nuclear fluorescence in neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>D), even though a few other cells (some muscle, intestinal, and hypodermal cells) showed a faint fluorescence. The neuronal expression pattern together with the fact that human <italic>PHF8</italic> is a XLMR gene prompted us to test the deletion allele <italic>tm3713</italic> for phenotypes related to the function of the nerve system. Of interest, the <italic>tm3713</italic> allele exhibited defects in body movement. Wild-type N2 animals moved by alternating dorsal and ventral flexions along the body length, producing a regular sinusoidal track on bacteria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>E). In contrast to this, the track pattern left by <italic>tm3713</italic> was irregular, with increased wavelength (distance between successive peaks of a wave) but unchanged amplitude of the wave. This phenotype is not due to increased length of the animal body compared toÂ wild-type (data not shown). Strikingly, reintroduction of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> gene in <italic>tm3713</italic> background (<italic>tm3713R</italic>) restored the wild-type phenotype, demonstrating that the locomotion defect is specific to the loss of <italic>F29B9.2</italic>. Moreover, re-expression of the gene in mutant background under a pan-neuronal promoter (<italic>rab-3</italic>) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Nonet etÂ al., 1997</xref>), but not under a muscle promoter (<italic>myo-3</italic>) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fire and Waterston, 1989</xref>), rescued the phenotype associated with loss of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F). We did not observe other phenotypes related to neuronal function, such as pumping, dye filling in sensory neurons, egg laying, sensitivity to levamisole, aldicarb, and serotonin in the <italic>tm3713</italic> mutant allele (data not shown). However, in conclusion, our data suggest that <italic>F29B9.2</italic> is important for normal neuronal function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>More than 82 genes have been linked to XLMR, and this number is expected to increase in the coming years (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chiurazzi etÂ al., 2008</xref>). XLMR is believed to affect 1 in 600 in the male population; however, despite the high prevalence, the complexity of the disease and the large number of genes associated with it have hampered a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to mental retardation. In this report, we have linked three previously mapped XLMR genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F), two of them uncharacterized, which are believed to have a causative role in XLMR (<xref rid="bib1 bib18 bib20 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Abidi etÂ al., 2007; Koivisto etÂ al., 2007; Laumonnier etÂ al., 2005; Tarpey etÂ al., 2009</xref>). We have demonstrated that PHF8 is an H3K9me2/me1 demethylase and that it is bound very close to transcriptional start sites of a large number of active or poised genes. Of interest, the large majority of PHF8-bound genes are also associated with H3K4me3, and the PHF8 and H3K4me3 binding profiles are strikingly similar. These results suggest that the H3K4me3 mark could be involved in the recruitment of PHF8 to active promoters, and accordingly, weÂ show that the PHD domain of PHF8 binds directly to H3K4me3. However, the demonstration that PHF8 is not bound to all H3K4me3-positive genes suggests that this mark is not sufficient for PHF8 recruitment and that other factors are involved. In agreement with this, we found that PHF8 directly interacts with ZNF711, suggesting a role for this factor in the recruitment of PHF8 to common promoters. Thus, the interaction between ZNF711 and PHF8 may instead stabilize the association of PHF8 with the histone tail either before or after H3K4me3 methylation and catalyze the efficient removal of H3K9me2.</p>
      <p>Dimethylation of H3K9 has mainly been associated with transcriptionally inactive genes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Peters etÂ al., 2003</xref>) and may catalyze gene repression by recruitment of repressive complexes interacting with the H3K9 mark. Alternatively, H3K9me2 may hinder acetylation of the H3K9 position, a histone modification present at the TSS site of active genes. Consistent with a role of PHF8 as an H3K9me2 demethylase, PHF8 is bound to active genes lacking the H3K9me2 mark. Even though our results show that both PHF8 and ZNF711 contribute to the activation of target genes, including <italic>JARID1C</italic>, we have so far been unable to detect an increase in H3K9me2 levels upon PHF8 or ZNF711 downregulation. Whereas transcription factors other than ZNF711 and PHF8 are probably important for transcription at target promoters, thisÂ observation indicates that, in a static cellular system like the SH-SY5Y cells, recruitment of a specific H3K9me2 methyltransferase is not a default mechanism. Our data showing that inactivation of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> PHF8 homolog leads to a strong overall increase in H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 levels demonstrate the biochemical role of the demethylase activity inÂ vivo. However, from this study, it is not possible to discriminate whether it is the increased H3K9me2 or H3K27me2 levels or both leading to the observed phenotype in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Furthermore, although we do not have any evidence for a role of PHF8 in demethylating other methylated lysines than those present on H3K9 and H3K27, PHF8 and its <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog might catalyze demethylation of other methylated lysines present on histones or other proteins inÂ vivo.</p>
      <p>It is striking to note that inactivation of PHF8 in humans and itsÂ <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog gives relatively mild phenotypes, taking the large number of genes that are potentially regulated by PHF8 into account. This suggests that the PHF8 demethylases are not functioning as on-off switches for transcription but, rather, appear to fine-tune transcription, and their function is only important for the specific development of certain cell types. Alternatively, due to a potential redundant function of the other proteins of the PHF8 family and potential ZNF711 homologs, PHF8 and ZNF711 might contribute to many other cellular processes in addition to neural development. In support of this, we have shown that the PHF8 and ZNF711 bind to a large number of genes that are required for the proliferation and differentiation of many different cell types in addition to neural cells.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PHF8 catalyzes the demethylation of H3K9me2/me1 and that it associates with the active or poised H3K4me3-positive and H3K9me2-negative genes, including the XLMR gene <italic>JARID1C</italic>. Furthermore, our results suggest a role for the transcription factor and XLMR protein ZNF711 in the recruitment of PHF8 to a subset of target genes, which may stratify those involved in mental retardation from those involved in cleft/lip palate malformation. Finally, theÂ <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog <italic>F29B9.2</italic> of PHF8 is also an H3K9me2 demethylase, and consistent with this and the important role of PHF8 in neuronal function, inactivation of <italic>F29B9.2</italic> leads to uncoordinated locomotion.</p>
