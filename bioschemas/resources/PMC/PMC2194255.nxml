        <p>Human membrane cofactor protein (CD46) protects host cells against complement attack and may function as a receptor for pathogenic <italic>Neisseriae</italic>. We assessed CD46 expression in the human cervical cell line ME-180 after exposure to <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. Piliated but not nonpiliated gonococci adhered to cells and produced up to an 80% reduction in CD46 surface expression by 6 h that persisted for at least 24 h. This response required a minimum multiplicity of infection of 10 and was not prevented by antibodies to CD46. CD46 down-regulation was not attributable to intracellular retention or a global or specific shutdown of mRNA or protein synthesis. Substantial quantities of CD46 were found in the supernatants, indicating a specific shedding of this protein. Adherent gonococci lacking the pilus retraction protein PilT did not down-regulate CD46 but de-repression of <italic>pilT</italic> expression restored CD46 down-regulation. After experimental infection of human volunteers with a gonococcal variant incapable of inducing CD46 down-regulation, variants of this strain were reisolated that exhibited CD46 down-regulation. Pilus-mediated interactions of gonococci with human epithelial cells results in a pathogen-induced manipulation of the host cell environment in which a membrane protein is removed from epithelial cells by liberation into the surrounding milieu.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The regulators of complement activation, a family of plasma and membrane proteins that protect the host from complement attack, are frequently targeted by pathogenic microorganisms (for review see reference <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Membrane cofactor protein (CD46) is a member of this family that is expressed on nearly all human cells. CD46 regulates complement activation by serving as a cofactor for the plasma serine protease factor I to cleave and thereby inactivate C3b and C4b deposited on the same surface on which CD46 is expressed (for review see reference <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CD46 has also been identified as a cellular receptor for several human pathogens, including some strains of the measles virus (MV; references <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), human herpes virus 6 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and the pathogenic <italic>Neisseriae</italic> (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
      <p>The role of CD46 in microbial pathogenesis has been most studied in the case of the MV. MV-induced signaling responses through CD46 include enhanced IL-12 secretion (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and increased release of nitric oxide through modulation of IFN Î±/Î² synthesis (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, regions of the cytoplasmic tail of CD46 are involved in the MV-induced processes of syncytia formation and down-regulation of CD46 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The inhibition of this interaction with CD46 peptides or mAbs specific to CD46 results in a loss of viral infectivity (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, usage of this receptor may come at a price, as the resulting loss of CD46 renders MV-infected cells more susceptible to complement attack (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
      <p>Initial adherence of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> to the human mucosal epithelium is thought to require CD46 and is facilitated by a multifunctional filamentous appendage known as the Type IV pilus (Tfp). In addition to host cell adhesion, expression of this organelle is associated with bacterial autoagglutination, competency for DNA transformation, and a mode of surface translocation known as twitching motility (for review see reference <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These processes are reliant on coordinate expression and presentation of the multiple protein constituents of the pilus. The pilus components PilE and PilC, both of which exhibit variable expression, are two major adhesins in pilus-mediated gonococcal attachment to host cells. PilE, or pilin, is the major pilus subunit, and comprises the bulk of the pilus fiber. <italic>pilE</italic> exhibits frequent sequence variation which arises from RecA-dependent gene conversion between the <italic>pilE</italic> expression locus and one of several silent <italic>pilS</italic> loci (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These pilin structural alterations modulate many aspects of pilus biology including antigenicity, pilus-mediated adhesion, and tissue tropism (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Changes in PilE are thought to contribute to host receptor recognition either through direct, high-affinity interactions with host cell receptors or by acting as a âmolecular scaffoldâ for other adhesion-promoting pilus constituents (for review see reference <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>The pilus-associated protein PilC has also been identified as a major pilus-associated adhesin based on the failure of PilC null mutants to adhere to epithelial cells and inhibition of pilus-mediated gonococcal attachment to epithelial cells by purified PilC preparations (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This protein has been localized to the outer membrane as well as to the tip of the pilus fiber (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and is expressed from two loci (<italic>pilC1</italic> and <italic>pilC2</italic>), both of which undergo high frequency on/off phase variation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In addition to its apparent role in host cell receptor recognition, PilC modulates the dynamics of pilus fiber assembly and is essential for full competence for DNA transformation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p>
      <p>Evidence for the role of CD46 as a pilus receptor includes binding of purified pili to CD46 in an overlay assay, inhibition of gonococcal adherence by mAbs to CD46, and adherence of piliated (P<sup>+</sup>) <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to CD46 transfectants of otherwise nonpermissive cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, the finding of an inverse correlation between CD46 expression and adherence levels of P<sup>+</sup>
<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to various epithelial cell lines challenged the perception of CD46 as a classical receptor for <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Other studies indicate a potential role for CD46 in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pathogenesis, especially an involvement of CD46 in intracellular signaling associated with gonococcal attachment. These analyses include the induction of a CD46-dependent calcium flux upon incubation of ME-180 cells with purified <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pili (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and phosphorylation of Tyr 354 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD46 by the src kinase c-Yes after adherence of P<sup>+</sup> bacteria to A431 human endocervical cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Additionally, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing tail deletion constructs of CD46 did not support bacterial adhesion (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), indicating that the CD46 cytoplasmic tail plays a role in promoting adhesion.</p>
      <p>Other responses of the host cell to pilus-mediated adherence of the pathogenic <italic>Neisseriae</italic> have been described previously, including cytotoxicity for human cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), increased lysosome exocytosis (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and cortical actin plaque formation (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The latter process is enhanced by expression of the inner membrane protein PilT of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, an ATPase thought to mediate retraction of the Tfp (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). PilT is dispensable for pilus biogenesis and pilus-mediated adhesion to cultured epithelial cells but is essential to DNA uptake and twitching motility (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The role of PilT in pilus retraction and its contributions to cortical actin plaque formation have sparked speculation that the tensile forces exerted on the host cell membrane by retractile pili of adherent <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> activate mechanosensory signaling pathways in the host cell to enhance gonococcal infectivity (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
      <p>The putative role of CD46 as a cellular receptor for pilus-associated adhesins (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) in conjunction with the dynamic nature of pilus-mediated gonococcal adherence to host epithelial cells (for review see reference <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) led us to explore the effects of pilus-mediated adherence on CD46 expression and function. Here, we describe the down-regulation of CD46 in cultured human epithelial cells after exposure to gonococci expressing retractile pili. The data are consistent with a cellular response to pilus-mediated gonococcal attachment that is reliant on PilT-dependent processes. In addition, after inoculation of male volunteers with a nonâdown-regulating variant of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, gonococcal pilin variants of this strain were isolated that exhibited CD46 down-regulation. We hypothesize that the down-regulation of CD46 represents a pathogen-induced alteration in the host cell designed to promote gonococcal infectivity.</p>

        <title>Cell Lines and Bacterial Strains.</title>
        <p>The cell lines ME-180, SiHa, FaDu, HeLa, Hep-2, Chang, and T84 (HTB-33, HTB-35, HTB-43, CCL-2, CCL-23, CCL-20.3, and CCL-248, respectively) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. ME-180 cervical epithelial cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Chang cells were maintained in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% FCS. Other cell lines were maintained in DMEM + 10% FCS.</p>
        <p>All bacteria were grown for 18â20 h on GC agar supplemented with Isovitalex (Becton Dickinson) at 37Â°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Piliation state and Opa expression of each population was determined by observation of colony morphology using an inverted stereomicroscope with a diascopic base. Colonies of P<sup>+</sup> bacteria were identified by their dense, domed colonies as described by Swanson et al. (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains used in this work are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>. N401 and its derivatives lacking the pilus constituents PilE, PilT, PilV, and PilU have been described previously as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>. Based on colony morphology, cultures were judged to be &gt;95% homogeneous in their piliation state before use. Where indicated, de-repression of PilT expression was achieved using isopropyl-Î²-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

        <p>Pilin variants selected by in vivo passage of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strain FA1090 through human hosts were isolated from male subjects, who were infected experimentally with this strain, using the procedures described by Cohen et al. (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and Jerse et al. (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The inoculum was a P<sup>+</sup> variant of strain FA1090 used in previous analyses (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>); the pilin expressed by this variant was arbitrarily designated P1. Gonococci cultured from urine or urethral swab specimens from infected subjects show shifts in the preponderance of variants expressing new pilin sequences (unpublished data). The colony variants designated P3, P6, P7, P11, and P17, each of which expresses pilin protein (PilE) with a different primary sequence, are representative of some of the pilin variants that predominated in experimentally infected subjects at different times after inoculation.</p>
        <p>To minimize variation, in vivo-derived variants of strain FA1090 were cultured directly from frozen stock and P<sup>+</sup> bacteria were selected based on colony morphology, recultured, and pooled. Pooled bacteria were used to prepare a frozen stock from which bacteria were cultured for each independent experiment without additional passage. Before each experiment, plates were examined to determine piliation state and the predominant colony morphology for each variant (&gt;65%) was indicative of a P<sup>+</sup> state.</p>
        <p>In some experiments, bacteria were heat killed by incubation for 5 min at 95Â°C before addition to cultured cells or were treated with chloramphenicol at a concentration of 200 Î¼g/ml 30 min before and during the incubation with cultured cells.</p>

        <p>ME-180 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue cultureâtreated plates at 1.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and incubated overnight. Gonococci, suspended in fresh, serum-free cell culture medium, were added to each well at the appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI; based on OD<sub>600</sub> where OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 = 10<sup>9</sup> bacteria/ml). Cells were incubated at 37Â°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. At indicated time points, monolayers were washed three times with McCoy's 5A medium, and trypsin was added for 1 min at RT. The cells were scraped into 350 Î¼l FACS<sup>Â®</sup> buffer (1% FCS in PBS) followed by a 5-min centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in FACS<sup>Â®</sup> buffer containing 25 Î¼g/ml TRA-2-10, a mAb specific to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal complement control protein repeat of CD46 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), followed by a 15â30 min incubation at 4Â°C. Next, the cells were washed twice in cold FACS<sup>Â®</sup> buffer and resuspended in a 1:100 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat antiâmouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).

        <p>To determine if adherence of P<sup>+</sup> gonococci to epithelial cells results in modulation of CD46 expression, ME-180 cells were incubated with N401 (P<sup>+</sup>), MW24 (P<sup>â</sup>), or medium alone for up to 24 h. FACS<sup>Â®</sup> and Western immunoblots demonstrated that incubation of ME-180 cells with P<sup>+</sup>
<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, but not P<sup>â</sup>
<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, led to a reduction in CD46 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) . These results were confirmed by ELISA of CD46 in whole cell lysates (not depicted). Experiments wherein CD46 levels were examined by FACS<sup>Â®</sup> at 30-min intervals up to 8 h after addition of P<sup>+</sup>
<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> established that the decrease in CD46 was detectable by 3.5 h and maximal by 6 h (unpublished data). A similar decline in CD46 expression to that seen with an MOI of 1,000 was induced by an MOI of 100, whereas an MOI of 10 induced a more modest decrease in CD46 and an MOI of 1 did not influence CD46 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) . In addition, incubation of ME-180 cells with heat-killed or chloramphenicol-treated <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> did not lead to CD46 down-regulation (not depicted).</p>

Consistent with previous papers, gonococcal adherence to all nonâdown-regulating cell lines were significantly lower than those observed with ME180 and T84 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).

<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to ME-180 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Furthermore, microscopic examination of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> adherence in the presence of mAbs to CD46 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B) indicated similar levels of adherence in the presence of these and other mAbs to CD46, including 122-2, E4.3, and J4-48 (Research Diagnostics Inc.) as well as a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (not depicted).

        <title>Mechanism of CD46 Down-regulation.</title>
        <p>Studies of CD46 down-regulation in response to MV infection have indicated that surface expression of CD46 declines but total cellular levels of CD46 remain constant, suggesting internalization without intracellular degradation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, in the case of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>âinduced CD46 down-regulation, a comparison of changes in CD46 expression on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A) and in the whole cell lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) established that CD46 is lost not only from the cell surface but also is not detectable intracellularly. However, Western immunoblot analysis of treated cell supernatants revealed substantial quantities of CD46 with the expected molecular weight in the supernatants of cells infected with P<sup>+</sup> bacteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) . Quantitation by ELISA of CD46 in cell lysates and the corresponding concentrated cell supernatants indicated that 25â50% of the CD46 lost from infected cells was recovered in the supernatants. In addition, RT-PCR analyses established that the loss of CD46 is not accompanied by decreased quantities of CD46 mRNA (not depicted).</p>

        <p>We also addressed the possibility that CD46 down-regulation was due to a more global loss of membrane constituents. Surface expression of DAF (CD55), HLA, and E-cadherin was assessed by FACS<sup>Â®</sup> under conditions that induced CD46 down-regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) . DAF, a complement regulatory protein functionally and structurally related to CD46 (for review see reference <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), showed modest down-regulation in response to P<sup>+</sup>
<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> adherence. However, HLA expression remained constant whereas the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin was up-regulated. These data indicate that the loss of CD46 is not a consequence of a generalized reduction in expression or surface presentation of membrane proteins. In addition, the coordinate down-regulation of CD46 and of the structurally and functionally related DAF protein may be related to a cooperative interaction between these proteins (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p>

De-repression of PilT restored the capacity to down-regulate CD46 in ME-180 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) , indicating that PilT was essential to the induction of CD46 down-regulation. Down-regulation of CD46 after induction of PilT expression in the PilT<italic><sub>ind</sub></italic> mutant occurred several hours later than that seen with N401, probably reflecting either delayed or reduced expression of PilT in this mutant.</p>

The PilU<sup>â</sup> mutant, which expresses retractile pili (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), was also hyperadherent (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A) and induced CD46 down-regulation similar to that seen with the control strain N401 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B), establishing that disruption of <italic>pilU</italic> gene expression does not account for loss of CD46 down-regulation observed for PilT<sup>â</sup>
<italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>.</p>
        <p>Together, these results imply a correlation between adherence, retractile Tfp, and CD46 down-regulation. Given the role of the pilus-associated protein and putative adhesin PilC in promoting adherence (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we sought to examine a potential role for PilC in induction of CD46 down-regulation. However, it was not possible to test mutants expressing retractile Tfp in the absence of PilC as the requirement for PilC in pilus biogenesis can only be suppressed in a PilT null background (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Alternatively, we assessed a PilV null mutant that retains expression of retractile Tfp but adheres inefficiently due to a defect in presentation or exposure of PilC (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). This mutant did not induce CD46 down-regulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). Based on these data, we conclude that CD46 down-regulation is reliant on expression of PilT and proper presentation of PilC.</p>

        <title>CD46 Down-regulation by In Vivoâderived Variants of N. gonorrhoeae Strain FA1090.</title>
        <p>To determine if induction of CD46 down-regulation was induced by <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strains other than N401, the in vivoâderived variants of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strain FA1090 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) were tested for their ability to adhere to and induce CD46 down-regulation in ME-180 cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) . Variants P3, P6, P7, P11, and P17 were isolated from experimentally infected male volunteers at various times after urethral inoculation with the variant designated P1 and are representative of variants arising in vivo expressing new pilin sequences (unpublished data). Microscopic examination and FACS<sup>Â®</sup>-based adherence assays revealed low levels of adherence for variants P1, P3, and P11 and high levels of adherence for variants P6, P7, and P17 when compared with adherence of strain N401 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A). Incubation of ME-180 cells with those variants that adhered well to ME-180 resulted in CD46 down-regulation similar to that induced by N401, whereas the three remaining variants (all of which showed lower levels of adherence) did not induce CD46 down-regulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B). These results are consistent with the requirement for bacterial adherence for CD46 down-regulation and indicate that this response is not induced solely by N401 and its derivatives. Although not all of the in vivoâderived variants induced CD46 down-regulation, down-regulation occurred with three of the five variants that were reisolated from human volunteers after experimental inoculation with the nonâdown-regulating variant P1. In addition, one of the nonâdown-regulating variants (P3) was only isolated early in the experimental infection. Attachment of three of the four variants that persisted late in infection (P6, P7, P11, and P17), led to CD46 down-regulation. Together, these results suggest that those variants favored by in vivo selective pressures in the human male urethra are capable of CD46 down-regulation.</p>

Those variants that were detectable at the time urethritis developed (day 3 or 4) are indicated with a positive sign whereas the inoculating strain (P1) and the variant (P3) that were detected early in infection (day 1) but not at the time of urethritis are indicated with a minus sign. Characterization of Opa expression of these variants revealed no correlation between expression of a specific Opa protein and the ability of a variant to induce CD46 down-regulation (not depicted), indicating that the observed differences in adherence and CD46 down-regulation are most likely attributable to variations in their pilin sequences.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We describe the down-regulation of CD46 after pilus-mediated adherence of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to ME-180 cells. This effect was reliant on bacterial adherence, requiring an MOI of 10 or greater, was not inhibited by mAbs to CD46, and was accompanied by the accumulation of CD46 in the supernatant. The down-regulatory response was induced by the laboratory strain N401 as well as by P<sup>+</sup>, in vivoâderived variants of strain FA1090 and was inhibited by null mutations in the twitching motility protein PilT.</p>
      <p>Although the mechanism underlying this reduction in CD46 expression remains under investigation, we have addressed several processes that could account for this down-regulation. In ME-180 cells challenged with P<sup>+</sup> gonococci, both surface presentation and total cellular content of CD46 were reduced with similar kinetics, indicating that CD46 is not internalized and maintained as such within the cell. In addition, we conclude that after incubation with P<sup>+</sup> gonococci, CD46 down-regulation was not due to a global reduction in expression or surface presentation of membrane proteins as was illustrated by the unchanged expression of HLA and up-regulation of E-cadherin. In addition, RT-PCR demonstrated that CD46 down-regulation does not coincide with a specific decrease in CD46 mRNA. However, substantial quantities of CD46 (at least 25â50% of that lost from the surface) were found in the media of infected cells. The molecular weight of CD46 in the supernatant is not detectably altered, arguing against a proteolytic cleavage event. Therefore, we currently favor and are pursuing the hypothesis that CD46 is lost from the cell surface into the supernatant via a shedding mechanism.</p>
      <p>The down-regulation of CD46 resulting from pilus-mediated adhesion requires expression of the twitching motility protein PilT and is manifest 3.5â6 h after addition of bacteria. Certain other processes related to pilus-mediated adherence of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> show similar delayed kinetics and dependence on expression of PilT. For example, the PilT-dependent formation of cortical actin plaques begins within minutes of bacterial adhesion but is not maximal until 4â6 h after infection (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). In addition, the progression from pilus-mediated adherence to intimate association by <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), which occurs in conjunction with a reduction in piliation and by tight juxtaposition of the bacterial and host cell membranes (for review see reference <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), is also PilT dependent and occurs between 4 and 9 h after infection. Due to variation in cell type and bacterial strain used for these studies, conclusions can only be cautiously drawn on the interrelatedness of CD46 down-regulation, cortical actin plaque formation, progression to intimate association, and other cellular responses for attachment of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. Nevertheless, an attractive explanation for the role of PilT in inducing all three responses could involve tensile forces exerted by retractile pili inducing mechanosensory signaling responses in mammalian cells, as proposed by Merz and So (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although MV and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infection induce a similar modulation of CD46 expression, there were some notable differences regarding the microbial constituents necessary to induce this response. Modulation of CD46 expression by MV requires a direct, proteinâprotein interaction between the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of CD46 and the MV hemagglutinin (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Inhibition of this interaction with mAbs to either protein prevents MV adherence as well as the induction of CD46 down-regulation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In contrast, our data from three lines of experimentation suggest that direct contact between CD46 and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pili may not be necessary in the induction of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>âinduced CD46 down-regulation or in adhesion of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> to host cells. We first demonstrated that preincubation of ME-180 cells with multiple mAbs to CD46, including those that are known to inhibit MV adherence (e.g., TRA-2-10; references <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) as well as those that have been described to inhibit <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> attachment (e.g., GB24; reference <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), did not result in inhibition of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> adherence or the resulting down-regulation of CD46 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Second, studies using ELISA and an overlay assay showed no direct interaction between purified pili and CD46 (unpublished data). Finally, upon examination of gonococcal adhesion to multiple cell lines, our data support the previously observed inverse correlation between CD46 expression and bacterial adhesion (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The cell lines that supported high levels of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> adhesion (despite comparatively low levels of CD46 expression) also exhibited <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>âinduced down-regulation of CD46. As these data collectively suggest that <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> adherence does not require a direct interaction between the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pilus and CD46, we speculate that <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> adherence and the induction of CD46 down-regulation may be reliant on interactions of bacterial adhesins with other as yet unidentified cell surface molecules. These molecules may not be present in cell lines that display neither high levels of gonococcal adhesion nor <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>âinduced CD46 down-regulation.</p>
      <p>The role of PilT in pilus retraction coupled with the necessity for PilT expression in the induction of CD46 down-regulation suggests that pilus retraction contributes to the induction of CD46 down-regulation. If an active bacterial response such as pilus retraction is necessary for CD46 down-regulation, activation of a cellular receptor through static binding of a bacterial adhesin could be an insufficient stimulus. Supporting evidence for this line of reasoning comes from the inability of the PilV<sup>â</sup> mutant to elicit this response. Loss-of-function mutants in the minor pilin subunit PilV retain retractile pili yet display reduced-affinity interactions with ME-180 cells, a property attributed to a concomitant defect in presentation of the adhesin PilC (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The absence of CD46 down-regulation despite normal retractile capability of the PilV<sup>â</sup> pilus, coupled with the necessity of PilT in induction of this response, implies a simultaneous requirement for high-affinity adhesion and pilus retraction in the induction of CD46 down-regulation. This implies that, in contrast to the interaction between MV hemagglutinin and CD46, a static interaction between gonococcal adhesins and host cell surface receptors is insufficient to induce CD46 down-regulation.</p>
      <p>Several pilus-associated properties influencing <italic>Neisseria</italic> adherence to human epithelial cells are affected by sequence variation in <italic>pilE</italic> arising from natural antigenic variation (for review see references <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Examination of <italic>pilE</italic> sequences after passage of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> strain FA1090 through the human host indicates rapid shifts in predominant pilin sequence (not observed upon in vitro passage), suggesting strong selective pressures for specific attributes of the gonococcal pilin (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In this paper, induction of CD46 down-regulation by variants of strain FA1090 that had been reisolated from human hosts after inoculation with a nonâdown-regulating strain (variant P1) point to selective pressures for gonococci capable of modulating CD46 expression. Based on the dependence of CD46 down-regulation on pilus expression (as per experiments herein with pilus mutants of strain N401) combined with analyses of the effects of antigenic variation in PilE on in vivo selection and adherence to epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>â<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), alterations in the <italic>pilE</italic> sequence likely account for differences in CD46 modulatory capabilities of the in vivoâderived variants. Future papers will assess these variations in PilE as well as differences in PilT and PilC among the six FA1090 variants used in this work.</p>
      <p>Although it remains to be determined if the loss of CD46 aids or hinders gonococcal pathogenesis, we propose that this process favors bacterial virulence and requires cross-talk between the pilus and CD46. The mechanism by which CD46 is shed from the cell membrane will be one focus of our investigations, as delineating this process may be fundamental to increasing our understanding of this interaction between a major human pathogen and CD46 of host cells.</p>
