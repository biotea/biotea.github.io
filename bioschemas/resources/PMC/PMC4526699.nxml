        <p>To equalize X-linked gene dosage between the sexes in mammalian females, Xist RNA inactivates one of the two X-chromosomes. Here, we report the crucial function of <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 in X-inactivation. <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 is the second-largest exon with a well-conserved repeat E in eutherian mammals, but its role is often overlooked in X-inactivation. Although female ES cells with a targeted truncation of the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 showed no significant differences in their <italic>Xist</italic> expression levels and RNA stability from control cells expressing wild-type <italic>Xist</italic>, compromised localization of Xist RNA and incomplete silencing of X-linked genes on the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) were observed in the exon 7-truncated mutant cells. Furthermore, the interaction between the mutant Xist RNA and hnRNP U required for localization of Xist RNA to the Xi was impaired in the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 truncation mutant cells. Our results suggest that exon 7 of Xist RNA plays an important role for stable Xist RNA localization and silencing of the X-linked genes on the Xi, possibly acting through an interaction with hnRNP U.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>To balance gene expression from X-chromosomes between males and females, one of the two X-chromosomes is inactivated in female mammals. X-chromosome inactivation is a chromosome-wide epigenetic gene silencing mechanism regulated by long non-coding Xist RNA. Mouse Xist RNA is commonly organized into 7 exons, with the extensively studied and known important domains of <italic>Xist</italic> residing within exon 1. However, the function of exon 7 of Xist RNA, which is the second longest exon, remains poorly understood. Our objective was to clarify the role of this exon in X-inactivation through the use of <italic>Xist</italic> truncation mutant female ES cells. Here, we provide evidence that <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 is required for the stable localization of Xist RNA and X-linked gene silencing on the inactive X-chromosome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In eukaryotes, an overwhelming majority of genomes are transcribed as non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One of the major classes of ncRNAs is long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), which vary in length from a few hundred bases to tens of kilobases. A number of lncRNAs play an important role in transcriptional regulation through their interaction with chromatin-modifying enzymes, which direct them to specific target genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. LncRNAs are also known to be involved in various biological processes such as the regulation of the cell cycle [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], cellular differentiation and development [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the regulation of metabolism [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and disease pathogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>X inactive-specific transcript (Xist) RNA is one such lncRNA, which regulates chromatin organization and transcriptional gene silencing in one of the two X-chromosomes to equalize the X-linked gene dosage between males and females [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the epiblast lineage, either the paternal or maternal X is randomly inactivated; this is referred to as random X-inactivation. In random X-inactivation, several non-coding genes in the X-inactivation center (<italic>Xic</italic>) are known to interact to initiate X-inactivation in one of the two X-chromosomes in females [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Xist RNA is exclusively expressed from the <italic>Xic</italic> of the future inactive X-chromosome (Xi) at the onset of X-inactivation and has a pivotal role in initiating X-inactivation <italic>in cis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Highly expressed Xist RNA coats the entire length of Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and recruits silencing factors such as the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) of lysine methyltransferase for H3K27me3 to the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Xist RNA induces gene silencing on the Xi by a cascade of epigenetic modifications that are maintained through multiple rounds of cell division [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There is evidence that the overall X-inactivation can be maintained in the absence of <italic>XIST</italic>/<italic>Xist</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; however, recent evidence has shown that <italic>Xist</italic> deletion from the Xi induces the partial de-repression of the X-linked genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, a recent paper has shown that the depletion of <italic>Xist</italic> in murine hematopoietic stem cells after the establishment of X-inactivation leads to a genome-wide aberration in gene expression, especially in the expression of X-linked genes, and an induction of highly aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic syndrome in a female-specific manner [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This finding suggests a critical role of <italic>Xist</italic> in the maintenance phase of X-inactivation to prevent cancer transformation and progression. Therefore, proper regulation of <italic>Xist</italic> is critical in both the initiation and maintenance phases for cell survival, cellular differentiation and development, and the prevention of cancer pathogenesis in mammalian species.</p>
      <p>Xist RNA has multiple functional domains and directly or indirectly interacts with various proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin modifying enzymes and scaffold proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Comprehensive functional analysis using a series of deletions of Xist RNA based on the inducible <italic>Xist</italic> transgene has identified the functional domain of Xist RNA for gene silencing, and broad redundant region for Xist RNA localization on the Xi and formation of macrochromatin bodies (MCB) associated with histone variant macroH2A1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This approach successfully demonstrated that repeat A of the 5Â´ region of Xist RNA is crucial for X-linked gene silencing and that the redundant region contributes to stable Xist RNA localization on the Xi. Although PRC2 binds promiscuously to a variety of RNA molecules, PRC2 exhibits preferential binding to repeat A of the Xist RNA in vivo and in vitro [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several reports have indicated that <italic>Xist</italic>-specific repeat motifs contained within exon 1 and conserved in various eutherian mammalian species are involved in the localization of Xist RNA on the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Transcriptional factor YY1 interacts with both Xist RNA and the <italic>Xist</italic> gene body through repeat C of Xist RNA and YY1 binding sites near repeat F in <italic>Xist</italic>, respectively; it is believed to anchor the Xist RNA to the <italic>Xist</italic> gene on the Xi as a nucleation center for Xist RNA spreading [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, the interaction between Xist RNA and the Xi can be blocked by targeting <italic>Xist</italic> repeat C with peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) or locked nucleic acids (LNAs). This fact contrasts with findings that a lack of repeat C does not affect the localization of Xist RNA on the Xi of the transgene assay [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U; also known as SAF-A or SP120) has an essential role for Xist RNA localization on the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, hnRNP U accumulation on the Xi is also dependent on the Xist RNA, indicating an interdependent relationship between Xist RNA and hnRNP U for their specific localization on the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. hnRNP U was originally identified as a nuclear matrix- or scaffold-attachment region (MAR or SAR)-associated protein [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is known to have a wide variety of functions such as gene expression, telomere regulation and nuclear organization [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Because hnRNP U has a unique molecular structure with a SAF-Box MAR binding domain and an arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) RNA-binding domain at its N-terminal and C-terminal, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], hnRNP U has been proposed to bridge Xist RNA and the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
      <p>While most Xist RNA functional domains for RNA localization and gene silencing are mapped within exon 1 of Xist RNA, the function of exon 7 in Xist RNA is unknown in spite of the presence of a well-conserved repeat E among the eutherian mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To elucidate the role of the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 in X-inactivation, we generated <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7-truncated mutant ES cells by inserting tandem polyadenylation (tpA) signals. In this paper, we report our novel findings regarding the interplay between the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 and hnRNP U for stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi and X-linked gene silencing.</p>

        <title>A truncation mutation of Xist RNA at the end of exon 6 does not affect the expression or stability of Xist RNA during X-inactivation</title>
        <p>To investigate the role of exon 7 in mouse Xist RNA, we inserted two tandem polyadenylation signals (2xtpA) into the end of exon 6 of <italic>Xist</italic> coupled with splice acceptor (SA)-internal ribosomal entry site (Ires)-hygromycin (Hyg)-pA for <italic>Tsix</italic> truncation to induce non-random X-inactivation of the mutant X. This resulted in the simultaneous truncation of both <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Tsix</italic> (Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005430.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We used the 16.7 mouse female ES cell line carrying one <italic>Mus musculus</italic> 129SvJ (129) X-chromosome and one <italic>Mus castaneous</italic> (Cast) X, which enabled us to perform allele-specific analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between these mouse strains [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As a control, we also established a <italic>Tsix</italic> truncation mutant by inserting SA-Ires-Hyg-pA at <italic>Xist</italic> intron 6, resulting in Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> female ES cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005430.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Allele-specific quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the <italic>Tsix</italic> expression revealed that the 129 X-chromosome was targeted by the truncation mutation (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). While the <italic>Tsix</italic> expression upstream of the truncation site could be detected by using both the 129 and Cast allele-specific primer sets (T1) in control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and two Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>/Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells, the Tsix transcript was efficiently truncated downstream (T2, <italic>Tsix</italic>
<sup><italic>129</italic></sup> exon 4) of the pA insertion site. These mutant ES cells allow us to address the effect of the <italic>Xist</italic> mutation on X-inactivation because the <italic>Tsix</italic> mutation caused a non-random inactivation of the mutant 129 X-chromosome [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>

        <p>First, to determine if the 2xtpA insertion was sufficient for the truncation of the Xist RNA, we performed 129 allele-specific RT-qPCR for the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). In two independently isolated Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant clones, the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 on the 129 Xi was found to not be expressed upon <italic>ex vivo</italic> differentiation. This suggests that the insertion of the 2xtpA cassettes efficiently truncates the Xist transcripts during X-inactivation. Next, to investigate the Xist expression in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells upon differentiation, the 129 allele-specific RT-qPCR was carried out using a primer set designed to amplify <italic>Xist</italic> exon 1 through exon 3 (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This RT-qPCR showed that <italic>Xist</italic> expression was upregulated in both Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells upon differentiation, comparable to the <italic>Xist</italic> expression level in wildtype female cells. We also examined the ratio of Xist RNA expressed from mutant 129 Xi to that from Cast wild-type active X-chromosome (Xa) by allele-specific RT-PCR analysis using a polymorphic restriction enzyme digestion with wild-type, control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). As expected, due to the <italic>Tsix</italic> mutation, the <italic>Xist</italic> was nearly exclusively expressed in the 129 X-chromosomes of both the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells in contrast to the wild-type cells (70â80% of the 129 X was chosen as the Xi) [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, because the <italic>Xist</italic> truncation mutant deletes approximately 40% of full length Xist RNA (7.5 kb out of 17.8 kb), we investigated whether an <italic>Xist</italic> truncation mutation lacking exon 7 affects the stability of the RNA by measuring the half-lives of 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) pulse-labeled Xist RNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). The half-life assay identified no significant differences in the Xist RNA stability between the control and two mutant clones. The half-life of the full-length wild-type Xist RNA in Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> ES cells and the exon 7-truncated mutant Xist RNA in the two Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> ES cells was approximately 2 hours. This half-life shorter than that observed in previous reports, which found a half-life of ~3.5 hours in the Xist RNA half-life assay of the <italic>Tsix</italic> knockout mutant female ES cells using RNA polymerase II inhibitor. This differences can likely be explained by the different approaches we used [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similar to the half-life of the wild-type and exon 7-truncated mutant Xist RNA in ES cells, the half-life of the wild-type and mutant Xist RNA in EB upon differentiation on day 8 was approximately 2~2.5 hours (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). These results suggest that the truncation of the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 does not alter the <italic>Xist</italic> expression or the stability of the Xist RNA during X-inactivation. Because a shorter isoform (S-isoform) of the Xist RNA lacks a large region of exon 7 in a long isoform (L-isoform) except for a 1.1 kb repeat E and 0.5 kb region of its 3Â´ end by alternative splicing, the S-isoform Xist RNA is similar to the mutant Xist<sup>delEx7</sup> RNA lacking the entire exon 7. We examined whether the L- and S-isoforms Xist RNA have a different stability. The L-isoforms of the Xist RNA exhibited a slightly longer half-life in wildtype 16.7 and cells TsixTST6 mutant (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), suggesting that alternative splicing might slightly affect the stability of Xist RNA.</p>
        <p>Because the Xist expression is tightly linked to the differentiation status, we also performed RT-qPCR analysis of the pluripotent cell markers, Nanog and Oct3/4, to clarify whether the <italic>Xist</italic> truncation mutation influences the ES cell differentiation (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). RT-qPCR showed that the Nanog and Oct3/4 expression levels in both the control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells were similarly decreased as the embryoid body (EB) differentiation progressed. Moreover, the outgrowth of the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells was similar to that of the control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells at day 8 upon differentiation, with a slightly slower growth (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). These results suggest that EB differentiation was not significantly affected by the <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 truncation mutation.</p>

<italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 is essential for the stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi</title>
        <p>Having shown that neither the control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> nor the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutation affected the expression of <italic>Xist</italic> or the stability of Xist RNA and that neither mutant exhibited severe growth defects in EB differentiation during X-inactivation, we next examined the chromosome-wide gene silencing induced by the mutant Xist RNA during X-inactivation. We performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization with immunofluorescence (immuno-RNA FISH) to observe the accumulation of Xist RNA and a hallmark of facultative heterochromatin marker, H3K27me3, on the Xi upon differentiation. In the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells, the number of robust (strong) Xist RNA cloud- and H3K27me3-positive cells gradually increased upon differentiation. This is greater than that in the wild-type 16.7 ES cells at each time point, likely due to faster Xist induction by the Tsix mutation in Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In contrast to the strong focal staining of the Xist RNA and H3K27me3 in the control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells, the immuno-RNA FISH results in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells indicated a significantly reduced number of Xist RNA cloud- and H3K27me3-positive cells, despite the comparable levels of Xist expression between the mutant and control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> cells (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Instead of strong focal Xist RNA clouds, the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells often exhibited a faint (weak) Xist signal. While the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells exhibited strong Xist clouds associated with H3K27me3 staining in approximately 65~70% of the cells on both day 8 and day 12, the co-localization of strong Xist clouds and H3K27me3 in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells was less than 20% and 14% on days 8 and 12, respectively. The difference in terms of the percentages of the Xist cloud-positive nuclei between the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells became more significant as differentiation progressed (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Notably, the total percentage of the Xist cloud-positive (strong and weak) cells in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells on days 8 and 12 were significantly decreased from 45% to 24% (clone #1) and from 37% to 19% (clone #2), respectively. In contrast, the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> cells maintained a high percentage of Xist cloud-positive cells (over 75% Xist cloud-positive) during the transitional period from day 8 to day 12. Our results suggest that exon 7 of the Xist RNA is essential for stable Xist RNA localization, especially in the maintenance of Xist RNA localization and associated H3K27me3 modifications on the Xi.</p>

<italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 is required for the silencing of X-linked genes during X-inactivation</title>
        <p>Intriguingly, the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant clones exhibited impaired localization of the Xist RNA and H3K27me3 on the Xi. This observation prompted us to investigate whether the compromised Xist RNA and H3K27me3 localization on the Xi affects the expression status of X-linked genes on the Xi during EB differentiation using two different approaches (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>): RT-qPCR analysis using allele-specific primers (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) and allele-specific RT-PCR using a polymorphic restriction enzyme digestion (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The allele-specific RT-qPCR analysis using 129 allele-specific primer sets can discriminate the Pgk1 and Mecp2 expression on the mutant 129 X-chromosome from their expression on the Cast X-chromosome. Thus, we can only detect Pgk1 and Mecp2 expression on the mutant 129 X-chromosome. In the control Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> EB cells on days 8 and 12 of differentiation, the X-linked <italic>Mecp2</italic> and <italic>Pgk1</italic> expression from the 129 Xi gradually decreased upon differentiation and remained less than 13% and 12% compared to that of the undifferentiated ES cells (day 0), respectively. In contrast to the control cells, the mutant 129 allele-specific RT-qPCR for <italic>Mecp2</italic> and <italic>Pgk1</italic> in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant clones showed that the partial silencing of <italic>Mecp2</italic> (40% and 25% in clones #1 and #2, respectively) and <italic>Pgk1</italic> (55% and 47% in clones #1 and #2, respectively) occurred on day 8 instead of on day 0. The partial silencing of <italic>Mecp2</italic> and <italic>Pgk1</italic> in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells was then followed by the reactivation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> (98% and 89% in clones #1 and #2, respectively) and <italic>Pgk1</italic> (64% and 58% in clones #1 and #2, respectively) on day 12 upon differentiation, although the initial phase of silencing in <italic>Mecp2</italic> and <italic>Pgk1</italic> on day 4 was similar between the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells. Additionally, to confirm the compromised <italic>Mecp2</italic> and <italic>Pgk1</italic> expression from the 129 Xi relative to that of the wild-type Cast Xa in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells, allele-specific RT-PCR analysis based on a polymorphic restriction enzyme digestion was performed (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The ratios of the X-linked gene expression from the 129 Xi were markedly reduced from differentiation day 8 in the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> cells. However, in the mutant clones, the ratios of X-linked gene expression from the 129 Xi remained high during the late stages of X-inactivation. Combined with the data in <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, these results suggest that the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant Xist RNA can partially induce the silencing of X-linked genes, but cannot sustain transcriptional repression on the Xi. This is likely due to the loss of the Xist RNA clouds and the H3K27me3 on the Xi.</p>

        <title>hnRNP U directly interacts with exon 1 and 7 regions of Xist RNA</title>
        <p>We previously reported that the nuclear matrix protein hnRNP U directly interacts with the Xist RNA via the RGG RNA-binding domain and is involved in the chromosomal localization of Xist RNA along the entire Xi region [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To further investigate the interaction between the Xist RNA and the hnRNP U protein across the <italic>Xist</italic> gene in detail, especially in exon 7 of Xist RNA, UV-crosslinking RNA-immunoprecipitation (UV-crosslinking RIP) analysis was carried out using Neuro2a cells as previously reported (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Multiple primer pairs were designed for the quantitative analysis to examine the binding affinity of hnRNP U to specific regions of the Xist RNA. The UV-crosslinking RIP showed that exons 1 and 7 of the Xist RNA could be significantly co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-hnRNP U, unlike the control 7SK, U2, beta-actin and Gapdh RNA. Within exon 1 of the Xist RNA, the second half of the exon (primer positions 4â7) exhibited preferential binding with hnRNP U over the first half of the exon (primer positions 1â3). Interestingly, the hnRNP U also bound to exon 7 of the Xist RNA with as high affinity at primer positions 13â18, with the exception of the repeat E region at primer positions 10â12. We also explored how hnRNP U interacted with the XIST RNA in human cells. Consistent with the data showing that the knockdown of human hnRNP U by siRNA induces the dissociation of XIST RNA from the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we confirmed that the hnRNP U knockdown in human HEK293T cells led to the disperse localization of histone macroH2A, which accumulates on the Xi in an Xist RNA-dependent manner (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These data suggest that hnRNP U is essential for XIST RNA localization on the Xi in both humans and mice. Similar to the interaction between mouse Xist RNA and hnRNP U, the UV-crosslinking RIP analysis revealed that the human hnRNP U preferentially bound to XIST RNA broadly in the second half of the first exon and the last exon, except for the repeat E region (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that exon 7 of the Xist RNA could contribute to the stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi through interaction with hnRNP U.</p>

        <p>Next, to investigate whether the unstable Xist RNA localization and X-linked gene silencing on the Xi observed in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells was due to the disturbed interaction between hnRNP U and the Xist RNA lacking exon 7, we performed UV-crosslinked RIP using Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant ES cell lines expressing a FLAG-HA epitope tag hnRNP U. To establish the ES cell lines expressing the FLAG-HA tagged hnRNP U from the endogenous hnRNP U loci, we used the CRISPR/Cas system. With this system, we obtained 2 and 3 FLAG-HA biallelic knock-in ES cell lines derived from the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant ES cells, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). By RT-qPCR and western blotting using anti-FLAG and anti-hnRNP U antibodies, we confirmed that the FLAG-HA knock-in ES cell lines expressed similar levels of FLAG-HA-hnRNP U to those of the parental ES cell lines (the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant ES cell lines) on day 12 upon differentiation (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5Câ5E</xref>).

Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> cells expressing wildtype Xist RNA exhibited a similar pattern of hnRNP U binding across Xist RNA, as observed in the Neuro2A cells showing preferential binding of hnRNP U to the 3Â´ regions of exon 1 and exon 7 of Xist RNA (with the exception of repeat E) (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Approximately 2.5â18% of the wild-type Xist RNA was precipitated by FLAG-hnRNP U immunoprecipitation at all primer pair positions in the differentiating EB of the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> and Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant ES cell lines, while approximately 2â25% of the Xist RNA was recovered by FLAG-hnRNP U IP at a similar position in the Neuro2A cells (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). The slightly lower Xist RIP efficiency that was observed in the EB cells could be due to the incomplete induction of X-inactivation (less than 80% on day 12) (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) or to insufficient UV-irradiation on the inside of the sphere-shaped differentiating EB cells. Interestingly, the prominent binding of FLAG-HA-hnRNP U at the 3' region of exon 1 in Xist RNA was impaired by ~30% in the Xist<sup>delEx7</sup>Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> mutant cells compared to that of the wild-type Xist RNA in the Tsix<sup>TST6</sup> cells (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). These data indicate that exon 7 of Xist RNA could be required for the interaction between the Xist RNA and hnRNP U or maintenance of the Xist RNA-hnRNP U RNP complex. Overall, these data suggest that exon 7 of Xist RNA is essential for stable Xist RNA localization and X-linked gene silencing, possibly acting through an interaction with hnRNP U.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we provided novel evidence that <italic>Xist</italic> exon 7 is necessary for the localization of Xist RNA during X-inactivation. Our results show that the aberrant localization of mutant Xist RNA lacking exon 7 on the Xi leads to the loss of the Xist cloud and the H3K27me3 modification on the Xi and impairs X-linked gene silencing due to the impaired binding affinity of Xist RNA to hnRNP U which bridges the Xist RNA and the Xi.</p>
      <p>Previously, to examine the effects of <italic>Xist</italic> mutations on chromosome silencing and coating, tetracycline (tet)-inducible mutant Xist RNA constructs containing exon 7 specific deletions were generated and introduced into the <italic>Hprt</italic> locus of male ES cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The results showed that a large deletion of the 3' end of the Xist RNA that included exon 7 resulted in weak defects in Xist RNA localization on the Xi, X-linked gene silencing and MCB formation. In contrast to these results, our <italic>Xist</italic> truncation mutant at the endogenous locus exhibited a severe phenotype in terms of X-inactivation (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Exon 7 truncated Xist RNA lost its ability to localize to the Xi and failed to induce or maintain X-linked gene silencing. Similar phenotypic differences were observed in the repeat C study in the Xist RNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Two independent studies using antisense PNA or LNA oligonucleotides to block the repeat C function of the Xist RNA revealed a crucial function of the repeat C in Xist RNA for its localization to the Xi [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, a tet-inducible <italic>Xist</italic> transgene assay showed that the repeat C deletion in the Xist RNA affects neither the Xist RNA localization on the Xi nor the silencing of adjacent selection markers [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These differences might reflect differences in the systems used to elucidate the functional domain of the Xist RNA. One possibility is that the tet-inducible promoter used in the tet-inducible transgene assay might induce much higher levels of Xist expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, an abundant mutant Xist RNA could compensate for the defects of the mutant Xist RNA in the Xist RNA localization and X-linked gene silencing.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the tet-inducible <italic>XIST</italic> transgene assay in human cells showed that XIST RNA lacking a large part of its 3' region (from the end of the exon 1 through the last exon) displayed dispersed localization of XIST RNA on the targeted locus, yet could still induce adjacent EGFP silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the deletion of the central region of XIST exon 1, including repeat C in the XIST transgene, did not affect the XIST localization [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Whereas human XIST RNA has only one poorly conserved repeat C in exon 1, there are 14 copies of a 120 bp repeat C in mice, which are crucial for Xist RNA function [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, while both the first and last exons of Xist RNA are indispensable for its localization onto the Xi in mice, it is possible that the role of the second largest exon in human <italic>XIST</italic>, exon 6, might be more crucial for XIST RNA localization on the Xi than exon 1 in human cells.</p>
      <p>To further explore the detailed mechanisms of how Xist RNA is stably anchored onto the Xi, we extended our previous approach [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to clarify the detailed interaction between Xist RNA and hnRNP U. Because hnRNP U has an RGG RNA-binding domain required for the interaction with Xist RNA and a SAF domain for SAR/MAR attachment and DNA binding [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], it is likely that hnRNP U anchors Xist RNA onto the Xi to induce and maintain X-linked gene silencing during X-inactivation. The UV-crosslinking RIP analysis using a growing number of primers across the <italic>Xist</italic> gene showed that hnRNP U broadly bound not only to exon 1 of Xist RNA but also to exon 7 (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005430.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). We also showed that the truncation mutation of Xist RNA lacking exon 7 results in an impaired interaction of the mutant Xist RNA with hnRNP U, indicating that exon 7 of Xist RNA is essential for the stable interaction with hnRNP U (<xref rid="pgen.1005430.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). These results raise the possibility that stable Xist RNA localization on the Xi is mediated through the binding of hnRNP U to both exon 1 and 7 of the Xist RNA.</p>
      <p>Previous work has shown that an absence of hnRNP U leads to the loss of the L-isoform of Xist RNA which contains the full length of exon 7, suggesting that an interaction of hnRNP to exon 7 of Xist RNA might regulate the stability of L-isoform of Xist RNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These observations suggest that the interaction between hnRNP U and exon 7 of Xist RNA is crucial for both the stability of Xist RNA and the localization of the Xist RNA on the Xi. Alternatively, hnRNP U might regulate the splicing of Xist RNA because hnRNP U is known to regulate the global control of alternative splicing of noncoding RNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although hnRNP U might regulate the splicing of nascent Xist RNAs transcribed at the endogenous <italic>Xist</italic> locus, it is unlikely that the hnRNP U accumulated across the entire Xi plays a role in the splicing of Xist RNA because the majority of Xist RNA is the spliced mature RNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, a previous report has shown that even without splicing, inducible <italic>Xist</italic> cDNA transgenes can induce hnRNP U and Xist RNA localization to the Xi following gene silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], indicating that Xist RNA-dependent hnRNP U accumulation on the Xi is not related to the splicing of Xist RNA. On the other hand, because the S-isoform of Xist RNA lacks a large region of exon 7 except for a 1.7 kb repeat E and 0.4 kb region of its 3Â´ end, it lacks a large hnRNP U binding region similar to the mutant Xist<sup>delEx7</sup> RNA lacking the entire exon 7. It would be interesting to delineate the distinct roles of the L- and S-isoforms of Xist RNA in X-inactivation.</p>
      <p>How does exon 7 of Xist RNA contribute to the stable interaction with hnRNP U and localization of Xist RNA on the Xi? One possibility is that multiple hnRNP U binding across exons 1 and 7 of Xist RNA might be essential for the stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi. Thus, the mutant Xist<sup>delEx7</sup> RNA lacking multiple hnRNP U binding sites within exon 7 of Xist RNA results in its unstable localization on the Xi. Alternatively, exon 7 of the Xist RNA might contribute to the stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi through the RNP complex formation with hnRNP U. Because it is known that hnRNP U can form nucleic acid-mediated aggregation [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], multiple hnRNP U binding to both exon 1 and exon 7 within one Xist RNA molecule might facilitate the formation of an aggregated hnRNP U complex and stabilize the functional RNP complex. Without exon 7 of the Xist RNA, an insufficient number of hnRNP U might not be able to maintain the aggregated hnRNP U-Xist RNA complex, resulting in inefficient Xist RNA binding to the Xi.</p>
      <p>To date, many chromatin modification enzymes have been known to interact with lncRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] but it remains unclear how these chromatin modification enzymes are recruited to their specific target loci to modify the chromatin structure. As a representative example, Xist RNA interacting with multiple chromatin modifying enzymes is targeted to the Xi to establish a multi-layer repressive epigenetic landscape [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While we note the potential role of hnRNP U to target Xist RNA to the Xi through interactions with specific RNA regions in this work, multiple recent reports have suggested that interactions between hnRNP proteins and lncRNAs play a pivotal role in numerous physiological processes, such as local gene regulation, nuclear organization, and the immune response [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although the role of hnRNP proteins in each physiological process remains to be elucidated, these findings suggest that hnRNPs may be crucial players in the recruitment of lncRNA and its associated factors, such as chromatin modifying enzymes, onto their target loci. The interaction between Xist RNA and hnRNP U would be a great model to uncover how RNP complexes of lncRNAs, hnRNPs and chromatin-modifying enzymes are established and recruited to their specific target sites to regulate local gene regulation. Further studies of the interaction between the hnRNPs and lncRNAs will be necessary to shed light on the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the biological processes mediated by lncRNAs.</p>

        <p>The targeting vectors for the <italic>Xist</italic>/<italic>Tsix</italic> and <italic>Tsix</italic> truncation mutation were constructed using homologous recombination in bacteria [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

The pGEM-Xex2-7-DTAR was transfected to SW106 for recombination in bacteria. To generate the promoterless Hyg selection cassette, the BamHI fragment of SA-tpA from pSS-SAtpA1lox-DTAF [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was subcloned into a pGEM vector derivative in which the EcoRI and HindIII sites in pGEM11-Zf(-) were replaced by SpeI, yielding pGEM-SAtpA-1. BamHI (Klenow-filled)-EcoRV Ires-Hyg fragment of pQCXIH (Clontech) was inserted into the Klenow-filled HindIII site between SA and tpA of pGEM-SAtpA-1 in the same direction. The BamHI SA-Ires-Hyg-tpA cassette was transferred into the pBluescript II SK- (pBS-SKII-) plasmid at the BamHI site, yielding pBS-SA-Ires-Hyg-tpA. To create a selection marker flanked by two FRT derivative F3 sites for the selection of homologous recombination in bacteria, the adaptor (F3-F and F3-R primers) was ligated into the HindIII/EcoRI of pBS-SKII- (pBS-2xF3), and a NheI-EcoRI zeocin (Zeo) cassette of pSKY [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] was cloned into the pBS-2xF3 at NheI and MfeI site between two F3 sites, yielding the pBS-2xF3-Zeo plasmid. For the construction of the <italic>Tsix</italic>-truncation targeting vector, the right arm (annealed XTST-F9L and XTST-R9L primers) for homologous recombination in bacteria was inserted into the BstBI/SacI of pBS-2xF3-Zeo, yielding pBS-2xF3-R85. The SpeI (Klenow-filled)-NotI SA-Ires-Hyg-tpA of pBS-SA-Ires-Hyg-tpA and the left arm (annealed TST-F8 and TST-R8 primers) were inserted into the HindIII (Klenow-filled)-XhoI of pBS-2xF3-Zeo-R85. tpA was replaced by an Eco53kI-NotI beta-actin pA (bpA) fragment of pGEM11-DTAL. For the <italic>Xist</italic>/<italic>Tsix</italic> truncation, the SA-tpA cassette was cloned into pBS-SKII(-). SA was replaced with an additional tpA fragment which was amplified with pA-BamXmaI-F and pA-BglII-R, yielding pBS-2xtpA-F. The left arm of the <italic>Tsix</italic>-truncation targeting construct for bacterial recombination was replaced with the left arm for <italic>Xist</italic>/<italic>Tsix</italic>-truncation (adaptor with XST-F7 and XST-R7) and EcoRV-NotI 2xtpA cassette from pBS-2xtpA-F. Selection cassettes with left and right homology arms for bacterial recombination were released by SalI-Bsu36I digestion and inserted into pGEM-Xex2-7-DTAR at position chrX: 103,468,781 and chrX: 103,468,781â103,468,821 in GRCm38/mm10 (UCSC genome browser) for the <italic>Tsix</italic>- and <italic>Xist</italic>/<italic>Tsix</italic>-truncation constructs, respectively.

Anti-Flag M2 beads (Sigma), or protein G beads (Millipore) conjugated with 3 Î¼g of control IgG (Jackson or Millipore) or anti-hnRNP-U (3G6, Santa Cruz) were added to the cell lysates and rotated at 4Â°C for 2 h. The beads were washed twice with high salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) and three times with low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0] 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). The washed beads were treated with proteinase K at 37Â°C for 1 h, and the RNA was extracted with Trizol LS Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Purified RNA treated with DNase I was dissolved in 20 Î¼l nuclease free water, and cDNA was synthesized using 2 Î¼l of the RNA samples. Quantitative PCR was performed using the primers listed in <xref rid="pgen.1005430.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

        <title>Targeted knock-in of the FLAG-HA epitope tag to hnRNP U by the CRISPR/Cas system</title>
        <p>pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] (pX459, Addgene plasmid #48139) was used for CRISPR/Cas-mediated FLAG-HA knock-in to the 5Â´-end of the hnRNP U coding region. To avoid the premature termination of sgRNA and to improve the sgRNA-Cas9 assembly, mutations were introduced to pX459 [<xref rid="pgen.1005430.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. pX459 was digested with BbsI and KpnI and ligated with three pairs of oligonucleotides (hnRNPU-CRI-F &amp; hnRNPU-CRI-R, sgRNA-[F+E]-F1 &amp; sgRNA-[F+E]-R1, sgRNA-[F+E]-F2 &amp; sgRNA-[F+E]-R2), each of which were phosphorylated, denatured and annealed before ligation, yielding pX459FE-hnRNPU. 5x10<sup>6</sup> ES cells were plated on 6-well plates with feeder cells 8 hours before transfection. Cells were transfected with FuGENE HD (Roche) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, with 1 Î¼g pX459FE-hnRNPU vector and 1 Î¼g single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (hnRNPU-FLAGHA-KI) for the homology directed repair (HDR)-mediated FLAG-HA knock-in. 16 hour after transfection, 2 Î¼g/ml of puromycin was added to the ES media and ES cells were cultured for 24 hours. After puromycin selection, cells were trypsinized and 1/5 of cells were plated onto a 10 cm dish with feeder cells without any selection drug. Colonies were picked on 8 days after plating.</p>

        <title>Western blotting</title>
        <p>Differentiated EB cells were lysed on day 12 with RIPA buffer and sonicated using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) set on âHIGHâ for 4 cycles of 30 sec ON and 30 sec OFF. Equal amounts of total protein (20 Î¼g per lane) were applied and run on a 4â15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked by 5% skim milk in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h, and incubated using primary antibodies against FLAG M2 (mouse 1:2,000, Sigma), hnRNP U (clone 3G6, mouse 1:1,000, Millipore) and alpha Tubulin DM1A (mouse 1:5,000, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4Â°C. After incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (anti-mouse IgG 1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h, immune complexes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Thermo Scientific) or Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore), and quantitated by AlphaView (Alpha Innotech).</p>
