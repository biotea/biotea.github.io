          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is an integral component of the pathway for Na<sup>+</sup> absorption in epithelial cells. The ubiquitin ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 bind to ENaC and decrease its activity. Conversely, Serum- and Glucocorticoid regulated Kinase-1 (SGK1), a downstream mediator of aldosterone, increases ENaC activity. This effect is at least partly mediated by direct interaction between SGK and Nedd4-2. SGK binds both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, but it is only able to phosphorylate Nedd4-2. Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 reduces its ability to bind to ENaC, due to the interaction of phosphorylated Nedd4-2 with 14-3-3 proteins, and hence increases ENaC activity. WW-domains in Nedd4-like proteins bind PY-motifs (PPXY) present in ENaC subunits, and SGK also has a PY-motif.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Principal Finding</title>
          <p>Here we show that single or tandem WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK and that different WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are involved. Our data also show that WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2 mediate the interaction with SGK in a cooperative manner, that activated SGK has increased affinity for the WW-domains of Nedd4-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and a greater stimulatory effect on ENaC Na<sup>+</sup> transport compared to wildtype SGK. Further, SGK lacking a PY motif failed to stimulate ENaC activity in the presence of Nedd4-2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The epithelial sodium channel is an important component of the body's control of sodium homeostasis and blood pressure <xref rid="pone.0012163-Garty1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A number of cellular pathways impact on ENaC function: for example, ubiquitination by the Nedd4-family of E3 ubiquitin ligases leads to a decrease in ENaC activity <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, whereas ENaC cleavage by proteases such as furin <xref rid="pone.0012163-Hughey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> or prostasin <xref rid="pone.0012163-Bruns1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> leads to activation of ENaC. The <underline>S</underline>erum- and <underline>G</underline>lucocorticoid regulated <underline>K</underline>inase isoform 1 (hereafter referred to as SGK) is a positive regulator of ENaC <xref rid="pone.0012163-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. SGK expression is switched on in response to a number of stimuli and integrates information from several pathways including the insulin, mineralocorticoid and cAMP signalling pathways <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Co-expression of SGK with ENaC in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes increases amiloride-sensitive current mediated by ENaC <xref rid="pone.0012163-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-NrayFejesTth1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ENaC activity can be inhibited by three Nedd4-family members: Nedd4, Nedd4-2 and WWP2 <xref rid="pone.0012163-Kamynina1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Goulet1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the interaction between Nedd4-2 and ENaC appears to be the most important because RNAi studies in mammalian epithelia showed that Nedd4-2 siRNA, but not Nedd4 siRNA, increased amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> current <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and because a Nedd4-2 knockout mouse develops salt-sensitive hypertension <xref rid="pone.0012163-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Nedd4 family members contain three or four WW-domains characterized by two conserved tryptophans (W) which mediate interaction with protein substrates; an enzymatic HECT (<underline>h</underline>omologous to <underline>E</underline>6-AP <underline>C</underline>-<underline>t</underline>erminus) domain which catalyzes addition of ubiquitin to target proteins; and a C2 calcium-lipid binding domain is present in some isoforms. WW-domains of Nedd4-like proteins interact with PY-motifs (PPXY) present in the C-terminal domains of the Î±-, Î²- and Î³ENaC proteins. Previously we have shown that WW-domain 3 of Nedd4 is critical for the binding and inhibition of ENaC by Nedd4 <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Lott1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, while others have shown that WW-domain 3, along with WW-domain 4 of Nedd4-2 appear to be critical for ENaC binding <xref rid="pone.0012163-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Fotia1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previously two groups reported that SGK phosphorylated Nedd4-2 on consensus SGK-phosphorylation sites <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Debonneville1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, suggesting that the mechanism of SGK-mediated upregulation of ENaC involves the interaction of SGK with Nedd4-2, reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder6" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated Nedd4-2 and are believed to sequester Nedd4-2, reducing its interaction with ENaC <xref rid="pone.0012163-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, resulting in increased ENaC activity <xref rid="pone.0012163-Debonneville1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In a feedback mechanism activated Nedd4-2 catalyzes conjugation of ubiquitin moieties to SGK, leading to reduced levels of SGK <xref rid="pone.0012163-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There has been debate in the literature over detection of an interaction between SGK and Nedd4-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the interaction is currently not understood at the molecular level. SGK contains a PY motif (PPFY), which might mediate interaction with the WW-domains of Nedd4/Nedd4-2. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 interact with wildtype SGK but not with SGK<sub>Y298A</sub> that contains a mutated PY motif <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Two previous <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies have asked whether the WW-domains of Nedd4-2 interact with an SGK peptide containing the PY motif. One study used surface plasmon resonance and concluded that interaction did occur <xref rid="pone.0012163-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, whereas the other study used intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and did not observe an interaction <xref rid="pone.0012163-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Further, Rauh <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Rauh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> reported the lack of interaction between SGK and Nedd4-2 in a far-Western analysis. Here we report that SGK interacts with the WW-domains of Nedd4-2 and show that this interaction is functionally significant.</p>

        <title>SGK binds to WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2</title>
        <p>Co-immunoprecipitation was used to characterize an <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between Nedd4-2 and SGK. Nedd4-2-FLAG and SGK-HA were co-expressed in COS7 cells, SGK was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and the presence of Nedd4-2 in the immunoprecipitates was assessed by western blotting with anti-FLAG. Nedd4-2 co-precipitated with SGK but the amount of Nedd4-2 co-precipitated was small, and appeared to be close to the limit of detection (data not shown). We reasoned that SGK would be rapidly turned over in the cells, and this would be enhanced by overexpression of active Nedd4-2, since Nedd4-2 is known to induce degradation of SGK <xref rid="pone.0012163-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore we co-expressed a stable form of SGK (ÎN60SGK-HA, lacking the first 60 amino acids of SGK), together with a ligase-dead form of Nedd4-2 (Nedd4-2<sub>C821A</sub>âFLAG). After immunoprecipitating SGK and Western blotting for Nedd4-2 we show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, top left panel) that SGK and Nedd4-2 interact when co-expressed in COS7 cells.</p>

            <p>(A) ÎN60SGK-HA and Nedd4-2<sub>C821A</sub>âFLAG were transiently co-expressed, or expressed alone as indicated, in COS7 cells. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and sequential western blotting (IB) with anti-FLAG antibody (Nedd4-2) and anti-HA antibody (ÎN60SGK). Expression of the proteins (5% input) is shown in the bottom panel, nâ=â3. Either ÎN60SGK-HA (B, E) or SGK-FLAG (C, D) was transiently expressed in COS7 cells. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection with TBS +1% Triton-X-100. The lane labelled âlysateâ shows expression of SGK in whole cell lysate. COS7 cell lysates were incubated with the indicated Nedd4-2 or Nedd4 WW-domain GST-fusion proteins, or GST alone, to test for interaction with SGK. Bound SGK was analyzed by immunostaining with anti-FLAG/HA antibody. The bands indicate that WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2, and WW-domains 1 and 3 of Nedd4 interact with SGK, nâ=â7. The two SGK bands observed in some experiments are likely to be unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of SGK <xref rid="pone.0012163-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In order to better understand the molecular nature of the interaction between Nedd4-2 and SGK, <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pulldown studies were performed. The presence of a PY-motif in the SGK protein, a sequence that can be bound effectively by WW-domains in other contexts, suggests that the WW-domains of Nedd4-2 may be involved in mediating the interaction. Individual WW-domains of Nedd4-2 or Nedd4, or combinations of Nedd4-2 WW-domains, were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Lysates of COS7 cells expressing SGK or ÎN60-SGK (both SGK constructs gave the same results) were incubated with the WW-domain fusion proteins or GST alone. Bound SGK was detected by western blotting with anti-FLAG/HA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2 individually bind SGK, whereas WW-domains 1 and 4 did not bind. Consistent with this finding, a GST fusion protein consisting of WW-domains 2 and 3 together with the intervening sequence also bound SGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, WW-domains 2 and 3 in other contexts did not readily bind to SGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). This suggests that additional sequences mask the WW-domains 2 and 3 binding sites in pulldown assays or that the folding of the larger constructs was incorrect.</p>
        <p>There are three consensus SGK phosphorylation sites in Nedd4-2 and one of these, Ser327, lies between WW-domains 2 and 3. Therefore we tested whether mutation of Ser327 to alanine (to abolish any phosphorylation) or to aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) would alter binding between SGK and Nedd4-2-WW2-3. GST pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) showed no differences in the binding of WW2-3, WW2-3<sub>S327D</sub> or WW2-3<sub>S327A</sub> to SGK.</p>
        <p>The data from these GST interaction experiments served as a guide for subsequent surface plasmon resonance and molecular modelling experiments.</p>

        <title>SGK binds to WW-domains 1 and 3 of Nedd4</title>
        <p>Although not a target for phosphorylation by SGK, Nedd4 has also been shown to interact with SGK <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The four WW-domains of Nedd4 were therefore also tested for their interaction with SGK using GST interaction assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). In a similar manner to Nedd4-2, only two of the four WW-domains bound SGK. However, WW-domains 1 and 3 of Nedd4 interact with SGK, whereas for Nedd4-2 WW-domain 2 and 3 mediate binding to SGK. The profile of the SGK protein bound by Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 appeared to differ (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1</xref> C and E). Other studies (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>) report that different isoforms of SGK may be detected and these may reflect different phosphorylation states of SGK.</p>

        <title>SGK-PY-motif peptide binds to individual Nedd4-2 WW-domains WW2 and WW3 and most strongly to WW2â3</title>
        <p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to quantitate the findings from the GST pull-down assays, and to investigate the role of the PY-motif of SGK in this interaction. An SGK-PY-motif peptide was immobilized to the surface of the sensor chip using standard amine chemistry. GST fusion proteins containing the Nedd4-2 WW-domains, and WW-domain 3 of Nedd4, were cleaved with specific proteases to remove the GST moiety, and the isolated WW-domains purified to homogeneity by size exclusion chromatography. The pure WW-domains at a range of concentrations were then injected over the bound SGK-PY-motif peptide.</p>

        <title>Molecular modelling analysis of the SGK-WW-domains interaction</title>
        <p>Molecular modelling was undertaken to ascertain whether there were particular energetic factors that explained the preferential association between SGK and the Nedd4-2 WW-domains 2 and 3. In order to do this, the WW-domains and the SGK peptide were modelled in isolation, and as SGK-WW-domain complexes. The calculated relative binding energies predict that WW2 and WW3 bind to the SGK peptide more strongly than WW4 by approximately 70 and 60 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> respectively. Thus, as with the SPR-derived binding results, WW2 was shown to bind with highest affinity, closely followed by WW3. However, modelling was not able to predict the experimentally observed lack of affinity of the WW1 domain for the SGK peptide, which was calculated to have a similar affinity for the SGK peptide as WW3. Overall, there appears to be no single energy factor governing the strength of the SGK-WW-domain interaction, but rather a complex interplay between them.</p>

        <title>Activated SGK binds the WW-domains more strongly than inactivated SGK</title>
        <p>SGK is activated by phosphorylation, via a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway <xref rid="pone.0012163-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and SGK is then able to phosphorylate substrates such as Nedd4-2. Although we were able to detect interaction of Nedd4-2 WW-domains with wildtype SGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), we hypothesized that an activated form of SGK might have a higher affinity for Nedd4-2. Therefore GST interaction experiments were performed comparing the binding of wildtype SGK and activated SGK (SGK<sub>S422D</sub>) to isolated Nedd4-2 WW-domains. SGK<sub>S422D</sub> appeared to run more slowly compared to SGK, consistent with it representing a phosphorylated form of SGK <xref rid="pone.0012163-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. SGK<sub>S422D</sub> did not bind to GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g003">Fig. 3</xref> A, left), and in parallel experiments we showed that SGK<sub>S422D</sub> binds Nedd4-2 WW-domains more strongly than SGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g003">Fig. 3</xref> A, B). This result indicates that phosphorylation may promote binding of SGK to Nedd4-2. To ask if SGK<sub>S422D</sub> has an altered effect on Na<sup>+</sup> transport, we measured the amiloride-sensitive short circuit current in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelia <xref rid="pone.0012163-Sheppard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> transfected with Î±-, Î²-, and Î³ENaC and either wildtype or activated SGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). SGK stimulated I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride significantly, consistent with reports of others <xref rid="pone.0012163-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-NrayFejesTth1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. SGK<sub>S422D</sub> had a greater stimulatory effect on I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride compared to SGK. Similar results were observed in both serum-containing and serum-free media, suggesting that lack of activation of wildtype SGK is not the primary reason for SGK<sub>S422D</sub> being a more effective positive regulator of ENaC. Instead, increased binding of SGK<sub>S422D</sub> to Nedd4-2 may be a factor in the improved ability of SGK<sub>S422D</sub> to increase amiloride-sensitive current.</p>

        <title>SGK lacking the PY motif does not alter the Nedd4-2-ENaC inhibition dose response curve</title>
        <p>Our previous work has shown that SGK lacking its PY motif (SGK<sub>Y298A</sub>) is not able to bind full length Nedd4-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1</xref> in <xref rid="pone.0012163-Snyder5" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>), and others have shown that SGK lacking its PY motif is less able to phosphorylate Nedd4-2 <xref rid="pone.0012163-Debonneville1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To test the hypothesis that the interaction of the Nedd4-2 WW-domains with the SGK PY motif is required for SGK to influence Nedd4-2 function, we co-expressed Î±-, Î²- and Î³ENaC in FRT epithelia with either wild type SGK or SGK<sub>Y298A</sub> along with increasing amounts of Nedd4-2, and measured the amiloride-sensitive short circuit current. Consistent with our previous work, we found that in the absence of SGK, Nedd4-2 inhibited ENaC in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0012163-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Wild type SGK reduced inhibition, shifting the dose-response relationship to the right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, SGK<sub>Y298A</sub>, that has a disrupted PY motif, had no effect on the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). A previous report has shown that SGK with a mutated PY motif tyrosine retains catalytic activity similar to that of wildtype SGK <xref rid="pone.0012163-Debonneville1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we confirmed that the WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK. The binding appears to be relatively weak, but is enhanced when SGK is activated, and the activated form of SGK induces higher levels of Na<sup>+</sup> transport in ENaC-transfected epithelia. We also used a functional assay to show that the PY motif of SGK is essential for preventing Nedd4-2 inhibition of ENaC by SGK.</p>
      <p>Using pulldown assays and SPR we showed that the WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2 both bind individually to SGK, but that a protein construct containing both of these WW-domains and the intervening sequence binds more strongly to SGK than either domain on its own, with a dissociation constant of 53 ÂµM. This binding is â¼5 fold weaker than previously reported results for Nedd4/Nedd4-2 WW-domain binding to ENaC PY motifs <xref rid="pone.0012163-Lott1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012163-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our data may be an overestimate of the binding affinity due to the difficulty of purifying sufficient soluble WW-domain proteins at a concentration greater than twice the calculated <italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub>. This suggests that the binding of Nedd4-2 to SGK is rather weak, and hence possibly transient <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Our data are consistent with that reported by Asher <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> who found that the binding of Nedd4-2 WW-domains to SGK was much weaker than their binding to ENaC, although no affinity constants were reported. Asher <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> reported that Nedd4-2 WW-domain 3 bound best to the SGK PY motif peptide followed by tandem WW-domain proteins: WW-domains 2 and 3 and WW-domains 3 and 4. Our results show that the tandem protein containing WW-domains 2 and 3 binds best and that WW domain 2 binds more strongly than WW domain 3. The studies of Asher <italic>et al</italic>. used fusion proteins with the GST moiety intact whereas in our studies the GST moiety, which can dimerize and hence affect the results, was removed. These data differ to that of Henry <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and Rauh <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Rauh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> who did not detect binding of SGK to Nedd4-2 WW-domains. Rauh <italic>et al</italic>. have suggested that species difference may account for these discrepancies as <italic>in vitro</italic> interactions have been reported for the human, but not the mouse or rat proteins <xref rid="pone.0012163-Rauh1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our data, using human SGK and human Nedd4-2 support this hypothesis, although the SGK PY motif peptides used in the studies were slightly different, and the use of different techniques may also contribute to the differences. Further, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we report a robust <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between a stable form of SGK and ligase-dead Nedd4-2, suggesting that the difficulties in detecting interaction between the full-length forms of SGK and Nedd4-2 proteins are due to rapid degradation of SGK that is enhanced in the presence of wild-type Nedd4-2.</p>
      <p>The multiple WW-domain 2 and 3 construct from Nedd4-2 (WW2-3) used in the present study shows a higher binding affinity for the SGK PY motif peptide (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub>â=â53 ÂµM) than either WW-domain in isolation (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub>â=â105 or 249 ÂµM). This is in marked contrast to the behaviour of a multiple WW-domain construct (WW domains 2, 3, and 4) from Nedd4 binding to the Î²ENaC PY motif peptide less strongly (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub>â=â65 ÂµM) than WW3 alone (<italic>K</italic>
<sub>D</sub>â=â11.1 ÂµM) as we reported previously <xref rid="pone.0012163-Lott1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The fact that Nedd4-2 WW2-3 shows increased affinity for the SGK PY motif peptide compared to its constituent domains implies that a cooperative interaction is occurring between the WW-domains, that is not seen in the binding of the Nedd4 multiple WW-domain construct to the Î²ENaC PY motif peptide. Therefore, there is presumably some contribution to this cooperative binding from the intervening sequence. This might arise either by the binding state of one WW-domain being able to influence the affinity of the other for its target, or through possible different orientations of the two WW-domains in the Nedd4-2 WW2-3 protein compared to its Nedd4 counterpart. This region of the polypeptide is the most different in sequence between Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, with significant insertions in Nedd4-2: 39 extra residues between WW domain 2 and WW domain 3. We tested whether presence of an SGK phosphorylation site between the domains might influence binding, however changing Ser327 to either Ala or Asp did not alter binding to SGK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
      <p>The presence of cooperative binding in Nedd4-2, but not in Nedd4 supports other data showing that the structural context of the WW-domains is able to influence their affinity for peptide ligands, making it possible that the true <italic>in vivo</italic> binding affinity between SGK and Nedd4-2 may be tighter than that measured in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Jennings <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0012163-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> have reported that tandem arrangement of WW-domains in <italic>suppressor of deltex</italic> influences ligand binding, such that binding of ligand to one WW-domain enhances ligand binding to a nearby WW-domain.</p>
      <p>The finding, in GST pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), that WW2â3 cannot mediate binding to SGK when other WW-domains are present may be an artifact due to a sequence in the longer multiple WW-domain constructs being unable to fold correctly or due to occlusion of the binding site in this context preventing WW-domains 2 and 3 from binding to SGK. However, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that intervening sequences influence binding of Nedd4-2 WW-domains to SGK.</p>
      <p>SGK must be phosphorylated on two residues before it is an active kinase, and mutation of one of these sites (SGK<sub>S422D</sub>) is sufficient to produce active SGK protein <xref rid="pone.0012163-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Here we show that SGK<sub>S422D</sub> binds more strongly to Nedd4-2 WW-domains compared to wildtype SGK, and that SGK<sub>S422D</sub> is more effective in stimulating I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride in ENaC-transfected epithelia. Lack of activation of SGK is unlikely to be the cause of the difference in stimulation of current as the effect was similar in epithelia incubated in both serum-containing and serum-free media. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that kinase activity has changed in SGK<sub>S422D</sub>. These results contrast with studies on other channels and transporters in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes that reported similar activation effects of SGK and SGK<sub>S422D</sub> on the Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled glucose transporter SGLT1 <xref rid="pone.0012163-Dieter1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN5A <xref rid="pone.0012163-Boehmer1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This suggests that SGK activation of ENaC may be controlled differently to SGLT1 and SCN5A, or that the SGK signalling pathway differs between <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and FRT cells.</p>
      <p>Finally, our functional data show the importance of the PY motif of SGK in mediating its ability to prevent Nedd4-2 inhibition of ENaC, extending previous reports <xref rid="pone.0012163-Debonneville1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Together our data support the model that activated SGK binds to WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2, then phosphorylates Nedd4-2 on one or more sites. This produces a binding site for 14-3-3 family members to bind Nedd4-2 and sequester it away from ENaC. The result is an increase in ENaC at the cell surface, and activation of amiloride-sensitive sodium current.</p>

        <title>Measurement of WW-domain binding to SGK peptide using SPR</title>
        <p>GST-WW-domain fusion proteins were prepared in bulk, as described above, except that the bacterial pellet was resuspended in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After cell lysis by sonication, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the supernatant.

To release the WW-domains from the GST moiety, 150 units of thrombin protease or recombinant tobacco etch virus protease and 950 Âµl of PBS were added to 5.0â7.5 mg of fusion protein. Cleavage took place at room temperature for 4 hr. The proteins were finally purified to apparent homogeneity (as judged by Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE), using a Superdex-75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare), and concentrated using a Millipore ultrafiltration unit. Protein concentration was measured using absorbance at 280 nm <xref rid="pone.0012163-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>An SGK peptide containing the PY motif was synthesized: NH<sub>2</sub>-CLYGLPPFYSRNT- CONH<sub>2</sub> and for comparison a Î²hENaC PY-motif peptide was used, NH<sub>2</sub>-GTPPPNYDSLR-CONH<sub>2</sub> (Auspep, Parkville, Australia). For SPR experiments using a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) <xref rid="pone.0012163-Jnsson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> the SGK and Î² peptides were attached either via the N-terminal amino group or via a C-terminal arginine side chain to a carboxylated surface (Sensor Chip CM5) using standard amine immobilisation chemistry. Briefly, the carboxy surface was activated with 1-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide and <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide. Peptides were dissolved in 100 mM Na-borate buffer, pH 8.6 to give a final concentration of 300â1000 Âµg/ml. This solution was injected over the activated carboxylated surface at a flow rate of 20 Âµl/min, and unreacted surface esters were subsequently blocked with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The amount of peptide immobilized was controlled by manually varying the contact time. Interaction studies were carried out by injecting WW-domain-containing proteins over this surface at 20 Âµl/min, using HBS-EP as running buffer. The signal from a blank flowcell, (which had been activated and blocked as above, but to which no peptide had been immobilized) was subtracted from all SPR measurements to correct for bulk solvent effects. Data were analyzed using the Biacore BIAevaluation software (v3.1). The affinity constant, <italic>K</italic>

One day after seeding, cells were cotransfected with Î±-, Î²- and Î³ENaC (0.07 Âµg each), 0.6 Âµg wildtype or mutant SGK, and 0â0.2 Âµg Nedd4-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012163-g004">Fig. 4</xref> only).

The plasmids were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TFX 50 (Promega, Madison, WI; 7.9 Âµg/millicell) in serum free F12 Coon's media for 15 minutes and transferred to the apical surface of the monolayer. One-six hours later, the apical media was replaced with F-12 Coon's media containing 5% fetal calf serum and amiloride (10 ÂµM). Short-circuit current was measured 3 days after transfection in modified Ussing chambers connected to a voltage clamp (South Campus Electronics, Dunedin, New Zealand or Warner Instruments). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in (in mM) 135 NaCl, 1.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.6 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37Â°C and bubbled with O<sub>2</sub>. Amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride) was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (10 ÂµM) in the apical bathing solution. Data are presented as relative I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride (I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride relative) that was obtained by normalizing the I<sub>sc</sub>-amiloride to that of control cells transfected with Î±Î²Î³ENaC in the same experiment.
