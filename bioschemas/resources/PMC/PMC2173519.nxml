        <p>Disruption of the BPAG1 (bullous pemphigoid antigen 1) gene results in progressive deterioration in motor function and devastating sensory neurodegeneration in the null mice. We have previously demonstrated that BPAG1n1 and BPAG1n3 play important roles in organizing cytoskeletal networks in vivo. Here, we characterize functions of a novel BPAG1 neuronal isoform, BPAG1n4. Results obtained from yeast two-hybrid screening, blot overlay binding assays, and coimmunoprecipitations demonstrate that BPAG1n4 interacts directly with dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> through its unique ezrin/radixin/moesin domain. Studies using double immunofluorescent microscopy and ultrastructural analysis reveal physiological colocalization of BPAG1n4 with dynactin/dynein. Disruption of the interaction between BPAG1n4 and dynactin results in severe defects in retrograde axonal transport. We conclude that BPAG1n4 plays an essential role in retrograde axonal transport in sensory neurons. These findings might advance our understanding of pathogenesis of axonal degeneration and neuronal death.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The BPAG1 (bullous pemphigoid antigen 1) null mouse has a fascinating and complex phenotype, displaying sensory ataxia and devastating sensory neurodegeneration (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 1995</xref>). This degeneration is characterized by neurofilament disorganization, microtubule network abnormality, and intermittent accumulation of membranous organelles along sensory axons. The BPAG1 gene encodes multiple isoforms with BPAG1e expressed in the epidermis and the others (BPAG1n1, BPAG1n2, and BPAG1n3) expressed in neurons. Throughout normal development, mRNAs of BPAG1 neuronal isoforms are present in a variety of neurons. Postnatally, this expression is absent or reduced in motor neurons and restricted to sensory neurons (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dowling et al., 1997</xref>). It has been demonstrated that BPAG1n1 links intermediate filaments to actin microfilaments and that BPAG1n3 can stabilize microtubules (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the devastating sensory neuron degeneration in BPAG1 null mice await further characterization.</p>
      <p>Impaired axonal transport in neurons has long been implicated as a mechanism underlying axonal degeneration and neuronal death. In neurons, motor protein of kinesin superfamily drives anterograde transport, whereas cytoplasmic dynactin/dynein powers retrograde transport. The mutations discovered in critical components of transport pathways provide evidence for the notion that axonal transport is essential for neuronal survival. Transgenic mice carrying mutant superoxide dismutase-1, mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, show deficits in slow axonal transport early in the disease course (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Williamson and Cleveland, 1999</xref>). Additionally, in some superoxide dismutase-1 mutant lines, an early up-regulation of the kinesin superfamily motor protein KIF1A was detected in spinal motor neurons (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dupuis et al., 2000</xref>). Mutations in the gene encoding KIF1BÎ² cause an axonal form of a hereditary neuropathy (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). A recent work has linked mutations in cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain with defects in retrograde transport that lead to motor neuron degeneration (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hafezparast et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a mutation in the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin has been identified in a family with a slowly progressive, autosomal-dominant form of lower motor neuron disease in which sensory symptoms are absent (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>In this work, we analyze the functions of BPAG1n4, the fourth neuronal isoform of the BPAG1 gene family. BPAG1n4, referred to as BPAG1a by <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al. (2001)</xref>, harbors a structurally and functionally unique ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) domain (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burridge and Mangeat, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Marchesi, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lankes and Furthmayr, 1991</xref>). We provide biochemical evidence that the ERM domain of BPAG1n4 directly interacts with dynactin, and show that this isoform physiologically colocalizes with the dynactinâdynein complex in vivo in sensory axons. Finally, we demonstrate that disruption of the interaction between p150<sup>Glued</sup> dynactin and BPAG1n4 leads to a failure of retrograde axonal transport in sensory neurons.</p>

        <title>BPAG1n4 localizes to vesicle-like structures</title>
        <p>Although BPAG1n4 and BPAG1n1 share a conserved NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal actin-binding domain, BPAG1n4's COOH terminus harbors a distinctive functional microtubule-binding domain (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 1999</xref>; unpublished data). This domain features two EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ikura, 1996</xref>) immediately upstream of a short stretch of GAS2 motif (EF-hand/GAS2; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 1988</xref>). Furthermore, a central ERM domain (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burridge and Mangeat, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Marchesi, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lankes and Furthmayr, 1991</xref>) is flanked by two functional cytoskeleton-binding domains (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Human BPAG1n4 shares â¼82% sequence identity with a recently published mouse form, BPAG1a (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of BPAG1n4 was detected at both the mRNA and protein levels in wild type (WT), but not in null tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). The specificity of anti-BPiso4 was confirmed in cells transiently expressing a FLAG epitope-tagged BPAG1n4 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal segment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C, lanes 3 and 4) that was also recognized by anti-FLAG (not depicted). Immunohistochemical studies using anti-BPiso4 antibody recapitulated our previously published staining pattern characteristic of sensory neurons using anti-BPAG1n antibody, which recognizes all isoforms (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dowling et al., 1997</xref>). No significant staining was found in motor neurons of postnatal animals (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

        <title>BPAG1n4 interacts directly with dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup>
</title>
        <p>ERM domain containing proteins are known to modify the interaction of cytoskeletal and integral membrane proteins (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Burridge and Mangeat, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Marchesi, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lankes and Furthmayr, 1991</xref>). We used the ERM domain of BPAG1n4 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2002</xref>) of a human brain cDNA library. 28 putative positive clones exclusively identified the COOH-terminal region of dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gill et al., 1991</xref>) as the binding partner for BPAG1n4. Consistent with our two-hybrid results, HA-tagged ERM could be coimmunoprecipitated by FLAG-tagged p150<sup>Glued</sup> when coexpressed in cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C, lane 4). Additional assays using tissue extracts corroborated the interaction of BPAG1n4 and p150<sup>Glued</sup>, including in vitro blot overlay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>) and coimmunoprecipitations (co-IPs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, DâF). In brief, by in vitro blot overlay binding assay, p150<sup>Glued</sup> bound only to the immobilized HA-tagged ERM domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, lane 4) or to BPAG1n4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B, lane 3), but not to control proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, lanes 5 and 6; and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B, lanes 4, 6, and 7). In co-IP experiments from tissues, BPAG1n4 was specifically detected in the complex coimmunoprecipitated by anti-p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D, lane 3). Conversely, p150<sup>Glued</sup> and p50, another dynactin subunit, as well as DIC but not a control protein, were specifically coimmunoprecipitated by anti-BPiso4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E, lane 2 and 5, respectively). Neither the secondary alone nor a sham antibody pulled down BPAG1n4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D, lanes 5 and 6) or dynactin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E, lane 4 and 6). Neuronal isoforms BPAG1n1â3 were detected in total lysates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> F, lane 1) using anti-BProd antibody, which recognizes the domain common to these isoforms, but not in complexes precipitated by either anti-p150<sup>Glued</sup> or anti-BPiso4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D, lanes 2 and 3). Together, our results provide strong evidence that BPAG1n4 associates with dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> via its ERM domain.</p>

<bold>Blot overlay and co-IP assays show BPAG1n4âdynactin interaction.</bold> (A) Blot overlay assays with ERM domain. 85-kD epitope-tagged ERM (HA-ERM), 78-kD gigaxonin (HA-Gig), or 90-kD BPAG1n4 COOH terminus (FLAG-n4-C-long) from transfected CHO cells were immobilized on membranes. Membranes were incubated with (+) or without (â) total lysates of mouse spinal cord and sciatic nerve and probed with anti-HA (HA.11; CRP, Inc.), anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-p150<sup>Glued</sup>, respectively. In addition to its endogenous band (arrowhead), p150<sup>Glued</sup> was also detected at the position of HA-ERM (lane 4, arrow) as a result of its binding to the ERM domain of BPAG1n4. (B) Blot overlay assays with BPAG1n4. BPAG1n4 was immobilized on membrane and overlaid with (+) or without (â) total lysates of spinal cord and sciatic nerve. Blots were probed with anti-p150<sup>Glued</sup> and antigigaxonin (Gig, control). (lys) total brain lysates. p150<sup>Glued</sup> (lane 3), but not gigaxonin (lane 6), binds to full-length BPAG1n4 (arrows). (C) Co-IP of ERM domain and p150<sup>Glued</sup> in COS-7 cells. (WB) Western blotting; (IP) immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates of COS-7 transfected with pHA-ERM (lanes 2 and 3), or pFLAG-p150<sup>Glued</sup> (lane 1), or both (lane 4) were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. Protein samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. (DâE) co-IP of BPAG1n4 and the dynactinâdynein complex from mouse nerve tissue extracts. A rabbit antiâp150<sup>Glued</sup> (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody, but not the sham antibody, was able to coimmunoprecipitate BPAG1n4 (D, lane 3). Conversely, anti-BPiso4 but not the sham antibody was able to coimmunoprecipitate the dynactin complex (E, lane 2). Antibodies against BPAG1n4, p150<sup>Glued</sup>, p50, DIC, and control protein (sham) were used for immunoblotting. (F) Neither anti-p150<sup>Glued</sup> nor anti-BPiso4 could coimmunoprecipitate other BPAG1 neuronal isoforms (BPAG1n1â3). Immunoblot was probed with rabbit antibody against the common rod domain shared by BPAG1n1â3 (anti-BProd).</p>

        <title>BPAG1n4 is required for retrograde axonal transport in sensory neurons</title>
        <p>At the ultrastructural level, vesicles, multivesicular bodies, mitochondria, and other membranous organelles were found to accumulate in BPAG1 null sensory axons, a phenotype characteristic of impaired axonal transport (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). In contrast, WT axons displayed no such accumulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). We analyzed axonal transport by double-ligation of sciatic nerves (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C), monitoring a sensory neuron protein, p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Raivich et al., 1991</xref>), for any subsequent accumulation. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that in BPAG1 null mice p75<sup>NTR</sup> failed to accumulate at distal sites 6 h after ligation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D, bottom, distal), but exhibited proximal accumulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D, bottom, proximal) surprisingly similar to those observed in WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D, top). Quantitative biochemical assays were conducted on â¼3-mm segments proximal and distal to the double ligatures at 3- and 6-h time points. In WT mice, a substantial accumulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was observed bidirectionally at both time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E, lanes 1 and 5, and lanes 3 and 7, respectively). In contrast, in the null mice, the accumulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was barely detectable at both directions 3 h after ligation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E, lanes 2 and 4). Interestingly, at the 6-h time point the retrograde accumulation remained undetectable in the null mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E, lane 8), but at anterograde direction the difference appears less marked (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E, lane 6). These results suggest that, whereas the axonal transport in BPAG1 null mice is bidirectionally impaired, the retrograde direction is apparently more severely affected.</p>

        <p>The gene targeting strategy in BPAG1 null mice ablated all isoforms (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 1995</xref>), all of which could collectively play important roles bidirectionally in axonal transport. However, the specific interaction of BPAG1n4 and dynactin/dynein in vivo pointed to a potential role for the BPAG1n4 isoform in retrograde axonal transport. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed an ERM-GFP fusion protein in cultured mouse DRG neurons. ERM-GFP and GFP proteins were efficiently transported to the neurite tips in transfected neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> AâB). To examine retrograde transport, the neurons were incubated for 2 h with media containing the tracer transferrin conjugated with Texas red (Tf-TR). The media were replaced with tracer-free media, and retrograde transport of Tf-TR was subsequently monitored at 2-h time points. In the first 2 h after removing Tf-TR, no significant differences were observed in the cultured neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, EâH). However, after 4â6 h, the WT and GFP-expressing neurons had begun to accumulate Tf-TR in their cell bodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, K and J</xref>, respectively). After 12â14 h, â¼94% of these neurons had completed retrograde transport of the Tf-TR pulse (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, N and O</xref>). In contrast, in three independent experiments, 82% of the ERM-GFPâoverexpressing neurons showed severe defects identical to those seen in 91% of BPAG1 null neurons, namely, a nearly complete failure to transport Tf-TR to the cell bodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">PFig. 5, I and M, and L and P</xref>, respectively). Together, these results demonstrate that the isolated ERM is sufficient to disrupt BPAG1n4's function in sensory neurons in a dominant-negative fashion, leading to a failure of retrograde axonal transport that could account for the impaired retrograde transport found in the BPAG1 null mouse. We conclude that BPAG1n4 is essential for retrograde axonal transport in sensory neurons. Because the postnatal expression of BPAG1 neuronal isoforms is restricted to sensory neurons (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>), it is likely that a related molecule expressed in motor neurons, such as ACF7 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Byers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Karakesisoglou et al., 2000</xref>), may play a corresponding role in axonal transport in those cells. Alternatively, motor neurons may rely on different mechanisms for such a process.</p>

        <p>Defects in axonal transport have been implicated in many human neurodegenerative disorders (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Williamson and Cleveland, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hafezparast et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Puls et al., 2003</xref>). The extraordinary length of axons and unique features of neurons may require a more complex system to meet the unusual transport challenges that are far beyond those of nonneuronal cells. Our findings pertaining to BPAG1n4 may contribute to a better understanding of relations between neurodegeneration and axonal transport. The next challenge will be to understand how the interactions of BPAG1n4 with dynactin/dynein and cytoskeletons facilitate retrograde axonal transport in sensory neurons.</p>
