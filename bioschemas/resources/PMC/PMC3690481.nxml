        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The linear ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is an E3 ligase that specifically assembles Met1-linked (also known as linear) Ub chains that regulate nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) signaling. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are key regulators of Ub signaling, but a dedicated DUB for Met1 linkages has not been identified. Here, we reveal a previously unannotated human DUB, OTULIN (also known as FAM105B), which is exquisitely specific for Met1 linkages. Crystal structures of the OTULIN catalytic domain in complex with diubiquitin reveal Met1-specific Ub-binding sites and a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in which the proximal Ub activates the catalytic triad of the protease. Mutation of Ub Glu16 inhibits OTULIN activity by reducing <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> 240-fold. OTULIN overexpression or knockdown affects NF-ÎºB responses to LUBAC, TNFÎ±, and poly(I:C) and sensitizes cells to TNFÎ±-induced cell death. We show that OTULIN binds LUBAC and that overexpression of OTULIN prevents TNFÎ±-induced NEMO association with ubiquitinated RIPK1. Our data suggest that OTULIN regulates Met1-polyUb signaling.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ubiquitination is an important posttranslational modification that regulates diverse processes, including protein degradation, intracellular trafficking, transcription, kinase activation, and the DNA damage response (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). This variety of functions is mediated by eight different types of polyubiquitin (polyUb) linkages, and, although the roles of Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb have been studied in great detail, much less is known about the remaining âatypicalâ Ub chains (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Behrends and Harper, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Met1-linked polyUb (Met1-polyUb) is the source of the cellular Ub pool, given that Ub is translated as a polyprotein (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ozkaynak etÂ al., 1984</xref>) and posttranslationally processed by dedicated DUBs, such as USP5 (also known as IsoT) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Amerik AYu etÂ al., 1997</xref>). This chain type can also be assembled by the linear Ub chain assembly complex (LUBAC), a multisubunit E3 ligase consisting of HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kirisako etÂ al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2011</xref>). LUBAC has roles in NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Haas etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga and Iwai, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Walczak etÂ al., 2012</xref>) and is required for full activation of the inhibitor of ÎºB (IÎºB) kinase (IKK) complex. IKK activation leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºB and the activation of the NF-ÎºB transcription factor (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000</xref>). It is not fully understood how Met1-polyUb regulates this process, but it involves the binding and modification of the IKK subunit NEMO with Met1-linked chains. NEMO harbors a Met1-specific Ub-binding domain (UBD) that is important for NF-ÎºB signaling (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Komander etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Rahighi etÂ al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Much less is known about DUBs that regulate Met1-polyUb chains, and a specific DUB for Met1-linkages has not been identified. Of the roughly 80 active DUBs in the human genome, many show weak or no activity toward Met1-linked chains (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Faesen etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Komander etÂ al., 2009</xref>). A potential reason is the distinct chemistry of a peptide versus an isopeptide linkage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A).</p>
      <p>Ovarian tumor (OTU) domain DUBs regulate important cell-signaling pathways. A20 regulates NF-ÎºB signaling (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hymowitz and Wertz, 2010</xref>), OTUD5 (also known as DUBA) regulates IRF3 signaling (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kayagaki etÂ al., 2007</xref>), and OTUB1 regulates the DNA damage response (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nakada etÂ al., 2010</xref>). OTU DUBs can be linkage specific. Structural work has revealed the basis for OTUB1 Lys48 specificity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Juang etÂ al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wiener etÂ al., 2012</xref>) and TRABID specificity against Lys29 and Lys33 linkages (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Licchesi etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, viral OTU DUBs have been reported that are highly divergent in sequence but are structurally similar (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Frias-Staheli etÂ al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we identify a previously unannotated human DUB, FAM105B/OTULIN, which is specific for Met1-linked Ub chains. Structural studies reveal that this specificity is due to Met1-specific Ub-binding sites and a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis where a residue in a Met1-linked chain directly participates in the organization of the catalytic triad of the enzyme. Overexpression and knockdown analysis of OTULIN suggest that the protein binds LUBAC and regulates LUBAC-mediated processes in cells.</p>

        <title>FAM105B/OTULIN, a Met1-Linkage-Specific OTU DUB</title>
        <p>Given the high sequence divergence of OTU domains, we set out to identify unstudied OTU enzymes using a bioinformatical screen based on generalized profile analysis (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bucher etÂ al., 1996</xref>). Iterative profile refinement, starting from a multiple-sequence alignment of experimentally validated OTUs, indicated an OTU domain with a complete catalytic triad in the uncharacterized human protein FAM105B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B). FAM105B comprises 352 amino acids (aa), and the OTU domain spans the majority of the protein (aa 80â352) and an N-terminal region with predicted helical content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>B, 1C). The catalytic domain is highly conserved between species (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>A available online). Bacterially expressed full-length FAM105B did not hydrolyze common fluorescent substrates such as Ub-AMC (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>B). Ub-based suicide inhibitors that comprise an electrophilic group at the Ub C terminus (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Borodovsky etÂ al., 2002</xref>) covalently modify most OTU domain DUBs but showed no reactivity against FAM105B (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>C). However, DUB assays against diubiquitin (diUb) of all eight linkage types revealed that FAM105B exclusively hydrolyzed Met1-diUb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D). The enzyme was active at 10Â nM concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>D) and remained Met1 linkage specific at a 1Â Î¼M concentration (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref>D). Specificity is maintained when longer Ub chains are used as substrates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>E) but depended on an intact Ub Gly<sup>76</sup>-Met<sup>1</sup> linkage sequence between Ub moieties, given that mutant tetraUb with Ser<sup>76</sup>-Met<sup>1</sup> linkages was not hydrolyzed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>E). Catalytic mutants of FAM105B (C129A, H339A, and N341A) did not hydrolyze Met1-diUb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>F). Having established FAM105B as a Met1-linkage-specific OTU DUB, we named the enzyme OTULIN (OTU DUB with linear linkage specificity). OTULIN is unique, given that the 14 annotated human OTU DUBs cannot hydrolyze Met1-diUb (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      </sec>

        <title>Molecular Basis for OTULIN Specificity</title>
        <p>Structural studies revealed how OTULIN achieved its unique specificity for Met1 linkages. The catalytic domain of OTULIN (OTULINcat, aa 80â352) is sufficient for linkage specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>G), and OTULINcat C129A bound Met1-diUb with a similarly high affinity as full-length OTULIN C129A, as revealed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> 196 versus 178Â nM, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>H).</p>
        <p>OTULINcat was crystallized, and its structure was determined to 1.3Â Ã resolution with SeMet phasing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). OTULINcat adopts an OTU fold most similar to OTUB1 (root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] 2.1Â Ã, DALI <italic>Z</italic> score 8.7) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>B). Interestingly, catalytic triad residues His339 and Cys129 display two alternate conformations. In the âactiveâ conformation (occupancy â¼30%), the catalytic triad is formed by interactions between Asn341, His339, and Cys129 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C); e.g., as observed in OTUB1 in complex with Ub suicide inhibitor (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wiener etÂ al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>AâS2C). In the âinhibitedâ conformation (occupancy â¼70%), Asp336 pulls His339 away from its catalytic position (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C), and Cys129 flips to an inactive rotamer. Next, we determined the structure of OTULIN D336A to 1.35Â Ã resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>G and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). There were no global structural perturbations (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2</xref>E and S2F), but His339 was now in the active rotamer, and Cys129 showed increased occupancy of the active rotamer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>D). Consistently, Ub suicide inhibitors that did not modify wild-type (WT) OTULIN modified OTULIN D336A and also OTULIN N341D, in which the catalytic Asn341 was changed to a negatively charged Asp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>E). Both mutants stabilize His339 in the active conformation, generating a more reactive enzyme.</p>
        <p>To understand how OTULIN acted on Met1-polyUb specifically, we determined the structure of OTULINcat C129A bound to Met1-diUb to 1.9Â Ã resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). The distal and proximal Ub moieties occupy extensive S1 and S1â Ub-binding sites on OTULIN, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Fâ2H). Residues mediating Ub binding are highly conserved inÂ OTULIN orthologs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>I). The binding interface with theÂ distal Ub covers 1,045Â Ã<sup>2</sup> and involves the Ile44 patch thatÂ interacts with a helical arm (aa 254â264) conserved in all OTU domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>Fâ2H). However, compared to the OTUB1â¼Ub structure (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wiener etÂ al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>J), the distal Ub rotates by â¼18Â° in the S1 binding site (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S2</xref>K). The proximal Ub binds with an interface of 880Â Ã<sup>2</sup> to an S1â Ub-binding site formed by helices Î±1 and Î±2 of OTULINcat via an unusual binding surface on Ub involving the Ub helix and the Phe4 patch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>H). Point mutations in the S1 (L259E and E314R) or S1â (W96A and TQK100-102AAA) Ub-binding sites reduced OTULIN activity toward Met1-diUb (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>I) by decreasing Met1-diUb affinity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>J).</p>

        <title>OTULIN Specificity: Selective diUb Binding</title>
        <p>The extensive S1â Ub-binding site is likely to be important for OTULIN specificity in that it orients the proximal Ub such that only Met1 points toward the catalytic center (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>A). In this orientation of the proximal Ub, all Lys residues are remote from the catalytic center, except for Lys63, which is spatially close to Met1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). Importantly, OTULIN wedges these linkage points apart by two loops (aa 125â127 and 282â284) that fix Lys63 in a dedicated binding pocket (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>B). Nonetheless, a differently linked Ub chain including a Lys63-linked diUb would rotate the proximal Ub moiety by several degrees, and such orientation would likely not fit the OTULIN S1â binding site. Indeed, Lys63-linked diUb bound with 100-fold reduced affinity (&lt;112Â nM for Met1-linked diUb versus 12Â Î¼M for Lys63-linked diUb), and no binding was detected for Lys48-linked diUb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>C). This shows that the Ub-binding sites of OTULIN already distinguish between structurally similar Met1 and Lys63 chain types by two orders of magnitude.</p>

        <title>OTULIN Specificity: Substrate-Assisted Catalysis</title>
        <p>The complex structure revealed that the proximal Ub directly participates in the organization of the catalytic center. Autoinhibition of the catalytic triad in the absence of substrate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>D) is released by the binding of the Met1-linked proximal Ub (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F). The carbonyl group of Met1 sterically interferes with the inhibited conformation of His339, pushing it into an active conformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>F). Lys-linked Ub chains lack a structural equivalent of this carbonyl moiety in the linkage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref>A). More significantly, Glu16 of the proximal Ub is inserted into the catalytic center, displacing the inhibitory OTULIN residue Asp336, further restricting the mobility of His339 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F). In addition, Glu16 coordinates the third residue in the catalytic triad Asn341, aligning it toward His339 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E).</p>
        <p>Importantly, Met1-diUb with mutations of Glu16 in the proximal Ub was hydrolyzed with significantly lower activity in qualitative gel-based assays, whereas mutation of nearby Gln2 (which also interacts with OTULIN, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E) had no effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>A). All mutants were hydrolyzed by the nonspecific DUB USP21 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ye etÂ al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>B) and bound to OTULINcat C129A in analytical gel filtration (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>C), and Met1-diUb E16A<sup>prox</sup> affinity toward OTULIN C129A was only slightly decreased (612 versus &lt;112Â nM, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S3</xref>D).</p>
        <p>We used a quantitative fluorescent kinetic assay for diUb cleavage (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Virdee etÂ al., 2010</xref>) to examine whether Glu16 on a proximal Ub had a direct role in catalysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>H and 3I). Met1-diUb E16A<sup>prox</sup> decreased <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> 240-fold and enzyme efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>) 74-fold (because of a 3.5-fold lower <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> for the mutant) in comparison to Met1-diUb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>H and 3K). Interestingly, the negative charge on Ub is important for OTULIN activity, given that Met1-diUb E16Q<sup>prox</sup> still showed a 35-fold lower <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> for WT OTULIN. Next, we tested whether the more reactive OTULIN N341D or D336A mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>E) showed improved diUb hydrolysis activity. WT Met1-diUb is a poor substrate for OTULIN N341D, most likely because of the repulsion of negative charges (Ub Glu16 and OTULIN Asp341) in the catalytic center (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I and K). Indeed, OTULIN N341D showed improved kinetics when Ub Glu16 was mutated, and both <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> improved, although WT activity was not regained. The OTULIN N341D mutant worked best with Met1-diUb E16Q<sup>prox</sup>, suggesting that the requirement for a negative charge was partially compensated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J and 3K). The coordination of Asn341 is a key event in OTULIN activation, as was confirmed when the only OTULIN residue coordinating the Asn341 side chain, Tyr91, was mutated to Phe, resulting in 20-fold reduction of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> while not affecting <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>I, 2J, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>K, and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>F). Strong effects of Glu16 mutation were also observed in the OTULIN D336A mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J and 3K). Altogether, this showed that the coordination of the catalytic triad through Ub interaction is important for OTULIN activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>L).</p>
        <p>Hence, we reveal a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in which Glu16 of the proximal Ub activates the catalytic triad of OTULIN by both restricting the movement of the catalytic His339 and introducing a negative charge, presumably for the proper coordination of Asn341 for catalysis. OTULINâs usage of a catalytic Asn improves interaction with Glu16 containing Met1-linked chains.</p>
        <p>It appears that OTULIN has evolved Met1-linkage-specific Ub-binding sites to specifically interact with linear chains. Additionally, to further distinguish chain types, OTULIN invokes a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in order to ensureÂ that only Met1 linkages are hydrolyzed. OTULINâs remarkable specificity suggests that Met1-linked polyUb have to be tightly regulated independently of other ubiquitination events in cells.</p>

        <title>Cellular OTULIN Antagonizes LUBAC Signaling</title>
        <p>The identification of OTULIN as a Met1-linkage-specific DUB prompted us to study its role in cells. The human <italic>FAM105B</italic> gene is ubiquitously expressed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org/%2523goto%253Dgenereport%2526id%253D90268" id="intref0025">http://biogps.org/%23goto%3Dgenereport%26id%3D90268</ext-link>). A polyclonal antiserum detected OTULIN in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293ETÂ and other cell lines (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>AâS4C). C-terminal GFP-tagged OTULIN is cytoplasmic, active, and Met1 specific (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>DâS4F). OTULIN is evolutionarily restricted to vertebrates and selected invertebrate lineages but is not detected in <italic>D.Â melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C.Â elegans</italic>. Interestingly, all OTULIN-comprising taxa also contain genes for components of the Met1-polyUb chain assembly machinery LUBAC.</p>
        <p>Expression of the LUBAC components HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN induced Met1-polyUb, which was removed when OTULIN was coexpressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). Inactive OTULIN C129A led to the significant enrichment of Met1-polyUb in cells, and OTULIN Ub chain-binding mutants W96A and L259E (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>I and 2J) increased Met1 linkages in cells, albeit not to the same extent as C129A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A, lanes 4â6).</p>
        <p>Expression of LUBAC induces NF-ÎºB activation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>), which was suppressed when OTULIN was transiently coexpressed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B) and also in stable cell lines overexpressing OTULIN (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>G and S4H). Despite the enrichment of Met1-polyUb (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A), OTULIN catalytic or Ub-binding mutants still inhibited LUBAC-driven NF-ÎºB activity to some extent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>B). Apparently, the increase in Met1-polyUb alone is not sufficient to augment NF-ÎºB activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B).</p>
        <p>NF-ÎºB activation by TNFÎ± leads to the translocation of the cytosolic p65 NF-ÎºB subunit to the nucleus (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>C, and S5D). Transient overexpression of OTULIN or OTULIN C129A blocked p65 nuclear translocation after TNFÎ± stimulation, whereas OTULIN W96A or OTULIN L259E had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>C, and S5D). It appears that OTULIN overexpression antagonizes NF-ÎºB activation by removing Met1-polyUb, whereas OTULIN C129A acts as a high-affinity UBD that competes with other Met1-specific UBDs required for NF-ÎºB signaling in a similar manner to the one recently reported for the overexpression of the NEMO UBAN domain (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">van Wijk etÂ al., 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>These results suggested that OTULIN was able to regulate LUBAC mediated processes in cells. One of the few reported targets of LUBAC is NEMO (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>). Transfection of GST-tagged NEMO resulted in NEMO modification which wasÂ prevented in a NEMO K285/309R double mutant where ubiquitination sites are mutated (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>D). Co-overexpression of LUBAC resulted in an additional Ub band on NEMO, and the Met1-specific antibody indicated that this additional band was a short Ub chain. This was absent in OTULIN-overexpressing stable cell lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>F)Â suggesting that OTULIN could remove Met1-polyUb from NEMO.</p>
        <p>Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown of NEMO precipitated HOIP, HOIL1, SHARPIN, and OTULIN, suggesting that these proteins might form a complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>F). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous SHARPIN precipitated endogenous HOIP and, interestingly, also endogenous OTULIN under unstimulated conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>G). Upon TNFÎ± stimulation, the TNF-R1 was enriched in SHARPIN IPs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E), further supporting the idea that a LUBAC-OTULIN complex is formed and that this complex may translocate to the TNF receptor signaling complex (TNF-RSC).</p>
        <p>Met1-linked polyUb is known to affect complex assembly at the TNF-RSC (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Haas etÂ al., 2009</xref>). IP of endogenous NEMO coprecipitates ubiquitinated RIPK1 after TNFÎ± stimulation. Importantly, overexpression of OTULIN abrogated NEMO-RIPK1 complex formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>F). This supports the idea that the interaction between NEMO and RIPK1 is stabilized by Met1 linkages and reveals a mechanism of how OTULIN may affect NF-ÎºB activation in response to TNFÎ± stimulation.</p>

        <title>Ubiquitin Glu16 Is Important for Met1-polyUb Signaling</title>
        <p>Next, with a cellular readout for OTULIN overexpression at hand, we set out to test OTULINâs mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in cells by characterizing the effects of an Ub E16A mutant. Control experiments assessing whether this mutant is still assembled in Met1-polyUb by HOIP gave the surprising result that a minimal HOIP ligase construct (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Smit etÂ al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Stieglitz etÂ al., 2012</xref>) was impaired in assembling Met1-linked chains from Ub E16A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>A). Furthermore, fluorescent Met1-diUb E16A<sup>prox</sup> bound to the NEMO UBAN domain with reduced affinity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>B), which is consistent with the known interaction between the NEMO UBAN domain and Ub Glu16 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>C) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Rahighi etÂ al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>Despite this, co-overexpression of Ub E16A and LUBAC in HEK 293ET cells still activated NF-ÎºB, and this could not be completely reversed by OTULIN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 5</xref>D), consistent with OTULINâs inability to efficiently hydrolyze Ub E16A-containing polymers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>). These results suggested that Ub Glu16 is important in multiple aspects of Met1-polyUb signaling.</p>

        <title>OTULIN Affects LUBAC-Mediated Cytokine Responses</title>
        <p>Transient overexpression of OTULIN or the well-studied NF-ÎºB inhibitor A20 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hymowitz and Wertz, 2010</xref>) blocks poly(I:C) induced NF-ÎºB activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). In comparison, OTULIN inhibits TNFÎ±-mediated NF-ÎºB by â¼50%, which correlates with effects observed by LUBAC downregulation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Haas etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>A). In OTULIN-expressing stable cell lines, transcription of NF-ÎºB target genes was reduced in response to 10Â ng/ml TNFÎ± (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>B), and, although IÎºBÎ± was rapidly phosphorylated and almost completely degraded after 15Â min of TNFÎ± stimulation in control cell lines, IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation, degradation, and NF-ÎºB activation was delayed in OTULIN-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>C). Moreover, stable overexpression of OTULIN sensitized cells to TNFÎ±-induced cell death (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>D and 6E), consistent with observations in <italic>cpdm</italic> mice that lack Sharpin (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Walczak etÂ al., 2012</xref>) or in humans with mutations in HOIL1 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boisson etÂ al., 2012</xref>). OTULIN overexpression promoted enhanced and persistent JNK activation and c-Jun phosphorylation at later time points, leading to the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, two key players in the regulation of cell-death induction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 6</xref>F). As for IÎºBÎ± phosphorylation, OTULIN overexpression also resulted in a delay of JNK activation kinetics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and 6F).</p>
        <p>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against OTULIN resulted in anÂ increase in LUBAC-induced NF-ÎºB activation in HEK 293ET and U2OS cells and also in T-REx 293 cells stably expressing a doxycycline-inducible OTULIN-targeting microRNA (miRNA) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>A and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>AâS6C). LUBAC-dependent induction of NF-ÎºB could be prevented by co-overexpression of active, but not inactive, OTULIN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>A). Interestingly, western blotting against the overexpressed LUBAC components revealed that HOIP was ubiquitinated in OTULIN miRNA cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B), and coexpression of OTULIN removed these chains, showing that they are Met1 linked (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>B). This suggested that one role of OTULIN in the LUBAC complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>E) is to prevent the autoubiquitination of HOIP. However, LUBAC recruitment to the TNF-RSC was unchanged in OTULIN knockdown cell lines, and Met1-Ub linkages were enriched in the TNF-RSC, implying that OTULIN also regulates Met1-Ub on other components (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C). Accordingly, we observed a slight increase in RIPK1 ubiquitination enriched with a Met1-linkage-specific Ub-binding matrix in OTULIN-depleted U2OS cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>D), suggesting that RIPK1 Met1 ubiquitination in response to TNFÎ± is targeted by OTULIN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>F).</p>
        <p>Stable OTULIN knockdown affected cytokine responses and led to enhanced NF-ÎºB activation after poly(I:C) and TNFÎ± (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>E), and, even though the initial induction of NF-ÎºB target genes was not severely altered after OTULIN knockdown, expression of A20, IÎºBÎ±, IL-8, and TNFÎ± was sustained in response to TNFÎ± (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>F). Initial phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºBÎ± after TNFÎ± stimulation was only slightly enhanced in OTULIN knockdown cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S6</xref>D). However, JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation was sustained at late time points, again leading to cell death (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6</xref>DâS6F). The fact that both overexpression and knockdown of OTULIN led to cell death was surprising and requires further investigation.</p>
        <p>OTULIN knockdown cell lines were deregulated in their NF-ÎºB response, but we could not observe a strong effect on canonical NF-ÎºB signaling. Jurkat cells express higher amounts of OTULIN (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S4</xref>C), and OTULIN knockdown by siRNA led to an increase in phospho-IÎºBÎ± and subsequent enhancement of NF-ÎºB DNA binding (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>G). This was due to increased IKK activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>H), consistent with current models of LUBAC function (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga and Iwai, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Walczak etÂ al., 2012</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we identify FAM105B/OTULIN as a human OTU DUB specific for Met1-linked Ub chains. OTULIN is a missing piece in Met1-Ub chain biology, for which no linkage-specific DUB has been described to date. Our data suggest that OTULIN is an antagonist of LUBAC inÂ vitro and in cells. We reveal the molecular basis for the remarkable Met1 linkage specificity by structural and biophysical studies and give insights into potential roles of OTULIN as a LUBAC interactor and antagonist in cells. Consistent with the biochemical findings, overexpression of OTULIN removes Met1-polyUb and dampens LUBAC-mediated NF-ÎºB signaling, whereas knockdown of OTULIN leads to increased Met1-polyUb, IKK activation, and NF-ÎºB signaling after TNFÎ± stimulation. However, both overexpression and knockdown of OTULIN sensitized cells to TNFÎ±-induced cell death, suggesting more complex roles for Met1 linkages in balancing signaling pathways downstream of the TNFÎ± receptor.</p>

        <title>Structural Insights into Ub Chain Linkage Specificity inÂ DUBs</title>
        <p>Linkage specificity in DUBs is not well understood, and the structure of apo OTULIN did not explain its Met1 specificity, because of its structural similarity to the Lys48-specific OTUB1. The key insight into linkage specificity for these two enzymes came from the complex structures of the enzyme with two Ub molecules bound across the active site.</p>
        <p>A high-affinity Ub-binding site in OTULIN allows it to select Met1-linked chains with 100-fold preference over Lys63 linkages and disallows the binding of Lys48-linked and presumably other chains. This mechanism is shared by many DUBs; e.g., TRABID (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Licchesi etÂ al., 2012</xref>) and OTUB1 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Juang etÂ al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wiener etÂ al., 2012</xref>). However, in a physiological situation where multiple Ub chain linkages are often mixed, substrate-targeted DUBs may cleave additional Ub chain types. OTULIN prevents such promiscuity by requiring a properly positioned Ub residue, Glu16, for catalytic efficiency. Even in Lys63-linked chains, the required rotation of the proximal Ub would displace Ub Glu16, preventing activity. Therefore, OTULIN is the first DUB for which substrate-assisted catalysis has been demonstrated to achieve linkage specificity. It is possible that substrate-assisted catalysis explains the linkage (or substrate) specificity of other DUBs. It will also be interesting to see whether DUB activators exist that complement the catalytic triad in an analogous manner as that observed in OTULIN.</p>
        <p>Ub-mediated substrate-assisted catalysis was recently shown to be crucial for the assembly of Lys11-linked polyUb, where Ub Glu34 complements the active site of the E2Â Ub-conjugating enzyme UBE2S (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wickliffe etÂ al., 2011</xref>). The fact that Glu16 also impairs HOIP activity also suggests the functionality of this side chain in assembly reactions. Altogether, this shows that Ub is more than just a binding partner for other proteins and that it can actively participate in enzymatic reactions.</p>

        <p>In transfection experiments, we demonstrated that OTULIN could counteract cellular LUBAC responses, suggesting that OTULIN helps to balance the amount of Met1-polyUb in cells. Furthermore, the mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis suggests that OTULIN may not target individual proteins but, instead, target Met1-linked Ub chains, regardless of where they are attached. Indeed, we identified three proteins that change in their ubiquitination status when OTULIN levels are modulated. NEMO and RIPK1 are among the few reported targets of LUBAC (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>We provide evidence that OTULIN directly interacts with LUBAC. The observation that depletion of OTULIN leads to the modification of HOIP with Met1-polyUb suggests that HOIP, like many other E3 ligases, undergoes autoubiquitination and that OTULIN has the ability to prevent this. This most likely explains why the overexpression of OTULIN chain-binding mutants lead to increased Met1-polyUb in cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A). Moreover, this interaction most likely recruits OTULIN to LUBAC targets. However, the functional consequences of a LUBAC-OTULIN interaction are unclear, given that HOIP stability, recruitment, and activity appear to be unaffected, and this requires further investigation.</p>
        <p>Regarding the functional requirement for Met1-linked chains in NF-ÎºB responses, key questions remain to be answered. First, inÂ contrast to Lys63-linked chains, for which roles in NF-ÎºB signaling have long been verified, for example, by elegant replacement strategies (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xu etÂ al., 2009</xref>), Met1-linked polymers have a very low abundance, and are hard to detect in cell lysates. This may change with the discovery that catalytically inactive OTULIN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>A) or OTULIN knockdown (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>C) leads to the stabilization of Met1 linkages. A second, more important issue is the lack of proteins modified with Met1-polyUb inÂ vivo after a physiological stimulus. We believe that OTULIN can also be instrumental here, given that its specificity can be exploited as a Met1-specific Ub-binding protein when inactivated or in mass spectrometry methods. We anticipate that the identification of LUBAC and OTULIN targets may reveal a surprising variety of cellular proteins not restricted to NF-ÎºB signaling.</p>

        <title>Role of OTULIN in Cytokine Responses</title>
        <p>Our data identify roles of OTULIN in TNFÎ± signaling, which is in agreement with reported roles of Met1-polyUb in this pathway (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Haas etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Walczak etÂ al., 2012</xref>). However, in TNFÎ± signaling, the putative redundant or nonredundant involvement of many different Ub chain types leads to a complicated interplay of Ub signaling (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</xref>). The functional importance of Met1-linked chains in the mix is supported by genetic evidence from <italic>cpdm</italic> mice lacking SHARPIN (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gerlach etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda etÂ al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tokunaga etÂ al., 2011</xref>) and data from human patients with mutations in HOIL1 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boisson etÂ al., 2012</xref>). So far, there is no unifying molecular mechanism that explains why so many different forms of polyUb are seemingly important for the activation of identical kinase cascades upon TNFÎ± stimulation. Interestingly, the effects of OTULIN overexpression or knockdown seem more pronounced in poly(I:C) versus TNFÎ± signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E), and it will be important to study roles of OTULIN in other pathways that depend on Met1-linked chains, such as NOD2 signaling (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Damgaard etÂ al., 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our data support a role of Met1 linkages in providing an important scaffold for productive complex formation, given that the loss of Met1-linked chains induced by OTULIN overexpression prevents the association of NEMO with ubiquitinated RIPK1. Ubiquitinated RIPK1 is targeted also by the DUBs A20 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hymowitz and Wertz, 2010</xref>) and CYLD (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sun, 2010</xref>). CYLD hydrolyzes Met1 linkages (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Komander etÂ al., 2009</xref>) and, hence, could also contribute to antagonize LUBAC signaling. However, although A20 and CYLD are induced by TNFÎ± for the establishment of a negative feedback loop, neither OTULIN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 7</xref>F) nor LUBAC (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Haas etÂ al., 2009</xref>) are induced by TNFÎ±, again suggesting that they function as a differentially regulated signaling module. OTULIN is subject to phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination in cells, and it will be interesting to study whether these modifications regulate its activity or function.</p>
        <p>Overall, our data suggest that the identified DUB OTULIN is an antagonist of the LUBAC E3 ligase complex. Consistent with reported roles for Met1-polyUb, changing OTULIN expression affects LUBAC-mediated processes, including NF-ÎºB signaling. Detailed genetic analysis will be necessary in order to understand how LUBAC and OTULIN balance Met1-polyUb chains inÂ vivo. This might confirm some reported roles and may reveal new cellular roles for this atypical Ub chain type.</p>

Met1-diUb variants were serially diluted into FlAsH-buffer and contained a fixed concentration of 300Â nM FlAsH-tagged Met1-diUb, to detect changes in fluorescence anisotropy. To each well, 10Â Î¼l of substrate was mixed with 10Â Î¼l OTULIN variants in FlAsH-buffer. The change of fluorescence anisotropy was recorded over a period of 5Â min. The observed fluorescence polarization values were converted to percentage of substrate cleavage by comparing to baseline values from intact substrate and FlAsH-tagged monoUb that were acquired for each experiment. All measurements were corrected by subtracting changes in fluorescent anisotropy for FlAsH-tagged Met1-diUb alone. Triplicate recordings were made for each substrate concentration. Kinetic analysis was performed in Graphpad Prism 5. Initial rates of the enzymatic reaction were calculated and plotted against substrate concentration at a fixed OTULIN concentration, allowing determination of Michaelis-Menten parameters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>(A) Chemical difference between an isopeptide (left) and Met1-peptide linkage (right) in diUb. The distal Ub (top) is linked via its C-terminal Gly<sup>75</sup>-Gly<sup>76</sup> sequence to a Lys side chain Îµ-amino group in another Ub or on a substrate, generating a branched peptide. In a Met1-linked chain, the C-terminal Gly76 is connected to Met1 of the distal Ub in a standard peptide linkage. The Met1 and Gln2 side chains, as well as the Met1 carbonyl (red), represent steric differences in comparison to an isopeptide linkage. A green arrow indicates the scissile bond in a DUB reaction.</p>

        <p>(A) Sequence alignment of FAM105B/OTULIN from various species, extracted from the Ensembl Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Compara_Tree%3fg%3dENSG00000154124;r%3d5:14664773-14699820" id="intref0015">http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Compara_Tree?g=ENSG00000154124;r=5:14664773-14699820</ext-link>). Several sequences (Zebrafinch, Lizard, <italic>Xenopus</italic>) lack an initiating N-terminal Met, suggesting that sequences were N-terminally truncated. Annotations of secondary structure are based on the Met1-diUb complex structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>F). The annotation below indicates the start of the crystallized construct (black arrow), catalytic residues (yellow stars), and residues interacting with the proximal (orange circles), distal (red circles) or both Ub moieties (yellow circles) (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>G).</p>
        <p>(B) Hydrolysis of Ub-AMC by 5 pM UCH-L3 and 25Â nM OTULIN WT. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean calculated from triplicate measurements. See <xref rid="dtbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Extended Experimental Procedures</xref> for details.</p>
        <p>(C) Ub-based suicide inhibitors. Ub-x, with x being a C2Cl, C2Br or C3Br warhead (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Borodovsky etÂ al., 2002</xref>), were prepared according to (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Akutsu etÂ al., 2011</xref>) and <xref rid="dtbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Extended Experimental Procedures</xref> and used to modify vOTU or OTULIN. A coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel is shown. While vOTU modification with Ub-probes results in a band shift due to the covalent modification, OTULIN is inert toward these reagents.</p>
        <p>(D) Linkage specificity is retained with 1Â Î¼M OTULIN. DiUb (1Â Î¼M) of all possible linkage types is hydrolyzed over a time course by 1Â Î¼M OTULIN, and visualized on silver stained 4%â12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels.</p>
        <p>(E) Incubation of OTULIN with Met1-linked tetraUb (Met1) or mutant Met1-linked tetraUb (Met1, GS-linked) in which Gly76 in the linkage is mutated to Ser. A silver stained SDS-PAGE gel of the indicated time course is shown. OTULIN hydrolysis of Met1-linked tetraUb immediately generates tri-, di- and monoUb, suggesting that OTULIN can cleave at any position within the tetraUb chain (endo-activity).</p>

        <p>Structural Analysis of OTULIN, Related to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref></p>
        <p>The catalytic triad of OTULIN is delocalized in the absence of Met1-diUb.</p>
        <p>(A) View of OTULIN catalytic triad as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C, the occupancies of the catalytic cysteine (Cys129) and histidine (His339) are 28% and 36% respectively.</p>
        <p>(B) View of the catalytic triad of OTUB1 (green) bound to Ub suicide probe (red) (PDB ID: 4DHZ) (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wiener etÂ al., 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>(C) Superimposition of OTULIN and OTUB1 catalytic centers highlights the miss-orientation of OTULINs catalytic residues, His339 and Cys129 in the absence of Met1-diUb.</p>
        <p>(D) Stereo view of the apo OTULIN catalytic site, as viewed from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>C showing all residues within the region of the catalytic center enclosed in a 2|Fo|-|Fc| map, contoured at 1Ï.</p>
        <p>(E) Superimposition of OTULIN structures used within this study reveals no conformational changes between the OTULIN D336A and OTULIN WT structure (rmsd 0.24Â Ã) and OTULIN C129A from the Met1-diUb-containing structure and OTULIN WT (rmsd 0.76Â Ã).</p>
        <p>(F) Close-up view of the various OTULIN catalytic centers. The catalytic His339 exists in two occupancies within the apo structure whereas only a single, catalytic conformation is observed in the D336A mutant structure. Likewise, within the OTULIN Met1-diUb structure His339 exists only in the catalytic conformation.</p>
        <p>(G) Stereo view of the OTULIN D336A catalytic site enclosed in a 2|Fo|-|Fc| map, contoured at 1Ï.</p>
        <p>(H) Catalytic center of OTULIN Met1-diUb complex as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>E, with a 2|Fo|-|Fc| map contoured at 1Ï shown for relevant residues.</p>
        <p>(I) Surface conservation of OTULIN, based on the sequence alignment in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ S1</xref> generated with the Consurf server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://consurf.tau.ac.il/" id="intref0020">http://consurf.tau.ac.il/</ext-link>). The surface of OTULIN (from the diUb complex structure, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>F) is colored from green (no conservation) to dark red (fully conserved) and shown as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>G (left) as well as in a 180Â° rotation (right).</p>
        <p>(J) Side-by-side comparison between the OTULIN and OTUB1 -diUb complexes, with OTULIN (blue, with red (distal) and orange (proximal) Met1-diUb) on the left and OTUB1 (green, with gray Ub molecules) on the right. The N-terminal helix in OTUB1 (yellow) binds to the Ile44 hydrophobic patch (blue on all Ub molecules) of the proximal Ub molecule. In the OTULIN structure, rotation of the proximal Ub leads to an exposed Ile44 patch of the proximal Ub moiety.</p>
        <p>(K) Orientation of diUb molecules (colored as in (J) resulting from superposition of OTULIN and OTUB1. Although Ub molecules occupy similar spaces on the enzymes (see (J), both Ub molecules are rotated with respect to each other. Rotation of the proximal Ub is expected as different linkage points are involved (see position of C-termini, labeled C). The rotation of the distal Ub of â¼18Â° is more surprising, and reveals that the S1 binding site of the enzyme also shows significant plasticity.</p>
        <p>(L) Close-up of the OTULIN catalytic center bound to Met1-diUb. Glu16 and Gln2 of the proximal Ub are shown in yellow, and active site residues are labeled.</p>
        <p>(M) Catalytic center of OTUB1 bound to two ubiquitin molecules. Lys48 of the proximal Ub is indicated, and is the only residue in close proximity to the catalytic center, explaining OTUB1âs specificity. However, further Ub residues interacting with the catalytic triad as observed in OTULIN are not present.</p>

        <p>(A) Met1-diUb and variants with point mutations in the proximal Ub moiety were hydrolyzed by OTULIN at 50Â nM concentration (compared to 10Â nM in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>G). A time course of the reaction is resolved on a silver stained SDS-PAGE gel as in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>G.</p>
        <p>(B) Same as (A), but using the Ub specific protease USP21 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ye etÂ al., 2011</xref>) at 50Â nM concentration.</p>
        <p>(C) Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles of inactive OTULINcat C129A with Met1-diUb, and Met1-diUb variants containing point mutations in the proximal moiety. Experiments were performed with 33.5Â Î¼M OTULIN and 43Â Î¼M Met1-diUb mutants, giving a 1:1.3 molar ratio of OTULIN to diUb, respectively. Shifting of the SEC peak to the left indicates complex formation in all cases. Corresponding SDS-PAGE gels showing proteins in peak fractions according to the profile are shown below.</p>
        <p>(D) Binding curves derived from fluorescence anisotropy measurements for OTULIN C129A and OTULIN C129A N314D using FlAsH-tagged Met1-diUb WT, E16A<sup>prox</sup> and E16Q<sup>prox</sup>. Error bars represent standard deviation from the mean of measurements performed in triplicate.</p>
        <p>(E) View of the catalytic center of OTULINcat C129A bound to Met1-diUb, showing the interaction of Tyr91 with the catalytic Asn341.
