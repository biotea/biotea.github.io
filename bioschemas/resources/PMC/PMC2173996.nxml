      <abstract>
        <p>We find that Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, translocates to discrete foci on mitochondria during the initial stages of apoptosis, which subsequently become mitochondrial scission sites. A dominant negative mutant of Drp1, Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, inhibits apoptotic scission of mitochondria, but does not inhibit Bax translocation or coalescence into foci. However, Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> causes the accumulation of mitochondrial fission intermediates that are associated with clusters of Bax. Surprisingly, Drp1 and Mfn2, but not other proteins implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, colocalize with Bax in these foci. We suggest that Bax participates in apoptotic fragmentation of mitochondria.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, Bax and Bak, are essential for many pathways of programmed cell death (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). Bax is cytosolic, whereas Bak circumscribes the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> in healthy cells and upon the initiation of apoptosis they coalesce together into punctate foci on the surface of mitochondria (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hsu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>). Interaction of Bax with components of the permeability transition pore (for review see <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Desagher and Martinou, 2000</xref>) has suggested that induction of permeability transition and mitochondrial swelling are the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis induction. An alternative model, supported by results obtained with artificial membranes, is that Bax directly forms pores (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Antonsson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Schlesinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Basanez et al., 1999</xref>) that allow proteins to escape from the mitochondria (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein et al., 2000</xref>) into the cytosol to initiate apoptosis.</p>
      <p>Recently, mitochondrial fission has been reported to occur during apoptosis induced by a variety of unrelated stimuli (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Mancini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Desagher and Martinou, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Pinton et al., 2001</xref>) and truncated Bid induces morphological remodeling of mitochondrial cristae (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Scorrano et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Maintenance of mitochondrial shape depends on the balance between fusion and fission events and is controlled by several proteins, including dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Otsuga et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Labrousse et al., 1999</xref>) and Mfn2 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Santel and Fuller, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we explore the relationship between Bax foci on mitochondria and mitochondrial scission machinery during the progression of apoptosis.</p>

        <title>Bax localizes at the tips, constriction sites, and scission foci of mitochondria in apoptotic cells</title>
        <p>We explored Bax translocation and foci formation during the mitochondrial fragmentation process that frequently occurs during apoptosis. After treatment with the broad specificity kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS), focal clusters of endogenous Bax were detected with the anti-Bax 6A7 antibody (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 1999</xref>). In some cells endogenous Bax clusters were located at the tips or along the edges of elongated tubular mitochondria typical of healthy cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Bax foci were also present at mitochondrial constriction sites, separating elongated mitochondria into several shorter units (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, arrowheads). Similar results were obtained in the presence and absence of the broad specificity caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, indicating that Bax translocation and foci formation are early apoptotic events, upstream of caspase activation. The same results were obtained with STS-treated Cos-7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) and HeLa cells (unpublished data) cotransfected with CFP-Bax and mito-YFP.</p>

<bold>Localization of Bax clusters on mitochondria in apoptotic Cos-7 cells.</bold> (A) Cells transfected with mito-DsRed2 (green) were treated with 1 Î¼M STS for 6 h, fixed, stained with anti-Bax 6A7 mAb (red), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. (B) Cells were cotransfected with CFP-Bax and mito-YFP. At 12 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 Î¼M STS for 90 min and examined by confocal microscopy. Each field illustrates one of the typical morphologies of mitochondria (green) and Bax foci (red) in apoptotic Cos-7 cells. Bax associates with mitochondrial constriction sites (arrowheads) or at the tips of tubular elongated mitochondria and appositions of mitochondria. (C and D) Cos-7 cells were treated with 1 Î¼M STS and analyzed by electron microscopy after staining endogenous Bax (C) or CFP-Bax (D) with anti-Bax 6A7 mAb and anti-GFP mAb, respectively, and processing by silver-enhancement of immunogold labeling. In dying cells, endogenous Bax localized to mitochondrial tips and constriction sites. Bars, 0.5 Î¼m.</p>

Although the localization of Bax to mitochondrial scission sites was not previously recognized, examination of previously published electron micrographs (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>) reveals that both endogenous and overexpressed Bax localize to mitochondrial tips in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>, and constriction sites in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and I</xref>, of that paper.</p>

At 12 h after transfection cells were treated with 1 Î¼M STS and analyzed by confocal microscopy over time. Fragmentation and vesiculation of mitochondria began at the same time (between 75 and 80 min in A) that Bax (red) coalesced at mitochondrial scission sites (arrowheads). Fragmented mitochondria often remained connected by Bax-containing structures (A and B). Complete separation of fragmented mitochondria was also detected (C).</p>

        <p>We examined the time sequence of Bax foci localization during mitochondrial scission events. HeLa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>) and Cos-7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C) cells were cotransfected with CFP-Bax and mito-YFP constructs, treated with STS and analyzed by confocal microscopy over time. CFP-Bax clusters became detectable between 60â120 min after addition of STS, immediately preceding major changes in the morphology of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In most cases Bax coalesced at sites where mitochondrial scission subsequently occurred, although some sites of Bax coalescence did not sever in the time frame examined (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). However, all productive scission events had CFP-Bax aggregates associated with them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, AâC). In those instances in which the severed mitochondria moved apart, CFP-Bax clusters remained attached to both tips of the newly formed organelles at the scission site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). These observations suggest that Bax may participate in the severing of mitochondria that occurs during apoptosis. Consistent with this model, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> inhibited STS-induced clustering of Bax on mitochondria (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>), mitochondrial fragmentation (unpublished data), and apoptosis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boise et al., 1993</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effect of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> on Bax dynamics in apoptotic cells</title>
        <p>The dominant negative inhibitor of Drp1, Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, was shown to inhibit the mitochondrial fragmentation occurring during apoptosis induced by various stimuli (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Frank et al., 2001</xref>). We explored the effect of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> on Bax translocation, foci formation, and on mitochondrial scission.</p>
        <p>We analyzed the effect of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> expression on mitochondrial Bax translocation using HeLa cells in which expression of WT Drp1 (T-Rex-Drp1) and Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (T-Rex-Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>) is controlled by tetracycline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Tetracycline-treated T-Rex-Drp1, T-Rex-Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, and control vectorâtransfected cells (T-Rex-V) were incubated with STS for 5 h, fractionated, and analyzed by Western Blotting for mitochondrial translocation of Bax. Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> did not inhibit mitochondrial translocation of Bax (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). However, T-Rex- Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> cells were more resistant to apoptosis induced by STS than T-Rex-V or T-Rex-Drp1 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C). Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> also did not inhibit Bax translocation to membranes in Cos-7 cells transiently cotransfected with Bax and Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> D).</p>

T-Rex- Drp1, T-Rex- Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, and T-Rex-V cells were treated with 1 Î¼g/ml of tetracycline for 24 h and analyzed for expression of WT Drp1, Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> by Western Blotting. (B) T-Rex- Drp1, T-Rex- Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, and T-Rex-V cells were treated with 1 Î¼g/ml of tetracycline for 24 h and then treated with 1 Î¼M STS for 5 h, and analyzed for the translocation of Bax to the membranes by Western Blotting. (C) Viability T-Rex- Drp1, T-Rex- Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, and T-Rex-V was assayed as described in Materials and methods. Data represent the mean Â± SD of two experiments with the starting number of 100 cells per field. Two fields per sample were counted at each time point. (D) Cos-7 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA 3.1-Drp1 and pcDNA 3.1-Bax or pcDNA3.1- Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> and pcDNA 3.1-Bax (ratios 3:1), treated with 1 Î¼M STS for 2 h and, after cell fractionation, heavy membrane fractions and cytosols were analyzed by Western Blotting. (E and F) Cells were transfected with CFP-Bax, YFP-20, and pcDNA3.1-Drp1 (E), or CFP-Bax, YFP-20, and pcDNA3.1-Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (F) (ratio 2:0.5:6), treated with 1 Î¼M STS for 90 min and analyzed with confocal microscopy. Arrowheads indicate invaginations of OMM; possibly representing fission intermediates localized with CFP-Bax clusters. Bars, 20 Î¼m. (G) High magnification of some mitochondria from F (G1 and G2, control; G3â6, STS-treated cells). Arrowheads show the sites where Bax clusters localize, which may represent early fission sites.

        <p>We also examined the effect of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> on Bax translocation by confocal microscopy. Cells were cotransfected with CFP-Bax, a marker of the OMM, YFP-20 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>), and Drp1, or CFP-Bax, YFP-20, and Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> and then treated with STS. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>, Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> did not inhibit formation of Bax clusters, consistent with the results of Western blotting in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and D</xref>. However, in cells overexpressing Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F), Bax translocation and cluster formation did not correlate with changes in the gross morphology of mitochondria, in contrast to cells overexpressing WT Drp1 and Bax (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> E). Invaginations and/or vesiculations of the OMM were spatially associated with CFP-Bax in the presence of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> G, arrowheads), suggesting an increase in membrane dynamics in the areas containing Bax or aberrant mitochondrial scission attempts.</p>
        <p>To obtain high-resolution images of the effect of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> on the spatial distribution of Bax, Cos-7 cells were cotransfected with Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> or WT Drp1 and CFP-Bax, treated with STS, stained with anti-GFP antibodies, and analyzed by electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, H and I</xref>). In cells expressing WT Drp1, Bax clusters were tightly associated to one or two round mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> H). In cells overexpressing Drp1<sup>K38A</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> I, 1â5), mitochondria containing multiple clusters of Bax were detected as seen by confocal microscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> F). In the presence of Drp1<sup>K38A</sup>, Bax clusters were detected in two predominant localizations; bud-like complexes associated with the OMM and mitochondrial constriction sites. These Bax foci are clearly delineated and more electron dense, indicating a higher protein concentration than the surrounding cytoplasm, and occasionally are associated with membrane vesicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> I, 1, arrow).</p>

        <title>Analysis of the submitochondrial localization and spatial relation of proteins implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology to the Bax-foci</title>
        <p>To assess the possible participation in the apoptotic fission foci of proteins having proven or potential roles in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology in mammals, we analyzed the submitochondrial localizations of: Mfn2 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Santel and Fuller, 2001</xref>), Drp1 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>), a human homologue of Fis1 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Mozdy et al., 2000</xref>), human OMP25, and synaptojanin 2A (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Nemoto and De Camilli, 1999</xref>). YFP-Fis1 and YFP-OMP25 circumscribed mitochondria completely in healthy cells, whereas YFP-synaptojanin 2A was mostly cytosolic. Their localization did not change upon induction of apoptosis (unpublished data). We also did not detect submitochondrial foci formation in either healthy or apoptotic cells by the members of the Bcl-2 family, Bad, Bid and Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> (unpublished data; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>). However, Mfn2-YFP formed mitochondria-associated clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A; Online supplemental material) that colocalized with CFP-Bax upon induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Almost complete colocalization of clusters of Mfn2-YFP with CFP-Bax was detected in apoptotic cells. 92% Â± 10.5% of Mfn2 clusters (<italic>n</italic> = 847) colocalized with Bax clusters and 68% Â± 10% of Bax clusters (<italic>n</italic> = 1,238) colocalized with Mfn2 clusters. Endogenous Mfn2 was also found to colocalize with endogenous Bax in primary human myocytes (see Online supplemental material). Bak, the closest Bax homologue in the Bcl-2 family, which colocalized with Bax foci in apoptotic cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>) was also found to colocalize with Mfn2 in apoptotic cells (see Online supplemental material, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200209124/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200209124/DC1</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Endogenous Drp1 also colocalized with endogenous Bax after induction of apoptosis with STS, actinomycin D and etoposide in Cos-7 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C; Online supplemental material) and primary human fibroblasts treated with actinomycin D or etoposide (see Online supplemental material, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200209124/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200209124/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, two proteins that participate in the mitochondrial fission (Drp1) and fusion (Mfn2) colocalize with Bax in foci.</p>
        <p>These results suggest that Bax may participate with the mitochondrial fission apparatus to promote apoptosis. Previous results leading to other models of Bax activity could be consistent with the mitochondrial fission model. Bax was found to form channels in membranes that suggested a mechanism of the OMM permeabilization through Bax oligomeric pores. However, detailed analysis shows that Bax forms a lipidic pore (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Basanez et al., 1999</xref>), most similar to the type of pore formed during membrane fusion events (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerberg et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that the cell-free pore assay may be revealing how Bax participates in mitochondrial fusion and fission events. Although Bax poreâforming activity may be related to fission activity, further work is needed to interpret the biological significance of Bax localization with the mitochondrial fission process.</p>
