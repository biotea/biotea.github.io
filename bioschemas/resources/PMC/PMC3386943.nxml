        <p>Mutations in the <italic>ATP13A2</italic> gene (PARK9) cause autosomal recessive, juvenile-onset Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by parkinsonism. KRS mutations produce truncated forms of ATP13A2 with impaired protein stability resulting in a loss-of-function. Recently, homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations in <italic>ATP13A2</italic> have been identified in subjects with early-onset parkinsonism. The mechanism(s) by which missense mutations potentially cause parkinsonism are not understood at present. Here, we demonstrate that homozygous F182L, G504R and G877R missense mutations commonly impair the protein stability of ATP13A2 leading to its enhanced degradation by the proteasome. ATP13A2 normally localizes to endosomal and lysosomal membranes in neurons and the F182L and G504R mutations disrupt this vesicular localization and promote the mislocalization of ATP13A2 to the endoplasmic reticulum. Heterozygous T12M, G533R and A746T mutations do not obviously alter protein stability or subcellular localization but instead impair the ATPase activity of microsomal ATP13A2 whereas homozygous missense mutations disrupt the microsomal localization of ATP13A2. The overexpression of ATP13A2 missense mutants in SH-SY5Y neural cells does not compromise cellular viability suggesting that these mutant proteins lack intrinsic toxicity. However, the overexpression of wild-type ATP13A2 may impair neuronal integrity as it causes a trend of reduced neurite outgrowth of primary cortical neurons, whereas the majority of disease-associated missense mutations lack this ability. Finally, ATP13A2 overexpression sensitizes cortical neurons to neurite shortening induced by exposure to cadmium or nickel ions, supporting a functional interaction between ATP13A2 and heavy metals in post-mitotic neurons, whereas missense mutations influence this sensitizing effect. Collectively, our study provides support for common loss-of-function effects of homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations in <italic>ATP13A2</italic> associated with early-onset forms of parkinsonism.</p>

      <p>In recent years, a number of genes have been identified that are associated with autosomal recessive forms of parkinsonism including <italic>parkin (PARK2)</italic>, <italic>DJ-1 (PARK7)</italic>, <italic>PINK1 (PARK6)</italic> and <italic>ATP13A2 (PARK9)</italic>

Mutations in the <italic>ATP13A2</italic> gene cause Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), a juvenile-onset pallido-pyramidal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by slowly progressive levodopa-responsive parkinsonism often with additional features including supranuclear gaze palsy, pyramidal dysfunction, dystonia and dementia <xref rid="pone.0039942-NajimalDin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. KRS subjects normally exhibit generalized brain atrophy with evidence of impaired nigrostriatal dopaminergic function <xref rid="pone.0039942-Behrens1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Crosiers1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been identified in KRS subjects of families from Jordan, Chile, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China that produce frameshift or splicing variants resulting in truncated forms of ATP13A2 protein that are predicted to lead to a loss-of-function <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Crosiers1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that such truncating mutations promote the mislocalization of ATP13A2 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mammalian cells where they are degraded by the proteasome via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A number of homozygous (F182L [Japan] <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ning1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, G504R [Brazil] <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and G877R [Italy] <xref rid="pone.0039942-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) and heterozygous (T12M [Italy] <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, G533R [Italy] <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and A746T [Taiwan/Singapore] <xref rid="pone.0039942-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>) missense mutations have recently been identified in subjects with early-onset forms of familial or sporadic parkinsonism or Parkinson's disease (PD) suggesting that <italic>ATP13A2</italic> mutations may also contribute to early-onset PD. Of interest, homozygous mutations (F182L, G504R and G877R) typically cause juvenile-onset parkinsonism (10 to 22 years) whereas heterozygous mutations (T12M, G533R and A746T) are associated with early-onset parkinsonism (&lt;50 years) <xref rid="pone.0039942-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ning1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, potentially suggesting a gene dosage or graded effect of mutations. In contrast to truncating KRS mutations, the mechanism by which missense mutations cause parkinsonism or PD is unclear at present.</p>
      <p>The human <italic>ATP13A2</italic> gene encodes an 1180 amino acid protein of â¼130 kDa belonging to the P<sub>5</sub> subfamily of P-type transport ATPases that are predicted to contain ten transmembrane-spanning domains <xref rid="pone.0039942-Schultheis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Disease-associated missense mutations are located within the intracellular and extracellular regions of the protein with a particular cluster in the second intracellular loop region containing the catalytic ATPase domain. The physiological function of ATP13A2 in mammalian cells is unknown. ATP13A2 is highly expressed in the mammalian brain with particular enrichment in the substantia nigra <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In PD brains, ATP13A2 expression is up-regulated in surviving substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramonet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. ATP13A2 is localized at least in part to lysosomal membranes in mammalian cells where it is predicted to participate in the active transport of cations across vesicular membranes in an ATP-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Schultheis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, at present, the cation transporting activity or selectivity of ATP13A2 has not been directly demonstrated. In yeast, deletion of the ATP13A2 ortholog, <italic>ykp9</italic> (<italic>YOR291W</italic>), confers sensitivity to growth in the presence of heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>), manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>), nickel (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) and selenium (Se<sup>2+</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gitler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, implicating Ykp9 in sequestering heavy metals. ATP13A2 orthologs have been reported to protect against cellular toxicity induced by expression of the PD-associated protein Î±-synuclein in yeast, nematode worm and primary midbrain dopaminergic neurons <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gitler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. KRS mutations produce unstable truncated forms of ATP13A2 but are also directly toxic to cells, induce ER stress and sensitize cells to ER stress-induced cell death <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, truncating KRS mutations most likely cause disease through a loss-of-function mechanism but they may also induce additional cellular toxicity.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear how homozygous missense mutations (F182L, G504R and G877R) in ATP13A2 associated with parkinsonism potentially cause disease as they are likely to have subtle effects compared to truncations <xref rid="pone.0039942-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ning1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. At this juncture it is not clear whether heterozygous mutations in ATP13A2 (T12M, G533R and A746T) are truly disease-causing since they could represent rare polymorphic variants, or pathogenic variants that contribute to disease in combination with unidentified mutations, in a dominant or haploinsufficient manner, or as risk factors <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A complete understanding of the effects of disease-associated missense mutations on the basic properties of ATP13A2 will help to clarify their mechanism of action and whether they are likely to represent authentic pathogenic variants. Here, we comprehensively examine the effects of parkinsonism-associated homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations on the protein stability, subcellular localization and ATPase activity of ATP13A2, and their effects on neuronal integrity. Our data demonstrate that homozygous mutations commonly impair the protein stability of ATP13A2 and lead to its enhanced proteasomal degradation, whereas heterozygous mutations commonly impair the ATPase activity of ATP13A2. We further demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type ATP13A2 impairs neurite outgrowth whereas the majority of heterozygous and homozygous missense mutations lack this ability. Finally, the overexpression of ATP13A2 sensitizes to neurite shortening induced by exposure to the heavy metal ions, cadmium or nickel, and missense mutations influence this effect. Our data support a common loss-of-function mechanism for missense mutations associated with early-onset parkinsonism.</p>

        <title>Disease-associated missense mutations reduce the steady-state levels of ATP13A2</title>
        <p>To begin to explore the potential pathogenic effects of missense mutations in ATP13A2 associated with early-onset parkinsonism, we generated expression constructs for V5-tagged human ATP13A2 harboring homozygous (F182L, G504R and G877R) or heterozygous (T12M, G533R and A746T) missense mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We also introduced a synthetic D513N mutation that ablates a critical P1 domain phospho-acceptor site required for ATPase activity that is predicted to be non-functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0039942-Schultheis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gitler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. To initially explore the biochemical properties of ATP13A2, the solubility of these variants in different extraction buffers at ambient temperature was determined by Western blotting from HEK-293T cell extracts transiently expressing V5-tagged ATP13A2. ATP13A2 is most soluble in 1% Triton X-100 buffer and Laemmli sample buffer consistent with being a transmembrane-spanning protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also assessed the effects of temperature on the solubility of ATP13A2 derived from HEK-293T cells. Increasing temperature from 60 to 90Â°C decreases the solubility of ATP13A2 in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, for all subsequent experiments we routinely employed buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 without heating to efficiently extract ATP13A2 from cells. Frameshift and splicing mutations in ATP13A2 associated with KRS (i.e. 3057delC, 1632_1653dup22 and 1306+5GâA) produce truncated proteins that are unstable and degraded by the proteasome <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To explore the effects of missense mutations on protein stability, we examined the steady-state levels of ATP13A2 variants in HEK-293T cells by Western blotting. The homozygous mutations, F182L, G504R and G877R, produce a significant decrease in the steady-state levels of Triton-soluble ATP13A2 compared to WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The heterozygous T12M, G533R and A746T mutations or the non-functional variant, D513N, do not significantly influence the levels of ATP13A2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar observations were made for the steady-state levels of Triton-insoluble ATP13A2 thereby demonstrating that missense mutations do not influence the detergent solubility of ATP13A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The homozygous mutations, F182L, G504R and G877R, similarly reduce the steady-state levels of ATP13A2 in the Triton-soluble fraction of human SH-SY5Y neural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). For comparison, we also assessed the stability of ATP13A2 harboring KRS truncation mutations. The 3057delC, 1632_1653dup22 and 1306+5GâA mutations markedly reduce the steady-state levels of ATP13A2 to levels comparable to the effects of the F182L, G504R and G877R mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). To determine the effects of missense mutations on the steady-state mRNA expression levels of human ATP13A2 we conducted quantitative RT-PCR for each ATP13A2 variant expressed in HEK-293T cells. With the exception of the G877R variant, WT and mutant ATP13A2 mRNAs are expressed at similar levels (Figure S1). G877R ATP13A2 exhibits a non-significant reduction in mRNA expression levels suggesting that this mutation could potentially influence mRNA transcription and/or stability, which contributes in part to the markedly reduced steady-state protein levels observed for this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Collectively, our data demonstrate that homozygous missense mutations associated with early-onset parkinsonism commonly reduce the steady-state levels of ATP13A2 consistent with reduced protein stability.</p>

        <p>Since homozygous missense mutations dramatically reduce the steady-state levels of ATP13A2, we next sought to determine whether these effects are due to impaired protein stability. HEK-293T cells transiently expressing human ATP13A2 variants (WT, F182L, G504R and G877R) were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit new protein synthesis and sampled at 1, 3, 6 and 8 hours post-treatment to estimate the rate of protein turnover by Western blotting. The levels of WT ATP13A2 are reduced by â¼25% following treatment with CHX for 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

        <p>To understand the mechanism leading to the destabilization of ATP13A2 due to homozygous missense mutations, we assessed the degradation of ATP13A2 variants through the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways.

        <title>Missense mutations impair the effects of ATP13A2 on neurite outgrowth</title>
        <p>KRS mutations in ATP13A2 have been shown to induce cellular toxicity, ER stress and sensitize cells to ER stress-induced cell death <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To initially assess the effects of ATP13A2 missense mutants on cell viability, we examined the effects of overexpressing human ATP13A2 variants on the viability of human SH-SY5Y neural cells using an MTS proliferation assay. The expression of WT or missense mutant forms of ATP13A2 does not appreciably influence the basal viability of SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) demonstrating that ATP13A2 missense mutants are not intrinsically toxic to mammalian cells unlike truncated KRS mutants. We next sought to compare the subtle effects of ATP13A2 variants on neuronal integrity by assessing neurite outgrowth. Rat primary cortical cultures at DIV 3 were transiently co-transfected with V5-tagged human ATP13A2 variants (or empty vector) and EGFP at a 10â¶1 molar ratio to label transfected neurons. After 72 hours, cultures were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry to identify MAP2-positive cortical neurons. For each ATP13A2 variant, the length of EGFP+/MAP2+ cortical neurites was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). The overexpression of WT and F182L mutant ATP13A2 leads to a non-significant reduction of cortical neurite length compared to control MAP2+ neurons expressing EGFP alone, whereas expression of the T12M, G504R, D513N and G533R variants do not differ from EGFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that the levels of each human ATP13A2 variant in cortical neurons were similar to those achieved in HEK-293T cells (data not shown). Taken together, our data demonstrate that the overexpression of WT ATP13A2 displays a non-significant trend towards impairing neurite outgrowth whereas missense mutations in ATP13A2, with the exception of the F182L variant, disrupt this neurite effect consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism of action. Our data further suggest that the F182L variant may act through both a loss-of-function (i.e. impaired protein stability) and a gain-of-function (i.e. impaired neurite outgrowth) mechanism similar to KRS truncation mutations <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <title>ATP13A2 overexpression sensitizes cortical neurons to neurite shortening induced by heavy metals</title>
        <p>Since the overexpression of human ATP13A2 tends to impair the neurite outgrowth of primary cortical neurons, we next assessed the impact of exposure to heavy metals on this neuronal phenotype to assess the potential functional interaction between ATP13A2 and metal cations. Primary cortical neurons were co-transfected with V5-tagged human ATP13A2 variants (or empty vector) and EGFP plasmids at a 10â¶1 molar ratio, treated after 48 hours with or without Cd<sup>2+</sup> (30 ÂµM) or Ni<sup>2+</sup> (50 ÂµM) for 24 hours, and subjected to immunocytochemistry to label MAP-positive neurons. As before, we determined the length of EGFP+/MAP2+ neurites for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). In control neurons expressing EGFP alone, treatment with 30 ÂµM Cd<sup>2+</sup> results in a â¼33% reduction of neurite length compared to untreated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). In contrast, Cd<sup>2+</sup> treatment produces a marked â¼47% reduction of neurite length in neurons expressing WT ATP13A2, a â¼59% reduction with the F182L mutant, and a â¼39% reduction with the G504R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Treatment with 50 ÂµM Ni<sup>2+</sup> induces a â¼7% reduction of neurite length of control neurons expressing EGFP alone, whereas neurons expressing WT, F182L or G504R ATP13A2 exhibit a â¼19%, â¼20% or â¼3% reduction of neurite length, respectively, compared to untreated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039942-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment fails to induce neurite shortening in the presence or absence of ATP13A2 and was not studied further (data not shown). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the overexpression of ATP13A2 sensitizes neurons to impairments of neurite outgrowth induced by exposure to cadmium or nickel ions. The F182L mutation enhances the effects of cadmium compared to WT ATP13A2 further suggesting enhanced neuronal toxicity of this mutant protein, whereas the G504R mutation acts in a loss-of-function manner. These data support a functional interaction of ATP13A2 with heavy metal ions in post-mitotic neurons.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations in ATP13A2 are associated with early-onset forms of parkinsonism <xref rid="pone.0039942-Santoro1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-DiFonzo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ning1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The pathogenic mechanism(s) by which these mutations may cause disease have not been elucidated. For heterozygous mutations, it unclear whether they represent rare benign polymorphic variants or authentic disease-causing variants. Here, we demonstrate that homozygous missense mutations (F182L and G504R) commonly exhibit reduced steady-state levels, increased turnover, and enhanced proteasomal degradation of ATP13A2 consistent with impaired protein stability. The homozygous G877R mutation exhibits a combination of reduced protein stability and reduced mRNA expression levels. In contrast, heterozygous mutations, T12M, G533R and A746T, have small or minimal effects on protein stability. We further demonstrate that ATP13A2 is normally localized to cytoplasmic acidic vesicular membranes in mammalian neurons, including lysosomes and early and late endosomes. Similar to truncating KRS mutations <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the highly unstable F182L and G504R mutations disrupt the cytoplasmic vesicular localization of ATP13A2 and promote its mislocalization to the ER. Heterozygous mutations (T12M, G533R and A746T) impair the ATPase activity of microsome-localized ATP13A2 whereas the homozygous F182L, G504R and G877R mutations fail to appreciably localize within microsomes. In contrast to KRS mutations in ATP13A2 <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, missense mutants are not intrinsically toxic to human cell lines. However, in primary cortical neurons, the overexpression of wild-type ATP13A2 compromises neuronal integrity by impairing neurite outgrowth whereas missense mutations (with the exception of F182L) lack this toxic effect consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism for these mutations. ATP13A2 overexpression further sensitizes neurons to neurite shortening induced by exposure to the heavy metal ions, cadmium and nickel, with the F182L or G504R mutations enhancing or reducing this sensitizing effect, respectively. Collectively, our study reveals differential pathogenic effects of missense mutations on ATP13A2 protein stability, subcellular localization, ATPase activity and neuronal phenotypes consistent with a common loss-of-function mechanism for the actions of homozygous and heterozygous mutations.</p>
      <p>Homozygous missense mutations (i.e. F182L and G504R) markedly impair the protein stability of ATP13A2. Similar to truncating KRS mutations (i.e. 1632_1653dup22, 3057delC, 1306+5GâA and 3253delC) that mislocalize to the ER <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the F182L and G504R mutations impair the normal localization of ATP13A2 to vesicular membranes and facilitate mislocalization to the ER suggesting that these mutant proteins are potentially misfolded and may be subjected to degradation by the ERAD pathway. The G877R mutation, although partly unstable, can normally localize to vesicular membranes suggesting that it may not be a major substrate of the ERAD pathway. The F182L and G504R mutations appear to enhance the turnover of ATP13A2 by promoting its proteasomal degradation. The F182L, G504R and G877R mutations are localized to the first extracellular (F182L) and second intracellular loop (G504R and G877R) regions of ATP13A2 and most likely cause conformational alterations to these loops that destabilize the protein. Two of these mutations result in the non-conservative substitution of a neutral glycine residue for a positively charged arginine residue perhaps suggesting that simply altering the charge of this loop or increasing the side chain length has a destabilizing conformational effect that varies in magnitude depending on the location of this residue within the loop i.e. G504R&gt;G877R. The effect of substituting a hydrophobic phenylalanine residue for a similarly hydrophobic leucine residue at position 182 is less obvious but may relate to the reduced bulk of the side chain due to the absence of an aromatic benzene ring. Potentially, disease-associated missense mutations may produce a non-functional protein that is selectively targeted for degradation. Of note, the G504R variant is located adjacent to the P1 domain whereas the G877R variant occupies the P2 domain, with both domains implicated to play a role in the ATPase activity of ATP13A2 and may therefore produce a non-functional protein. Three heterozygous mutations localized to the intracellular N-terminal tail (T12M) and the intracellular catalytic loop (G533R and A746T) fail to have obvious effects on protein stability or subcellular localization suggesting that they may act through an alternate mechanism. Accordingly, heterozygous mutations (T12M, G533R and A746T) commonly impair the ATPase activity of microsomal-localized ATP13A2 whereas the homozygous F182L, G504R and G877R mutants fail to appreciably localize to microsomes and were thus refractory to analysis of ATPase activity. Missense mutations therefore appear to commonly act through a loss-of-function mechanism by exerting differential effects on the protein stability, subcellular localization or ATPase activity of ATP13A2.</p>
      <p>A potential caveat of the present study is that it relies on the transient overexpression of human ATP13A2 variants in human cell lines and cultured primary neurons at non-physiological expression levels. Consistent with our study, recent studies of KRS truncation mutants using similar overexpression approaches in a range of mammalian cells have revealed a destabilizing effect on the ATP13A2 protein resulting from its mislocalization to the ER and enhanced proteasomal degradation <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Collectively, there is strong agreement that PD-associated missense mutations and KRS mutations act through similar mechanisms to produce a loss-of-function effect. It will be important to confirm the destabilizing effects of missense mutations and truncating KRS mutations on the ATP13A2 protein in physiologically-relevant systems such as patient-derived cells or tissues, or knockin mouse models. Along these lines, cultured olfactory neurospheres harboring compound heterozygous ATP13A2 mutations (i.e. 3253delC frameshift and L1059R missense mutations) reveal a reduction in endogenous ATP13A2 mRNA levels primarily due to nonsense-mediated decay of the 3523delC mutant mRNA although ATP13A2 protein levels were not assessed in this model <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The impact of disease-associated mutations on the stability of the endogenous ATP13A2 protein awaits confirmation in future studies pending the availability of appropriate cellular models or tissues. PD-associated and KRS mutations share similar biochemical effects suggesting that ATP13A2 loss-of-function is primarily responsible for precipitating neurodegeneration. Recent studies have employed ATP13A2 knockdown in cultured cell lines or primary neurons, or patient-derived fibroblasts bearing <italic>ATP13A2</italic> mutations, to model the cellular consequences of disease-associated <italic>ATP13A2</italic> mutations <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramonet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Grunewald1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gusdon1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Usenovic1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. ATP13A2 knockdown has been suggested to impair neuronal integrity and/or induce neuronal cell death through a number of potential mechanisms, including abnormal cation homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramonet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, decreased macroautophagy <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gusdon1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, lysosomal dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0039942-Usenovic1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, Î±-synuclein accumulation <xref rid="pone.0039942-Usenovic1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and/or alterations in mitochondrial quality control <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramonet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Grunewald1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gusdon1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Which of these cellular abnormalities are directly responsible for mediating neuronal damage is not yet clear but they most likely result as a consequence of impaired lysosomal activity. Therefore, lysosomal dysfunction potentially underlies the pathogenic effects of ATP13A2 loss-of-function in neurons.</p>
      <p>We find that the overexpression of ATP13A2 missense mutants in human SH-SY5Y neural cells does not influence cell viability suggesting that they are not intrinsically toxic. KRS mutants have been shown to induce cell death in HeLa cells where they also sensitize to ER stress-induced cell death <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, another study reports the lack of cell death induced by the same KRS mutants overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons <xref rid="pone.0039942-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Furthermore, in the context of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced cell death in cell lines and hippocampal neurons, WT ATP13A2 protects from cell death whereas KRS mutants lack this ability <xref rid="pone.0039942-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Additional toxicity induced by KRS mutants may not therefore play a major role in disease and could relate to overexpression at non-physiological levels, especially given that such mutations lead to a dramatic destabilization and degradation of ATP13A2 <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It will be important to determine whether the expression of KRS mutants at physiological levels in patient-derived cells and tissues similarly induces cellular toxicity. A recent study has shown that human olfactory neurospheres harboring compound heterozygous mutations in ATP13A2 (3253delC and L1059R) exhibit signs of ER stress although neuronal viability was not assessed <xref rid="pone.0039942-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In primary cortical neurons, we find that the overexpression of WT ATP13A2 tends to impair neurite outgrowth. Consistent with a loss-of-function effect for missense mutations, the disease-associated T12M, G504R and G533R variants fail to influence neurite outgrowth compared to WT ATP13A2. These effects were similar to the effects of an ATPase-deficient D513N variant further supporting a loss-of-function mechanism. Similar to certain unstable KRS truncation mutants <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ugolino1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the F182L variant appears to induce additional toxicity when overexpressed since it causes a trend of reduced neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons similar to WT ATP13A2 despite its markedly impaired protein stability. It is likely that these effects are exacerbated by overexpression at non-physiological levels in neurons with the primary pathogenic effect of the F182L mutation at physiological expression levels being a loss-of-function due to reduced protein stability. Of note, the heterozygous T12M and G533R variants which have no obvious effects on protein stability or subcellular localization, have no effect on neurite outgrowth suggesting that they may also act as a pathogenic loss-of-function mutations albeit through an alternative mechanism such as via reduced ATPase activity.</p>
      <p>In support of a role for ATP13A2 in regulating the transport of Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>, we find that the overexpression of WT ATP13A2 sensitizes cortical neurons to neurite shortening induced by exposure to these heavy metal ions. This finding was somewhat unexpected as we would anticipate that ATP13A2 might protect against Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>-induced neuronal toxicity similar to the reported neuroprotective effects of ATP13A2 against Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Î±-synuclein toxicity <xref rid="pone.0039942-Gitler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Consistent with a loss-of-function effect for the G504R mutation, the overexpression of this mutant exhibited a reduced sensitizing effect on neurite length following Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> exposure compared to WT ATP13A2. In contrast, the F182L mutation enhanced the sensitizing effect of ATP13A2 following Cd<sup>2+</sup> exposure consistent with the enhanced neuronal toxicity of this unstable protein following its overexpression. The significance of neurite shortening induced by ATP13A2 is unclear at present and could indicate impaired neuronal integrity due to toxicity or a physiological effect of ATP13A2 in regulating neuronal process morphology similar to the PD-associated protein LRRK2 <xref rid="pone.0039942-MacLeod1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nevertheless, our data support a specific functional interaction of human ATP13A2 with Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> suggesting a potential role in the transport of these metal cations in post-mitotic mammalian neurons. Previous studies demonstrate that deletion of the ATP13A2 ortholog, <italic>ykp9</italic>, impairs yeast cell growth in the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Se<sup>2+</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0039942-Gitler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039942-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of WT but not KRS mutant ATP13A2 in mammalian cell lines or rat hippocampal neurons may protect from Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced apoptotic cell death <xref rid="pone.0039942-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Our recent studies have shown that the overexpression of human ATP13A2 in primary cortical neurons delays mitochondrial fragmentation induced by acute exposure to cadmium <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramonet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Collectively, these studies support a functional interaction between ATP13A2 and heavy metal cations, particularly cadmium. Our future studies will continue to clarify whether ATP13A2 can directly transport heavy metal cations across vesicular membranes, the substrate selectivity of ATP13A2, and the functional significance of cation transport <xref rid="pone.0039942-Ramonet1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Collectively, the present study demonstrates that disease-associated homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations in ATP13A2 exhibit differential pathogenic effects on protein stability, subcellular localization, ATPase activity and neuronal phenotypes, thereby providing support for a pathogenic loss-of-function mechanism for these mutations in precipitating early-onset parkinsonism.</p>

Microsomal fractions were quantified by BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and 4 Âµg of microsomal proteins were used for each ATPase assay. ATP hydrolysis activity was measured by monitoring the release of free Î³-phosphate (Pi) from ATP in 96-well plates using a high-sensitivity colorimetric ATPase Assay kit (Innova Biosciences, Cambridge, UK) as per manufacturer's recommendations. Activity of the V-ATPase was inhibited by addition of 5 Î¼M Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich) to each microsomal fraction during the reaction. In parallel, replicate microsomal samples without ATP were used to determine non-specific background absorbance. Microsomal fractions from non-transfected cells were used to determine non-specific ATPase activity. Assay samples were incubated with 0.5 mM ATP for 30 min at room temperature, reactions were terminated, and absorbance at 650 nm was measured. Absorbance from replicate samples without ATP was removed from the equivalent sample containing ATP, and the absorbance from non-transfected microsomes was also subtracted from each sample. Microsomal samples were subjected to Western blotting with anti-V5 antibodies and ATP13A2-V5 protein levels were determined by densitometry and used to normalize ATPase activity in each sample. Data represent Pi release from ATP expressed as a percent of WT ATP13A2 activity.</p>
