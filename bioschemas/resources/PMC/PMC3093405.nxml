      <abstract>
        <p>DEAD-box proteins are enzymes endowed with nucleic acid-dependent ATPase, RNA translocase and unwinding activities. The human DEAD-box protein DDX3 has been shown to play important roles in tumor proliferation and viral infections. In particular, DDX3 has been identified as an essential cofactor for HIV-1 replication. Here we characterized a set of DDX3 mutants biochemically with respect to nucleic acid binding, ATPase and helicase activity. In particular, we addressed the functional role of a unique insertion between motifs I and Ia of DDX3 and provide evidence for its implication in nucleic acid binding and HIV-1 replication. We show that human DDX3 lacking this domain binds HIV-1 RNA with lower affinity. Furthermore, a specific peptide ligand for this insertion selected by phage display interferes with HIV-1 replication after transduction into HelaP4 cells. Besides broadening our understanding of the structure-function relationships of this important protein, our results identify a specific domain of DDX3 which may be suited as target for antiviral drugs designed to inhibit cellular cofactors for HIV-1 replication.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The DEAD-box proteins constitute a subfamily of the DExD/H-box RNA helicases within the helicase superfamily 2 <xref rid="pone.0019810-Cordin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. They are named after the amino acid sequence of the Walker B motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (D-E-A-D), which is conserved in all members of the subfamily. The DEAD-box protein family comprises proteins found in all eukaryotes and most prokaryotes. Their widespread conservation is related to their essential roles in almost all aspects of RNA metabolism, from transcription, splicing and decay, to translation <xref rid="pone.0019810-Abdelhaleem1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0019810-Linder1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. DEAD-box proteins are endowed with nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity and some also show ATP-dependent RNA unwinding. While they differ in the amino acid (aa) sequence in their extreme N- and C- terminal parts, they all contain a core helicase domain, which is composed of two covalently linked globular domains (subdomain 1, aa 168â405 and subdomain 2, aa 411â582 in DDX3) each consisting of five Î²-strands and five Î±-helices, connected by a flexible linker (aa 406â410 in DDX3). Based on sequence alignments, nine conserved motifs have been identified in the helicase core of DEAD-box proteins. Motifs I (Walker A), II (Walker B) III and Q of the subdomain 1, together with motifs V and VI of subdomain 2, are directly involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Motifs Ia and Ib of subdomain 1 together with motifs IV, -[QxxR]- and V of subdomain 2 are involved in RNA binding <xref rid="pone.0019810-Cordin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Based on the available crystal structures of several DEAD box helicases showing the spatial arrangements of both domains, also in complex with RNA and nucleotides, a model has been proposed for the coordinated interplay of both subdomains in nucleic acid binding and ATP hydrolysis <xref rid="pone.0019810-Schtz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the absence of bound ATP and nucleic acid, the DEAD-box proteins adopt open conformations, whereby subdomains 1 and 2 are separated from each other. On the other hand, the structures of the Vasa protein from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, human Dbp5 and DDX19, showed a closed conformation, with both subdomains creating an RNA binding surface and contributing to the ATP binding site <xref rid="pone.0019810-Schtz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0019810-vonMoeller1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Binding of ATP has been proposed to facilitate the interaction of the Î±-helix 8 of motif I with a conserved Arg in motif V, creating the RNA-binding competent conformation <xref rid="pone.0019810-Schtz1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The DEAD-box ATPase/RNA helicase DDX3 has recently been in the focus of intense research, owing to its implications in tumor proliferation and viral infections <xref rid="pone.0019810-Ariumi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0019810-Maga1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In particular, DDX3 has been shown as an essential cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication <xref rid="pone.0019810-Yedavalli1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Functional genomic screenings have recently identified about 300 human proteins important for the replicative cycle of HIV-1 <xref rid="pone.0019810-Knig1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Such previously unrecognized complexity of host-pathogen relationships, coupled to the seemingly unavoidable problem of drug resistance due to the high mutation rate of HIV-1, has renewed the long-standing interest toward cellular proteins as novel targets for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The main argument in favor of targeting a host factor instead of a viral protein is the predicted low drug resistance level. On the other hand, interfering with a cellular pathway might lead to serious complications, including crucial cell function loss or oncogenic drift. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify host cellular factors and to characterize the domains that, while essential for virus replication, are dispensable for the host cell metabolism. The protein DDX3 apparently satisfies all the requirements of a potential anti-HIV target, and we have recently shown that small molecule inhibitors of DDX3 ATPase activity can block HIV-1 replication <xref rid="pone.0019810-Maga1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to design even more selective inhibitors of DDX3, a detailed knowledge of its biochemical properties is essential. DDX3 has been shown to have both ATPase and RNA helicase activities and to possess a rather relaxed nucleotide substrate specificity, being able to accept as substrates both ribo- and deoxy-nucleoside triphosphates, as well as different nucleotide analogs <xref rid="pone.0019810-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019810-Franca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019810-Yedavalli2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The core helicase domain (aa 132â605) of human DDX3 is nearly identical to <italic>X. laevis</italic> An3 and <italic>M. musculus</italic> Pl10 proteins and has strong homology to the corresponding domain of the yeast Ded1 and Dbp1 proteins <xref rid="pone.0019810-Tarn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recently, the core domain of human DDX3 has been crystallized in complex with AMP <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the absence of bound RNA, the protein adopts an open conformation. However, by analogy with other DEAD-box protein structures, it has been proposed that also DDX3 would adopt a closed conformation once bound to ATP and RNA.</p>
      <p>Human DDX3 has been reported to have a unique region between motifs I and Ia, which has been proposed to bind the 3â²-end of the RNA substrate <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Such an insertion is also conserved in the closest homologs of DDX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g001">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Sequence alignment analysis, revealed that the length of the amino acid sequence between motifs I and Ia is very similar among different DEAD-box proteins, being about 30 aa in representative human, insect, yeast and archeal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g001">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Among all eukaryotic DEAD-box proteins available in the databases, only three members appear to have longer insertions: DDX3 (42 aa), DDX42 (150 aa) and DDX1, this latter with the longest insertion of 240 aa. Sequence alignment of this region of DDX3 and other DEAD-box proteins, revealed a high degree of identity for the sequences immediately flanking the motifs I and Ia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g001">Fig. 1 C</xref>), while the central part was more variable. Interestingly, the human proteins showed an invariant -[DG]-motif in common with DDX3, while proteins with more distant phylogenetic relationship (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Vasa, <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Hera, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dbp9) lacked such a motif, but showed a -[ExG]- conserved box. The Vasa and Hera proteins also have in common with DDX3 an additional basic amino acid -[ExG<bold>R</bold>]- in this box. DDX3, however, was unique in having an additional positively charged extension -[YG<bold>RRK</bold>]-.</p>

      <p>By using a series of different DDX3 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g001">Fig. 1 D</xref>), we show here that the central 10 residues of the DDX3 insertion (aa 250â259) are important for the ATPase activity, nucleic acid binding and unwinding. We also found that <italic>in vitro</italic> human DDX3 can unwind partially double stranded (ds) DNA substrates with a preference for 5â²-single strand DNA overhangs, a property previously shown only for the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Dbp9 member of the DEAD box proteins <xref rid="pone.0019810-Kikuma1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Finally, we show that the DDX3 unique region of the insertion between motifs I and Ia contributes to HIV-1 RNA binding and, furthermore, that a specific peptide ligand to this region reduces the ability of DDX3 to support HIV-1 replication in infected cells.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our results uncovered novel unique features of human DDX3, which might be used to design novel selective anti-HIV agents.</p>

        <title>Construction, purification and ATPase activity determination of human DDX3 mutants</title>
        <p>To study the role of the DDX3 specific insertion between motifs I and Ia, a deletion mutant, DDX3ÎINS, lacking aa 250â259 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g001">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) was constructed, starting from the cDNA for full length human DDX3. We also produced the N-DDX3 mutant lacking the C-terminus (Î428â662) and consisting of the entire subdomain 1 plus the linker domain and the double deletion mutant I-DDX3 (Î1â159/Î428â662), corresponding to the helicase core of subdomain 1. Isolated domain 1 from different DEAD-box helicases has been successfully crystallized, indicating that the two domains can properly fold individually. Moreover, a multiple construct approach applied to DDX3 has previously shown that constructs lacking the first 169 aa were perfectly expressed as soluble proteins <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, the single point mutant K230E, bearing a substitution in motif I (Walker A); and the double mutant DADA (D346A/D349A), bearing a double mutation in motif II (Walker B) were also constructed. The residues mutated in these proteins are known to be essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis <xref rid="pone.0019810-Sengoku1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019810-Yedavalli1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which allowed us to include these loss-of-function mutants as controls to rule out the presence of any possible contaminating ATPase activity, as well as ATP-independent DNA unwinding activities. We also cloned the full length human DEAD-box protein DDX1, bearing the largest known insertion between motifs I and Ia. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned into the pTRcHis expression vector and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as N-terminal his-tagged fusion proteins. The recombinant proteins were soluble and purified through four subsequent chromatographic steps, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, involving affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA), anion- (MonoQ) and cation- (MonoS) exchange chromatography and hydroxyapatite (HAP) column.</p>
        <p>As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g002">Fig. 2 A</xref> shows the eluted peak fractions of DDX3wt from the last column (HAP). The protein in the fractions was recognized by specific anti-human DDX3 polyclonal Abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g002">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Fractions 20â26 (indicated with asterisks) were pooled and used for the experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g002">Fig. 2 C</xref> shows the SDS-PAGE of all the other DDX3 proteins after purification. Next, the intrinsic ability of all the purified proteins to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of nucleic acid was tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g002">Fig. 2 D</xref>, the mutants lacking fully functional Walker A (K230E, lane 6) or Walker B (DADA, lane 5) motifs were catalytically inactive as expected. The DDX3wt and DDX3ÎINS mutant, on the other hand, displayed detectable ATPase activity (lanes 2 and 4). Surprisingly, the isolated subdomain 1 of DDX3, either full (N-DDX3, lane 3) or lacking the first 160 aa (I-DDX3, lane 7) also displayed low but detectable ATPase activity. To verify that ATP hydrolysis was catalyzed by the truncated mutants, and not due to a contaminant, we tested the sensitivity of the N-DDX3 mutant towards FE15, a specific inhibitor of DDX3 ATPase previously developed in our laboratory <xref rid="pone.0019810-Maga1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g002">Fig. 2 E and F</xref>, ATP hydrolysis of both DDX3wt and the N-DDX3 mutant was inhibited by the compound FE15 with similar potency. To verify whether the introduced deletion could significantly alter the folding of the DDX3ÎINS mutant, thermal inactivation experiments were carried out. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g002">Fig. 2 G and H</xref>, DDX3ÎINS was about 2- fold more resistant to thermal inactivation than the wild type protein, as suggested by the time-dependent activity decay at 70Â°C. These results indicate that the specific 10 aa insertion of DDX3 likely plays a structural role, but is not essential for the intrinsic ATPase activity of the protein.</p>

          <title>The DDX3 insertion between motifs I and Ia is required for stimulation of ATPase activity by DNA and RNA</title>
          <p>We have previously shown that the ATPase activity of wild type human DDX3 could be stimulated to a similar extent by a variety of different hetero- and homopolymeric nucleic acids (NA), irrespectively of their sequence or base composition, the main difference being the nature of the ribose sugar (RNA vs. DNA) <xref rid="pone.0019810-Franca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, we compared the ability of NA (both DNA and RNA) to stimulate the ATPase activity of the different DDX3 proteins. Addition of single strand (ss) RNA or DNA in the presence of DDX3wt clearly stimulated ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 AâC</xref>). The calculated kinetic parameters are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref>. DDX3 showed a higher apparent affinity for ATP (lower K<sub>m</sub>) as compared to that of most DEAD-box proteins <xref rid="pone.0019810-Cordin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) of DDX3wt was increased 2.8- and 3.2- fold by RNA and DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 H</xref>). The comparable stimulation of DDX3 ATPase by RNA and DNA was uncommon, since most DEAD-box proteins analyzed to date showed a preference for RNA <italic>vs.</italic> DNA as a cofactor of their ATPase activity <xref rid="pone.0019810-Cordin1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The DDX3ÎINS mutant (lacking aa 250â259), showed a lower affinity for ATP than DDX3wt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref>), while its catalytic rate was similar. In order to assess whether the K<sub>m</sub> value determined from the variation of ATP hydrolysis rate as a function of substrate concentration, truly reflected a difference in ATP binding, we measured the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of ATP for DDX3wt and DDX3ÎINS, in the absence of catalysis, by directly UV-crosslinking [Î±<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP to the enzyme active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 F</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref>, the K<sub>D</sub> value for ATP was 2.8- fold higher for the DDX3ÎINS mutant than for DDX3wt, confirming a lower binding affinity of ATP for this mutant. The stimulation of the basal ATPase activity (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) of this mutant by both RNA and DNA was lower than with the wt enzyme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 H</xref>), being less than 2- fold. These data suggest a possible role of the deleted domain in mediating the interaction with NA and with ATP, likely keeping the Walker A and B motifs correctly aligned for ATP binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 E</xref>, increasing the DDX3ÎINS concentration from 0.15 ÂµM to 0.5 ÂµM did not result in better stimulation by either DNA or RNA. The N- and I-DDX3 mutants (lacking the entire subdomain 2), on the other hand, showed no stimulation of the ATPase activity in the presence of both NA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g003">Fig. 3 F</xref>). As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref>, the N- and I-DDX3 mutants also showed 3- to 9- fold reduced catalytic efficiency for ATP hydrolysis with respect to DDX3wt in the absence of NA. These data indicate that the isolated DDX3 subdomain 1 still retains a very low basal ATPase activity, while the presence of both subdomains is essential for full catalytic efficiency and stimulation by NA.</p>

          <p>We also compared the ability of nucleic acids to stimulate the ATPase activity of the human DDX1 protein, that bears a long insertion (250 aa) between motifs I and Ia, but shows no similarity within this region with the equivalent region of DDX3. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t001">Table 1</xref>, the catalytic efficiency of DDX1 was stimulated 2.6- fold by RNA, but only 1.3- fold by DNA, as typically observed for DEAD-box proteins. Thus, the high degree of stimulation by DNA observed with DDX3 was not simply due to a wider distance between motifs I and Ia with respect to the majority of DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g001">Fig. 1 B</xref>), but rather to sequence/structure-specific determinants.</p>

          <p>In order to better characterize the ability of DNA to stimulate the ATPase activity of DDX3, the ATP hydrolysis rate was measured in the presence of increasing ssDNA concentrations. A typical experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 A</xref>. Dose-response curves were generated by measuring the variation of the reaction velocity as a function of increasing ssDNA concentrations, in the presence of a fixed amount of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 B</xref>). For each data point, the corresponding relative -fold increase values (1âv<sub>DNA</sub>/v) were plotted as a function of the nucleic acid concentrations and fitted to a hyperbolic relationship (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 B</xref>, the DDX3ÎINS mutant protein showed a significant reduction (3.2- fold) in the maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity by ssDNA, with respect to DDX3wt.</p>

          <p>Next, the ATPase reaction of DDX3wt and the DDX3ÎINS mutant proteins was monitored at different time points in the absence or presence of both nucleic acids (NA) ssRNA and ssDNA. The corresponding progress curves were fitted to a mixed exponential equation (as detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) as a function of time. This analysis allowed to estimate three parameters: the burst amplitude (A<sub>burst</sub>), which is proportional to the amount (expressed as a concentration) of the enzyme-substrates E:(NA):ATP complex formed at the beginning of the reaction; the burst rate (<italic>k</italic>
<sub>burst</sub>) which represents the global rate of conversion of the E:(NA):ATP complex into the E:ADP complex and the steady-state rate (<italic>k</italic>
<sub>ss</sub>), which is the limiting rate of the reaction at equilibrium (likely Pi release and NA dissociation). Thus, the effects of nucleic acids addition on the early steps of the reaction can be estimated by the variations of A<sub>burst</sub> and <italic>k</italic>
<sub>burst</sub> values. Progress curves for DDX3wt and DDX3ÎINS are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 C and D</xref>. The calculated values are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t002">Table 2</xref>. Addition of RNA or DNA caused a 3- to 3.6- fold increase in A<sub>burst</sub> values for DDX3wt. On the contrary, both RNA and DNA caused a smaller increase in the burst amplitude of the DDX3ÎINS mutant (1.8- to 2- fold increase). The <italic>k</italic>
<sub>burst</sub> of DDX3wt was also increased by nucleic acid addition (1.7- to 2.3-fold increase), while no effect on the <italic>k</italic>
<sub>burst</sub> for DDX3ÎINS was observed in the presence of DNA or RNA. The N- and I-DDX3 mutants showed reduced A<sub>burst</sub> and <italic>k</italic>
<sub>burst</sub> values for ATP hydrolysis, with respect to wild type DDX3 in the absence of nucleic acids, indicating that the subdomain 1 alone was severely impaired both in binding and in hydrolysis of ATP. This is consistent with the important roles that residues in motifs V and VI are known to play in the formation of the ATP binding site. Neither DNA nor RNA had any effect on both A<sub>burst</sub> and <italic>k</italic>

          <p>Collectively, these results indicate that deletion of the specific DDX3 insert between motifs I and Ia reduced the formation of the enzyme-NA complex. In contrast, lack of the C-terminal subdomain 2 completely abrogated NA interaction.</p>
          <p>From the curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 B</xref>, the apparent affinity (K<sub>app</sub>) value for ssDNA was 3.3- fold higher for DDXÎINS compared to DDX3wt, suggestive of a reduced affinity for the nucleic acid. This K<sub>app</sub> value, however, has been derived as a function of the ATP hydrolysis rate, thus being related to the concentration of ternary enzyme-DNA-ATP complex that has reacted with ATP and not directly to the enzyme-DNA binary complex formed. To further verify that the DDX3ÎINS had a reduced binding affinity for nucleic acids also in the absence of catalysis, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed, in the presence of various amounts of DDX3wt or DDX3ÎINS and a fixed dose of a 5â²-labelled ssRNA or ssDNA oligonucleotides. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 E and F</xref>, the DDX3ÎINS was less efficient in binding RNA and DNA, respectively, with respect to DDX3wt, as judged by the lower amount of enzyme-NA complex formed (compare lanes 2â5 with lanes 6â9 in both panels E and F). Since DDX3 is also a helicase (see also below), dsRNA or DNA is also a physiological substrate. Thus, nitrocellulose filter-binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 G</xref>) were performed to measure the affinity of DDX3wt and DDX3ÎINS to dsDNA, in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 H</xref>, the DDX3ÎINS mutant showed a 2.1- fold reduced affinity for dsDNA, in agreement with the proposed role of the specific DDX3 insert in NA interaction.</p>

        <title>The human DDX3 specific insert is important for the RNA helicase activity</title>
        <p>Human DDX3 was shown to possess an ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity <xref rid="pone.0019810-Maga1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019810-Yedavalli1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019810-Franca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The ability of the different DDX3 mutants to unwind a double-strand (ds) RNA heteropolymeric template was therefore compared. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g005">Fig. 5 A</xref>, DDX3wt (lanes 1â6) showed more efficient RNA helicase activity than the DDX3ÎINS mutant (lanes 9â14). The previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggested that this mutant had an impaired RNA binding. To test whether this reduced affinity for RNA was the cause of the reduced helicase activity, the same experiments were performed under single-turnover conditions, i.e. in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabelled ssRNA as a trap. Under these conditions, as soon as the enzyme dissociates from the duplex substrate, it should be sequestered by the competitor RNA preventing rebinding to the labelled substrate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g005">Fig. 5 B</xref>, while DDX3wt (lanes 1â6) was still able to unwind the RNA duplex in the presence of the trap, the activity of the DDX3ÎINS mutant (lanes 9â14) was almost completely inhibited in the presence of the competitor RNA. This suggests that the complex between this mutant and the RNA duplex had a significantly reduced half-life with respect to the wt enzyme, becoming sequestered by the competitor ssRNA before it could initiate the unwinding reaction. The corresponding progress curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g005">Fig. 5 C</xref> and the calculated apparent rates of unwinding (<italic>k<sub>uw</sub></italic>) are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t003">Table 3</xref>. Addition of the trap reduced the unwinding rate of DDX3wt by about 2- fold, suggesting that under distributive conditions (i.e. without trap) DDX3wt required two binding events in order to fully displace the 18mer strand from the complementary 36mer. In the absence of the trap, the DDX3ÎINS mutant showed a 2- fold reduced unwinding rate with respect to DDX3wt, while addition of the trap caused a 10-fold reduction in the unwinding rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019810-t003">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the DDX3ÎINS mutant was significantly impaired in its RNA unwinding activity. As expected, the isolated subdomain 1 (N- or I-DDX3) did not show helicase activity (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that both subdomains are required for helicase activity and that the DDX3 insertion between motifs I and Ia is important for interaction with RNA.</p>

          <title>Human DDX3 can unwind partially double-stranded DNA with 5â²-single strand overhangs</title>
          <p>The ability of the human DDX3 ATPase to be significantly stimulated by DNA prompted us to investigate whether the enzyme was able to unwind ds DNA substrates. To this aim, we employed three pairs of partially complementary DNA oligonucleotides, to generate partially dsDNA substrates with either 5â²- or a 3â²- protruding ss ends, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The shorter oligo was 5â²-labelled with a fluorescent group (FAM). Helicase reactions were carried out in the presence of ATP and the products resolved on non-denaturing PAGE. Human DDX3wt was able to unwind a DNA duplex carrying both 5â²- and 3â²-protruding ssDNA ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 A</xref>, lanes 1â5) or with a single 5â²-protruding end (lanes 11â15), but not the substrate with a 3â²-ss DNA region (lanes 6â10). As expected, mutants lacking ATPase activity (K230E and DADA) or DNA binding (N- and I-DDX3) were found to be inactive also as DNA helicases (data not shown). The mutant DDX3ÎINS showed DNA helicase activity, but much lower than DDX3wt (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 A</xref>, lanes 3â5, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lanes 7â9), consistent with its reduced affinity for DNA (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Human DDX1, similarly to most DEAD-box helicases, did not display DNA unwinding capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lanes 3â5). Taken together, these data suggest that lack of the specific DDX3 insert (aa 250â259) causes a reduction in DNA unwinding, while the mere presence of a long insertion between motifs I and Ia (as is the case for DDX1) did not suffice to confer DNA helicase activity.</p>

          <title>The DDX3 specific insertion is important for the function of DDX3 as a cofactor of HIV-1 replication</title>
          <p>A role for DDX3 in the export of HIV-1 unspliced RNA, in cooperation with the vial protein Rev and the cellular protein XPO1/CRM1 has been proposed <xref rid="pone.0019810-Yedavalli1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In order to analyze the effect of the DDX3 specific insertion in view of this role of DDX3 as cellular cofactor for HIV-1 replication, we first performed HIV-1 RNA pulldown experiments, using viral genomic RNA prepared from HIV-1 virions with equal amounts of purified DDX3wt and DDX3ÎINS proteins.

          <p>To further analyze the role of the DDX3 insertion in the context of HIV-1 replication, we selected peptide ligands for the DDX3 insertion from phage displayed random peptide libraries. Interestingly, one of the selected peptides, DDX3-INS1, showed amino acid homologies to XPO1/CRM1, a natural binding partner of DDX3 that is involved in the export of unspliced HIV-1 RNA in conjunction with the viral Rev protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g007">Fig. 7 B</xref>). We therefore analyzed this peptide further, with respect to functional interference with HIV-1 replication. After fusion to a protein transduction domain, different amounts of the DDX3-INS1 peptide or a control peptide were transduced into HelaP4 cells 24 hours after infection with HIV-1Lai. HIV-1 infection was quantified 48â72 hours after infection by titering released HIV-1 in culture supernatants on Tzm-bl cells based on measuring the luciferase activity in the cell lysates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>, the DDX3-INS1 peptide reduces HIV-1 replication about 50% at 20 ÂµM in contrast to the control peptide. The DDX3-INS1 peptide was not toxic for the cells in the concentration range used (data not shown). Thus, binding of the peptide ligand to the DDX3 insertion, interferes with HIV-1 replication further providing evidence of an important functional role of the DDX3 insertion not only for enzymatic functions, but also for HIV-1 replication.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Human DDX3 was co-crystallized with AMP in the absence of nucleic acid and thus the available structure represents the âopenâ conformation of the protein, as opposed to the âclosedâ conformation observed for other DEAD box proteins in complex with RNA, which involves repositioning of subdomains 1 and 2 relative to each other to accommodate both RNA and ATP substrates <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This fact, together with the presence of AMP and not ATP in the binding site of DDX3, did not allow to establish a role of domains V and VI in mediating the interactions with the Î²- and Î³- phosphates of the nucleotide as seen in the RNA-bound structures of the VASA protein of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0019810-Sengoku1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> or the human Dbp5 <xref rid="pone.0019810-vonMoeller1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our results showed that the isolated subdomain 1 alone (mutant N-DDX3 aa 1â427) of human DDX3 possesses a low but detectable intrinsic (i.e., nucleic acid-independent) ATPase activity. This finding is apparently in contrast with the reported lack of ATPase activity of the entire DDX3 helicase core (aa 168â582) used for crystallization <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It is possible that the isolated subdomain 1 might fold more easily into a catalytically active globular domain.</p>
      <p>On the basis of the structures of Vasa and Dbp5 <xref rid="pone.0019810-Sengoku1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019810-vonMoeller1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, it has been proposed that a conserved aromatic residue (F or Y) of motif VI (-GR<bold>F</bold>/<bold>Y</bold>G-) stacks on the purine ring of adenosine, thus contributing to its binding. Sequence alignment showed that this residue is not conserved in DDX3, where it is replaced by a valine (-GR<bold>V</bold>G-). On the other hand, the conserved aromatic residue of the Q-motif, which stacks also on top of the purine ring, is conserved in DDX3 (Y201). A metal ion is coordinated to the Î²- and Î³- phosphates of ATP, through essential water molecules which are contacted by the invariant aspartic acid of Walker B and a glycine residue of motif VI. Both these residues are also conserved in DDX3 and, based on the overall high homology between the conserved motifs of Vasa and DDX3, they have been proposed to play a similar role as seen in Vasa <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Other specific contacts of subdomain 2 include the ribose (motif V) and the triphosphate moiety (motif VI) of ATP. However, the structures of Vasa and Dbp5 clearly indicated that the majority of the interactions, including those occurring with the water molecules, are mediated by residues of motifs Q, I, II and III, all confined in the N-terminal subdomain 1. Since a structure for DDX3 in its closed conformation is lacking, it is possible that the DDX3 subdomain 1 alone might adopt a folding, which enables stable nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, even though at a very low rate when compared to the wild type protein, as indicated by our data. Our results clearly indicate an essential contribution of subdomain 2 in increasing the intrinsic ATPase activity as well as in mediating nucleic acid binding and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, as seen in all known DEAD-box proteins.</p>
      <p>Both the ATPase and nucleic acid binding activities of the DEAD-box proteins are functionally connected to their helicase activity. In this respect, DEAD-box proteins are considered to behave more as ATP-dependent RNA binding proteins, than classical helicases, since ATP binding/hydrolysis does not generate energy for translocation, but rather drives the conformational changes required to destabilize the double helix <xref rid="pone.0019810-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0019810-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Based on the DDX3 crystal structure, it has been proposed that the specific insertion (aa 250â259) seen in DDX3 between motifs I and Ia could contribute to nucleic acid binding, together with the adjacent unique basic motif [-RYGRRK-] <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We have experimentally proven this hypothesis by showing that the DDX3 mutant lacking this particular insertion has a seriously compromised RNA and DNA ATPase stimulation and unwinding activity. In addition, the deleted insertion likely plays some structural role in defining the architecture of the ATP binding site, since the DDX3ÎINS mutant displayed reduced ATP binding with respect to DDX3 full length.</p>
      <p>We found that human DDX3, contrary to most DEAD-box helicases, can unwind partially dsDNA substrates with a preference for DNA substrates containing a 5â²-single stranded overhang. DNA unwinding by a DEAD-box protein has been shown so far only for the Dpb9 protein of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0019810-Kikuma1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The strong preference for RNA by DEAD-box proteins has been ascribed to four specific ribose 2â²-OH contacts, mediated by five amino acids in motifs Ia, Ib and IV, as seen in the Vasa crystal structure. Sequence alignment of human DDX3, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Dpb9, human DDX1, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Vasa and human Dbp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 C</xref>), showed that the residues in motif Ia and Ib are conserved in all proteins, irrespectively of their RNA vs. DNA preference, while the glutamic acid residue of motif IV is present only in DDX3 and Vasa. Thus, it seems that the presence of these residues did not suffice to confer an absolute preference for RNA <italic>vs</italic> DNA to DEAD box proteins. A model of DDX3 in the closed conformation bound to RNA, based on the Vasa-RNA complex structure, suggested that the specific DDX3 insertion between motifs I and Ia, contributes to generate a positively charged cavity in the close proximity of the 3â²-end of the bound nucleic acid <xref rid="pone.0019810-Hogbom1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The 5â²-strand loading preference observed for DDX3 DNA unwinding implies that the annealed strand is displaced starting from its 3â²-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">Fig. 6 A</xref>). It is then tempting to speculate that the unique DDX3 insertion might partially contribute to the 5â²-end loading preference of DDX3. It is interesting to note that the human protein DDX1, which bears a very large insertion (250 aa) between motifs I and Ia, has a clear preference for RNA as an activator for its ATPase and does not show DNA helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g004">Fig. 4 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g006">6 B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we could experimentally prove that the DDX3 insertion functionally contributes to the cofactor activity of DDX3 with respect to HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). First, lack of the insertion in DDX3ÎINS reproducibly resulted in reduced pull down of HIV-1 genomic RNA compared to DDX3wt as detected by RT-PCR. Second, a specific peptide ligand, selected from phage display libraries with a DDX3-derived peptide containing the insertion, was shown to interfere with replication of HIV-1 Lai in HelaP4 cells. Interestingly, the selected peptide showed extensive homology to XPO1/CRM1, a natural binding partner of DDX3 involved in nuclear export of unspliced HIV RNAs in conjunction with Rev. It is possible that, by binding to the insertion between domains I and Ia of DDX3, the peptide prevented the correct assembly of the DDX3/CRM1/Rev/HIV-RNA complex, required for nuclear export. Additional experiments with optimized peptides have to further elucidate if, indeed, interference with viral replication occurs at the level of RNA export from the nucleus. In fact, a recent study revealed a role of DDX3 also in the translation of HIV-1 proteins <xref rid="pone.0019810-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have provided evidence for a role of the unique motif located in the DDX3 N-terminal subdomain 1 in ATPase activity, nucleic acid binding and HIV-1 cofactor activity of DDX3. Given the interest of DDX3 as a possible target for antiviral chemotherapy, the design of small molecules specifically interacting with this DDX3 unique motif might be considered.</p>

PCR conditions for all mutants were: 2â² at 95Â°C followed by 30 cycles of 40â³ at 95Â°C, 1â² at 55Â°C, 1â²30â³ at 72Â°C and a final elongation of 10 min at 72Â°C. The K230E DDX3, with a substitution of the lysine at the position 230 with a glutamic acid, and the DADA DDX3 mutant, with a substitution of the two aspartic acids at positions 328 and 231 for alanines, were purchased from Bio-Fab Research (Rome). All cDNAs were sequenced for confirmation and cloned into the pTrcHisA vector, resulting in the desired protein fused to an N-terminal peptide of â¼3 kDa (comprising the 6ÃHis tag) and seven additional amino acids (KQGCFGG) at the COOH-terminal part.</p>

        <title>Expression and purification of the recombinant proteins</title>
        <p>All clones were expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> competent cells BL-21 Select<sup>96</sup> (Promega). Small-scale expression experiments were carried out to select the optimal conditions for solubility of the expressed proteins. Cells were grown at 37Â°C in Luria Broth (LB) to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4. Isopropyl Î²-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and growth continued for 5 hours at 37Â°C. Recombinant proteins were purified through four different chromatographic steps. Cells were lysed for 45â² on ice adding 2.5 volumes per gram of pellet of Buffer A (0.1 M NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.01 M TrisHCl pH 8, 0.01%, 5 mM NP-40 Imidazole) in the presence of lysozyme (1 mg/ml), protease inhibitors (1â¶10000 dilution, Sigma) and 1 mM PMSF. The lysate was sonicated 5 times for 10â³ and the suspension was centrifugated at 30000Ã g for 1 h15â² at 4Â°C. The supernatant was applied to an affinity FPLC-NiNTA-column, equilibrated with Buffer B (5 mM TrisHCl 2 pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole, 5% Glycerol). Proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient (0.005â0.5 M Imidazole) in Buffer B. The presence of the recombinant protein in the collected fractions was checked by staining (Coomassie Blue) and Western blotting with specific anti-DDX3 antibodies (A300â474A and A300â475A, Bethyl) that recognized an epitope at N-terminal domain between residues 1 and 50 and at the C-terminal domain between residues 550 and 600, respectively. For the I-DDX3 mutants we have used anti-His tag polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling TECHNOLOGYÂ®). Positive fractions were collected and dialyzed against Buffer C (25 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.5 mM L-Dithiothreitol (DTT)) at 4Â°C. Dialyzed fractions were applied to an anion-exchange Mono Q column previously equilibrated with Buffer C and eluted with a linear gradient (0.01â1 M NaCl) in Buffer C containing 1 M NaCl. After SDS-PAGE and Western blot, positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer D (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 5%Glycerol). Dialyzed fractions were applied to a cation-exchange chromatography (MonoS) column equilibrated with Buffer D and proteins bound were eluted with a linear gradient (0.01â0.5 M KCl) in Buffer D containing 500 mM of KCl. Positive fractions were collected and dialyzed against Buffer C. Dialyzed fractions were applied to a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in Buffer C. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0â0.7 M KPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.5) in Buffer C containing 0.7 M KPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.5.

For the RNA helicase assay, a 18/36mer ds RNA oligonucleotide with both 3â² and 5â²-protruding ss ends was used. For the DNA helicase assay, three different dsDNA substrates were used, all of them composed of the same 18mer oligonucleotide 5â²-FAM labelled and three different 38 mer oligonucleotides with the sequence complementary to the 18 mer at different positions. Annealing of the 18 mer to each of the 38 mer generated the different DNA substrates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019810-g005">Fig. 5 A</xref>.

        <title>Kinetic analysis</title>
        <p>ATPase reactions were performed as described, in the presence of increasing amounts of nucleic acids and variable ATP concentrations. Variations of the initial velocities of the reaction as a function of ATP concentrations in the absence or presence of nucleic acids were analyzed with the equation:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0019810.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic>

The relative -fold increase in the ATPase velocities 1â(v<sub>DNA</sub>/v) as a function of the nucleic acid concentrations was fitted to the hyperbolic relationship:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0019810.e002.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where v<sub>NA</sub> is the apparent velocity of the reaction in the presence of nucleic acid, v is the velocity in its absence, K<sub>D</sub> is the apparent affinity for the nucleic acid and [NA] is the concentration of the nucleic acid substrate. The symbol K<sub>D</sub> is used, instead of K<sub>m</sub>, solely to reflect the fact that the NA is not a reactant (i.e. it is not converted into products) but only a cofactor of the reaction, without implying any assumption on the nature of the microscopic rates contributing to the K<sub>D</sub> value itself.</p>
        <p>Variation of the ATPase reaction as a function of time was fitted to the mixed-exponential equation:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0019810.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where [P] is the concentration of products (pmols) at any given time point, <italic>t</italic> is time, A<sub>burst</sub> is the burst amplitude, <italic>k</italic>

<sub>ss</sub> is the rate of the steady-state linear phase. The burst amplitude reflects the amount of enzyme-substrate complex reacting in the exponential phase, hence it has the dimension of a concentration. The burst rate is the combined rate of product formation (Pi) and release during the exponential phase, hence the dimensions of a rate constant (s<sup>â1</sup>).</p>
        <p>Variation of the amount of unwound RNA substrate as a function of time was fitted to a simple exponential equation:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0019810.e004.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where MAX is the the amount of unwound substrate extrapolated at infinite time, <italic>k<sub>uw</sub></italic> is the apparent rate of unwinding.</p>

Peptides (1 Âµg) were coated on TALON beads over night at 4Â°C. After 6 washes (PBS/0.25% gelatine/0.1%Tween20), 10 Âµl of each of the original phage libraries were added to the beads and rotated over night at 4Â°C. After extensive washing, bound phages were eluted by pH shift (0.2 M glycine/HCl, pH 2.2), neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1) and used for negative selection as described above. Phage in supernatants after negative selection were amplified in E. coli ER2738, precipitated over night and used for two additional selection rounds.
