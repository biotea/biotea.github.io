      <abstract>
        <p>CREB3L1 (cAMP response element binding protein 3-like 1), a transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor and activated through Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP), is essential for collagen production by osteoblasts during bone development. Here, we show that TGF-Î² (transforming growth factor-Î²), a cytokine known to stimulate production of collagen during wound healing and fibrotic diseases, induces proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 in human A549 cells. This activation results from inhibition of expression of TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L6 family member 20), which normally inhibits RIP of CREB3L1. Cleavage of CREB3L1 releases its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain from membranes, allowing it to enter the nucleus where it binds to Smad4 to activate transcription of genes encoding proteins required for assembly of collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Our findings raise the possibility that inhibition of RIP of CREB3L1 could prevent excess deposition of collagen in certain fibrotic diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Recent studies have identified cAMP response element binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3L1) as a transcription factor that activates genes involved in assembly of the collagen-containing extracellular matrix <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0108528-Denard2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In a pioneering study, Murakami et al. showed that mice lacking CREB3L1 (also called OASIS) developed abnormal bones owing to a deficiency of the collagen extracellular matrix production by osteoblasts <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. CREB3L1 belongs to a family of transcription factors synthesized as transmembrane precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activated through a process designated as Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP) <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. CREB3L1 contains a single transmembrane helix with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal transcription factor domain projecting into the cytosol and a COOH-terminal domain projecting into the lumen of the ER. Upon stimulation, CREB3L1 undergoes two sequential cleavages catalyzed by two Golgi-localized proteases: Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P). These cleavages release the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of the protein from membranes, allowing it to enter the nucleus where it drives transcription of genes required for assembly of the collagen extracellular matrix <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0108528-Denard2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Murakami <italic>et al</italic> identified bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) as a stimulator for RIP of CREB3L1, and they showed that CREB3L1 activates transcription of genes required for assembly of collagen matrix, including <italic>collagen 1Î±1</italic> (<italic>COL1A1</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), a cytokine homologous to BMP2, also activates COL1A1 synthesis <xref rid="pone.0108528-Leask1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Loeys1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. TGF-Î² signals by binding to its cell surface receptor, a serine kinase that phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, each of which forms complexes with Smad4 <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These complexes activate target genes including those required for assembly of collagen extracellular matrix <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Burch1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This mechanism, however, only accounts for acute induction of collagen synthesis by TGF-Î², because the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 decline within a few hours even in the presence of the cytokine <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Yet the collagen-stimulating effects of TGF-Î² persist for days <xref rid="pone.0108528-Leask1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Verrecchia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The mechanism through which TGF-Î² induces chronic accumulation of collagen has yet to be identified.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Smad-dependent pathway, TGF-Î² also activates Smad-independent non-canonical pathways, which include activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) <xref rid="pone.0108528-Derynck1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. ERK activation has been reported to play a critical role in TGF-Î²-induced pathological events <xref rid="pone.0108528-Holm1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the contribution of ERK activation to TGF-Î²-induced collagen synthesis has yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>In the current study, we determine that TGF-Î² stimulates RIP of CREB3L1, and this proteolytic activation is required for prolonged activation of genes involved in assembly of the collagen extracellular matrix. We show further that transmembrane 4 L6 family member 20 (TM4SF20), a membrane protein without a previously identified function, inhibits RIP of CREB3L1. We provide evidence that TGF-Î² stimulates cleavage of CREB3L1 by inhibiting expression of TM4SF20 through an ERK-dependent pathway.</p>

        <p>We then determined the relationship between signal transduction mediated by Smad proteins and RIP of CREB3L1. For this purpose, we transfected cells with two duplexes of siRNA targeting different regions of Smad4, the common Smad protein that is required for both Smad2 and Smad3 to regulate transcription of their target genes <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

A likely explanation for the observation is that Smad4 could bind to nuclear CREB3L1 to serve as a transcriptional co-activator to stimulate transcription of genes activated by nuclear CREB3L1. To test this hypothesis, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment to determine whether Smad4 forms a complex with nuclear CREB3L1. We immunoprecipitated nuclear CREB3L1 with an antibody against the protein. Nearly all nuclear CREB3L1 was precipitated by this antibody because the protein was depleted from the supernatant fraction of the immunoprecipitation carried out by anti-CREB3L1 but not a control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108528-g003">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic>

        <p>We then determined the mechanism through which TGF-Î² induces RIP of CREB3L1. Previous studies showed that ER stress triggered RIP of CREB3L1 <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Nevertheless, mass spectroscopy analysis indicated that TGF-Î² did not enhance production of ceramide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108528.s001">Fig. S1</xref>

        <p>Since it took 12 h for TGF-Î² to induce significant cleavage of CREB3L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108528-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic>
</xref>), we suspected that TGF-Î² may induce RIP of CREB3L1 by regulating expression of certain genes. Microarray analysis revealed that TGF-Î² altered expression of 25 genes by more than 5 folds during this period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108528.s002">Table S1</xref>). Since proteins regulating cleavage of SREBPs, the best studied RIP substrates, are all transmembrane proteins <xref rid="pone.0108528-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, we hypothesized that the protein regulating cleavage of CREB3L1 may be a transmembrane protein as well. Among the 25 genes in the list, 5 of them encoded proteins known or predicted to be transmembrane proteins according to the gene database in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108528.s002">Table S1</xref>). Among these proteins, claudin 4 (CLDN4), cholinergic receptor nicotinic Î±9 (CHRNA9), and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 19 (ADAM19) are known to be located and functioning in plasma membranes <xref rid="pone.0108528-Tsukita1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0108528-Qi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Since previous studies demonstrated that membrane proteins localized in the ER and Golgi regulated RIP mediated by S1P and S2P <xref rid="pone.0108528-Brown2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, we believe that these plasma membrane proteins are unlikely to be involved in regulating RIP of CREB3L1. We thus focused our attention on the remaining 2 genes, namely leucine rich repeat containing 8 family member C (LRRC8C) and TM4SF20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108528.s002">Table S1</xref>). Inasmuch as TGF-Î²-induced cleavage of CREB3L1 is Smad4-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108528-g003">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic>
</xref>), we reasoned that Smad4 should also not be required for TGF-Î² to alter expression of genes encoding proteins regulating cleavage of CREB3L1. While knocking down Smad4 significantly inhibited activation of LRRC8C expression by TGF-Î² (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108528.s001">Fig. S1</xref>

The results shown above suggest that TM4SF20 may act as an inhibitor for RIP of CREB3L1.

      <p>The results presented above support the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108528-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. In the absence of TGF-Î², Smad2 and Smad3 are inactive, and proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 is blocked by TM4SF20. Thus, transcription of genes involved in assembly of the collagen extracellular matrix is not induced. Immediately after exposure of cells to TGF-Î², Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by phosphorylation, and they form a complex with Smad4 to activate transcription of genes required for assembly of collagen matrix. TGF-Î² also activates ERKs through phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting <italic>TM4SF20</italic> expression. Chronic exposure of the cells to TGF-Î² leads to deactivation of Smad2 and Smad3, as phosphorylation of these proteins is short-lived. In contrast, phosphorylation of ERKs is a long-lasting event that leads to prolonged inhibition of <italic>TM4SF20</italic> expression. Owing to depletion of TM4SF20, RIP of CREB3L1 proceeds and this cleavage releases the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of CREB3L1 from membranes, allowing it to enter the nucleus where it binds to Smad4 to maintain the activation of transcription of genes required for synthesis of extracellular collagen matrix.</p>

          <title>A model illustrating the role of CREB3L1 in TGF-Î²-induced collagen synthesis.</title>
          <p>In the absence of TGF-Î², Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are not phosphorylated. RIP of CREB3L1 is blocked by TM4SF20. In the absence of activation of these transcription factors, expression of collagen is not induced. Acute exposure of cells to TGF-Î² results in heterodimerization of two TGF-Î² receptors, namely TGFÎ²RI and TGFÎ²RII. Consequently, Smad2/3 are phosphorylated by the activated receptor, allowing them to form a complex with Smad4 to drive transcription of collagen. TGF-Î² treatment also leads to phosphorylation of ERKs, which in turn inhibit transcription of TM4SF20. In cells chronically exposed to TGF-Î², the amount of phosphorylated Smad2/3 is drastically reduced. Owing to depletion of TM4SF20, CREB3L1 is cleaved by S1P and S2P. This cleavage releases the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of CREB3L1 from membranes, allowing it to form a complex with Smad4 to continue activating transcription of collagen.</p>

      <p>The current study was motivated by an earlier observation that BMP2 stimulates RIP of CREB3L1 to produce collagen in osteoblasts <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although BMP2 and TGF-Î² belong to the same family of cytokines that signal through Smad proteins <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, the mechanism through which these cytokines induce RIP of CREB3L1 may not be the same: Unlike TGF-Î², BMP2 appears to induce cleavage of CREB3L1 through ER stress <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. BMP2 also takes a much longer time (â¼7 days) <xref rid="pone.0108528-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> to induce cleavage of CREB3L1 than that required for TGF-Î² to induce the same cleavage (â¼12 h).</p>
      <p>In contrast to the well-established canonical TGF-Î² signaling pathway mediated by Smad proteins, the functional significance of Smad-independent non-canonical signaling pathways including the ERK pathway has been unclear <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The ERK-mediated pathway was reported to contribute to aortic aneurysm progression in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome caused by excessive TGF-Î² signaling, but the underlying mechanism was not identified <xref rid="pone.0108528-Holm1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Habashi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the current study we demonstrate that activation of ERKs is necessary for TGF-Î² to inhibit expression of <italic>TM4SF20</italic>, a reaction required to activate RIP of CREB3L1. Interestingly, nuclear CREB3L1 produced through the RIP reaction requires Smad4 as a co-activator. Thus, the canonical and the non-canonical signaling pathways of TGF-Î² are both required to induce prolonged collagen synthesis.</p>
      <p>In addition to inducing genes involved in assembly of collagen matrix, nuclear CREB3L1 also activates genes that suppress cell proliferation, including p21 <xref rid="pone.0108528-Denard1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Denard2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Interestingly, TGF-Î² was originally discovered as a cytokine that inhibited proliferation of certain cells <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massagu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Considering together, these data raise the possibility that TGF-Î² suppresses proliferation of certain cells by stimulating RIP of CREB3L1. However, malignant tumor cells frequently become resistant to the anti-proliferative action of TGF-Î² <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massague1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Massagu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The A549 cells used in the current study are resistant to the growth-inhibiting action of TGF-Î², but they remain sensitive to the collagen-inducing action of the cytokine. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the co-activator required for CREB3L1 to activate transcription of anti-proliferative genes is different from that required to activate genes involved in assembly of collagen matrix. Our current and previous studies <xref rid="pone.0108528-Denard1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> demonstrate that nuclear CREB3L1 is necessary but not sufficient to induce its target genes. In the current study we identify Smad4 as a co-activator that is required for nuclear CREB3L1 to induce genes involved in assembly of collagen extracellular matrix. We have yet to identify the co-activator required for nuclear CREB3L1 to stimulate genes involved in suppression of cell proliferation. The selective inactivation of the anti-proliferative co-activator still enables the cancer cells to produce collagen extracellular matrix. This may be beneficial to the tumor cells as excess production of the matrix has been reported to facilitate tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0108528-Egeblad1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The current study demonstrates that RIP of CREB3L1 is specifically required for TGF-Î² to chronically induce transcription of genes involved in assembly of collagen extracellular matrix. This specific requirement makes RIP of CREB3L1 a possible drug target to treat fibrotic disease, which is caused by chronic deposition of excess collagen matrix on tissue surface <xref rid="pone.0108528-Rosenbloom1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine whether compounds blocking RIP of CREB3L1 such as those inhibiting S1P <xref rid="pone.0108528-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108528-Olmstead1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> are effective in treating fibrotic diseases.</p>
