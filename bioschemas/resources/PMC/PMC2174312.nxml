      <abstract>
        <p>The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein, the product of the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) gene, is localized both in the cytoplasm and in discrete nuclear bodies called gems. In both compartments SMN is part of a large complex that contains several proteins including Gemin2 (formerly SIP1) and the DEAD box protein Gemin3. In the cytoplasm, the SMN complex is associated with snRNP Sm core proteins and plays a critical role in spliceosomal snRNP assembly. In the nucleus, SMN is required for pre-mRNA splicing by serving in the regeneration of spliceosomes. These functions are likely impaired in cells of SMA patients because they have reduced levels of functional SMN. Here, we report the identification by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry of a novel component of the SMN complex that we name Gemin4. Gemin4 is associated in vivo with the SMN complex through a direct interaction with Gemin3. The tight interaction of Gemin4 with Gemin3 suggests that it could serve as a cofactor of this DEAD box protein. Gemin4 also interacts directly with several of the Sm core proteins. Monoclonal antibodies against Gemin4 efficiently immunoprecipitate the spliceosomal U snRNAs U1 and U5 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes cytoplasm. Immunolocalization experiments show that Gemin4 is colocalized with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Interestingly, Gemin4 is also detected in the nucleoli, suggesting that the SMN complex may also function in preribosomal RNA processing or ribosome assembly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common autosomal recessive disease that is the leading hereditary cause of infant mortality. SMA is characterized by degeneration of motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord resulting in muscular weakness and atrophy (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pearn1980">Pearn 1980</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Melki1999">Melki 1999</xref>). SMA results from deletions or mutations in the survival of motor neurons gene (<italic>SMN</italic>), which is duplicated as an inverted repeat on human chromosome 5 at 5q13 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Brzustowiczetal1990">Brzustowicz et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Melkietal1990">Melki et al. 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Melkietal1994">Melki et al. 1994</xref>). The telomeric copy of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene (<italic>SMN1</italic>) is deleted or mutated in &gt;98% of SMA patients (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lefebvreetal1995">Lefebvre et al. 1995</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Burghes1997">Burghes 1997</xref>). The SMN protein is expressed in all tissues of mammalian organisms with particularly high levels expressed in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Coovertetal1997">Coovert et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lefebvreetal1997">Lefebvre et al. 1997</xref>). In contrast, individuals affected by the most severe form of SMA, Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome or SMA type I, have barely detectable levels of SMN in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Coovertetal1997">Coovert et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lefebvreetal1997">Lefebvre et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>The SMN protein is part of a multiprotein complex and two other proteins of the complex, Gemin2 (formerly SIP1) and Gemin3 (for component of gems 2 and 3, respectively) thus far have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). SMN, Gemin2, and Gemin3 localize in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of somatic cells. In the nucleus, they are concentrated in bodies called gems, which are similar in size and number to coiled bodies (CBs) and are often associated with them (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LiuandDreyfuss1996">Liu and Dreyfuss 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). In addition to SMN, Gemin2 and Gemin3, the large cytoplasmic complex of which they are part also contains Sm proteins that are components of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNPs; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). SMN interacts directly with the Sm proteins and with Gemin2 and Gemin3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). Antibody microinjection experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes revealed that Gemin2 has a critical role in the assembly of snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fischeretal1997">Fischer et al. 1997</xref>), a process which takes place in the cytoplasm where the Sm proteins combine with snRNAs that were exported from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MattajandDeRobertis1985">Mattaj and De Robertis 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mattaj1988">Mattaj 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Luhrmannetal1990">Luhrmann et al. 1990</xref>). Once properly assembled and modified, the snRNPs recruit the necessary nuclear import receptors and translocate into the nucleus where they function in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mattaj1986">Mattaj 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mattaj1988">Mattaj 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Luhrmannetal1990">Luhrmann et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="NeumandeVegvarandDahlberg1990">Neuman de Vegvar and Dahlberg 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ZieveandSauterer1990">Zieve and Sauterer 1990</xref>). Transfections of a dominant negative form of SMN (SMNÎN27) revealed that SMN also plays a critical role in the cytoplasmic assembly of snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>). In the nucleus, overexpression of the SMNÎN27 protein causes a striking rearrangement of the snRNPs, which accumulate with the mutant SMNÎN27 in enlarged gem/coiled body structures (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>). SMN has been further shown to be required for pre-mRNA splicing, likely for the regeneration or recycling of snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>). Of the known components of the SMN complex, the recently described DEAD box protein Gemin3 is the most likely candidate to have the capacity to perform such functions (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). Interestingly, SMN mutants found in SMA patients lack the snRNP regeneration activity likely because of their defective interaction with the Sm proteins as well as with Gemin3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we report the amino acid sequencing by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wilmetal1996">Wilm et al. 1996</xref>) and molecular cloning of a novel component of the SMN complex designated Gemin4 (available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession number AF173856). Several lines of evidence suggest that Gemin4 participates in the functions of the SMN complex. Together with SMN, Gemin2 and Gemin3, Gemin4 can be isolated in a complex with the spliceosomal snRNP proteins. The presence of Gemin4 in the SMN complex in vivo is a result of its direct interaction with Gemin3 but not with SMN. Gemin4 also interacts directly with several of the spliceosomal snRNP core Sm proteins, including SmB, SmD1-3, and SmE, and is associated with U snRNAs in the cytoplasm of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Gemin4 is a novel protein and shows no significant homology to any other protein found in the databases. Its tight association with Gemin3 suggests that it may act as a cofactor of the putative ATPase and/or helicase activity of Gemin3. We have produced mAbs to Gemin4, and show by immunofluorescence microscopy that it colocalizes with SMN in gems. Interestingly, unlike other gems proteins described so far, Gemin4 is also detected in the nucleolus, suggesting that it may have additional functions in ribosome biogenesis.</p>

For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDSâpolyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleider and Schuell, Inc.) using a BioTrans Transblot apparatus (model B; Gelman Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were incubated in blocking solution (PBS 5% nonfat milk) for at least 1 h at room temperature, rinsed with cold PBS, and incubated in blocking solution with primary antibody for at least 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% NP-40, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), which were visualized by an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham) after three additional washes with PBS containing 0.05% NP-40.</p>

        <title>In Vitro Protein-binding Assay</title>
        <p>Purified GST or GST fusion proteins (2 Î¼g) bound to 25 Î¼l of glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 10<sup>6</sup> cpm of in vitro translated protein in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 0.5% aprotinin). After incubation for 1 h at 4Â°C, the resin was washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The bound fraction was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed for 30 min and the signal was enhanced by treatment with Amplify solution (Amersham). For direct in vitro binding, we used 5 Î¼g of purified His-tagged SmB and a binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP-40, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 0.5% aprotinin). The binding experiment was performed as described above, except that bound His-tagged SmB proteins were immunodetected by Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal anti-His tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p>

        <title>Oocyte Injections and Immunoprecipitation of RNAâProtein Complexes</title>
        <p>Injections were carried out as previously described (Fischer et al., 1993). In brief, oocytes were incubated for 3 h in modified Barth's solution containing 0.2% collagenase type II (Sigma Chemical Co.). Defolliculated stage V and VI oocytes were collected and usually used the day after for microinjection. In a typical injection experiment, 30 nl of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA (10<sup>6</sup> cpm/Î¼l; total concentration of 0.7 Î¼M) was injected into the cytoplasm. For immunoprecipitation of RNAâprotein complexes (Fisher et al., 1993), the injected oocytes were homogenized in 300 Î¼l of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation, and the clear supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing antibodies bound to protein GâSepharose (Pharmacia). This mixture was incubated with constant shaking for 1 h at 4Â°C and subsequently washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Bound RNAs were isolated by phenol extraction for 1 h, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis.</p>

        <p>In vitro transcription of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs was carried out as described in Fisher et al. (1993) from plasmids encoding for U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs. The plasmid encoding the chicken Î´-crystallin pre-mRNA was previously described (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>). The plasmid encoding the chicken Î´-crystallin mRNA was constructed by elution of the chicken Î´-crystallin mRNA from polyacrylamide gel followed by reverse transcriptaseâPCR and subcloning into pSP65 (pSP1415m; Promega Corp). The plasmids used for in vitro transcription and translation of SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and the Sm proteins have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>Gemin4, a Novel Component of the SMN Complex</title>
        <p>Immunoprecipitations from [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell lysates with anti-SMN mAbs revealed the presence of several protein components in the SMN complex (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>). Proteins that coimmunopurify with anti-SMN antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) include Sm proteins, Gemin2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>), and the recently described DEAD box protein Gemin3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). In addition to these proteins, there are bands of 175, 97, 95, 60, and 50 kD that coimmunopurified with SMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In this paper, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of the 97-kD polypeptide. The p97 band was digested in gel by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were sequenced by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Shevchenkoetal1996">Shevchenko et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wilmetal1996">Wilm et al. 1996</xref>). Searching the databases with several peptides from this band (using the peptide sequence tag algorithm) we identified a human expressed sequence tag sequence (clone no. R55454) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Shevchenkoetal1996">Shevchenko et al. 1996</xref>). Several additional cDNA clones were obtained by hybridization screening of a human leukemia 5â²-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library using the expressed sequence tag clone as a probe. We isolated 20 independent partial cDNA clones with insert sizes ranging from 0.8 to 3.1 kb, all of which contained overlapping regions of the same open reading frame (ORF). A cDNA clone containing the longest ORF was constructed, and conceptual translation of its nucleotide sequence revealed a potential initiator methionine preceded by an in-frame stop codon. This cDNA encodes a putative protein of 1,058 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 119.9 kD and an estimated pI of 5.68. Database searches with the full-length clone did not reveal significant homology to any other protein or any recognizable motifs. Thus, this is a full-length cDNA clone that encodes a novel component of the SMN complex (see below), which we termed Gemin4 for component of gems number 4.</p>

        <title>Production of Monoclonal Antibodies to Gemin4</title>
        <p>To investigate the interaction of Gemin4 with SMN and to characterize Gemin4 further, we generated mAbs by immunizing mice with a bacterially produced, purified recombinant His-tagged Gemin4 fragment (from amino acids 611 to 1,058). One hybridoma, 22C10, was selected for additional studies. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that this hybridoma indeed produced mAb that recognizes Gemin4 specifically. First, 22C10 immunoprecipitated Gemin4 produced by in vitro transcription and translation from the Gemin4 cDNA but not similarly produced hnRNP A1 or SMN proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). Second, on an immunoblot of total HeLa lysate, 22C10 recognized a single protein of â¼97 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). Finally, 22C10 specifically immunoprecipitated a single protein of â¼97 kD from [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa and mouse 3T3 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C), suggesting that Gemin4, like SMN, is conserved in vertebrates.</p>

        <title>Gemin4 Is Localized both in Gems and in Nucleoli</title>
        <p>Indirect immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy using mAb 22C10 was performed on HeLa cells to determine the subcellular localization of Gemin4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. C</xref>, shows that anti-Gemin4 antibodies display intense staining of prominent discrete bodies in the nucleus, and these are also readily discernible by differential interference contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> D). In addition, the 22C10 antibody stained nucleoli (see below). To determine if the discrete nuclear structures stained by 22C10 are gems or CBs, we performed double label immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies against Gemin4 and either p80-coilin, as a marker of CBs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andradeetal1991">Andrade et al. 1991</xref>), or SMN, as a marker of gems (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LiuandDreyfuss1996">Liu and Dreyfuss 1996</xref>). In many cell lines, the antibody staining of gems and CBs entirely overlap, however, in the HeLa PV strain used here these two bodies are frequently found separate from each other (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LiuandDreyfuss1996">Liu and Dreyfuss 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MateraandFrey1998">Matera and Frey 1998</xref>). In a recent report, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Carvalhoetal1999">Carvalho et al. 1999</xref> have also observed that gems are often detected separately from CBs. The nuclear structures that contain Gemin4 are clearly distinct from CBs but are completely colocalized with SMN in gems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. E</xref>). The colocalization of Gemin4 with SMN strongly supports the conclusion that these two proteins exist as a complex in the cell. Thus, Gemin4 is the fourth constituent of gems described so far. Like staining with antibodies to SMN, Gemin2 and Gemin3, 22C10 shows a diffuse cytoplasmic staining for Gemin4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A).</p>
        <p>To further study the nucleolar staining of Gemin4, we performed double label immunofluorescence experiments using the Gemin4 antibody 22C10 and the fibrillarin antibody 1881 as a marker of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Raskaetal1990">Raska et al. 1990</xref>). The staining, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> F, indicates that Gemin4 and fibrillarin do not colocalize, but both show distinct nucleolar patterns. This demonstrates that Gemin4 is present in the nucleolus but excluded from the dense fibrillar compartment of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="OchsandSmetana1991">Ochs and Smetana 1991</xref>). Thus, Gemin4 represents the first component of the SMN complex that localizes both in gems and nucleoli (see Discussion).</p>

        <title>Gemin4 Is in a Complex with SMN, Gemin2 and Gemin3</title>
        <p>To characterize the Gemin4-containing complex, we tested for its presence in the SMN complex in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments. The anti-Gemin4 mAb 22C10 was used for immunoprecipitation from HeLa cell total extracts, and these were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted, and probed with the anti-SMN antibody 2B1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LiuandDreyfuss1996">Liu and Dreyfuss 1996</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A (lane 22C10 IP), 2B1 readily detects SMN in the 22C10 immunoprecipitates, indicating that SMN is coimmunoprecipitated with Gemin4. Because SMN forms a stable complex with Gemin2 in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>), we also investigated whether Gemin2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Gemin4. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A, the anti-Gemin2 mAb 2S7 clearly detects Gemin2 in the anti-Gemin4 immunoprecipitates (lane 22C10 IP). We also examined whether Gemin4 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Gemin3, which is a recently identified novel component of the SMN complex (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A shows that, like SMN and Gemin2, Gemin4 is present in the anti-Gemin3 (lane 11G9 IP) immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). In a reciprocal experiment, the Gemin4 protein could also be coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-SMN, the anti-Gemin2, and the anti-Gemin3 mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). No SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, or Gemin4 proteins were detected in the control nonimmune (SP2/0) immunoprecipitate (data not shown and lane SP2/O, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). These results suggest that SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 are associated in vivo in one or more complexes that can be immunoprecipitated by either anti-SMN, anti-Gemin2, anti-Gemin3, or anti-Gemin4 antibodies.</p>
        <p>Further support for the existence in vivo of a single complex that contains SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 was obtained from gel filtration experiments. Total HeLa extract was fractionated on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 high performance gel filtration column; fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-SMN, anti-Gemin2, anti-Gemin3, and anti-Gemin4 antibodies. SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 comigrated and showed a peak at â¼800 kD, indicating that they are components of a large macromolecular complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). Gemin4 is also detected in a second complex of â¼550 kD that lacks SMN and Gemin2 but does contain a faster migrating form of Gemin3. Thus, there appear to be at least two different Gemin4-containing complexes.</p>
        <p>A second peak containing SMN and Gemin2, but lacking Gemin3 and Gemin4, is observed at lower molecular mass fractions that correspond to â¼100 kD. The SMN protein present in these fractions was not detectable with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the peptide sequence encoded by exon 7 of SMN (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). Thus, this smaller SMNâGemin2 complex contains the oligomerization-deficient form of SMN lacking amino acids encoded by exon 7, which is most likely produced by the SMN2 gene (see Discussion; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gennarellietal1995">Gennarelli et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lefebvreetal1995">Lefebvre et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>).</p>

        <title>Gemin4 Interacts Tightly with the DEAD Box Protein Gemin3</title>
        <p>To investigate the interactions of Gemin4, we performed in vitro protein binding assays using Gemin4 and several constituents of the SMN complex. For this assay, purified GST or GST-Gemin4 fusion immobilized on gluthathione-Sepharose were incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A, full-length Gemin3 is the only protein of the SMN complex that binds specifically to immobilized GST-Gemin4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). No binding to GST alone was observed (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To further investigate this interaction, Gemin3 was expressed as a fusion protein with GST, and Gemin4 was produced and labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. GST-Gemin3 fusion was incubated with labeled Gemin4 in the presence of increasing salt concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B, full-length Gemin4 bound to GST-Gemin3, and this binding appears to be avid because it is not disrupted at 750 mM NaCl. No binding of Gemin4 to GST alone was detected (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Gemin4 Is Associated with Spliceosomal snRNPs in the Cytoplasm</title>
        <p>To further characterize the Gemin4 complex, immunoprecipitations using anti-Gemin4 mAbs from [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells were carried out, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As references for these immunoprecipitations, we also performed immunoprecipitation with the anti-Sm mAb Y12 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LernerandSteitz1979">Lerner and Steitz 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lerneretal1981">Lerner et al. 1981</xref>) and with the anti-SMN mAb 2B1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A, several proteins are coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Gemin4 antibodies, and the pattern is very similar to the one obtained with anti-SMN antibodies. Besides SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4, the Sm core proteins B/Bâ², D1-3, E, F, and G proteins were also coimmunoprecipitated with the 22C10 anti-Gemin4 antibody. Additional proteins coimmunoprecipitated specifically with anti-SMN (at 175, 95, 60, and 50 kD) or anti-Gemin4 (at 80 kD) mAbs. Note that the U1-specific A protein, but not the U1-specific C protein, coimmunoprecipitates with SMN and Gemin4. This indicates that the SMN complexes are not associated with mature snRNP particles.</p>
        <p>The in vivo association of Gemin4 with the Sm proteins was confirmed by a coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot experiment. The anti-Sm mAb Y12 was used for immunoprecipitation from HeLa cell total extracts, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and an immunoblot with the anti-Gemin4 antibody 22C10. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B, 22C10 readily detects Gemin4 in the Y12 immunoprecipitate, demonstrating that Gemin4 is associated with the Sm proteins in vivo. To investigate whether Gemin4 interacts with Sm proteins directly, purified recombinant GST-Gemin4 protein was used for binding assays with in vitro produced [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled Sm proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> C shows that the Sm proteins B, D1, D2, D3, and E bind to GST-Gemin4, whereas there is no detectable binding to GST alone (data not shown). To determine if Gemin4 is able to interact directly with the Sm proteins and not via other components of the SMN complex that may be present in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, recombinant His-tagged SmB protein was produced and incubated with GST or GST-Gemin4. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the 6xHis-tag. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D, SmB binds specifically to Gemin4 but not to GST. We conclude that Gemin4 interacts directly with SmB.</p>
        <p>To determine whether Gemin4 was associated with snRNAs in vivo, we used the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte that provides a particularly advantageous system in which to study spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis by use of microinjection (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MattajandDeRobertis1985">Mattaj and De Robertis 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mattaj1986">Mattaj 1986</xref>). We first wished to determine whether Gemin4 is present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells and whether it can be recognized by 22C10 antibody. The 22C10 mAb showed both gems and nucleolar staining on <italic>Xenopus</italic> XL177 somatic cells, strongly suggesting that Gemin4 is conserved in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (data not shown). However, immunoblotting with the anti-human Gemin4 mAb 22C10 on <italic>Xenopus</italic> tissue culture cells or on <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte lysates did not detect any protein (data not shown). To determine if Gemin4 is associated with U snRNAs in vivo, various <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs including chicken Î´-crystallin mRNA, chicken Î´-crystallin pre-mRNA, and the spliceosomal snRNAs U1 and U5 were produced by in vitro transcription and a mixture of these RNAs was microinjected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. After 3 h, immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-Gemin4 (22C10) and, as a positive control, anti-Gemin2 (2E17) antibodies (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fischeretal1997">Fischer et al. 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> A shows that only U1 and U5 snRNAs are efficiently and specifically precipitated, indicating that they associate with Gemin4. A similar, but less efficient, immunoprecipitation of U1 and U5 snRNAs was observed with the anti-Gemin2 antibody. We further asked whether the other spliceosomal U snRNAs, U2 and U4, were associated with Gemin4 as well, and whether the association of Gemin4 with mature U snRNPs was also observed in the nucleus. To do so, a mixture of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled U snRNAs were injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes followed by an 18-h incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B). After this incubation period, â¼50% of the injected snRNA was imported into the nucleus while the rest remained in the cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitations from the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were carried out with either anti-Gemin4 antibody, anti-Sm antibody as a positive control, or SP2/O as a negative control. The coimmunoprecipitated RNAs were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. As previously reported, U1, U2, U4, and U5 were efficiently immunoprecipitated by Y12 in approximately equal amounts from the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mattaj1986">Mattaj 1986</xref>; Fisher and Luhrmann, 1990). In contrast, Gemin4 associated more efficiently with U1 and U5 than U2 and U4, and this association was only observed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B).</p>
        <p>We conclude that the Gemin4, like SMN and Gemin2, is stably associated with U1 and U5 snRNAs in the cytoplasm of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes but not after these snRNAs have been assembled into snRNPs and imported into the nucleus. Thus, like SMN and Gemin2 (Fisher et al., 1997), Gemin4 likely dissociates from the spliceosomal snRNPs either immediately before nuclear entry or shortly thereafter.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Using a biochemical approach to characterize additional components of the SMN complex, we have identified a novel protein termed Gemin4. Gemin4 does not contain any known or recognizable protein motifs. Several lines of evidence suggest that Gemin4, together with SMN, Gemin2, and Gemin3, function as a complex in vivo. SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 can be coimmunoprecipitated, and are present in a large complex that also contains the spliceosomal snRNP core Sm proteins. Like SMN and Gemin3, Gemin4 interacts directly with several snRNP Sm core proteins, including B/Bâ², D1-D3, and E and is associated with U1 and U5 snRNAs in the cytoplasm of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, where snRNP assembly takes place (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fischeretal1997">Fischer et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). We have previously shown that the SMN complex plays a critical role in spliceosomal snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm, and is required for pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fischeretal1997">Fischer et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>). Thus, it is likely that Gemin4 also plays an important role in these processes. Note, that so far, we have not been able to detect any effect of anti-Gemin4 antibody 22C10 on snRNP assembly and/or snRNP import into the nucleus upon microinjection into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (data not shown).</p>
      <p>Unlike Gemin2 and Gemin3, Gemin4 does not interact with SMN directly and its presence in the SMN complex is probably the result of its direct and stable interaction with Gemin3. The observation that Gemin4 and the DEAD box protein Gemin3 interact with each other directly and avidly suggests that they function together. Previous studies have shown that the RNA helicase activity of the translation initiation factor eIF4A, also a DEAD box protein, is dependent on the presence of a second initiation factor, eIF4B. Interestingly, in a series of preliminary experiments we have so far not been able to detect RNA helicase or RNA-dependent ATPase activity for recombinant Gemin3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). It is possible that such activity will only manifest itself when Gemin3 is associated with other proteins such as Gemin4.</p>
      <p>Gel filtration experiments revealed the presence of two SMN complexes in HeLa cells. The high molecular mass complex is the most abundant and contains all the components of the SMN complex thus far identified (SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4) and likely represents an active form of the complex (see below). The large size of this complex is likely the result of the capacity of SMN to form large oligomers (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). The second complex probably represents a monomeric, COOH-terminalâtruncated form of SMN (SMNÎEx7) associated with Gemin2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). While <italic>SMN1</italic> produces only full-length mRNA, <italic>SMN2</italic> mainly produces an alternatively spliced form of SMN mRNA lacking exon 7 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gennarellietal1995">Gennarelli et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lefebvreetal1995">Lefebvre et al. 1995</xref>). Exon 7 skipping is due to the presence of a single nucleotide change in the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene compared with <italic>SMN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lorsonetal1999">Lorson et al. 1999</xref>), and the ratio of alternatively spliced versus full-length <italic>SMN2</italic> mRNA correlates with the severity of SMA (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gavrilovetal1998">Gavrilov et al. 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, no evidence for the presence of SMN protein lacking exon 7âencoded amino acids in vivo has been reported. The absence of the amino acid sequence encoded by exon7 is thought to generate a nonfunctional SMN protein that lacks the capacity to oligomerize and, thus, cannot interact with Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Burghes1997">Burghes 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lorsonetal1998">Lorson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). The absence of Gemin3 and Gemin4 from the SMNÎEx7âGemin2 complex probably results from the defective interaction of SMNÎEx7 with Gemin3 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). We have shown that SMNÎEx7 is a nonfunctional protein that is incapable, unlike wild-type SMN, of regenerating splicing extracts in vitro (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>). Thus, the loss of function of SMNÎEx7 is likely due to its defective interaction with the Sm proteins as well as with the Gemin3âGemin4 complex (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the SMNÎEx7âGemin2 complex represents an inactive form of the SMN complex, whereas the high molecular mass complex containing SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 represents the active complex that can bind substrates such as the Sm proteins and carry out the functions of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fischeretal1997">Fischer et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>Higher eukaryotic nuclei contain numerous morphologically distinct substructures or nuclear bodies (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SingerandGreen1997">Singer and Green 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="LamondandEarnshaw1998">Lamond and Earnshaw 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Matera1999">Matera 1999</xref>).

CBs are highly enriched in snRNPs and snoRNPs and, together with gems, appear to be involved in snRNP biogenesis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Galletal1995">Gall et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="LamondandEarnshaw1998">Lamond and Earnshaw 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1998">Pellizzoni et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Matera1999">Matera 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SleemanandLamond1999">Sleeman and Lamond 1999</xref>). In addition to its localization in gems, Gemin4 is in the nucleoli and, thus, represents the first component of the SMN complex present in this nuclear compartment. Using a different polyclonal anti-SMN antibody from 2B1, others have observed a strong nucleolar immunolocalization of SMN in mouse and human CNS tissues (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Francisetal1998">Francis et al. 1998</xref>). However, SMN has not been detected in nucleoli of HeLa cells. Interestingly, SMN interacts with fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LiuandDreyfuss1996">Liu and Dreyfuss 1996</xref>), a common component of small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs). Fibrillarin is found in the nucleoli and in CBs and may be the snoRNP's functional equivalent of the core Sm proteins of spliceosomal snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="TycandSteitz1989">Tyc and Steitz 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MaxwellandFournier1995">Maxwell and Fournier 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SmithandSteitz1997">Smith and Steitz 1997</xref>). Because of their close association with nucleoli, it has been suggested that CBs participate in snoRNP biogenesis and/or metabolism (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Raskaetal1990">Raska et al. 1990</xref>). Given the close association between CBs and gems and the interaction between SMN and fibrillarin, it is possible that the SMN complex also plays a role in snoRNP assembly and ribosomal RNA metabolism. Therefore, Gemin4 may function to connect SMN to both UsnRNA biogenesis and rRNA biogenesis.</p>

        <p>Gemin4 interacts directly with the DEAD box protein Gemin3 in vitro. (A) Gemin4 interacts with Gemin3 in vitro. In vitro translated [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled myc-tagged SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 proteins were incubated with purified GST-Gemin4 as described in Materials and Methods. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The in vitro translation panel shows 5% of the input. The position of the molecular mass markers is indicated on the left in kilodaltons. (B) Gemin4 interacts tightly with Gemin3. In vitro translated [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled myc-Gemin4 was incubated with purified GST-Gemin3 in increasing salt concentrations as indicated (see Materials and Methods). Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The in vitro translation panel shows 10% of the input.</p>

        <p>Gemin4 is associated with snRNPs in vivo. (A) Immunoprecipitations of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled total HeLa cell extract using mAbs specific to SMN (2B1), Gemin4 (22C10), and the snRNP Sm core proteins (Y12). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The several proteins immunoprecipitated are indicated on the right. (B) Gemin4 is coimmunoprecipitated with Sm proteins. Immunoprecipitation from the total HeLa extract was performed with mAb anti-Sm (Y12) and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using 22C10 (anti-Gemin4). The position of the molecular mass markers is indicated on the left (in kD). The positions of the light chain (l.c) and heavy chain (h.c) of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation are indicated. The total lane shows 2% of the input. (C) Gemin4 interacts with several Sm proteins in vitro. In vitro translated [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled myc-tagged Sm proteins B, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G were incubated with purified GST-Gemin4 as described in Materials and Methods. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The in vitro translation panel shows 5% of the input. The position of the molecular mass markers is indicated on the left in kilodaltons. (D) Gemin4 interacts directly with SmB in vitro. Recombinant His-tagged SmB protein was incubated with purified GST or GST-Gemin4 proteins as described in Materials and Methods. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-His tag antibodies.</p>

        <p>Gemin4 is associated with spliceosomal U snRNAs in the cytoplasm of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. (A) Immunoprecipitation of spliceosomal U snRNAs with anti-Gemin2 and anti-Gemin4 antibodies. A mixture of different in vitro synthesized <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs were injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. 3 h later, immunoprecipitations were carried out with either anti-Gemin4 (22C10) or anti-Gemin2 (2E17) or control antibodies (SP2/O). Immunoprecipitated RNA (IP) was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. In the supernatant (SUP) panel 2.5% of each immunoprecipitation is shown. (B) Anti-Gemin4 antibodies can immunoprecipitate U1 and U5 snRNAs only from the cytoplasm. The indicated <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNAs were injected as a mixture into the cytoplasm of oocytes. After incubation for 18 h, the oocytes were dissected into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions, and RNAs from both fractions were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-Gemin4 (22C10), anti-Sm (Y12), or control antibodies (SP2/O). 2.5% of the input is shown.</p>

        <p>A schematic representation of the SMN complexes. (A) The monomeric SMNÎEx7, associates with Gemin2 to form a dimeric complex. SMNÎEx7 lacks the ability to self-associate as well as to interact with Gemin3 and the Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Lorsonetal1998">Lorson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). This monomeric SMNÎEx7âGemin2 complex is very likely an inactive complex (see text for more details). (B) Monomeric SMN, associated with Gemin2 which binds to SMN but not itself (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Liuetal1997">Liu et al. 1997</xref>; data not shown), contains a low affinity binding site for the Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). Gemin3 associates with Gemin4 (this work). SMN self-associates, forming at least a SMNâGemin2 dimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pellizzonietal1999">Pellizzoni et al. 1999</xref>). Gemin3âGemin4 complex associates with SMNâGemin2 dimeric complex via an SMNâGemin3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Charrouxetal1999">Charroux et al. 1999</xref>). In this oligomeric conformation, a binding site with a much higher affinity for the Sm proteins is formed. The oligomeric form likely represents the active form of the SMN complex (see text for more details). (C) Gemin4 interacts with Gemin3* to form a dimeric complex that lacks SMN and Gemin2 (see text for details). Gemin3* represents the faster migrating form of Gemin3 observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B. Only one Sm snRNP protein is included in the drawing to simplify the model.</p>
