      <abstract>
        <p id="P1">We report the discovery of the <italic>GATA2</italic> gene as a new myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) predisposition gene. We found the same, novel heterozygous c.1061C&gt;T (p.Thr354Met) missense mutation in the <italic>GATA2</italic> transcription factor gene segregating with the multigenerational transmission of MDS/AML in three families, and a <italic>GATA2</italic> c.1063_1065delACA (p.Thr355del) mutation at an adjacent codon in a fourth MDS/AML family. The mutations reside within the second zinc finger of GATA2 which mediates DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions. We show differential effects of the mutants on transactivation of target genes, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and global gene expression. Identification of such predisposing genes to familial forms of MDS and AML is critical for more effective diagnosis and prognosis, counselling, selection of related bone marrow transplant donors, and development of therapies.</p>

  <body>
    <p id="P2">AML is the most common form of sporadic leukemia in adults <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> while MDS is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, with a tendency to progress to AML<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The study of families predisposed to particular malignancies is a successful strategy for discovering causative oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). While rare, dozens of families developing non-syndromic forms of MDS and AML (<italic>i.e.</italic> lacking other systemic manifestations) have been described. To date, only two MDS/AML predisposition genes have been recognized: Runt-related transcription factor 1 (<italic>RUNX1</italic>/<italic>AML1</italic>) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein Î± (<italic>CEBPA</italic>) (reviewed in<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>).</p>
    <p id="P3">Here we report a highly specific p.Thr354Met heritable mutation in GATA2 co-segregating with with early onset MDS/AML in three families. We also report a family with MDS with a 3 bp heritable deletion in the <italic>GATA2</italic> gene (p.Thr355del) deleting the second threonine in this sequence.</p>
    <p id="P4">We determined the genomic DNA sequence of all RefSeq exons in 50 candidate genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) from patients representing five pedigrees with predisposition to MDS/AML, prescreened for absence of <italic>RUNX1</italic> or <italic>CEBPA</italic> germline mutations. In three families, there was an identical heritable heterozygous variation in the transcription factor <italic>GATA2</italic>, c.1061C&gt;T (p.Thr354Met) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). In all three families p.Thr354Met segregated with the disease for the samples tested, and no family members had AML or MDS who did not also carry p.Thr354Met (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary table 2</xref>). There were also members in each family who carried this variant but were unaffected (Pedigree 1: III-5 and III-8; Pedigree 2: II-6; Pedigree 3: III-9).</p>
    <p id="P5">We recently identified a fourth family in which a father and son, both affected by MDS, shared a heterozygous heritable deletion of 3 bp in <italic>GATA2</italic> (c.1063-1065delACA) resulting in p.Thr355del (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This codon is adjacent to the codon mutated in the first three families, and encodes the second of the five consecutive threonines.</p>
    <p id="P6">p.Thr354 and p.Thr355del are the first two of five consecutive threonine residues in a highly conserved region of the GATA2 protein (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) encoding zinc finger 2 (ZF2), which is involved in DNA binding, homodimerization and interaction with transcription factor PU.1<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. PolyPhen-2 predicts that p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del are likely to affect GATA2 function.

    <p id="P10">Haplotype mapping using 8 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and surrounding the <italic>GATA2</italic> gene demonstrated that the c.1061C&gt;T (p.Thr354Met) mutation segregated within two distinct haplotypes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) indicating that this mutation has arisen at least twice among the three families in which it is found.</p>
    <p id="P11">GATA2 is a DNA-binding transcription factor which localizes predominantly to the nucleus. We generated cDNAs for the p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del mutant GATA2 proteins and the acquired CML BC p.Leu359Val mutant<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Wildtype (WT) and mutant proteins expressed at comparable levels when transiently expressed in HEK293 fibroblasts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and when induced to express from a 4HT-responsive dual vector lentivirus system in stably transduced HL-60 promyelocytes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels to wildtype (WT) GATA2 when transiently introduced into WT and mutant proteins appropriately localized to the nucleus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). However, the p.Thr354Met mutation dramatically reduced the ability of GATA2 to bind its consensus WGATAR DNA motif while p.Thr355del almost completely ablated DNA binding (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">Molecular modeling of GATA2 ZF2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>) demonstrated that the p.Thr354 residue does not contact DNA, but rather makes polar contact with adjacent threonines, and via its amino group with p.Cys349 which coordinates the zinc atom. Replacement of p.Thr354 with the bulky methionine moiety is predicted to alter the overall structure of this zinc finger by affecting zinc contacts. This may explain reduced binding of p.Thr354Met to DNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). In contrast, p.Thr355del shortens the conserved threonine string, likely impacting the orientation and position of p.Leu359, which directly contacts DNA. These observations likely explain the almost-complete ablation of DNA binding.</p>
    <p id="P13">Luciferase reporter assay experiments show that GATA2 p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del had significantly reduced transactivation ability compared to WT on known <italic>GATA2</italic> responsive enhancers (<italic>RUNX1</italic> and <italic>CD34</italic>) and the <italic>LYL1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b,c</xref>). Experiments mixing WT with p.Thr354Met or p.Thr355del at a 1:1 ratio, mimicking heterozygosity, demonstrated a dominant negative effect of the mutants over WT transcription activation in multiple systems (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, WT and PU.1 transactivated the <italic>CSF1R</italic> (<italic>M-CSF-R</italic>) promoter 2.4 and 2.5-fold, respectively, but together synergized to induce 18-fold (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). While p.Leu359Val was similar to WT GATA2, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del gave dramatically reduced induction alone (1.5- and 0.9-fold) or with PU.1 (7- and 9-fold, respectively, compared to 18-fold with WT). p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del also displayed dominant negative activity with transactivation by WT GATA2 reduced to 9- and 10-fold, respectively in the presence of these mutants (only marginally above the 7- and 9-fold with mutants alone). Hence, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del perturb the transactivation ability of GATA2, presumably by disrupting association with PU.1 or other interacting transcription factors, and are likely impact expression of downstream targets. Interestingly, while WT GATA2 displayed different responses in HEK293 versus Cos-7 cells on the <italic>RUNX1</italic> enhancer (activating versus repressing, respectively), p.Thr354Met displayed loss-of-function activity in both cell types (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, on multiple GATA responsive elements, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del show loss-of-function and also dominant negative effects.</p>
    <p id="P14">HL-60 promyelocytes differentiate into granulocytes upon exposure to all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA), resulting in upregulation of CD11b, cessation of proliferation and subsequent promotion of apoptosis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). When expressed at equivalent levels under non-differentiating conditions, unlike WT and p.Leu359Val which inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del acted as loss-of-function mutants (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,f,j</xref>). However, in the presence of ATRA, p.Thr354Met alone enabled cell proliferation/survival (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>), while simultaneously inhibiting differentiation and apoptosis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d,m</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). p.Thr355del appeared to be a null mutant under these conditions.</p>
    <p id="P15">In order to better understand the effects of the GATA2 mutants on gene expression, microarray analysis was performed to compare global gene expression in HL-60 cells expressing WT GATA2 and the three GATA2 mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). The data clearly showed that p.Thr355del and p.Thr354Met are almost total loss-of-function mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Note that, p.Leu359Val exhibits gain-of-function (1,253 newly regulated genes compared to WT GATA2) and partial loss-of-function (457 genes no longer regulated) while retaining 786 genes commonly regulated. These results are consistent with EMSA-western blot and transactivation assays. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that <italic>MYC</italic> may be among key target which is repressed by GATA2 WT but not p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Note</xref>)</p>
    <p id="P16">Interestingly, recurrent p.Leu359Val mutation in ZF2 of GATA2 was reported in 8/85 cases of CML BC<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, a disease often phenotypically indistinguishable from AML. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c, p</xref>.Thr354Met is situated between the deleted residues (p.Ala341_Gly346del), also observed in CML BC, and the p.Leu359 residue. p.Leu359 contacts DNA at the guanine residue of the WGATAR consensus motif and based on <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding and transactivation assays, p.Leu359Val has previously been reported to be a gain-of-function mutation while p.Ala341_Gly346del appears to be a partial loss-of-function mutation. p.Met354 or deletion of p.Thr355 may affect overall ZF structure (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) although we cannot exclude disrupted heterodimerization with GATA2âs interacting partners of GATA2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We speculate that aberrant protein partnerships may explain dominant negative activity and adversely influences expression of genes critical to myelopoiesis.</p>
    <p id="P17">The MDS/AML observed within these families is clinically heterogeneous, and demonstrate a variety of somatic chromosomal abnormalities, including monosomy 7, trisomy 8, and trisomy 21 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). As such it is similar to familial MDS/AML with monosomy 7<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>GATA2</italic> mutations were not detected in 8 MDS/AML families in which <italic>RUNX1</italic> and <italic>CEPBA</italic> mutations were excluded and 27 families presenting with lymphoid malignancy. Mutations at this position within ZF2 are likely to initiate an exclusively myeloid pathway of oncogenesis in which subsequent gene-specific, somatically acquired mutations probably define the particular type of disease that ultimately arises.</p>
    <p id="P18">The mechanism by which GATA2 p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del mutations function is distinct to that generally described for <italic>RUNX1</italic> and <italic>CEBPA</italic>, which commonly act as classical TSG with a wide-range of mutations and requiring functional disruption of both alleles. Transcription factors are well characterized as targets of dominant negative or constitutively active mutations in cancer<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, with <italic>RUNX1</italic> mutations leading to a spectrum of outcomes including AML and ALL consistent with both TSG and dominant oncogene models<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.

Many of these interactions involve ZF2 in which the p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del mutations reside, and it is likely that changes in the nature of these interactions play an important role in predisposition to MDS/AML. Indeed, our co-transfection studies are consistent with altered transactivation by p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del with PU.1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P20">p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or any other mutations in <italic>GATA2</italic> were absent in our heterogeneous cohort of sporadic AML patients, although we cannot rule out possible mutations in samples with low percentage blasts. This is consistent with other recent studies, however, suggesting that somatic <italic>GATA2</italic> mutations in both ZF1 and ZF2 could be acquired only in specific AML subtypes such as AML-M5<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. <italic>GATA2</italic> is, however, overexpressed in many cases of sporadic MDS<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and AML, particularly in <italic>FLT3-ITD</italic><sup>+</sup> AML<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that alterations to <italic>GATA2</italic> expression, rather than direct mutation, may occur more commonly.. Further, chromosomal aberrations at the 3q21 breakpoint cluster encompassing a presumptive <italic>GATA2</italic> regulatory region resulted in upregulated <italic>GATA2</italic> expression in MDS and AML<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.

    <p id="P21">In this study, we show that <italic>GATA2</italic> is a new predisposition gene for familial MDS/AML and demonstrate functional changes due to mutations within a highly conserved threonine repeat located in the second zinc finger.

        <p id="P34">HEK293 cells were transfected with GATA2 WT or mutants using Lipofectamine<sup>â¢</sup> 2000. After 24 h, nuclear extracts were prepared using a NE-PER<sup>Â®</sup> Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Double stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing two GATA binding sites (Human TCRÎ´ enhancer) or a single GATA binding site (GATA Consensus and Human GM-CSF-153 promoter) were synthesized (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). Each single stranded oligomer was labeled using a Biotin 3â² End DNA Labeling kit (Pierce) and annealed according to manufacturerâs protocol. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a modified protocol from Kumar <italic>et al</italic> 2008<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and visualized using a Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Double stranded labeled probes (100 fmol) were incubated with 3 Î¼g of nuclear extract for 20 min in 1x binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Î¼M ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA and 5 Î¼g/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Polyclonal rabbit Î±-GATA2 (H-116) antibody (Cat. No. sc-9008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) (1:100) was added to nuclear lysates for 20 min prior to addition of probe to demonstrate GATA2 as the binding protein. To assess the specificity of the binding, 200-fold excess of each unlabeled probe was used as competitor. The mixtures were resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels made in 0.5x TGE buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 85 mM glycine and 0.5 mM EDTA) and the electrophoresis was performed at 4Â°C. For EMSA-Western blots, the experiment was carried as described above, except that the shifted DNA oligonucleotides-protein complexes were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, instead of PVDF. The membrane was probed with monoclonal mouse Î±-GATA2 (CG2-96) antibody (Cat. No. sc-267; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) and detection was performed as mentioned above.</p>

The probes were visualised using chemiluminescence (top panel). Note, GATA2 &amp; NS relates to a band that contains both GATA2 and a non-specific (NS) protein. To visualise GATA2 alone, an EMSA-western blot was performed probing with polyclonal Î±-GATA2 antibody (bottom panel), showing the level of binding of GATA2 WT and mutants. A neutralizing Î±-GATA2 antibody in the far right lane removes GATA2, but not the non-specific binding protein (NS) (top panel), and the specificity of GATA2 is confirmed in the bottom panel.</p>
