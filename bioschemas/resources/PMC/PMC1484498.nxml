<named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> Scc2 binds Scc4 to form an essential complex that loads cohesin onto chromosomes. The prevalence of Scc2 orthologs in eukaryotes emphasizes a conserved role in regulating sister chromatid cohesion, but homologs of Scc4 have not hitherto been identified outside certain fungi. Some metazoan orthologs of Scc2 were initially identified as developmental gene regulators, such as
<italic>Drosophila</italic> Nipped-B, a regulator of
<italic>cut</italic> and
<italic>Ultrabithorax,</italic> and delangin, a protein mutant in Cornelia de Lange syndrome. We show that delangin and Nipped-B bind previously unstudied human and fly orthologs of
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> MAU-2, a non-axis-specific guidance factor for migrating cells and axons. PSI-BLAST shows that Scc4 is evolutionarily related to metazoan MAU-2 sequences, with the greatest homology evident in a short N-terminal domain, and proteinâprotein interaction studies map the site of interaction between delangin and human MAU-2 to the N-terminal regions of both proteins. Short interfering RNA knockdown of human MAU-2 in HeLa cells resulted in precocious sister chromatid separation and in impaired loading of cohesin onto chromatin, indicating that it is functionally related to Scc4, and RNAi analyses show that MAU-2 regulates chromosome segregation in
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> embryos. Using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to knock down
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Xenopus tropicalis</named-content> delangin or MAU-2 in early embryos produced similar patterns of retarded growth and developmental defects. Our data show that sister chromatid cohesion in metazoans involves the formation of a complex similar to the Scc2-Scc4 interaction in the budding yeast. The very high degree of sequence conservation between Scc4 homologs in complex metazoans is consistent with increased selection pressure to conserve additional essential functions, such as regulation of cell and axon migration during development.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sister chromatid cohesion in eukaryotes occurs by a well-conserved mechanism that depends on cohesins, protein complexes that bind to multiple sites on chromosome arms but are highly enriched at centromeres. At the heart of cohesins are tripartite SMC-kleisin complexes that form ring-like structures (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] for recent reviews). Two large SMC proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, form a V-shaped heterodimer with ABC-like ATPases at the tips (or heads) of the two arms. A connecting Î±-kleisin subunit (Scc1/Mcd1 in budding yeast) completes the ring; its N- and C-terminal sequences are linked to the ATPase heads of the Smc3 and Smc1 proteins, respectively.
</p>
      <p>The Î±-kleisin subunit can be hydrolyzed at anaphase by a specific protease, separase, enabling release of sister chromatids previously entrapped by centromeric cohesins. In association with the connecting kleisin subunit is a fourth cohesin subunit, Scc3 in budding yeast or SA1/SA2 in human cells. Similar SMC-kleisin complexes are the basis of the condensins that compact chromosomes in preparation for chromosome segregation. In one model for sister chromatid cohesion, the SMC-kleisin complexes are envisaged to form a ring-like structure that topologically entraps sister chromatids from the time of their generation, following DNA synthesis, up to their separation at anaphase [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another model has the rings interacting with one another and with one sister chromatid apiece in order to snap sister chromatids together [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
</p>
      <p>There has been increasing appreciation of wider functional roles for proteins that regulate sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Individual subunits of cohesin and condensin complexes have been implicated in gene regulation, and accessory proteins that facilitate how they work may also have diverse functions. Among several proteins that interact with cohesins are those that load previously assembled cohesins onto chromosomes. In
<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> the Scc2 and Scc4 proteins form a complex for this purpose. Both proteins are essential, and in
<italic>scc2</italic> or
<italic>scc4</italic> mutants cohesin complexes form normally, but they do not bind to centromeres or chromosome arms, resulting in precocious sister chromatid separation (PSCS) [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
</p>
      <p>In
<italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> the loading of cohesin complexes occurs just before the initiation of DNA replication and at frequent intervals along the chromosomesâalthough shortly after being loaded cohesins appear to relocate to regions between convergent transcription units [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because hydrolysis of ATP bound to the Smc1/Smc3 heads is essential for cohesin loading, the function of Scc2-Scc4 has been suggested to stimulate the required ATP hydrolysis [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In more complex metazoan cells, loading of cohesins is mostly achieved in the G1 phase, although it can commence at the end of mitosis. In egg extracts from
<italic>Xenopus laevis,</italic> the assembly of the pre-replication complex is required for loading of Scc2 onto the chromatin and for efficient cohesin loading [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
</p>
      <p>Consistent with its essential function in regulating sister chromatid cohesion, Scc2 has been well conserved during evolution, and orthologs can be identified in apparently all eukaryotes where there is sufficient sequence information. Scc2 and other well-studied fungal orthologs, including
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> Mis4 and
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Coprinus cinereus</named-content> Rad9, are known to be involved in various aspects of chromosome function and double-strand DNA repair [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Metazoan orthologs of Scc2 have recently been implicated in regulating sister chromatid cohesion, such as
<named-content content-type="genus-species">X. laevis</named-content> XScc2,
<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Nipped-B, and human delangin [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
</p>
      <p>Some of the metazoan Scc2 orthologs were initially identified as developmental regulators. Nipped-B is known to regulate
<italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> and
<italic>cut,</italic> a homeobox gene important in wing and limb development, and is envisaged to facilitate interaction between the promoter and remote enhancers of such genes [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Delangin, the product of the
<italic>NIPBL</italic> (
<italic>Nipped-B</italic>-like) gene, is abnormally expressed in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a rare congenital malformation that is characterized by growth and mental retardation, specific craniofacial and limb abnormalities, and abnormalities in a variety of other organs and tissues [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for a recent review). The precise mechanism of action of Nipped-B and delangin in developmental gene regulation is uncertain. Nipped-B and cohesin subunits appear to have opposing effects on target gene expression leading to the idea that Nipped-B and orthologs (sometimes called adherins) also facilitate localized or temporary unloading of cohesin to allow long range gene activation [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
</p>
      <p>The structures of Scc2 orthologs provide few clues as to how they function in cells. A large C-terminal domain, spanning about 1,300â1,500 amino acids in the different family members, is comparatively strongly conserved and is expected to be functionally significant. The vast majority of CdLS-associated missense mutations map to this region in delangin (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and the domain contains several HEAT repeats, motifs that have been implicated in proteinâprotein interaction. HEAT repeats have been found in a variety of chromosome-associated proteins, including several other classes of proteins associated with cohesins and condensins [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The N-terminal region of Scc2 orthlogs has expanded in size during evolution, but is comparatively poorly conserved.
</p>
      <p>Scc2 has been shown to physically interact with cohesin [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but the wider (evolutionary) significance of its interaction with Scc4 has been enigmatic. In contrast to Scc2, Scc4 appears at first sight to have been very poorly conserved during evolution [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using a Scc4 protein query to screen protein and translated nucleotide sequence databases, standard BLAST analyses identify significant sequence matches in a very restricted group of organisms (see below). Other than Scc4, only a few proteins have been reported to interact with members of the Scc2 protein family. Mammalian HP1 heterochromatin proteins have been shown to bind to delangin sequences, but the interaction motif in the delangin sequence is located in a comparatively poorly conserved N-terminal region [

      <p>In order to explore the function of the Nipped-B and delangin developmental regulators, we sought proteins that interact with them. In the current study we show that Nipped-B and delangin interact respectively with the products of the
<italic>D. melanogaster CG4203</italic> and human
<italic>KIAA0892</italic> genes. The latter two genes have not previously been studied, but they have recently been recognized to be orthologs of

<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We have carried out PSI-BLAST analyses that show that MAU-2 and its metazoan orthologs are evolutionarily related to yeast Scc4. We also present evidence that the human MAU-2 protein is functionally, as well as evolutionarily, related to Scc4, and that MAU-2 regulates chromosome segregation in
<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> Finally, we show that
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Xenopus tropicalis</named-content> MAU-2 and delangin are involved in similar developmental pathways. The data obtained indicate that metazoan Scc4 homologs provide an unanticipated link between sister chromatid cohesion and the guidance of cell and axon migration.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), possibly as a consequence of artificial over-expression. Nuclei that had been isolated from the transfected cells and extracted in Triton X-100 continued to show a high content of the GFP fusion protein (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, bottom panel), suggesting that this protein could be bound to chromatin. Polyclonal antisera raised against a GST-human MAU-2 fusion protein (see

The immunoprecipitation fraction from immunoprecipitating the GFP-human MAU-2 fusion protein reveals a specific band at Ë100 kDa (arrow) that is not found in the negative control sample.

        <p>The wider (evolutionary) significance of Scc4 has been difficult to gauge. Whereas orthologs of Scc2 can readily be detected in apparently any eukaryote where there is sufficient sequence information, Scc4 appears at first sight to have been comparatively poorly conserved during evolution [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Searching contemporary sequence databases using standard BLASTP or tBLASTN with a Scc4 protein query identifies significant matching to sequences from a very limited number of organisms, all of them members of the hemiascomycetes group of fungi. They include various
<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and
<italic>Kluymoveres</italic> species,
<named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida glabrata</named-content> and

<italic>Neurospora</italic> species or
<italic>S. pombe,</italic> or in any animal or plant genome (unpublished data). The comparable sizes of Scc4 (624 amino acids) and members of the metazoan MAU-2 family (593â632 amino acids) suggested that they could nevertheless be related. To identify metazoan homologs of Scc4 we used PSI-BLAST ([
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], see
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The search converged after five rounds identifying 11 homologous proteins from various yeast species. The highest scoring human protein was KIAA0892, the human MAU-2 ortholog, with a score of 36 bits, corresponding to a non-significant E-value of 2.6.
</p>
        <p>Although one would expect matches with the above score by chance, the match was in the N-terminal region of both Scc4 and human MAU-2, which is the most conserved region in the yeast homologs. To validate the above finding, we started with the human MAU-2 sequence and carried out a reciprocal PSI-BLAST search to see if we could identify Scc4. In the first round, vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant homologs of MAU-2 were identified. By round three a number of the yeast homologs of Scc4, identified above, were found confirming the relationship of Scc4 with the metazoan MAU-2 family. The alignments of the homologs identified show that the N-terminal sequences of the metazoan MAU-2 family members are the sequences most evolutionarily related to Scc4 (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and are likely to be of evolutionarily ancient functional significance. In round four a large number of tetratricopeptide repeat proteins were identified, suggesting that Scc4 family members are composed of tetratricopeptide repeats, structural bi-helical repeats implicated in proteinâprotein interactions [

Chromatin fractions prepared from aliquots collected at 0, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 h were subjected to Western blotting with anti-SMC3 and anti-SCC1 antibodies to monitor loading of cohesin on the chromatin. Histone H3 was used as a loading control (lower panel). The intensity of the bands was quantified as described in
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.
</p>
            <p>(C) Left panels: Western blotting of whole Hela cell extracts that had been subjected to M1 siRNA knockdown or controls shows that the effects seen in (B) did not result from non-specific knockdown of cohesins (SMC3 and SCC1). Panels to the right: to assess the integrity of the cohesin complexes present in the supernatant, SMC3 was immunoprecipitated (see
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitation of SCC1 was tested. The ratio of SMC3:SCC1 present in the immunoprecipitated samples is identical in negative control cells and cells subjected to human MAU-2 knockdown indicating that the integrity of the cohesin complexes is not affected. In the negative control there is a marked difference in the amount of immunoprecipitated SMC3 between time 0 and 3 h later, as in these cells cohesin gets loaded on the chromatin and there is fewer SMC3 available for immunoprecipitation in the supernatant (see B). In contrast, in cells subjected to human MAU-2 this difference is notably smaller, as in these cells cohesin fails to load on the chromatin to a comparable extent (see B).
</p>
            <p>(D) Cohesin-loading defects observed in cells subjected to human MAU-2 knockdown are not the result of cell-cycle arrest. HeLa cells were treated as in (B) and aliquots were collected at 0 and 3.5 h. The cell-cycle profile of the cell population in each sample was analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>

        <p>We followed up by asking whether, like Scc4, human MAU-2 is also involved in loading cohesins onto chromatin. HeLa cells subjected to human MAU-2 knockdown were synchronized in G2/M by nocodazole treatment and then released to progress into the cell cycle. Aliquots taken at regular intervals from cells released from the nocodazole block were fractionated to generate chromatin and supernatant fractions (see
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) that were then tested for the presence of the cohesin subunits SMC3 and SCC1. As can be seen in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, following the release from the nocodazole block, cohesin subunits start to be very quickly loaded on the chromatin in the control cells (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, upper and middle panel, left) but fail to do so in cells in which human MAU-2 had been knocked down using the M1 oligonucleotide (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, upper and middle panels, right). The cohesins (SMC3 and SCC1) in the supernatant could be readily co-immunoprecipitated suggesting that the complexes still form normally after knockdown of human MAU-2 (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, right panels). In the samples from control cells there is a difference between the amounts of cohesins immunoprecipitated at times 0 h and 3 h, respectively, but this difference is less obvious in the samples from cells in which human MAU-2 has been knocked down (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, bottom right panels). In accordance with the results in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, cohesins are loaded on the chromatin in the control cells leaving less of them to be immunoprecipitated from the supernatant. Conversely, cohesins accumulate in the supernatant from the knocked down cells; therefore, the difference is much smaller between the amounts of cohesins immunoprecipitated at the two time points (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, bottom right panels). The above effects did not result from non-specific knockdown of the cohesins (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, left panels) or failure of the cells to progress through the cell cycle following siRNA knockdown (

        <title>Evolutionary Conservation of the Scc2 and Scc4 Protein Families</title>
        <p>The precise roles of metazoan Scc2 and Scc4 homologs remain to be elucidated. Cross-species comparisons for the two protein families are instructive. First, there is the apparently striking difference in evolutionary conservation. Strong conservative selection of much of the protein sequence means that Scc2 can readily be detected in apparently all eukaryotes where there is adequate sequence information. In contrast, standard BLASTP and tBLASTN searches can identify Scc4 homologs only in certain fungal species that are closely related to
<italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Nevertheless, the PSI-BLAST analyses have shown that Scc4 has more distantly related homologs, including a previously unstudied
<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> homolog.
</p>
        <p>Part of the difference in evolutionary conservation of these two protein families could relate to differential requirements for protein interaction. Multiple candidate protein partners are revealed following screens for protein partners using Nipped-B [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or delangin (our unpublished data), and it may be that the conserved C-terminal domain is under strong selection pressure to recognize various proteins and/or play a vital role in cohesin binding [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, reciprocal screens using CG4203, the
<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> MAU-2 ortholog [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or human MAU-2 (present study), have revealed a single protein partner: Nipped-B or delangin, respectively. If Scc4 does not directly bind cohesins, perhaps early in eukaryote evolution the only selection pressure on Scc4 was to recognize and bind Scc2. The resulting comparative lack of selection pressure could have allowed very considerable species divergence in Scc4 sequence. However, the marked sequence conservation of Scc4 homologues in some metazoan lineages may reflect subsequent acquisition of additional essential functions (see below).

        <title>Evolution of Function in the Scc2 Protein Family</title>
        <p>Fungal Scc2 family members have been well studied and have been shown to regulate various aspects of chromosome function, including sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and double-strand DNA repair (see Introduction and summary table in [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Recently, metazoan homologs have also been implicated in sister chromatid cohesion (see
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>), but initial investigations focused on their roles in early development.
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> was isolated in a screen to identify factors that regulate long-range activation of
<italic>Drosophila cut;</italic> the
<italic>cut</italic> gene is activated by a remote enhancer located 85 kb upstream, and this activation is regulated by
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, unlike for other
<italic>cut</italic> activators, the effect of
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> is much more significant when
<italic>cut</italic> expression is limited by insertion of a
<italic>gypsy</italic> transposon between
<italic>cut</italic> and its enhancer, than when components of the enhancer are deleted. The effect of the inserted
<italic>gypsy</italic> transposon is to act as an insulator, and because mutations in
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> have their greatest effect when
<italic>cut</italic> activation is compromised by
<italic>gypsy</italic> insulator action, the normal Nipped-B protein has been envisaged to facilitate interaction between the remote enhancer and promoter of
<italic>cut.</italic> A similar situation applies to activation of another
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> target gene,
<italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other target genes remain to be identified, but genetic studies show that some
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> mutations suppress certain
<italic>Notch</italic> mutant phenotypes [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Delangin was identified by investigating the molecular basis of a developmental malformation, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and can be expected to be functionally similar to Nipped-B.
</p>
        <p>While roles in basic chromosomal function have been conserved in the Scc2 protein family, a key question concerns the extent to which the roles in gene regulationâthat are apparent for Nipped-B and expected for vertebrate delanginsâare metazoan novelties. Gene regulation in metazoan cells, unlike in simple eukaryotic cells such as the budding yeast, often involves interaction between promoters and
<italic>cis</italic>-acting transcriptional activators and repressors that may be separated by long distances, often tens or hundreds of kb. In addition to architectural factors like HMG proteins that facilitate such interactions over short distances (hundreds of base pairs), other factors are required to support interactions over long distances in metazoan cells, and the screen that identified
<italic>Nipped-B</italic> was carried out to identify factors of this type. It is possible, therefore, that during metazoan evolution Scc2-type proteins became much more important in gene regulation while continuing to fulfill ancestral functions in chromosomal regulation. However, there is a close relationship between sister chromatid cohesion and transcriptional silencing in unicellular yeasts (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and references therein), and Scc2-type proteins in simple eukaryotes could also be involved in gene regulation.

      <sec id="s3c">
        <title>Evolution of Function in the Scc4 Protein Family</title>
        <p>While overall sequence divergence between Scc4 family members has generally been much more marked than between Scc2 family members, the role in sister chromatid cohesion and cohesin loading onto chromatin seems to have been conserved from budding yeast to humans. Consistent with this, the RNAi studies in
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> show that
<italic>mau-2</italic> interacts with
<italic>pqn-85</italic> and with
<italic>scc-3</italic> in regulating chromosome segregation. Further evidence comes from fission yeast where the product of the
<italic>SPAC1687.18c</italic> gene, which we have identified as a highly diverged
<italic>Scc4</italic> homolog (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g004">Figure 4</xref>), has recently been found to bind to Mis4, the
<named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> Scc2 ortholog, and to function in cohesin loading (J. P. Javerzat, personal communication).
</p>
        <p>Although from a broad metazoan perspective, MAU-2 sequence conservation does not at first appear to be so high, the degree of sequence conservation is very pronounced in more complex metazoans and vertebrates. The sequence identity between essentially full-length human and
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> MAU-2 is only 21%, somewhat less than the 37% identity between the conserved C-terminal domains of delangin and its
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> ortholog PQN-85. However, almost full-length comparisons between human MAU-2 and more complex metazoan orthologs give high sequence identities as follows:
<named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>, 49%; sea urchin,
<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus,</italic> 67%;
<italic>X. tropicalis,</italic> 96%; and chick, 97% (see the
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Supporting Information</xref> section below for sequence accession numbers and comments).
</p>
        <p>The latter figures are much higher than those obtained in equivalent ortholog comparisons for even the highly conserved C-terminal domain of delangin (unpublished data). The data are consistent with increased selection pressure in complex metazoans to maintain sequence conservation across essentially the full-length sequence of Scc4 homologs. The participation of a
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> Scc4 homolog in axon and cell migration guidance was unexpected, and it will be important to test if other metazoan homologs have similar functions. Whatever the originâwhether acquisition of an additional essential function in metazoans or variation of an ancestral functionâthe very high sequence identities between the Scc4 homologs of complex metazoans may reflect the increasing importance of ensuring correct migration of axons and cells in complex metazoans.
</p>
        <p>From
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040242-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the
<named-content content-type="genus-species">X. tropicalis</named-content> homolog appears to function in the early embryo in developmental pathways that are similar to those in which delangin participates. A large-scale morpholino antisense oligonucleotide knockdown approach has identified similar phenotypes for knockdown of mRNA specifying a variety of other proteins, including the 14-1-3â3 and Emsy genes (Rana et al., unpublished data). However, RNAi knockdown of
<italic>Drosophila</italic> MAU-2 (see
<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) failed to elicit any obvious developmental phenotype, possibly as a result of ineffective knockdown, or possibly because of gene-dosage differences between species.

        <title>Sister Chromatid Cohesion, Developmental Gene Regulation, and Pathogenesis</title>
        <p>The dual nature of the role of metazoan Scc4 homologs in regulating both chromosomal functions and developmental processes mirrors that of the metazoan Scc2 homologs, and there appears to be functional co-operation between members of the two families in both chromosomal and developmental regulation. A variety of other genes that are directly involved in sister chromatid cohesion or chromosome condensation (or that are paralogs of such) are now also known to play important roles in gene/developmental regulation. Recent examples include the
<italic>ESCO2</italic> gene that is involved in establishing sister chromatid cohesion and that is a locus for a developmental malformation, Roberts syndrome [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], Scc1 homologs with distinct developmental functions in
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and clock gene paralogs that regulate chromosome cohesion in
<named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] (see also other studies cited in [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]).
</p>
        <p>The data obtained in the present study also raised the question of whether human MAU-2 could, like delangin, be involved in pathogenesis. The precise roles of delangin and Nipped-B, and the connection between their involvement in sister chromatid cohesion and developmental gene regulation, remain to be elucidated. Mutations in
<italic>NIPBL</italic> that cause CdLS are thought to be predominantly heterozygous loss of function mutations (see [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). The ensuing reduced dosage of delangin could conceivably result in increased apoptosis during early development with loss of key tissue progenitor cells. Another possibility depends on whether, in addition to its general function in loading cohesins onto chromosomes, delangin could also regulate target genes by facilitating transient unloading of cohesins. Here, a failure to unload cohesins from regions that need to be transcribed could result in transcriptional defects in certain target genes that result in CdLS [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consistent with this idea, a special
<italic>Drosophila pds5</italic> mutation that decreases cohesin chromosomal binding increases
<italic>cut</italic> gene expression during wing margin development [
<xref rid="pbio-0040242-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
</p>
        <p>The link between sister chromatid cohesion and regulation of cell and axon migration that has now been revealed by analysis of the metazoan MAU-2 family was unexpected. Conceivably, by affecting cell division, sister chromatid cohesion could affect the asymmetric segregation between daughter cells of determinants of cell fate. Altered cell fates of neurons and of cells (e.g., epidermal cells), which are the substrates on which axons migrate, could affect cell and axon migrations. Another possibility is that in addition to its role in chromosome segregation, MAU-2 also functions in a diferent, relatively independent, pathway that involves proteins directly linked to cell and axon migration.</p>
        <p>Conservation of Scc2-Scc4 interaction in metazoans and phenotype similarity following knockdown of MAU-2 and delangin in

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040242-t001">Table 1</xref>. Mutation screening was carried out by direct sequencing using the MegaBACE ET system (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and, where exons were suitably small, by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)âheteroduplex analysis using standard protocols. In the latter case we denatured PCR products, size fractionated them in 1x MDE gel (BioWhittaker, Rockland, Maryland, United States) containing 5% glycerol and 0.6% TBE buffer at 300 V for Ë 20 h (depending on fragment size), and visualized them by silver staining. Any samples that had differences relative to an unaffected control were subsequently sequenced.
