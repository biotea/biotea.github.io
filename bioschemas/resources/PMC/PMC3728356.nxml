      <abstract>
        <p>In this study, a five-generation Chinese family (family F013) with progressive autosomal dominant hearing loss was mapped to a critical region spanning 28.54 Mb on chromosome 9q31.3-q34.3 by linkage analysis, which was a novel DFNA locus, assigned as DFNA56. In this interval, there were 398 annotated genes. Then, whole exome sequencing was applied in three patients and one normal individual from this family. Six single nucleotide variants and two indels were found co-segregated with the phenotypes. Then using mass spectrum (Sequenom, Inc.) to rank the eight sites, we found only the <italic>TNC</italic> gene be co-segregated with hearing loss in 53 subjects of F013. And this missense mutation (c.5317G&gt;A, p.V1773M ) of <italic>TNC</italic> located exactly in the critical linked interval. Further screening to the coding region of this gene in 587 subjects with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) found a second missense mutation, c.5368A&gt;T (p. T1796S), co-segregating with phenotype in the other family. These two mutations located in the conserved region of <italic>TNC</italic> and were absent in the 387 normal hearing individuals of matched geographical ancestry. Functional effects of the two mutations were predicted using SIFT and both mutations were deleterious. All these results supported that <italic>TNC</italic> may be the causal gene for the hearing loss inherited in these families. <italic>TNC</italic> encodes tenascin-C, a member of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is present in the basilar membrane (BM), and the osseous spiral lamina of the cochlea. It plays an important role in cochlear development. The up-regulated expression of <italic>TNC</italic> gene in tissue repair and neural regeneration was seen in human and zebrafish, and in sensory receptor recovery in the vestibular organ after ototoxic injury in birds. Then the absence of normal tenascin-C was supposed to cause irreversible injuries in cochlea and caused hearing loss.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>There are a total of 278 million people suffering from hearing loss in the world, while in China the number amounts to 2.78 million. More than 60% of cases can be attributed to genetic causes and inherited across generations. Approximately 70% of hereditary hearing loss is nonsyndromic and caused by monogenic mutations. About 22â25% of them is autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (ADNSHL) <xref rid="pone.0069549-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To date, more than 60 loci and 27 responsible genes for autosomal dominant hearing loss had been identified (hereditary Hearing Loss homepage, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/">http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/</ext-link>). Most of these genes were identified through the traditional positional cloning and sequencing each gene in the critical interval one by one according to the gene function and expression pattern. The scope of this method however, is limited, especially in situations where there are a large number of genes in the mapped region. However, recent advances in exome sequencing (i.e., sequencing of all protein-coding regions of the genome) approach has shown the sensitivity and accuracy in the identification of the causal genes of several rare monogenic diseases such as Miller syndrome <xref rid="pone.0069549-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, especially in diseases inherited in recessive pattern. However, exome sequencing is an unbiased method to all genes. It adds the difficulties in identifying the heterozygous mutation responsible for autosomal dominant disease. Family-based linkage analysis could map the responsible gene in a special region, which is a more accurate compared to exome sequencing. Thus combinational strategy using linkage analysis and exome sequencing provides a powerful and affordable means to identify causative genes especially in autosomal dominant mode.</p>
      <p>Here we report a five-generation Chinese family (family F013) with autosomal dominant hereditary hearing loss mapped on chromosome 9q31.3-34.3 (28.54 Mb) in 2004, where there are 398 predicted and reported genes. Six years later after gene mapped, we successfully identified a novel causative gene for this type of hearing loss in family F013, <italic>TNC</italic> (Tenascin-C, <bold>NC</bold>_000009.11, NM_002160.2, NP_002151.2), applying the combined strategy of linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing. The causal role of this gene was supported by several lines: (I) the co-segregation of mutation with the phenotype; (II) its absence in 387 unaffected individuals of matched geographical ancestry; (III) the conservative nature of the mutation site; (IV) identification of another missense mutation of <italic>TNC</italic> in a two-generation Chinese hearing loss family; (V)<italic>TNC</italic> encoding protein, tenascin-C is a member of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein, and there have some reports about the pathological function of ECM proteins in hereditary hearing loss, such as Usherin <xref rid="pone.0069549-Adato1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and cochlin <xref rid="pone.0069549-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. (VI) Tenascin-C expresses under basilar membrane (BM) in cochlea, and is important for auditory development and self-recovery from injuries. BM proteins (laminin <xref rid="pone.0069549-Pillers1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and collagen 4 <xref rid="pone.0069549-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>) have been reported involved in hearing loss.</p>

All participants underwent clinical and audiological evaluation, including physical examination, pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, acoustic reflex, ABRs and DPOAE. The audiological data were evaluated based on the criteria established by European Working Group on Genetics of Hearing loss. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was also performed on some subjects to verify whether the family members had other complications other than hearing disorders. Environmental factors were also excluded as causes of hearing loss.</p>

        <p>Two-point linkage between the disease locus and the markers was evaluated using the MILNK program of the LINKAGE software package (version 5.1). The disease was assumed to be an autosomal dominant disorder with a disease allele frequency of 0.0001 (an educated guess based on previous genetic epidemiological data). The allelic penetrance was set at 90% considering the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary hearing loss. For the microsatellite marker loci, equal allele frequencies were used. The genome-wide scan genotypic data of the 11 affected individuals were also analyzed using GeneHunter to obtain multipoint LOD scores. Haplotype analysis was constructed with the Cyrillic software version 2.1 (Cyrillic Software, Wallingford, UK).</p>

        <p>Twenty-two of the 53 subjects in F013 were enrolled in the linkage study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069549-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The genome-wide linkage analysis of F013 located the deafness gene on the long arm of chromosome 9.

We obtained an average of 4.7 billion bases of sequence per individual as paired-end, 90 bp reads, and about 65% of the total bases mapped to the exomes with a mean coverage of 50-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s009">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s002">Figure S2</xref>). At this depth of coverage, 98% of the targeted region was sufficiently covered to pass our thresholds for variant calling. By exome sequencing, we detected 240 coding insertions or deletions (Indels). To identify SNPs, we used SOAPsnp software and bioinformatics pipeline. A total of 7,580 non-synonymous/splice acceptor and donor site/insertions or deletions (NS/SS/Indel) variants were detected in at least one of the affected individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s010">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s011">Table S5</xref>). After comparison with SNP databases, including dbSNP132, the 1000 Genome Project (10/2010 release), HapMap data (HapMap 8/2010 release), and YH (Asian), we identified 6 rare SNPs and 2 indels in transcribed sequences that co-segregated with the phenotype in these 4 subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069549-t002">Table 2</xref>). Among them, a missense mutation c.5317G&gt;A (p.V1773M) in exon 19 of the <italic>TNC</italic> gene, is just located in the critical linked region of 9q31.3-34.3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0069549-t003">Table 3</xref>). We screened the whole exon19, where the variant located in <italic>TNC</italic>, in all 53 members of F013 using Sanger sequencing. Results found that all 11 patients were heterozygous for this mutation and none of the clinically unaffected family members carried this variant, which is co-segregated with the hearing loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069549-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, six candidate SNPs and 2 indels in transcribed sequences found in exome sequencing were also genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform (Sequenom, Inc.) in all family members obtained. Except the mutation c.5317G&gt;A in <italic>TNC</italic>, none of the other seven variants were co-segregated with the hearing loss.</p>

        <p>Multiple sequence alignment in other organisms (including human, macaque, chimpanzee, elephant, pig, platypus and zebrafish) revealed the mutation was present in a highly conserved position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We assessed the functional impact of p.V1773M on the protein using SIFT (version 4.0.3) and Align-GVGD software, and this mutation was predicted to be functionally deleterious. We used PolyPhen-2 software (DeLano Scientific LLC) to study 3D structure of the protein, and found that mutation (p.V1773M) changes the shape of the protein in this region, which may alter its ability to bind to other molecules. This mutation was located in an exon that was present in all RNA isoforms. There is no total length of tenascin precursor in Protein Data Bank (PDB), and we took the FN-III domain structure in rat that is similar to <italic>TNC</italic> sequence as the template (PDB: 1TDQ, PubMed: 15296743, Sup. file 1) After comparison, the mutation located in the rim of conjunction of two conservative domains in FN-III domain, which was the most functional part of tenascin-C for ligand binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <p>To confirm the results, we sequenced the whole 28 exons of <italic>TNC</italic> gene in 587 subjects with SNHL that have unknown genes. We found a second mutation in a three-generation Chinese hearing loss family (Family 6957 with 5 patients; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s005">Figure S5</xref>) in exon19 of <italic>TNC</italic>, which was a missense variant c.5368A&gt;T transition (p.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The F013 has been mapped to 9q33 by linkage analysis six years ago by our team, but the causative gene was not identified because of too many candidate genes involved in this mapped locus. This caveat is common and unconquerable in the study of hereditary hearing loss because of the intrinsic defect of traditional method. Now, about 80 loci in 155 for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSSHL) including 30 dominant NSSHL loci remain to be identified. Strong power of exome sequencing technology in identifying causative gene has been exemplified for monogenic disease <xref rid="pone.0069549-Ng1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and gradually for common diseases <xref rid="pone.0069549-Stransky1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Previous study showed that this new technique is especially fit for diseases in recessive inheritance mode, because in domiant inherited mode the heterozygosity will be causative and be clinically effective and too many functional SNPs would be identified. However, exome sequencing is unbiased to detect all functional variants in coding region. After filteration by public data and familial controls, damaging mutations emerged. Then, by the help of exact location of linkage analysis, redundant mutations will be excluded and we could detect the causal mutation underlie F013. Using this strategy, combination the mapped interval by classical linkage analysis with results of exome sequencing, only one causative mutation were confirmed. The combination of linkage analysis and exome sequencing provided strong evidence that <italic>TNC</italic> may be responsible for hearing loss in this family. The causative evidence was elaborated in introduction and concrete procedures could be seen in methods and results.</p>
      <p>
<italic>TNC</italic> gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein and has a highly conserved sequence in different species, for example, the sequence originated from the mouse has about 74% human similarity and the zebrafish is about 72%. The gene product tenascin-C has a structure like hexabrachion, composing of a TA domain, a linear array of epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) repeats, a series of fibronectin type III (FN-III) domains, and a globular domain at the terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069549-g002">Figure 2G</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0069549-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The most important functional part of the protein is the FN-III domains. We used Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive to predict the protein structure change of Tenascin-C with mutations. We found that both mutations located in the rim the conjunction of two conservative domains in FN-III domain, which was the most functional part of tenascin-C for ligand binding. Mutation p.V1773M changes the shape of the protein in this region and tightens the distance of two adjacent FN-III domains, which may alter its ability to bind to other molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0069549.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Although p.V1773M was recorded in dbSNP as a known variant, it is a rare SNP with very low frequency as shown in the ssSNP report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ss.cgi?ss=ss342281564">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_ss.cgi?ss=ss342281564</ext-link>). The actual ratio was below 0.0005, and the number of subjects found by NCBI was 2 (2/4552â=â0.0004393). The similar artifact was also seen in the study from Walsh. They found a pathogenic mutation in dbSNP, but not in 768 controls. The reason was thought to be the use of uncurated variant database <xref rid="pone.0069549-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Tenascin-C, a glycoprotein, a member of the extracellular matrix (ECM), was expressed in the basilar membrane and the osseous spiral lamina in the human cochlear, which is one of the primary components in mammalian basilar membrane as collagen 4, laminin, nidogen, and dystroglycan. Because the basilar membrane in the inner ear regulates fluid and ion transport between the endolymph and perilymph <xref rid="pone.0069549-Anniko1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, mutated components of the basilar membrane could lead to disturbance of ionic homeostasis and result in hearing loss, as shown by laminin <xref rid="pone.0069549-Pillers1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> in nonsyndromic deafness and an altered expression of collagen IV chains in Alportâs syndrome <xref rid="pone.0069549-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. And other proteins in ECM have also been shown to be involved in hereditary hearing loss, for example, mutated Usherin caused Usher syndrome IIA and mutated collagen XI caused nonsyndromic deafness <xref rid="pone.0069549-McGuirt1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Tenascin-C managed the recovery of sensory receptors in vestibular organ in birds after ototoxic injury <xref rid="pone.0069549-Warchol1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The ability of spontaneous recovery after spinal lesion in adult zebrafish could also be explained by the promotion of tenascin-C <xref rid="pone.0069549-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. And some studies in human have also conducted the conclusion that tenascin-C play an important role in the tissue repair and restoration in skeletal system <xref rid="pone.0069549-Nakoshi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and in tissues remodeling after myocardial injury <xref rid="pone.0069549-ImanakaYoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Considering the remarkable sequence conservation in different species, it is speculated the similar impulse in repairment in human cochlea. Under mutated conditions, the altered protein couldnât bind to other extracellular matrix proteins, ligands and cell receptors, and the repair mechanism after reversible injuries would not work. The vulnerabilities of cochlea caused the accumulation of detriment and the hearing loss progressed.</p>
      <p>In summary, using a combination of linkage analysis and exome-sequencing enabled us to use a single pedigree to identify a novel hearing loss gene. These findings suggest the usefulness and decreased cost that whole exome-sequencing can provide for gene identification in hereditary NSHL and other dominant Mendelian diseases. Additionally the identification of <italic>TNC</italic> here adds new evidence for the importance of BM proteins in hereditary hearing loss.</p>
