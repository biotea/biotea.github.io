        <p>Lipoyl(Octanoyl) Transferase 2 (LIPT2) is a protein involved in the post-translational modification of key energy metabolism enzymes in humans. Defects of lipoic acid synthesis and transfer start to emerge as causes of fatal or severe early-onset disease. We show that the first 31 amino acids of the N-terminus of LIPT2 represent a mitochondrial targeting sequence and inhibition of the transit of LIPT2 to the mitochondrion results in apoptotic cell death associated with activation of the apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) current in normotonic conditions, as well as over-activation of the swelling-activated chloride current (IClswell), mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, caspase-3 cleavage and nuclear DNA fragmentation. The findings presented here may help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying derangements of lipoic acid biosynthesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Lipoylation is a post-translational modification involving five lipoate-dependent enzymes which catalyze essential redox reactions in humans. Two of these enzymes (Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH) play an essential role in mitochondrial energy metabolism, and three (branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage system, GCS) are involved in amino acid metabolism. The first four enzymes are collectively denoted as 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. The lipoate-dependent enzymes are multicomplex proteins, and lipoylation involves the E2 subunit/E3 binding protein and the H-protein of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and GCS, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Lipoic acid (6,8 dithiooctanoic acid) is a small hydrophobic molecule consisting of eight carbons and two sulfhydryl groups, first identified in association with PDH [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While being well characterized in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the biosynthesis of lipoic acid in eukaryotes is not completely understood and relies on recent studies in yeast. In eukaryotic cells, the activity of lipoate-dependent enzymes appears to rely exclusively on <italic>de novo</italic> intramitochondrial lipoic acid synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway, octanoic acidâthe precursor of lipoic acidâis synthesized from malonate and conjugated to an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Then, octanoic acid is transferred to the H protein of GCS system <italic>via</italic> action of lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2 (LIP2 in yeast; LIPT2, putative, in humans) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the reaction, the free carboxyl group of octanoic acid is attached <italic>via</italic> an amide linkage to the epsilon-amino group of a conserved lysine residue within a conserved lipoyl domain. Octanoylated H protein is the substrate for insertion of two sulfur atoms at C-6 and C-8 positions to obtain lipoylated H protein in a reaction catalyzed by the iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster protein lipoic acid synthetase (LIP5 in yeast; LIAS in humans). An additional enzyme (LIP3 in yeast; LIPT1 in humans) catalyzes the transfer of octanoic/lipoic acid to the E2 subunits of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

          <p>mtFAS generates octanoyl-ACP, that enters the lipoic acid biosynthesis pathway. The octanoyl moiety is then transferred from ACP to H or E2 proteins. Subsequently, insertion of two sulfur atoms occurs on the octanoyl moiety to generate lipoylated H or E2 proteins. 2-KGDH, Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; 2-OADH, 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; BCKDH, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase; GCS, glycine cleavage system; LA, lipoic acid; LIAS, lipoic acid synthetase; LIPT1, lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 1; LIPT2, lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2; mtFAS, mitochondrial fatty acidynthesis; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase.</p>

      <p>The relevance of lipoic acid biosynthesis in mammalians was elucidated by the use of cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or knockout mice [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in which the expression of key components of this pathway was compromised. These studies evidenced that mtFAS and lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins are tightly related and essential for mitochondrial function, cell survival and energy utilization. Lipoic acid biosynthesis defects were reported to be associated with human disease for the first time in 2011, when mutations in genes encoding for Fe-S cluster proteins (LIAS, MIM 60703) [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or proteins involved in their biogenesis (NFU1, MIM 608100; and BOLA3, MIM 613183) [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were identified as responsible for the patientsâ phenotype. Later, mutations affecting lipoic acid transfer pathway (LIPT1, MIM 610284) have also been described [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Patients with lipoic acid deficiency present common, early-onset clinical features such as psychomotor retardation, leukoencephalopathy and hypotonia; pulmonary hypertension and cardiomyopathy may also be present. Abnormalities of biochemical parameters include altered levels of organic acids (lactate, 2-ketoglutarate) and glycine, and PDH deficiency. The gravity of symptoms often results in fatalities [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Very recently, mutations involving the <italic>LIPT2</italic> gene (c.89T&gt;C; c.377T&gt;G) were identified by exome sequencing in a 8-year-old boy with encephalopathy, axial hypotonia and spasticity associated to mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in brain, impaired leucine metabolism and severely decreased PDH activity [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>A detailed understanding of structure, function, biogenesis and trafficking of proteins involved in the synthesis and transfer of lipoic acid is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of diseases resulting from lipoylation defects. Among the proteins involved in lipoic acid turnover, very little is known about LIPT2. LIPT2 function has been inferred by sequence similarity with the homologues genes in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<italic>lipB</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>LIP2</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, no experimental evidence to confirm the identity of the predicted mitochondrion transit peptide has been published. Curiously, a high throughput assay based on the mammalian two-hybrid method identified a direct protein interaction between the mouse homologue of LIPT2 and B-myc [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a nuclear regulator of transcription and cellular proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, LIPT2 protein expression has been referred to as cytoplasmic in most tissues and, on a cellular level, mainly localized in vesicles or the centrosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>, accessed on the 30<sup>th</sup> of January 2017). Therefore, we aimed to verify the expression and subcellular localization of LIPT2 in human cell lines, as well as the sequence of its mitochondrial targeting peptide. Here we show that amino acids 1â31 of LIPT2 target the protein to the mitochondrion. In addition, incorrect trafficking of LIPT2 to its physiological compartment leads to apoptotic cell death.</p>

        <p>The ORF coding for lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2 (LIPT2; NCBI sequence ID: NP_001138341.1) was cloned from HEK Blue cDNA into the pET3-His vector [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with the following primers: forward, <monospace>5â GAC GCA ACG GTG GGC ACG A 3â</monospace>, and reverse, <monospace>5â TGG CTC AGA GCT CAT GGT ATG TCC 3â</monospace>, and then subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of the bicistronic mammalian expression vector pIRES2 EGFP (Clontech). The use of vectors bearing the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) allows for the simultaneous expression of two individual proteinsâLIPT2 and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)âfrom a single bicistronic mRNA without the production of fusion proteins [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The single transfected cells can be individuated optically by detecting the fluorescent light emitted by EGFP (excitation maximum, 488 nm; emission maximum, 507 nm). When this vector was used for electrophysiology experiments, control experiments were conducted in cells transfected with the pIRES2-EGFP-EGFP vector, where an additional EGFP coding sequence was cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP expression vector [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>The ORF of LIPT2 was further subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of pEYFPC1 and pEYFPN1 mammalian expression vectors (Clontech), in frame with the ORF of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). These constructs encode for LIPT2 with EYFP fused to its N (EYFP-LIPT2) or C-terminus (LIPT2-EYFP), respectively.</p>
        <p>A construct encoding for LIPT2 void of the putative transit peptide to mitochondrion and with EYFP fused to its C-terminus (ÎmitotagLIPT2-EYFP) was obtained by amplification of the sequence coding for amino acids 32â231 of LIPT2 using the pET3-His vector as the template and the following primers: forward, <monospace>5â CAT TAC TCG AGA TGG CAG AGC CCG GCA TTG 3â</monospace>, and reverse, <monospace>5â ATA TAG GAT CCA CGT TGG GGC TGT CC 3â</monospace>, and cloning the PCR product into the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites of pEYFPN1 vector.</p>
        <p>To obtain EYFP with the LIPT2 putative mitochondrion transit peptide fused to its N-terminus (mitotag-EYFP), the sequence coding for the LIPT2 putative mitochondrion transit peptide (amino acids 1â31) was amplified by PCR using the pET3-His vector as the template and the following primers: forward, <monospace>5â ACC AGG CTC GAG AGA TGC GGC AAC CC 3â</monospace>, and reverse, <monospace>5â ATA CCT GGA TCC GCC TGC AGC CGC CGC 3â</monospace>, and cloned into the XhoI an BamHI restriction sites of pEYFPN1 vector, in frame with the ORF of EYFP.</p>
        <p>To obtain the mitotag-ÎATG-EYFP construct, the initiation of translation (START) codon (ATG) of the EYFP ORF was deleted from the sequence coding mitotag-EYFP with the QuikChange<sup>Â®</sup> site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturerâs protocol and the following primers: forward, <monospace>5â CCA CCG GTC GCC ACC GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG G 3â</monospace>, and reverse, <monospace>5â CCT CGC CCT TGC TCA CGG TGG CGA CCG GTG G 3â</monospace>.</p>
        <p>To obtain a construct encoding for the red fluorescent protein dsRed with the LIPT2 putative mitochondrion transit peptide fused to the N-terminus (mitotag-dsRed), the ORF coding for dsRed was amplified using the pIRES2 dsRed Express vector (Clontech) as the template ad the following primers: forward, <monospace>5â AAG ACT GGA TCC TGC CTC ATC AGA AGA CGT CA 3â</monospace> and reverse, <monospace>5â AGA GTC GCG GCC GCT ACA GGA ACA GGT GGT GG 3â</monospace>, and subcloned into the BamHI and NotI restriction sites of the mitotag-ÎATG-EYFP construct.</p>

        <title>Mitochondrial extraction</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial isolation was performed using the Qproteome Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Qiagen). HEK 293 Phoenix cells were seeded into two 15 cm diameter Petri dishes and cultured for 4 days. Cells (40 x 10<sup>6</sup>) were washed 3 times with 20 ml ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and then scraped in 10 ml PBS on ice. Cellular proteins were fractionated into cytosolic, microsomal and mitochondrial fractions according to manufacturerâs instruction. Shortly, following centrifugation at 500 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, the supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was washed with 1 ml 0.9% (w/v) ice-cold NaCl solution. Cells were then centrifuged again as described previously. For the following steps, all samples and buffers were incubated on ice and all centrifugation steps were performed at 4Â°C. After discarding the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml Lysis Buffer supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (HPIC, Thermo) to a final concentration of 1X and incubated at 4Â°C for 10 min with end-over-end mixing. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was carefully removed and saved for later use. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml Disruption Buffer supplemented with HPIC to a final concentration of 1X. Cell disruption was completed with 70 strokes in a 5 ml teflon homogenizer. The lysate was transferred to a 2 ml tube and centrifuged at 1000 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min to remove nuclei, cell debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant was transferred to a clean 1.5 ml tube and centrifuged at 6000 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet. The supernatant (microsomal fraction) was carefully removed and saved for later use. The mitochondrial pellet was processed according to the high-purity preparation procedure following the manufacturerâs instruction. Shortly, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 750 Î¼l Mitochondrial Purification Buffer. A separate 750 Î¼l aliquot of Mitochondrial Purification Buffer was added to a clean 2 ml tube and carefully overlayed with 500 Î¼l Disruption Buffer. The mitochondrial suspension was pipetted on top of the two phases and centrifuged at 14000 <italic>x g</italic> for 15 min. 1.5 ml of the supernatant were removed and the remaining solution was transferred to a new 2 ml tube. This solution was diluted with 1.5 ml Mitochondria Storage Buffer and centrifuged at 8000 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min. This step was repeated until a visible pellet of mitochondria formed at the bottom of the tube. For western blotting, the mitochondrial pellet was solubilized in 100 Î¼L 1X SDS-containing solubilization buffer (SSB) by vortexing for 1 min. Cytosolic and microsomal fractions were diluted 1:2 in 2X SSB. SSB (4X) contained 0.55 M SDS and 5.42 M glycerol in 0.5 M Trizma base, pH 6.8. SSB dilutions were obtained with water. Dithiothreitol was added fresh to 1X SSB to a final concentration of 1 mM. Protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay (Biorad).</p>

The resistance of the glass pipettes filled with the pipette solution and immersed in the bath solution was 3 to 8 MÎ©. Fast exchange of the hypertonic with the hypotonic bath solution was accomplished using a perfusion system with a flow rate of 5 ml/min and a bath volume of â¼300 Î¼l. For data acquisition, an EPC-10 (HEKA Elektronik, Germany) amplifier controlled by a Macintosh computer running the Patch Master (HEKA Elektronik, Germany) software was used. Access resistance as well as fast and slow capacitance were compensated and monitored throughout the recordings. All current measurements were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz. The cells were held at 0 mV, and step pulses of 400 ms duration were applied from 0 mV to +40 mV every 20 s to monitor current changes over time. To establish the current-to-voltage (I/V) relationship, step pulses of 500 ms duration were applied every 5 min from â120 mV to +100 mV in 20 mV increments from a holding potential of 0 mV. For data analysis, Fit Master (HEKA Elektronik, Germany) and Excel (Microsoft, USA) software were used. The current values (pA) were normalized to the membrane capacitance (pF) to obtain the current density (pA/pF), which is a measure of the current magnitude independent from the cell size.

The presence of white pixels in the merge image and the distribution of pixels along the diagonal in the scatter plots (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">2</xref>) are indicative of co-localization between the two signals. Similarly, the absence of white pixels in the merge image and the distribution of pixels along the x and y axes in the scatter plots are indicative of an absence of co-localization between the two signals. Colocalization was quantified as the Pearsonâs correlation coefficient [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (that may range from -1 to +1 indicating complete spatial exclusion or co-localization of two fluorescent signals, respectively), the overlap coefficient and the colocalization rate (that may range from 0 to +1 indicating complete spatial exclusion or co-localization of two fluorescent signals, respectively). Localization of EYFP, a water-soluble protein with apparent homogeneous distribution within nucleus and cytosol, was taken as an indicator of an absence of preferential colocalization with the mitochondria.</p>

        <title>LIPT2 is expressed in the mitochondrion</title>
        <p>To determine the subcellular localization of LIPT2, mitochondrial, cytosolic and microsomal fractions were prepared from total cellular protein extracts of native (untransfected) HEK 293 Phoenix cells and assayed for LIPT2 expression by western blot. Detectable levels of LIPT2 were found only in the complex IV-enriched mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>The antibody used in western blot analyses failed to detect endogenous LIPT2 expression by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Therefore, to confirm the subcellular localization of LIPT2 assessed by western blot and identify the domains determining the targeting to the mitochondrion, plasmids encoding the transfection marker EYFP fused either to the N or the C-terminus of LIPT2 (EYFP-LIP2 and LIPT2-EYFP, respectively) were generated and transfected in HeLa cells. The co-localization of EYFP-LIPT2, LIPT2-EYFP and the sole transfection marker EYFP with the mitochondria was determined 24, 48 and 72 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2Bâ2E</xref>). EYFP is a cytosolic protein and does not preferentially co-localize with the mitochondrion. The co-localization parameters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref>) evidenced that only LIPT2-EYFP reached the mitochondria. While not being obvious 24 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), the mitochondrial targeting of LIPT2-EYFP was first detected 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and was more evident 72 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Similar results were obtained with HEK 293 Phoenix cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These findings confirm that LIPT2 targets the mitochondrion. EYFP-LIPT2 did not reach the mitochondrial compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2Câ2E</xref>), suggesting that a free N-terminus is an essential requirement for LIPT2 mitochondrial targeting.</p>

Expression of the mitotag-EYFP construct in HeLa cells for 24â72 hours led to a clear fluorescent labeling of mitochondria. The extra-mitochondrial signal was reduced by removal of the initiation of translation (START) codon (ATG) of EYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These results show that LIPT2 amino acids 1â31 are sufficient for EYFP mitochondrial targeting but that a detectable amount of untagged EYFP can be produced if a START codon is located immediately downstream of the mitochondrial targeting sequence. Similar findings were obtained using the unrelated fluorescent protein dsRed instead of EYFP (data not shown), thus evidencing that LIPT2 amino acids 1â31 function as a mitochondrial targeting sequence independently of the protein to which they are fused.</p>

        <title>LIPT2 mitochondrial mis-targeting activates the swelling-activated chloride current IClswell</title>
        <p>The swelling-activated chloride current IClswell, which is stimulated after exposure of cells to an osmotic imbalance between the intracellular and the extracellular milieu, is an essential determinant of the ubiquitous homeostatic function of the Regulatory Volume Decrease (RVD) [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Accordingly, induction of AVD current is coupled to a facilitation of RVD and prevented by known blockers of IClswell [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Apoptosis inducers rapidly activate IClswell [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Cells were voltage clamped with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and initially kept in hypertonic solution (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mitochondria are evolutionary ancient organelles involved in multiple crucial functions of the eukaryotic cell, including energy production, synthesis of lipids and other biomolecules and orchestration of the apoptotic process. The human mitochondrial genome encodes only 13 of the over 1,000 mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, the large majority of the mitochondrial proteome is represented by nuclear encoded proteins translated on cytosolic ribosomes and actively imported into mitochondrial sub-compartments [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The classical type of mitochondrial targeting signal is represented by an N-terminally located presequence of 15â50 amino acids that forms positively charged amphipathic Î± helices. Sequence, net charge and structure of the presequence are critical for the interaction with the translocator of the outer and inner membrane (TOM and TIM) macromolecular complexes in a sequential manner. Once the preprotein reaches the mitochondrial matrix, the presequence is often proteolytically removed by mitochondrial processing peptidases (MPP). As many as 40% of all mitochondrial proteins do not possess N-terminal extensions, but include internal non-cleavable targeting signals which are variable in type and number [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. LIPT2 is a nuclear encoded protein of which the mitochondrion is the main location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and LIPT2 amino acids 1â31 represent its mitochondrial targeting presequence. Removal of amino acid 1â31 is sufficient to abrogate the mitochondrial targeting of LIPT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g003">Fig 3</xref>), therefore evidencing that the function of the targeting presequence cannot be fulfilled by internal signals. This concept is further supported by the evidence that the LIPT2 presequence can drive unrelated cytoplasmic proteins to the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g004">Fig 4</xref>). LIPT2 amino acids 1â31 are thus necessary and sufficient for protein targeting to the mitochondrion.</p>
      <p>The first 18 amino acids of the precursor to subunit IV of Cytochrome oxidase represent a classical signal sequence for protein import into the mitochondrion. This sequence can form an amphipathic Î± helix with positively charged residues (Arg 5, Arg 9, Lys 12 and Arg 16) on one side of the helix and non-polar residues on the other side [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, Arg residues are over-represented among the first 31 N-terminal amino acids of LIPT2. When this segment is organized into an Î± helix, those amino acid residues that would bear a positive charge at physiological pH (Arg 2, 7, 10, 13, 25, 28 and 29; pKa of the amino group of the side chain of Arg is 12.48) appear to be clustered on one face of the helix, with the non-polar residues (Met 1, Pro 4, Ala 5, Leu 8, Val 9, Leu 11, Gly 12, Pro 15, Leu 19, Leu 20, Leu 22, Trp 26, Leu 27 and Leu 30) on the opposite face (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), therefore nicely mirroring the characteristics of a classical signal sequence for protein import into the mitochondrial matrix.</p>
      <p>Given the mitochondrial localization of LIPT2, a direct molecular interaction with B-myc, which is a nuclear protein, is surprising [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Whether this interaction truly occurs in native cell systems or is a false positive generated by displacement of LIPT2 and/or B-myc from their physiological compartments due to the generation of fusion proteins (false positives are not uncommon with two-hybrid based protein-protein interaction screenings [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) remains to be established.</p>
      <p>Staining of mitochondria is often required to investigate their morphology, number and localization. Fluorescent staining of mitochondria in living cells with cationic dyes, such as rhodamine 123 and other patented molecules, requires an intact mitochondrial membrane potential [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, some of these dyes are not retained within the mitochondrion following cell fixation and/or permeabilization. Fusion constructs consisting of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of LIPT2 and the fluorescent proteins EYFP and DsRed were easily expressed in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Staining of the mitochondrial compartment by these fluorescent probes does not depend on the mitochondrial membrane potential and is therefore suitable for use in conditions where the mitochondrial membrane potential is altered, for example, following pharmacological treatment or in cell models of pathological conditions where mitochondrial function is compromised. Besides providing optimal signal-to-noise ratio, this strategy allows for fluorophore retention within the mitochondrial compartment after cell fixation and/or permeabilization and is therefore compatible with conventional sample processing for immunocytochemistry and other techniques and could in principle be used in combination with other established staining methods.</p>
      <p>Mitochondria control cell fate by inducing the apoptotic cascade following mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Mitochondria sequester holocytochrome c, an essential electron shuttle of the respiratory chain, in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Following MOMP, holocytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins are released into the cytosol, where they are thought to promote the activation of caspase-dependent and independent cell death pathways. The caspase activation cascade leads to the activation of caspase-3, a central executioner of apoptosis, partially or totally responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of several proteins in the late stages of the apoptotic process. Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation is the ultimate step on which caspase-dependent and independent cell death pathways culminate [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Based on this knowledge, we verified if the presence of the mitochondrial protein LIPT2 in extra-mitochondrial compartments triggers apoptosis. As already mentioned, cell shrinkage or apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) is one of the obligate initial events and most reproducible signs in the apoptotic process and is dependent upon normotonic activation of a chloride conductance resembling the hypotonicity-activated chloride current IClswell [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Activation of AVD current was detected in cells expressing a LIPT2 construct incapable of mitochondrial targeting (EYFP-LIPT2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Conversely, LIPT2 constructs of which the mitochondrial targeting was not affected (LIPT2 and LIPT2-EYFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g005">Fig 5</xref>) did not activate the AVD current. These evidences point to the fact that LIPT2 does not <italic>per se</italic> activate AVD, but AVD is triggered when LIPT2 fails to reach the mitochondria. This indicates that the presence of LIPT2 in an extra-mitochondrial compartment is capable of triggering apoptosis.</p>
      <p>The AVD and IClswell currents most likely rely on the same molecular entities. As RVD is dependent upon IClswell activation, induction of AVD is coupled to a facilitation of RVD [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. LIPT2 constructs incapable of mitochondrial targeting (EYFP-LIPT2 and ÎmitotagLIPT2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g006">Fig 6</xref>) led to an over-activation of IClswell current compared to what was observed with LIPT2 constructs with normal mitochondrial targeting (LIPT2 and LIPT2-EYFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Being that LIPT2 <italic>per se</italic> is unable of modulating IClswell magnitude and activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g007">Fig 7</xref>), these data indicate that IClswell is facilitated when LIPT2 does not reach the mitochondria and further support a role of LIPT2 in triggering AVD. Accordingly, increased expression of calreticulin and DNA fragmentation, hallmarks of the early and end stages of apoptosis respectively, were observed in cells expressing LIPT2 constructs incapable of mitochondrial targeting (EYFP-LIPT2 and ÎmitotagLIPT2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g008">Fig 8</xref>), therefore supporting the concept that apoptosis is triggered when LIPT2 fails to reach the mitochondria.</p>
      <p>Mutations in <italic>LIPT1</italic> and <italic>LIPT2</italic> genes begin to emerge as causes of infant death or severe disease [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and have been linked to loss of function of the corresponding proteins. One of the two mutations in <italic>LIPT2</italic> (c.T89C) described by Habarou et al. is predicted to lead to an amino acid substitution within the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the protein (p.Leu30Pro) and may therefore affect its trafficking to the mitochondrion. We described here that the presence of LIPT2 outside the mitochondrial compartment may lead to apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis is consistent with and may contribute to the pathological phenotype described in the context of dysfunction of the lipoic acid biosynthesis pathways.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, caspase-3 is an end-stage effector of mitochondrion, receptor and ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways and is activated by proteolytic cleavage [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We therefore verified if caspase-3 activation was observed in HEK 293 Phoenix cells expressing apoptosis-inducing LIPT2 constructs. Cleaved caspase-3 was detected in whole cell lysates derived from cells treated for 4 hours with 20 Î¼M staurosporine, an established inducer of apoptosis, and cells expressing EYFP-LIPT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), further supporting the activation of a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway following impeded LIPT2 mitochondrial trafficking.</p>
      <p>Whole-field measurements of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s006">S1 File</xref>) did not reveal significant differences following expression of EYFP-LIPT2 or LIPT2 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In line, oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s006">S1 File</xref>) was not significantly altered following expression of pro-apoptotic constructs or LIPT2 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, in case of LIPT2 silencing, mitochondrial function could have been preserved by residual LIPT2. Also, possible alterations in mitochondrial function by pro-apoptotic constructs could have been masked by a transfection efficiency lower than 100%. Indeed, determination of mitochondrial membrane potential on a single-cell level evidenced mitochondrial membrane potential collapse specifically in cells expressing apoptosis-inducing LIPT2 constructs (EYFP-LIPT2 and ÎmitotagLIPT2-EYFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179591.g009">Fig 9</xref>). These observations indicate that the mechanism by which the presence of LIPT2 outside the mitochondrion induces apoptotic cell death is most likely related to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
      <p>Apoptosis can be induced by ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, we verified if caspase-12 cleavage, a hallmark of ER-stress [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], could preferentially be detected in cells expressing apoptosis-inducing LIPT2 constructs (EYFP-LIPT2 and ÎmitotagLIPT2-EYFP). Cleavage of caspase-12 was detected in all transfected cells, and not in native (untransfected) cells, thus indicating that ER stress is more liked to the transfection <italic>per se</italic>, rather to the expression of specific constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). As mentioned above, various pro-apoptotic stimuli are capable of inducing the release of specific proteins, including holocytochrome c, from the mitochondrion, and the presence of mitochondrial proteins within the cytosolic compartment can unequivocally be considered as a marker of mitochondrial damage and initiation of apoptotic cell death [<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0179591.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated if LIPT2 can be retrieved within the cytosol following an apoptotic stimulus. HEK 293 Phoenix cells were treated with 20 Î¼M staurosporine or the vehicle, and the presence of LIPT2 and holocytochrome c in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions was assessed by western blot. As expected, holocytochrome c was retrieved only in the mitochondrial fraction of vehicle-treated cells and both in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of staurosporine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). However, LIPT2 was only retrieved in the mitochondrial fraction, and not in the cytosolic fraction, of staurosporine or vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179591.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These findings led us to conclude that LIPT2 is not released into the cytosol following an apoptotic stimulus. This is consistent with a localization of LIPT2 within the mitochondrial matrix, differently from holocytochrome c, which is retrieved in the intermembrane space of non-apoptotic cells.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The findings presented here show that LIPT2 is a protein expressed in the mitochondria of human cells. Amino acid 1â31 of LIPT2 represent the mitochondrial targeting sequence, and have been used to produce plasmid constructs that could be easily transfected in cells to obtain fluorescent labeling of mitochondria independent from the mitochondrial transmembrane potential.</p>
      <p>Prevention of transit of LIPT2 to the mitochondrion results in apoptotic cell death, as revealed by activation of the AVD current, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, caspase-3 cleavage and nuclear DNA fragmentation. Activation of AVD current in normotonic conditions was associated with over-activation of the chloride current IClswell elicited by a hypotonic challenge. We therefore suggest that over-activation of IClswell could be a useful tool to identify early stages of the apoptotic process.</p>
      <p>Alteration of the LIPT2 mitochondrial targeting sequence should be considered in evaluating the impact of mutations leading to lipoic acid biosynthesis defects in humans.</p>

          <title>Oxygen consumption in intact HEK 293 Phoenix cells determined by O2k high-resolution respirometry.</title>
          <p>(A) Representative traces of the respiration in intact cells. The blue line represents the oxygen concentration, the red line the oxygen flux. A coupling control protocol was applied after adding the cells into the O2k-chambers. (B) ROUTINE respiration (<italic>R</italic>) reflecting cellular oxygen consumption under near-physiological conditions. In this state, cells experience neither saturating substrate conditions nor are they challenged by elevated cellular ATP demand. (C) Free ROUTINE activity, calculated as the difference between <italic>R</italic> and LEAK (<italic>L</italic>) respiration (<italic>R</italic>-<italic>L</italic>). The latter represents the component of respiration not related to ATP production, but supporting proton transfer compensating for dissipative proton fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane. (D) Respiratory excess capacity, representing the difference between electron transfer system (ETS) capacity and <italic>R</italic>. ETS reflects maximum respiratory activity observed when the limitation imposed by the oxidative phosphorylation system is removed by uncoupling respiration from oxidative phosphorylation. All data for oxygen flow are corrected for residual oxygen consumption (obtained after the inhibition of the complexes I and III by rotenone and antimycin A, respectively) and for cell viability. Cells were transfected for 48 hours with the indicated constructs. Data are means Â± SEM of n = 4 cell cultures per experimental group. No statistically significant differences between groups were found, one-way ANOVA.</p>

          <title>LIPT2-induced apoptosis is not dependent on endoplasmic reticulum stress and LIPT2 is not released from the mitochondrion following induction of apoptosis.</title>
          <p>(A) HEK 293 Phoenix cells were transfected for 48 hours with the indicated constructs or left untransfected (native). Caspase-12 was immunodetected in whole cell lysates. Cleaved caspase-12 was retrieved in all samples from transfected cells, and not in native cells. The images are representative of 3 independent samples. (B) Untransfected HEK 293 Phoenix cells were treated either with 20 Î¼M staurosporine or the vehicle for 4 hours. Cytochrome c could be detected in the mitochondrial fractions and in the cytosolic fraction of staurosporine-treated cells, but not in the cytosolic fraction of vehicle-treated cells. (C) In the same samples shown in (B), endogenous LIPT2 could only be detected in the mitochondrial fractions, but not in the cytosolic fractions of staurosporine or vehicle-treated cells. In (B) and (C), the housekeeping protein Î²-actin was immunodetected as a loading control.</p>
