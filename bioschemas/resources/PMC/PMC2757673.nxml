      <abstract>
        <p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC or Sanfilippo syndrome type C (MPS IIIC, MIM #252930) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme, heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA: Î±-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT, EC 2.3.1.78), which catalyses transmembrane acetylation of the terminal glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate prior to their hydrolysis by Î±-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Lysosomal storage of undegraded heparan sulfate in the cells of affected patients leads to neuronal death causing neurodegeneration and is accompanied by mild visceral and skeletal abnormalities, including coarse facies and joint stiffness. Surprisingly, the majority of MPS IIIC patients carrying missense mutations are as severely affected as those with splicing errors, frame shifts or nonsense mutations resulting in the complete absence of HGSNAT protein.</p>
        <p>In order to understand the effects of the missense mutations in HGSNAT on its enzymatic activity and biogenesis, we have expressed 21 mutant proteins in cultured human fibroblasts and COS-7 cells and studied their folding, targeting and activity. We found that 17 of the 21 missense mutations in HGSNAT caused misfolding of the enzyme, which is abnormally glycosylated and not targeted to the lysosome, but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The other 4 mutants represented rare polymorphisms which had no effect on the activity, processing and targeting of the enzyme. Treatment of patient cells with a competitive HGSNAT inhibitor, glucosamine, partially rescued several of the expressed mutants.</p>
        <p>Altogether our data provide an explanation for the severity of MPS IIIC and suggest that search for pharmaceutical chaperones can in the future result in therapeutic options for this disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mucopolysaccharidosis III (also called Sanfilippo syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate <xref rid="pone.0007434-Neufeld1" ref-type="bibr">[reviewed in 1]</xref> and includes four allelic subtypes caused by the genetic deficiencies of heparan N-sulfatase (MPS III type A; MIM #252900), Î±-N-acetylglucosaminidase (MPS III type B; MIM #252920), heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA: Î±-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase or HGSNAT (MPS III type C; MIM #252930), and N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (MPS III type D; MIM #252940). The majority of MPS IIIC patients have severe clinical manifestations with onset in infancy or early childhood. They rapidly develop progressive and severe neurological deterioration causing hyperactivity, sleep disorders, loss of speech accompanied by behavioral abnormalities, neuropsychiatric problems, mental retardation, hearing loss, and visceral manifestations, such as mild hepatomegaly, mild dysostosis multiplex, mild coarse facies, and hypertrichosis <xref rid="pone.0007434-Bartsocas1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Valstar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A majority of patients experience severe mental retardation and die before adulthood but some survive to the fourth decade with progressive dementia and retinitis pigmentosa <xref rid="pone.0007434-Neufeld1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Valstar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In the very rare MPS IIIC patients with the onset of symptoms in adulthood the disease progression was similar in severity and time course to the forms with onset in childhood <xref rid="pone.0007434-BergerPlantinga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The birth prevalence of MPS IIIC in Australia, Portugal and the Netherlands was estimated at 0.07, 0.12 and 0.21 per 100,000, respectively <xref rid="pone.0007434-Meikle1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Pinto1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Poorthuis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although from the moment of discovery MPS IIIC was recognized as a deficiency of an enzyme that transfers an acetyl group from cytoplasmically derived acetyl-CoA to terminal N-glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate within the lysosomes <xref rid="pone.0007434-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0007434-Bame1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the molecular defects causing the disease have not been characterized for almost three decades because the identification and cloning of HGSNAT has been hampered by low tissue content and instability of the enzyme. Recently our group and others cloned the gene coding for HGSNAT <xref rid="pone.0007434-Hebek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> which paved the way for characterization of the molecular defects in MPS IIIC patients. To date, 54 HGSNAT sequence variants have been identified including 13 splice-site mutations, 11 insertions and deletions causing frame shifts and premature termination of translation, 8 nonsense, 18 missense mutations and 4 polymorphisms <xref rid="pone.0007434-Feldhammer1" ref-type="bibr">[reviewed in 13, http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/home.php?select_dbâ=âHGSNAT]</xref>, While the HGSNAT transcripts with abnormal splicing, frame shifts and premature stop codons are rapidly degraded via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway <xref rid="pone.0007434-Hebek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the phenotypic pathogenicity of missense mutations was impossible to predict. Here, in order to understand the biochemical effects of the missense mutations we have expressed mutant proteins in cultured human fibroblasts and COS-7 cells and found that all mutations result in misfolding of the enzyme. As a consequence, it is abnormally glycosylated, and is not targeted to the lysosome, but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).</p>

        <title>Expression, processing and enzymatic activity of HGSNAT mutants</title>
        <p>The effect of HGSNAT mutations on the enzyme biogenesis and catalytic activity was studied by the transient expression of the mutant cDNA. Mutations were generated by site directed mutagenesis in the pCTAP-HGSNAT construct that expresses human HGSNAT with a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag consisting of a high affinity streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) and a calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) to allow purification of the recombinant protein using successively-applied streptavidin-resin and calmodulin-resin affinity purification steps or its detection with anti-CBP antibodies <xref rid="pone.0007434-Rigaut1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Puig1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In preliminary experiments we have ensured that a human wild-type HGSNAT carrying a TAP tag on its C-terminus had a lysosomal localization and showed catalytic activity similar to that of the untagged enzyme (not shown). The sequences of the constructs were verified to ensure the correct introduction of mutations. In total, 21 constructs bearing nucleotide changes identified in patients were transfected in COS-7 cells and assayed for N-acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g001">Figure 1</xref>). All tested cells showed similar endogenous lysosomal Î²-hexosaminidase activity (not shown) but drastically different levels of the N-acetyltransferase activity. The four polymorphisms (P237Q, V481L, K523Q and A615T) displayed activity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the activity of the rest of the mutants was below the detection level. Kinetics studies were further conducted using partially purified enzyme to determine if the P237Q and V481L mutants showing full enzymatic activity would have a different affinity for the substrate, however their K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values were similar to those of the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007434.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>The expression of HGSNAT mutants was studied by Western blot analysis of cellular homogenates using anti-CBP antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). All mutants were expressed at a level approximately similar to that of the wild-type HGSNAT, but showed a difference in their molecular mass. The four polymorphisms (P237Q, V481L, K523Q and A615T) showed a molecular mass of â¼77 kDa, similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas all missense mutants (C76F, L137P, G262R, N273K, P283L, R344C, R344H, W403C, G424S, E471K, M482K, A489E, S518F, S539C, S541L, D562V, P571L) had a smaller molecular mass of â¼67 kDa. Since HGSNAT is predicted to have 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites each potentially contributing â¼2 kDa to the size of the mature enzyme <xref rid="pone.0007434-Hebek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, this molecular mass difference was consistent with the hypothesis that inactive mutants lacked proper glycosylation. To confirm this, the wild-type enzyme, 2 polymorphic variants and 2 inactive mutants were treated with endoglycosidase H which cleaves immature mannose-rich oligosaccharide chains added to glycoproteins in the ER <xref rid="pone.0007434-Maley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> Analysis by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g002">Figure 2</xref>) showed that upon deglycosylation the molecular mass of the wild-type enzyme and polymorphic mutants was reduced to 67 kDa, whereas the inactive mutants displayed only a subtle shift in their position on the gel, indicating that they already lacked most of the glycans. The homogenates were also treated with the peptide: N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) which fully removes all sugars from mature glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition to performing enzymatic deglycosylation of cell homogenates we treated the COS-7 cells transiently expressing the wild-type enzyme, a polymorphic and an inactive mutant with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-acetylglucosamine transferase that blocks glycosylation of newly-synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Results of both experiments were consistent with those obtained with Endoglycosidase H. Upon treatment with tunicamycin or PNGase F the size of the wild type HGSNAT and the enzyme containing the polymorphism was reduced by approximately â¼10 kDa whereas the inactive mutant displayed only a minor change in electrophoretic mobility. Western blot analysis also revealed that homogenates of cells transfected with both wild-type HGSNAT and polymorphic mutants, but not of untransfected cells or cells transfected with inactive mutants contained an immunoreactive protein with a molecular mass of â¼48 kDa. Since this form of HGSNAT contains the C-terminal CBP cross-reacting with the antibodies we estimated that it corresponds to the HGSNAT fragment missing â¼300 amino acids on the N-terminus. It seems that the appearance of this form is associated with the proper glycosylation and lysosomal targeting of HGSNAT, but further studies are necessary to conclude whether it represents a product of intralysosomal maturation (with the N-terminal chain not being detected by our antibodies) or a degradation product. On the other hand, the 77-kDa form of HGSNAT separated by FPLC anion-exchange chromatography showed full enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of HGSNAT mutants</title>
        <p>The effects of missense mutations on the subcellular localization of the enzyme were studied by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Immortalized human skin fibroblasts from a normal control were transfected with constructs expressing each of the missense mutations. The cells were allowed to express the mutant and polymorphic enzymes for 42 hours and were then fixed by paraformaldehyde. To identify the lysosomal-late endosomal compartment, prior to fixation the cells were treated with LysoTracker Red DND-99 dye. After fixation the cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and probed with anti-CBP antibodies to localize the HGSNAT and with antibodies against the ER marker calnexin and lysosomal marker LAMP-2.</p>
        <p>Distinct punctate staining characteristic of lysosomal targeting of the protein was evident for the recombinant wild-type enzyme and all active mutants. Accordingly, both wild-type recombinant HGSNAT and polymorphic mutants almost completely co-localized with the lysosomal markers LysoTracker Red or LAMP-2 (representative data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, the inactive mutants exhibited a diffuse pattern throughout the cell and were co-localized not with the lysosomal markers but with the ER marker calnexin (representative data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g004">Figure 4</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007434.s002">Figure S2</xref> for the data on all mutants). Partial ER localization (typically 2â5% of the total, not shown) was also observed for the wild-type recombinant and active mutants and most likely represented a pool of the enzyme processed in the ER on its way to the lysosomes.</p>

        <title>Glucosamine-mediated refolding of inactive HGSNAT mutants</title>
        <p>Since all the data were consistent with general folding defects and retention in the ER compartment of the HGSNAT mutants (C76F, L137P, G262R, N273K, P283L, R344C, R344H, W403C, G424S, E471K, M482K, A489E, S518F, S539C, S541L, D562V, P571L) we further tested whether competitive inhibitors of the enzyme that mimic the substrate binding in the active site would help to fold the enzyme in the ER so it can be properly modified and exported to the lysosome. We first tested several potential inhibitors of HGSNAT that were not expected to be highly toxic for the cultured cells and found that one of them, D-(+)-glucosamine hydrochloride, was a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with a K<sub>I</sub> of 0.28 mM close to the K<sub>M</sub> value for the 4MU-Î²GlcN substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007434.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To establish the optimal concentration of the inhibitor in the culture medium and the length of the treatment, we have used the immortalized skin fibroblasts of previously reported MPS IIIC patient homozygous for the N273K mutation that causes misfolding of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g004">Figure 4</xref>), since they were readily available in our lab <xref rid="pone.0007434-Seyrantepe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Immortalized fibroblasts from a patient homozygous for a splice site mutation (c.1726+1G&gt;A) <xref rid="pone.0007434-Hebek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and normal immortalized fibroblasts were used as controls. We found that the treatment of fibroblasts from a patient homozygous for the N273K mutation with 14 mM glucosamine results in the progressive increase of N-acetyltransferase activity in cell homogenates which reaches 3 fold induction after 5 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The N-acetyltransferase activity in the normal cells and in the cells of the MPS IIIC patient homozygous for the splice site mutation c.1726+1G&gt;A as well as the control Î²-hexosaminidase activity in all cell lines were not increased upon the treatment (not shown) suggesting that the observed induction of N-acetyltransferase activity was caused by rescuing the N273K mutant but not by the general induction of lysosomal enzymes. When the cells of the patient affected with the N273K mutation were treated for 5 days with increasing concentrations of glucosamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) we found that the effect was proportional to the concentration of the inhibitor. At the glucosamine concentration of 14 mM (â¼50x K<sub>I</sub>) the N-acetyltransferase activity in the treated cells was 0.3 nmol/h mg which corresponds to â¼7% of the average activity in normal control fibroblasts, but further increase of glucosamine concentration resulted in inhibition of cell growth. To understand whether similar effects could be also observed for other missense mutants the available primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from 9 MPS IIIC patients carrying missense HGSNAT mutations or a missense mutation in combination with a splice site or nonsense mutation were treated with glucosamine and assayed for N-acetyltransferase activity. Nine missense mutations were studied altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g005">Figure 5C</xref>; patient genotypes are listed in the figure legend). Although the maximal effect for different cell lines was achieved at different concentrations of glucosamine and at different treatment time (not shown), for 8 of 9 cell lines a statistically significant increase in the activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that some of the mutants were partially stabilized by the glucosamine, correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomal compartment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The current work provides an explanation for the severe phenotype of MPS IIIC patients carrying missense mutations in the <italic>HGSNAT</italic> gene. Altogether, we studied the activity and biogenesis of HGSNAT mutants having 21 amino acid substitutions previously identified in MPS IIIC families and affecting 8 of the 11 transmembrane segments of the enzyme as well as its luminal and cytosolic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The missense mutations studied in this paper represent all of the currently identified missense HGSNAT mutations. The polymorphisms (P237Q, V481L, K523Q and A615T, shown in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g006">Figure 6</xref>) identified in MPS IIIC only in <italic>cis</italic> either with a splice site mutation or with a missense mutation <xref rid="pone.0007434-Hebek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Feldhammer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> were previously reported by us to result in catalytically active protein <xref rid="pone.0007434-Feldhammer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. They were included in the current study because it was unclear whether they still could affect kinetic parameters or targeting of HGSNAT and therefore represent a clinically valuable phenotype. All variants were expressed as TAP-tagged proteins since no Western blotting or cellular immunostaining could be conducted using the patient fibroblasts due to a lack of specific antibodies against human HGSNAT. Our results show that the HGSNAT variants P237Q, V481L, K523Q and A615T are all correctly processed targeted to the lysosome and display full enzymatic activity. We conclude therefore that these four mutations represent rare polymorphisms in the <italic>HGSNAT</italic> gene and do not have clinical significance thus confirming our previous hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0007434-Feldhammer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Seventeen mutations (C76F, L137P, G262R, N273K, P283L, R344C, R344H, W403C, G424S, E471K, M482K, A489E, S518F, S539C, S541L, D562V and P571L, shown in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007434-g006">Figure 6</xref>) result in production of misfolded HGSNAT protein that is abnormally glycosylated and not targeted to the lysosome. Seven of these mutations (G262R, P283L, W403C, M482K, A489E, S518F and P571L) are predicted to reside within the highly hydrophobic transmembrane domains of the protein. Four of them (G262R, W403C, M482K, A489E) introduce hydrophilic or charged residues inside the transmembrane domains which usually have a dramatic effect on the folding of the protein <xref rid="pone.0007434-Gregersen1" ref-type="bibr">[reviewed in 18]</xref>. Three other changes (P283L, S518F and P571L) result in replacement of hydrophilic residues for hydrophobic ones that also could destabilize the transmembrane helix.</p>
      <p>Six mutations (R344C, R344H, E471K, S539C, S541L and D562V) are found adjacent to the predicted transmembrane domains either on the cytoplasmic (D562V) or on the lumenal (R344C, R344H, E471K, S539C, and S541L) side and 4 mutations (C76F, L137P, N273K, and G424S) reside inside the hydrophilic lumenal domains of the enzyme. In most cases these mutations are predicted to have a drastic effect on protein folding since they involve replacements with amino acids significantly different in hydrophobicity (C76F, D562V, S541L), charge (R344C/H, N273K, E471K) or size (C76F, L137P, G424S). Thus, enzyme folding defects due to missense mutations, together with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay seem to be the major molecular mechanisms underlying MPS IIIC.</p>
      <p>For at least 5 of the above changes (N273K, R344C, R344H, S518F and S541L) the active conformation can be stabilized by the competitive inhibitor of HGSNAT glucosamine resulting in part of the enzyme pool being properly processed and targeted to the lysosomes. L137P and P283L mutants may also be stabilized by the glucosamine treatment, however this could not be verified experimentally because in the available patient cell lines they were present together with the responsive mutations S518F and R344C, respectively. Only one cell line carrying E471K and D562V mutations did not show a significant increase in N-acetyltransferase activity in response to glucosamine. Further structural studies are needed to fully understand the difference in the effect of glucosamine on these mutants.</p>
      <p>Although the spectrum of mutations in MPS IIIC patients shows substantial heterogeneity, some of the missense mutations have a high frequency within the patient population. Importantly, the two mutations, R344C and S518F, responsive to glucosamine-mediated refolding account for 22.0% and 29.3%, respectively, of the alleles among the probands of Dutch origin <xref rid="pone.0007434-Ruijter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The S518F mutation has also been identified in a patient from Germany, while the R344C change was found in families from France, UK, Germany and Singapore. The responsive mutation R344H was found in 4 families from Eastern and Northern Europe (2 from Poland, one from Czech Republic and one from Finland) and the responsive mutation S541L was reported in 4 families from France, Ireland, Poland and Portugal. In general, the vast majority of patients is affected with at least one missense mutation interfering with the proper folding of the enzyme that could be partially rescued by the treatment of the cells with the competitive inhibitor of HGSNAT, glucosamine. We believe this makes MPS IIIC a good candidate for enzyme enhancement therapy <xref rid="pone.0007434-Fan2" ref-type="bibr">[reviewed in 20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007434-Desnick1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, where active site-specific inhibitors are used as pharmacological chaperones to modify the conformation of the mutant lysosomal enzymes usually retained and degraded in the ER in order to increase the level of the residual activity to a point sufficient to reverse the clinical phenotype. Together with inhibitors of heparan sulfate synthesis, pharmacological chaperones could potentially reduce storage of this polymer in the central nervous system to levels sufficient to stop neuronal death and reverse inflammation.</p>
