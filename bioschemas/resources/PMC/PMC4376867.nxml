        <p>Hereditary hearing loss is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. More than 80 genes have been implicated to date, and with the advent of targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE+MPS) the rate of novel deafness-gene identification has accelerated. Here we report a family segregating post-lingual progressive autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). After first excluding plausible variants in known deafness-causing genes using TGE+MPS, we completed whole exome sequencing in three hearing-impaired family members. Only a single variant, p.Arg185Pro in <italic>HOMER2</italic>, segregated with the hearing-loss phenotype in the extended family. This amino acid change alters a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil domain of HOMER2 that is essential for protein multimerization and the HOMER2-CDC42 interaction. As a scaffolding protein, HOMER2 is involved in intracellular calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization. Consistent with this function, we found robust expression in stereocilia of hair cells in the murine inner ear and observed that over-expression of mutant p.Pro185 <italic>HOMER2</italic> mRNA causes anatomical changes of the inner ear and neuromasts in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, mouse mutants homozygous for the targeted deletion of <italic>Homer2</italic> present with early-onset rapidly progressive hearing loss. These data provide compelling evidence that HOMER2 is required for normal hearing and that its sequence alteration in humans leads to ADNSHL through a dominant-negative mode of action.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The most frequent sensory disorder worldwide is hearing impairment. It impacts over 5% of the world population (360 million persons), and is characterized by extreme genetic heterogeneity. Over 80 genes have been implicated in isolated (also referred to as ânon-syndromicâ) hearing loss, and abundant evidence supports the existence of many more âdeafness-causingâ genes. In this study, we used a sequential screening strategy to first exclude causal mutations in known deafness-causing genes in a family segregating autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. We next turned to whole exome sequencing and identified a single variantâp.Arg185Pro in <italic>HOMER2</italic>âthat segregated with the phenotype in the extended family. To validate the pathological significance of this mutation, we studied two animal models. In zebrafish, we overexpressed mutant HOMER2 and observed inner ear defects; and in mice we documented robust expression in stereocilia of cochlear hair cells and demonstrated that its absence causes early-onset progressive deafness. Our data offer novel insights into gene pathways essential for normal auditory function and the maintenance of cochlear hair cells.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing (TGE+MPS) have revolutionized the field of hereditary hearing loss (HHL) by making comprehensive genetic testing for deafness a clinical reality and by accelerating the discovery of novel deafness-causing genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date over 80 genes have been causally implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL; Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage). The proteins encoded by these genes are involved in a broad array of molecular and cellular mechanisms essential for the development and maintenance of normal auditory function [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. At the centerpiece of this intricate system are the outer and inner hair cells (OHCs, IHCs)âkey structures in the mechanotransduction process by which mechanical stimuli are translated into electrical impulses [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The precise and efficient tuning of OHCs and IHCs is closely linked to their anatomical integrity and the coordinated movement of their apical stereocilia.</p>
      <p>The Homer proteins are scaffolding proteins crucial to many intracellular signaling cascades; their function underpins a variety of neuronal processes ranging from calcium homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization to synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Homer proteins are encoded by three genes; <italic>HOMER1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>3</italic> (MIM 604798, MIM 604799 and MIM 604800, respectively) that are translated into multiple isoforms as a result of alternative splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All isoforms share an N-terminal conserved EVH1 (Ena VASP Homology 1) domain, which binds proline-rich regions of target proteins. The long isoforms (HOMER1b and c, HOMER2, HOMER3) additionally have a coiled-coil (CC) region and leucine zipper motifs in their divergent C-termini [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The CC region is required for homo/hetero-multimerization to form tetrameric hubs (in which the CC domains align in a parallel fashion) and for interaction with Rho family GTPase proteins like CDC42 (MIM 116952) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the short isoforms lack CC domains and therefore do not form multimers, like their longer counterparts they bind target proteins through their EVH1 domain. This interaction regulates the activity of proteins involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling complexes including metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], inositol tri-phosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Homer proteins also regulate basal cytosolic calcium via an interaction with the plasma membrane calcium reuptake pump, PMCA [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>Aberrant Homer signaling has been associated with several developmentally related neurological syndromes including Fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, addiction, schizophrenia, neuropathic pain and Alzheimerâs disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To this list we now add autosomal dominant NSHL (ADNSHL).</p>

        <title>Clinical description and progression of hearing loss</title>
        <p>The family segregating the deafness-causing mutation in <italic>HOMER2</italic> (MIM 604799; RefSeq NM_004839) is a multi-generational kindred of European descent (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Pure tone audiometric evaluation of affected members showed bilateral post-lingual progressive hearing loss that segregated as an autosomal dominant trait; bone conduction thresholds excluded conductive hearing impairment. Clinical examination was negative for any findings consistent with syndromic hearing loss and also ruled out autoimmune phenotypes. Hearing impairment had a typical onset in the first decade of life in the high frequencies, with significant subsequent progression of hearing loss over all frequencies. To evaluate progression at each frequency, we performed linear regression analyses of threshold on age [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The resulting annual threshold deterioration (ATD) was 1.2 to 1.6 dB per year (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005137.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The age-related typical audiogram (ARTA) derived from these data confirmed the down-sloping audiometric configuration and demonstrated fairly similar progression across all frequencies.</p>

        <title>Whole exome sequencing identifies a mutation in <italic>HOMER2</italic>

        <p>Our initial strategy was to screen one family member (III.10) for pathogenic variants in known deafness-causing genes using a deafness-specific TGE+MPS panel (OtoSCOPE) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Plausible pathogenic variants were excluded (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was therefore completed on three affected family members (II.2, IV.5, and IV.10) and variants were filtered according to guidelines detailed in Materials and Methods section [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
        <p>The resultant final candidate variant lists included 163, 150 and 158 nucleotide changes for these three individuals, respectively (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Of these variants, only four were shared amongst the three sequenced exomes (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>) and only one segregated with the ADNSHL phenotype in the extended family (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). The segregating variant, c.554G&gt;C; p.Arg185Pro in <italic>HOMER2</italic> on chromosome 15q25.2, is a novel non-synonymous change that substitutes a highly conserved arginine for a proline, a substitution that is predicted to be pathogenic and disease-causing by Polyphen2, LRT, SIFT and MutationTaster (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
        <p>HOMER2 belongs to the homer family of post-synaptic density scaffolding proteins and is expressed as two isoforms, HOMER2 isoform 1 (NM_004839, 343 aa) and isoform 2 (NM_199330.2, 354 aa), which differ by 11 amino acids. The p.Arg185Pro variant lies in the CC domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). A lysine is found at the orthologous position in HOMER1 and HOMER3, which like arginine is a basic polar amino acid that confers similar chemico-physical properties to the protein. Proline, in contrast, is non-polar and is predicted to alter the conformational structure of the CC domain or affect its ability to multimerize and/or interact with partner proteins.</p>

        <p>To assess the impact of the p.Arg185Pro mutation in HOMER2 <italic>in vivo</italic> we used the zebrafish model. Zebrafish hair cells share similarities with their mammalian counterparts in morphology and function.

The zebrafish <italic>homer2</italic> (NP_001018470.1) is 67% identical to human HOMER2 and is expressed mostly in the developing musculature although there is faint expression in the otic capsule at 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

        <title>p.Arg185Pro mutation exerts its effect through a dominant-negative mechanism</title>
        <p>In aggregate, our data show that HOMER2 is required for normal hearing. Its complete absence in mice leads to early onset progressive hearing loss starting at the high frequencies and rapidly involving all frequencies. The recessive phenotype exhibited by null alleles of Homer2 makes it a strong candidate for autosomal recessive hearing loss due to loss of function in humans as well. The absence of a disease phenotype in <italic>Homer2</italic>
<sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice suggests that haploinsufficiency does not cause hearing loss. Together with results obtained from zebrafish experiments, these data strongly suggest that the p.Arg185Pro mutation in HOMER2 exerts its effect through a dominant-negative mechanism on wild-type protein by either inhibiting multimerization or competing for other partner proteins.</p>
        <p>In defining the effect of the p.Arg185Pro mutation in HOMER2 at a molecular level, we believe two hypotheses warrant consideration. One hypothesis posits that HOMER2 exerts its function by regulating actin dynamics in stereocilia through its interaction with CDC42, a highly conserved small GTPase of the RHO family that fine-tunes actin-turnover (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). HOMER2 is known to couple with and regulate CDC42 through its CDC42-binding domain (CBD) within the CC domain (<xref rid="pgen.1005137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In HeLa cells, CDC42 induces the formation of filopodia-like protrusions, while overexpression of HOMER2 suppresses this phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the cochlea, CDC42 localizes to stereocilia membranes and its targeted deletion in murine HCs leads to their degeneration and results in progressive hearing loss particularly at the high frequencies, a phenotype similar to the human <italic>HOMER2</italic> mutant phenotype and the <italic>Homer2</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> murine phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
        <p>A second hypothesis focuses on the role of HOMER2 in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> control. Several studies have shown that HOMER2 regulates a number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling proteins including TRPC and PMCA channels. Two TRPCsâTRPC3 (MIM 602345) and TRPC6 (MIM 603652)âare expressed in both sensory neurons and cochlear hair cells and are required for normal function. Their targeted deletion in mice causes significant dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> re-entry that leads to hearing impairment and vestibular deficits [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While both proteins are potentially interacting partners for HOMER2, to date only an interaction with TRPC1 (MIM 602343) has been established [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, a recent study has demonstrated a critical role for Homer2 in modulating PMCA activity by regulating the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in parotid acinar cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This finding suggests a possible role for Homer2 in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance to balance TRPC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and PMCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion. A suitable interacting partner of HOMER2 may be the PMCA2 pump (MIM 108733), which represents the only system for clearance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from hair cell stereocilia [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While both of these hypotheses are attractive, further functional studies are needed to identify the partner proteins of HOMER2 in inner ear and investigate the effect of the p.Arg185Pro mutation on these interactions.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have identified <italic>HOMER2</italic> as essential to normal auditory function and have shown that the p.Arg185Pro HOMER2 mutation causes ADNSHL through a dominant-negative mechanism of action, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with Homer protein dysfunction.</p>

Data analysis was performed on a local installation of Galaxy using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) for read mapping to the reference genome (hg19, NCBI Build 37), Picard for removal of duplicate reads, GATK for local re-alignment and variant calling, and ANNOVAR and a custom workflow for variant annotation. Variant filtering was based on: quality (&gt;10X); minor allele frequency (MAF&lt;0.0005) as reported in the 1000 Genomes Project database and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project Exome Variant Server (EVS). Variants were annotated for conservation (GERP and PhyloP) and predicted pathogenicity (PolyPhen2, SIFT, MutationTaster and LRT). Variants were then filtered based on coding effect (non-synonymous, indels and splice-site variants); heterozygosity and allele sharing amongst the three sequenced affected individuals (II.2, IV.5, and IV.10). Sanger sequencing was completed in all family members to confirm segregation of c.554G&gt;C; p.Arg185Pro in <italic>HOMER2</italic> gene (MIM 604799; RefSeq NM_004839) using primers HOMER2-6F: 5â-ATGGGAGAGGCAGCAAGTCT-3â and HOMER2-6R: 5â-AGACCCACCTGCCAGCTTAC-3â.</p>

        <p>Zebrafish embryos were raised at 28.5Â°C as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Iowa Office of Animal Resources (OAR) principle for the care and use of laboratory animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) were designed to block the exon/intron splice junctions between exon 1 and intron 1 (MO i1e1 5â²- GGTACACATGTATCTGTCTGACCTT-3â²) or intron 3 and exon 4 (5â²-CGCAATGAAAACTGTAAACACTCTT-3â²) of <italic>homer2</italic> (ENSDART00000124088) and bought from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR, USA). They were injected at 2.2 mg/ml along with 1 mg/ml p53 MO (5â-GCGCCATTGCTTTGCAAGAATTG-3â). A standard control MO (5â-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3â) was used for injection of negative controls along with p53 MO. The efficacy of <italic>homer2</italic> knockdown by each morpholino was assessed by RT-PCR analysis with the following primer sets: forward (5â- GGTTCCCGCCAGTAAACAG-3â) and reverse (5â-GTTTGAGCTCCGTCTTCAGG-3â), which amplified the region between exons 1 and 12; B-actin primers were forward (5â²-GAGATGATGCCCCTCGTG-3') and reverse 5'-GCTCAATGGGGTATTTGAGG-3').

<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, <italic>Homer2</italic>
<sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and WT mice at two (P14), four (P28) and eight (P56) weeks. At least 23 animals were tested at each time point. Mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal Ketamine/Xylazine at 0.1ml/10g body weight. Reference, ground and earth electrodes were placed subcutaneously just posterior to the tested ear (left ear), anterior to the contralateral ear and at the vertex of the head, respectively. ABRs were performed using an experimental setup and testing protocol, as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, clicks and tone-bursts were delivered to the testing ear through a plastic acoustic tube. ABRs were measured using an Etymotic Research ER10B+ probe microphone (Etymotic Research, Elk Grove, IL, USA) coupled to two Tucker-Davis Technologies MF1 multi-field magnetic speakers (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA). Click and tone-burst stimuli were presented and recorded using custom software running on a PC connected to a 24-bit external sound card (Motu UltraLite mk3, Cambridge MA, USA). A custom-built differential amplifier with a gain of 1,000 dB amplified acoustic ABR responses. Output was passed through 6-pole Butterworth high-pass (100 Hz) and low-pass (3 kHz) filters and then to a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (100,000 sample/s). Responses were recorded using standard signal-averaging techniques for 500 or 1000 sweeps. Hearing thresholds (db SPL) were determined by decreasing the sound intensity by 5 and/or 10 db decrements and recording the lowest sound intensity level resulting in a recognizable and reproducible ABR response wave pattern. Maximum ABR thresholds were capped at 100 db SPL. DPOAEs were measured unilaterally (left ear) using an experimental setup and testing protocol, as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005137.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In brief, DPOAE levels were elicited using two primary tone stimuli, f1 and f2, with sound pressure levels of 65 and 55 db SPL, respectively, with f2/f1 = 1.22. A custom plastic ear probe was inserted into the ear canal and DPOAE amplitudes were measured at f2 frequencies at 4000, 5657, 8000, 11314, 16000, 22627 and 32000 Hz and plotted after subtraction of noise floor amplitude.</p>

        <p>IPA (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to map interactions between genes involved in NSHHL (86 genes) and HOMER2 and CDC42. Networks were created from user-specified seed molecules by searching the knowledge base for molecules that are known to biologically interact with the seeds and connecting them. Networks are displayed graphically as nodes (genes/gene products) and edges (the biological relationships between the nodes). IPA computes a score for each network according to the fit of all significant genes.
