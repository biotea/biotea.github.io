        <p id="P1">Dominant optic atrophy (DOA)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and axonal peripheral neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2 or CMT2)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> are hereditary neurodegenerative disorders most commonly caused by mutations in the canonical mitochondrial fusion genes <italic>OPA1</italic> and <italic>MFN2</italic>, respectively<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In yeast, homologs of OPA1(Mgm1) and MFN2(Fzo1) work in concert with Ugo1<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, which has no human equivalent to date<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. By whole exome sequencing patients with optic atrophy and CMT2, we identified four families with recessive mutations in <italic>SLC25A46</italic>. We demonstrate that SLC25A46, like Ugo1, is a modified carrier protein that has been recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with the inner membrane remodeling protein, mitofilin(Fcj1). Loss-of-function in cultured cells and in zebrafish unexpectedly leads to increased mitochondrial connectivity, while severely affecting the development and maintenance of neurons in the fish. The discovery of <italic>SLC25A46</italic> strengthens the genetic overlap between optic atrophy and CMT2, while exemplifying a novel class of modified solute transporters linked to mitochondrial dynamics.</p>

    <p id="P2">Mutations in <italic>MFN2</italic> account for more than 20% of inherited axonal degenerative peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2A) <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. A subset of these patients also develop optic nerve atrophy<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, mutations in <italic>OPA1</italic> account for as much as 60â70% of dominant optic atrophy (DOA)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and sometimes cause additional neurological symptoms referred to as optic atrophy âplusâ<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. MFN2 and OPA1 are involved in the tethering and fusion of outer and inner mitochondrial membranes<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Both CMT2 and DOA are genetically heterogeneous disorders with up to 60% of patients undiagnosed genetically <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, we recruited families with both optic atrophy and axonal peripheral neuropathy to identify additional disease genes, based upon the hypothesis that causative genes would uncover new factors in common biological pathways. By applying whole exome sequencing with established methods and cut-offs for variant filtering in Mendelian inherited diseases<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, we found four families with recessive variants in the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene <italic>SLC25A46.</italic> After excluding other candidate genes by segregation analysis, we identified the compound heterozygous mutations c.165_166insC, p.His56fs*94 and c.746G&gt;A, p.Gly249Asp in a British family (UK), a homozygous mutation c.1005A&gt;T, p.Glu335Asp in a Palestinian family (PL), and the compound heterozygous variants c.882_885dupTTAC, p.Asn296fs*297 and c.998C&gt;T, p.Pro333Leu in an American family (US). We then used conventional Sanger sequencing methods to screen <italic>SLC25A46</italic> in similar cases without a genetic diagnosis, and identified an additional family from Sardinia, Italy (IT), with the homozygous mutation c.1018C&gt;T, p.Arg340Cys (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P3">All non-truncating changes were predicted to be deleterious (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Patients in these four families presented with similar phenotypic core features including optic atrophy, axonal CMT, as well as cerebellar atrophy (Refer to <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary information</xref>). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data in two of the patients found decreased N-Acetyl-Aspartate (NAA) and increased lactate in the central nervous system (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>) typical of mitochondrial disorders and suggestive of a metabolic role for SLC25A46. However, analysis of a muscle biopsy from patient IT II-3 found no ragged red fibers or cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX)-negative fibers (<bold>data not shown</bold>).</p>
    <p id="P4">SLC25A46 is a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (SLC25) and is predicted to function as a transporter across the inner mitochondrial membrane<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Using the Basic Local Alignment Search tool (BLAST), we found that SLC25A46 is a reciprocal match to Ugo1 when querying between human and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Ugo1 is a modified mitochondrial solute carrier in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> that operates as a mitochondrial fusion factor in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> with no homologs identified in metazoans<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. To unbiasedly determine the most similar protein to Ugo1 in metazoans, we created a bootstrapped, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with all mitochondrial carrier domain-containing proteins in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe.</italic> This revealed SLC25A46 as the most similar to Ugo1. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine orthology (<bold>Online methods</bold> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>) and SLC25A46 fails to complement <italic>ugo1</italic> deletion in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<bold>data not shown</bold>).</p>
    <p id="P5">During evolution, homologs of mitochondrial carriers, usually inner membrane proteins<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, have been modified and recruited to the MOM to perform specific functions, unrelated to metabolite transport. The list includes the mammalian mitochondrial carrier homologs MTCH1<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and MTCH2<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, critical players in apoptosis, and yeast Ugo1<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Because human SLC25A46 is also a highly derived carrier protein as shown in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary Fig 4</xref>, we investigated its submitochondrial localization.</p>
    <p id="P6">Immunocytochemistry studies in COS-7 cells demonstrate that HA-tagged SLC25A46 co-localizes more with the MOM marker (TOM20) and less with the inner membrane markers (myc-tagged mitofilin or ANT2) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). We subsequently used mitochondria isolated from HEK293T cells expressing SLC25A46-HA to perform solubility and proteinase K protection assays, which demonstrated that SLC25A46 is an integral outer membrane protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b and c</xref>). To gain insight into SLC25A46 function we identified interacting partners by performing an unbiased HA-immunoprecipitation assay combined with mass spectrometry analysis. Mitofilin was among the top hits in this assay (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table. 3</xref>). Consistently, sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses found mitofilin to co-sediment with a small fraction of SLC25A46-HA, indicating that they may exist in the same high molecular mass complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The interaction between SLC25A46 and mitofilin was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays using mitochondria isolated from cells transfected with SLC25A46-HA (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>) or co-transfected with SLC25A46-HA and mitofilin-myc (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), followed by western blot detection. These results are congruent to Ugo1, which has been shown to co-fractionate with Fcj1<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, the homolog of mammalian IMMT(mitofilin).</p>
    <p id="P7">To determine if SLC25A46 plays a conserved role in mitochondrial dynamics, we compared the effects of protein overexpression to the ATP transporter ANT2 (also known as SLC25A5) and found that SLC25A46, unlike ANT2, leads to mitochondrial fragmentation in cell lines (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Next we used siRNA to knockdown SLC25A46 and found it to cause mitochondrial hyperfusion (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). To determine the degree of mitochondrial connectivity, we observed the instantaneous diffusion of matrix targeted photoactivatable GFP, revealing that the GFP diffuses into larger areas of the knockdown cells versus controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e,f</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">Assuming that mitochondrial hyperfusion is controlled by the balance between fusion and fission, this phenotype could be caused by either increased fusion or loss of fission. To test the rate of mitochondrial fusion, we performed photoactivation experiments<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> where we measured the extinction of activated GFP over the course of 90 minutes and found no significant difference in the fusion rates between control and knockdown cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This in conjunction with the mitochondrial constriction sites in electron microscopy (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g,h</xref>), which appear to be fission intermediates<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> suggests that delays in fission or elongation contribute more to the hyperfused morphology than an increase in fusion rate.</p>
    <p id="P9">We further examined fibroblasts from proband IT II-3, which display a hyper-filamentous and interconnected network in comparison to both, the unaffected sibling IT II-2 and control, indicating the relevance of this phenomenon (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Loss-of-function of SLC25A46 is not associated with changes in total cellular ATP, mitochondrial DNA content, or membrane potential in either siRNA-treated cell lines, or a knockdown zebrafish model (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5bâd</xref>, or data not shown). However, patient IT II-3 fibroblasts show decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and a glycolytic shift of metabolism (decreased OCR/ECAR ratio) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4câe</xref>) consistent with the increased lactate peak found in MRS (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). A decrease in ATP synthesis driven by complex I substrates, was trending, but not significant (data not shown). These metabolic changes are congruent to previous findings in patient fibroblasts with OPA1 mutations<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P10">Altogether, our data supports that unlike Ugo1, SLC25A46 acts in a pro-fission manner. Ugo1 physically interacts with both Fzo1 (MFN2) and Mgm1 (OPA1) to coordinate the simultaneous fusion of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, mitochondrial fusion is not tightly coupled in mammalian cells, where the outer and inner membranes can fuse independently of each other<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, SLC25A46 does not interact with MFN2 or OPA1, but forms a complex with mitofilin that is independent of MFN2 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that SLC25A46 still functions as an adaptor protein, but the loss-of-function is more apparent on the fission mechanism where the outer and inner membranes come together at the constriction sites. Alternatively, SLC25A46 could mediate the translocation of an unknown pro-fission factor across the outer membrane, analogous to the translocation of tBID by MTCH2 during apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Although the function of SLC25A46 in mitochondrial dynamics seem to deviate from the role of Ugo1 in yeast, the conservation of the interaction of both proteins with mitofilin suggest that SLC25A46 and Ugo1 might play similar roles at the cristae junctions.</p>
    <p id="P11">Genome wide association studies have linked <italic>SLC25A46</italic> to atopic dermatitis<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>; however, the transcript has been shown to be highly expressed in the neurons affected in patients including spinal cord, cerebellum, and optic chiasm<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In order to determine the role of SLC25A46 in the vertebrate nervous system, we created a zebrafish knockdown model. Zebrafish slc25a46 is 69% identical to the human ortholog, and in agreement with previous RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, we found enrichment in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their corresponding neuronal projections in the axons of the optic nerve and in the dendrites of the inner plexiform (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8aâd</xref>). We then used a transient morpholino approach to knockdown the transcript and demonstrated that knockdown was effective for up to 96 hours post-fertilization (hpf) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). When injected with <italic>slc25a46</italic> morpholino, embryos (morphants) had fewer retinal ganglion cell axons that reached the tectum by 72 hpf (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). We also saw decreased antibody staining in the inner plexiform layer suggesting that RGC dendrites are also affected (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8e,f</xref>). Around 40% of morphant embryos injected with 0.45 picomoles (pmol) of morpholino have a severe curly-tail morphology (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8g,h</xref>); yet, even normal-appearing larvae display alterations in swimming, indicating dysfunction of neuronal circuits (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8i</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">We further investigated motor neurons and found significantly shorter axon tracts, many of which failed to innervate the rostral myotome at 48 hpf (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). The spinal cord neuropil at the level of electron microscopy showed fewer neuronal processes in <italic>slc25a46</italic> morphants, indicating either lack of development or degeneration of dendrites (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). By stochastically labeling the motor neurons, we frequently observed axonal blebbing and dying back at the morphant motor neuron terminals specifying degeneration, which is consistent with the pathology of CMT2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). These results suggest that slc25a46 is important for both the growth and maintenance of neuronal processes.</p>
    <p id="P13">We next investigated the mitochondria in the motor neurons <italic>in vivo.</italic> Consistent with previous findings<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, we observed that in controls the majority of the mitochondria are located within the lower half of motor neuron soma, clustered at the axon initial segment. In contrast, mitochondria in degenerating neurons exhibit a reversal in cell localization favoring the apical portion of the soma and also appear to be aggregated (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6aâc</xref>). At the level of electron microscopy, we identified numerous mitochondria that appeared to be in the process of fission within the cell bodies of morphants, which was never observed in controls (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Incomplete fission of mitochondria could inhibit transport and distribution into neuronal processes<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P14">In conclusion, we have identified a novel mitochondrial disease gene associated with mitochondrial dynamics, optic atrophy, and CMT2. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the role of SLC25A46 in mitochondrial dynamics, but given the similar human phenotypes associated with MFN2, OPA1, and SLC25A46 mutations, these genes could be involved in common pathological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, which opens the possibility of future pathway-oriented treatments for these types of mitochondrial disorders.</p>

        <p id="P23">Fibroblasts were seeded onto 36 mm diameter dishes and grown in DMEM. Mitochondrial morphology was assessed by staining cells with 10nM Mitotracker Red (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cellular fluorescence images were acquired with an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti-U epifluorescence microscope equipped with a back- illuminated Photometrics Cascade CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Images were collected using a 63X/1.4 oil objective. Data were acquired and analyzed using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extra-cellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured in adherent fibroblasts with a XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Each control and mutant fibroblast cell lines were seeded in 5 wells of a XF 24-well cell culture microplate (Seahorse Bioscience) at a density of 30.000 cells/well in 250 Î¼L of DMEM and incubated for 24 hours at 37 Â°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.

        <p>SLC25A46 localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with mitofilin on the inner membrane. (<bold>a</bold>) High resolution confocal images of COS-7 cells co-transfected with SLC25A46-HA and Mitofilin-myc. TOM20 and Mitofilin-myc were used as markers of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes respectively. Scale bar=1 Î¼m. Linear profiles of the fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units along 2 Î¼m dashed lines in merged images. (<bold>b</bold>) Mitochondria (M) isolated from SLC25A46-HA transfected HEK293T cells were submitted to brief sonication and centrifugation to fractionate soluble (S) and membrane-bound proteins. The pellet was subjected to alkaline extraction to separate soluble membrane extrinsic (CS) and membrane intrinsic (P) proteins. Equivalent volumes of each fraction were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the soluble matrix protein mHSP70, the extrinsic membrane protein SDHA, the intrinsic membrane protein COX2 and HA. (c) Mitochondria and mitoplasts prepared by hypotonic swelling of mitochondria from HEK293T cells expressing SLC25A46-HA were treated with proteinase K where indicated. After treatment samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the outer membrane protein TOM20, the inner membrane proteins TIM50 and COX2 and HA. (<bold>d</bold>) Co-sedimentation of SLC25A46-HA and mitoflin in a linear 7â20% sucrose gradient. Hemoglobin, a 67 kDa protein, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a 130 kDa protein, were used to calibrate the gradient. M: mitochondria. Ex: total mitochondrial extract. Two exposures are shown for each protein.

The homozygous IT II-3 fibroblasts show reduced OCR compared to controls and heterozygous IT II-2 fibroblasts. OCR values are normalized to protein content. Error bars indicate the standard error of mean (s.e.m.) of four independent experiments. (<bold>d</bold>) BASAL, PROTON LEAK-linked, ATP-linked, MAXIMAL, Complex I-linked, MAXIMAL Complex I-linked respiration and SPARE CAPACITY were calculated from OCR traces and reported in the graph as mean Â± SEM. Dunnettâs test of control vs mutant fibroblasts was performed, * indicates p&lt;0.01. (<bold>e</bold>) Analysis of OCR/ECAR in basal conditions. Extra-cellular acidification rate (ECAR), is an indicator of lactic acid production. The reduced OCR/ECAR ratio observed in the homozygous IT II-3 fibroblasts suggests the occurrence of a glycolitic shift. Bars indicate the confidence intervals (Conf.Int.). Analysis was performed from 5 replicate wells for each fibroblasts line. Dunnettâs test of control vs mutant fibroblasts was performed, * indicates <italic>P</italic> = 0.002.</p>
