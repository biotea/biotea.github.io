        <p>Erlins are cholesterol-binding proteins that restrict the activation of SREBPs, key transcription factors for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic genes, under conditions of cholesterol sufficiency.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Cellular cholesterol levels are controlled by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sterol sensing proteins, which include Scap and Insig-1. With cholesterol sufficiency, Insig inhibits the activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), key transcription factors for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic genes, by associating with ScapâSREBP complexes to promote their ER retention. Here we show that the multimeric ER proteins erlins-1 and -2 are additional SREBP regulators. Depletion of erlins from cells grown with sterol sufficiency led to canonical activation of SREBPs and their target genes. Moreover, SREBPs, Scap, and Insig-1 were physically associated with erlins. Erlins bound cholesterol with specificity and strong cooperativity and responded to ER cholesterol changes with altered diffusional mobility, suggesting that erlins themselves may be regulated by cholesterol. Together, our results define erlins as novel cholesterol-binding proteins that are directly involved in regulating the SREBP machinery. We speculate that erlins promote stability of the SREBPâScapâInsig complex and may contribute to the highly cooperative control of this system.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential lipid of mammalian cells, serving as a structural component of membranes and a biosynthetic precursor to steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ikonen, 2008</xref>). Cholesterol increases stiffness and reduces permeability of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bretscher and Munro, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ikonen, 2008</xref>). It also is thought to participate in membrane-associated signaling and protein sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simons and Gerl, 2010</xref>). Cholesterol has a central role in the etiology of many cardiovascular diseases, and pharmacological inhibitors of its biosynthesis are widely used as therapeutic agents.</p><p>Cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake are regulated by the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). SREBPs are synthesized as part of transmembrane precursors that are integrated in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Goldstein, 1999</xref>). The SREBP precursors are bound to the ER transmembrane chaperone Scap, which contains a sterol-sensing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radhakrishnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motamed et al., 2011</xref>). Under conditions of cholesterol sufficiency, cholesterol-bound Scap associates with Insig, which promotes ER retention of the SREBPâScap complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). However, when ER cholesterol decreases below a critical threshold, Scap undergoes a conformational change that allows packaging of SREBPâScap in COPII-coated vesicles for subsequent transport to the Golgi. This is accompanied by increased ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of Insig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gong et al., 2006</xref>). In the Golgi, site-specific proteases release the cytosolic transcription factor domain of SREBPs that activates genes for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). When cholesterol levels are restored, the SREBPâScapâInsig complex again accumulates in the ER. SREBP retention in the ER involves a highly cooperative, switch-like response to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). The molecular basis for this effect is not understood.</p><p>Erlins are â¼40-kD proteins that originally were characterized by their fractionation in cholesterol-enriched, detergent-resistant membrane derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Browman et al., 2006</xref>). Erlins contain a membrane-inserted segment at their N terminus and are localized to the ER lumen in â¼1,000-kD heteromultimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoegg et al., 2009</xref>). They contain an â¼180-residue stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflK/C homology domain, found in more than 6,500 proteins from Archaea to higher eukaryotes, which is proposed to organize membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Langhorst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Browman et al., 2007</xref>). Erlins promote ERAD of the activated IP3 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2009</xref>) and of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jo et al., 2011</xref>). We now show that erlins are cholesterol-binding proteins that interact with SREBPâScapâInsig and are needed for restricting SREBP activation under conditions of cholesterol sufficiency. Our results reveal a new complexity of the machinery that regulates SREBPs and identify erlins as components that contribute to cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We analyzed whether siRNA-mediated knockdown of erlin-1 and/or erlin-2 in HeLa cells affects the activity of SREBPs under conditions of cholesterol sufficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). As a positive control for SREBP activation, lipid-depleted cell cultures were analyzed in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakai et al., 1996</xref>). This condition strongly activates both SREBP-2, which controls genes governing cholesterol biosynthesis, and SREBP-1a, which regulates genes for both cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hannah et al., 2001</xref>). Whereas erlin levels were strongly reduced with targeting siRNAs, they were not affected by lipid depletion (LD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SREBP target gene activation and lipid accumulation in cells with erlin depletion.</bold> (A) Silencing of erlin-1 and -2 with siRNA.

These included two genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis that are activated by both SREBP-2 and SREBP-1a, HMGR and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), and two genes involved in fatty acid synthesis that are preferentially activated by SREBP-1a, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). The transcripts for HMGR and HMGS were elevated to â¼300â500% of the control level by siRNAs that silenced either one or both erlins. Similarly, the levels of FASN and ACC1 mRNAs were increased to â¼200â300% of the control. These changes closely paralleled the effects seen with LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Erlin silencing in HepG2 hepatoma cells grown with cholesterol sufficiency led to a similar up-regulation of the genes reporting activation of the SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 pathways (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201305076/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>).</p><p>We verified that erlin depletion did not induce an ER stress response that might activate SREBPs indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Ye, 2004</xref>) by examining the splicing of XBP1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Whereas treatment with the ER stressor tunicamycin resulted in the shift of all detectable XBP1 mRNA to the spliced form (Fig. S1 B), only the unspliced form of XBP1 was detectable in erlin-silenced cells, similar to control cells (Fig. S1 B). Moreover, the tubuloreticular morphology of the ER seen in live HeLa cells did not detectably change with erlin loss (Fig. S1 C).</p><p>Consistent with the transcriptional activation of SREBP target genes, erlin silencing caused a substantial increase in the frequency of cells containing cytoplasmic lipid inclusions stained with Oil Red O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), sites for accumulation of excess cholesterol such as cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walther and Farese, 2009</xref>). Likewise, the end products of the biosynthetic pathways activated by SREBPs were increased by erlin silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Cellular cholesterol was increased to â¼200â230% of the control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, left) with little change in the proportion of free and esterified cholesterol. Free fatty acid was increased to 115â125% of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, middle), although triglyceride levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, right).</p><p>We next investigated whether the activation of SREBP target genes by erlin silencing under cholesterol sufficiency involves the canonical pathway that is normally induced by cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). First, we found that silencing of erlin-1 and/or erlin-2 led to the appearance of proteolytically cleaved SREBP-2 in nuclear extracts, as seen with LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Correspondingly, SREBP-2 accumulated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201305076/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Second, we determined that SREBP target gene activation with erlin silencing involves Scap. Fatostatin, a small molecule that binds to Scap and inhibits ER to Golgi transport of SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamisuki et al., 2009</xref>), reduced SREBP target gene activation to similar extents for both erlin knockdown and LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Finally, knockdown of erlins increased the rate of proteasomal degradation of Insig-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), similar to the destabilization of Insig induced by cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gong et al., 2006</xref>). Together these data indicate that activation of SREBP target genes with erlin silencing occurs by the canonical Scap-mediated pathway. This implies that erlins inhibit the production of cholesterol by restraining SREBP activation. These cholesterol-limiting effects could be amplified by the ability of erlin-2 to promote ERAD of HMGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Validation of SREBP activation with erlin depletion.</bold> (A) SREBP-2 processing.

Under conditions of cholesterol sufficiency, we found that Insig-1, Scap, SREBP-1a, and SREBP-2 all coimmunoprecipitated (coIPed) with erlin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) and the associated erlin-1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201305076/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S3 B</ext-link>). We also detected coIP of the ubiquitin E3 ligase gp78 with erlin-2 as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jo et al., 2011</xref>). The coIP of these proteins with erlins was specific because three other transmembrane proteins of the ER (derlin-1, Sec61Î±, and calnexin) as well as the peripheral ER protein p97 were not detectable in erlin IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Moreover, after cholesterol depletion, Insig-1, Scap, SREBP-1a, and SREBP-2 were undetectable or strongly diminished in erlin IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, gp78 association was unchanged as seen before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pearce et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jo et al., 2011</xref>). This supports the model that a physical association of erlins with SREBPâScapâInsig is functionally relevant to regulation of the SREBP pathway.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Association of erlins with the SREBP regulatory machinery.</bold> (A) CoIP of SREBP pathway proteins with endogenous erlin-2 in lysates of HeLa cells grown with complete (F) or LD medium.

Input (Inp.; 1 equivalent) and IPed material (IP; 10 equivalents, except for erlin-2 blot [1 equivalent]) was analyzed by Western blotting. Certain transfections (asterisk) received four times more Insig-1-Myc cDNA to compensate for the instability of Insig in the absence of overexpressed Scap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gong et al., 2006</xref>).

IPs of erlin-2 contained similar levels of ectopic Insig-1, whether or not Scap and/or SREBP-2 were coexpressed. When ectopic erlin-2 and Scap were expressed without Insig-1, a low level of Scap coIPed with erlins. Endogenous Insig-1 was responsible for at least most of this coIPed Scap because it diminished approximately threefold after knockdown of Insig-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In contrast, the amount of coIPed Scap increased approximately fourfold when Insig-1 was expressed together with Scap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Finally, ectopic SREBP-2 was found in erlin-2 IPs only when ScapâInsig was coexpressed. These results suggest that Insig-1 is a more proximal binding partner of erlins that stimulates binding of SREBPâScap to the erlinâInsig complex. However, decisive resolution of this issue, and whether the interactions of erlins with the SREBPâScapâInsig complex is direct or involves bridging proteins, awaits further analysis.</p><p>We used wide-field fluorescence microscopy of erlin-GFP and Insig-mCherry to examine whether erlins and Insig colocalize in live cells. We were unable to visualize discrete erlin complexes by conventional imaging. Therefore, we developed a rapamycin-inducible system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemm et al., 1997</xref>) to cluster erlin multimers into resolvable units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). We monitored Insig association with these foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and used quantitative methods to characterize the sample set (Fig. S3).</p><p>Both erlin-GFP and Insig-mCherry were distributed in an ER-like pattern in untreated cells. However, 20 min after rapamycin addition numerous distinctive foci of GFP appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 C</xref> and S3 D). Insig-1-mCherry foci also were observed after the addition of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). We found that 64% (Â±5.5%) of the Insig-mCherry foci colocalized with conspicuous erlin-GFP foci (three experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 55 cells). When the assay contained calnexin-mCherry instead of Insig-1-mCherry, we never observed mCherry foci in cells with erlin-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 28 cells). Finally, no rapamycin-induced GFP or mCherry foci were obtained in cells transfected with erlin-2-GFP and Insig-1-mCherry only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 38 cells). The specific coclustering of Insig-1 and the erlin complex in this live-cell assay provides further evidence for a physical interaction between these components.</p><p>Because SREBP activation is modulated by binding of cholesterol to Scap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>), and because erlin interactions with the SREBP machinery appear to be sensitive to changes in cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), we examined whether cholesterol binds to erlins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>; see Materials and methods). We found that cholesterol bound to recombinant erlin-1 with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 13.2 ÂµM and approximately six molecules of cholesterol per erlin monomer at saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The binding curve fit best to a sigmoidal function (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.98) with a Hill coefficient of 4.05, indicating a high degree of binding cooperativity. The binding of radiolabeled cholesterol to erlin-1 was specific, as it was strongly diminished by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled cholesterol, epicholesterol, or lanosterol, but was not substantially reduced by progesterone, 25-hydroxycholesterol, Î²-sitosterol, or squalene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). We also found that the native erlin-1/2 complex isolated from murine liver microsomal membranes saturably bound cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>; apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 13.4 ÂµM; approximately four molecules of cholesterol bound per molecule of erlin monomer at saturation). Here the binding curve was best described by a sigmoidal function (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.91) with a Hill coefficient of 3.47. Competition assays showed sterol binding specificity similar to recombinant erlin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Supporting our results, erlin-2 was specifically labeled with a photoreactive cholesterol analogue in a proteome-wide screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hulce et al., 2013</xref>). Cholesterol binding by erlins may occur outside the lipid bilayer as suggested for NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Infante et al., 2008a</xref>) and Scap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motamed et al., 2011</xref>) or may involve a segment of erlins with close bilayer interaction.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Cholesterol binding by erlins.</bold> (A) Structures of cholesterol and related compounds used.

We compared the diffusional mobility of erlin-2-GFP in cells grown in cholesterol replete (FBS) versus lipid-depleted conditions. In both cases, the FRAP recovery curves fit a two-phase exponential equation (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99), describing erlin-2 pools with âfastâ and âslowâ recovery kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). In FBS, approximately half of the erlin-2-GFP was in a slow pool. After cholesterol depletion nearly all of it was in a slow pool, albeit with substantially slower recovery kinetics than the FBS slow pool. After restoration of cholesterol, both fast and slow pools of erlin-2-GFP had FRAP recovery times similar to cholesterol-replete cultures. Cholesterol-dependent changes in diffusional mobility were not observed for the model ER transmembrane protein laminin B receptor (LBR)âGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>), showing that the effect on erlin-2 is selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Moreover, the effect cannot be ascribed to an ER stress response because there was no significant change in the mobility of erlin-2 in tunicamycin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Although we have not yet determined the molecular basis for the changes in erlin mobility with cholesterol depletion, our data nonetheless show that the physical properties of erlins are altered by standard conditions that induce SREBP pathway activation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Cholesterol-dependent changes in diffusional mobility of erlin-2.</bold> (A) Confocal images during FRAP of a HeLa cell expressing erlin-2-GFP.

Because erlins bind cholesterol and physically interact with SREBPâScapâInsig, we suggest that they directly promote ER retention of SREBPâScap. Several nonmutually exclusive models could explain this effect. First, erlin multimers could provide a scaffold for maintaining the integrity of the SREBPâScapâInsig complex. Second, erlins could catalytically promote the structural states of Scap and/or Insig that are competent to retain SREBPs in the ER. Third, erlins might negatively regulate proteasomal degradation of Insig. Alternatively, cholesterol association with erlins might nucleate the formation of cholesterol-rich microdomains in the ER that stimulate the interaction of Insig with SREBPâScap. This would be analogous to the concept of cholesterol-rich âraftsâ in the plasma membrane as regulators of membrane protein functions and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). In any case, the highly cooperative binding of cholesterol to erlins might stabilize an erlin conformation that could support the functional output we have defined and contribute to the switch-like cooperative regulation of the SREBP system by cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructs</title><p>pLBR-GFP for the expression of the 238âamino acid N-terminal portion of LBR fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>) was obtained from H. Worman (Columbia University, New York, NY). pSec61-GFP for the expression of Sec61Î±-GFP under control of a CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenfield and High, 1999</xref>) was obtained from T. Rapoport (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). pCMV-Insig-1-Myc for the expression of C-terminally MYC epitopeâtagged human Insig-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (deposited by J.L. Goldstein, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). pcDNA-HSV-cgScap-T7 was constructed by lifting the desired coding sequence from pTK-HSV-SCAP-T7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hua et al., 1996</xref>; American Type Culture Collection) using PCR with specific primers, adding the four nontranslated nucleotides (CACC) in front of the start codon to make the PCR product compatible with directional TOPO cloning into pcDNA3.1/V5-His/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The resulting construct allowed expression of the tagged hamster Scap protein (cgScap) under control of a CMV promoter. pcDNA-FLAG-SREBP-2 was constructed by PCR amplifying the coding sequence for human SREBP-2 from template pTK-HSV-SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hua et al., 1996</xref>; provided by J. Ye, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) with specific primers adding an N-terminal FLAG tag, a stop codon immediately downstream of the ORF, and four nontranslated nucleotides (CACC) in front of the start codon to make the PCR product compatible with directional TOPO cloning into pcDNA3.1/V5-His/D-TOPO. This construct allowed expression of the tagged protein FLAG-Srebp-2 under control of a CMV promoter. Plasmid pErlin-2-GFP was constructed as follows. Human erlin-2 cDNA was amplified from IMAGE clone 5296776 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by PCR and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) to result in pCR-erlin-2. From there, the SalIâBamHI fragment containing the erlin-2 coding sequence was transferred into pEGFP-N1 (Takara Bio Inc.) to yield a C-terminal GFP fusion protein under control of a CMV promoter. pcDNA-erlin-1-FKBP-V5 was constructed by first PCR amplifying the ORF for human erlin-1 from clone #4214940 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using specific oligonucleotides and adding a glycine-serine (GSGSG) linker at the C terminus of erlin-1 and four nontranslated nucleotides (CACC) in front of the erlin-1 start codon to make the PCR product compatible with directional TOPO cloning into pcDNA3.1/V5-His/D-TOPO. This created pcDNA-erlin-1. To produce pcDNA-erlin-1-FKBP, a PCR fragment encoding three copies of FKBP flanked by unique XbaI and XhoI sites was PCR amplified from a plasmid DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemm et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohba et al., 2004</xref>). This PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA-erlin-1 via identical restriction sites. Construct pcDNA-erlin-1-FKBP-V5 was created by linearizing pcDNA-erlin-1-FKBP with XhoI, filling in the resulting 3â² recessed ends, and religating the DNA resulting DNA. This adjusts the sequence so that erlin-1-FKBP was brought in frame with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag for the expression of erlin-1-FKBP/V5 under control of a CMV promoter. pcDNA-erlin-2-GFP-FRB was constructed by PCR amplifying the ORF encoding erlin-2-GFP of pErlin-2-GFP with specific primers, adding a GSGSG linker sequence to the C terminus of erlin-2-GFP and four nontranslated nucleotides (CACC) in front of the erlin-2 start codon to make the PCR product compatible with directional TOPO cloning. This PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His/D-TOPO to produce pcDNA-erlin-2-GFP. To fuse erlin-2-GFP to the FRB domain of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemm et al., 1997</xref>), a PCR product encoding FRB was amplified from a DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohba et al., 2004</xref>) using primers that introduced unique NotI and XbaI sites 5â² and 3â² of the FRB coding sequence, respectively. This PCR product was digested with NotI and XbaI and cloned into the identical restriction sites in pcDNA-Erlin-2-GFP to create pcDNA-erlin-2-GFP-FRB for the expression of erlin-2-GFP-FRB under control of a CMV promoter. pcDNA-Insig-1-mCherry was constructed as follows. First, the region of clone #3794 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) harboring the full-length human Insig-1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR with specific primers. The reverse primer added a SalI restriction site immediately 3â² of the last codon of Insig-1. This fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to result in pCR-Insig-1. Second, the region of plasmid pmCherry-N1 (Takara Bio Inc.) encoding the red fluorescent protein mCherry was amplified by PCR with specific primers, adding a SalI restriction site and a sequence encoding a GSGSG linker immediately upstream and in frame with the CDS for mCherry. This PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 to create pCR-mCherry. Next, the SacIâSalI fragment of pCR-Insig-1 harboring the ORF for human Insig-1 was ligated into pCR-mCherry via identical restriction sites, fusing Insig-1 in frame with mCherry in the resulting construct, pCR-Insig-1-mCherry. This construct was used as a template to PCR amplify the Insig-1-mCherry ORF with flanking primers, adding a sequence encoding three consecutive FLAG tags followed by a translational stop codon after the last codon of mCherry sequence and the four nontranslated nucleotides (CACC) in front of the start codon for Insig-1 to allow directional TOPO cloning of the PCR product into pcDNA3.1/V5-His/D-TOPO. The resulting construct, pcDNA-Insig-1-mCherry, allowed expression of the red fluorescent fusion protein under control of a CMV promoter. pcDNA-CANX-mCherry was constructed by PCR amplifying full-length human calnexin (CANX) coding sequence from clone #4342723 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with specific primers, introducing a SalI restriction site immediately after the last codon of the ORF for CANX. The PCR product was cloned into pCR4 (Invitrogen) to result in pCR4-CANX. The SalIâSpeI insert of pCR-mCherry (see above) was ligated into the SalIâSpeIâdigested pCR4-CANX to create an in-frame fusion of CANX with mCherry in pCR4-CANX-mCherry. From here, a 2.2-kb EcoRIâSbfI restriction fragment was purified and the EcoRI site was filled in to generate a blunt DNA end. This fragment was ligated with the SbfIâHindIII backbone portion of pcDNA-INSIG-1-mCherry after blunting the HindIII site of the vector fragment to make it ligatable with the blunted EcoRI site of the CANX-mCherry insert. This created pcDNA-CANX-mCherry for the expression of the red fluorescent fusion protein under control of a CMV promoter.

Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>IP</title><p>For IP of endogenous erlin complexes, we used nearly confluent cultures of HeLa cells that had been transfected with a small quantity of pCMV-Insig-1-Myc to express trace amounts of the tagged protein. This allowed unambiguous identification of Insig-1 with anti-Myc antibodies because commercial antiâInsig-1 antibodies showed lot-to-lot variations in quality. Cells were lysed at â¼10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; cleared of insoluble components by centrifugation; and incubated with 3 Âµg of either Î±âerlin-2 for 2 h at 4Â°C. Immune complexes were captured on protein Gâcoupled Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with SDS dye and heating to 100Â°C for 5 min. Interacting proteins were detected directly by Western blotting with specific antibodies.</p><p>For IP experiments with recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) the expression constructs were mixed at the combinations indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and the amount of DNA per sample was adjusted to 35 Âµg with a pcDNA vector carrying no cDNA insert (empty vector). The DNA was diluted into 400 Âµl OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and complexed with 150 Âµl LF2000 for reverse transfection of â¼2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> 293T cells. Cells were seeded on 10-cm culture dishes prepared with 10 ml complete medium and were incubated for 24 h before analysis. Where applicable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), nontargeting or Insig-1âspecific siRNA (600 pmol per 10-cm dish; â¼50 nM) was introduced into 293T cells 24 h before transfection with the indicated expression constructs. Dishes were washed once with ice-cold IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) and cells were collected by scraping. The cell material was adjusted to a total volume of 400 Âµl with IP buffer, to which was added proteinase inhibitor cocktail and Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. Cells were lysed by brief sonication (5 s) and incubation on ice for 5 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The resulting supernatant, with protein concentrations ranging from 6 to 10 mg/ml, served as input material for IP. Erlin-2-V5 and associated proteins were precipitated by incubation with 5 Âµg anti-V5 antibody on ice for 2 h. Formed immune complexes were bound to protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) for 45 min on ice, collected, washed thrice with IP buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and eluted into 70 Âµl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 50 mM DTT by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. A 50-Âµl sample of the input material was carried through the same incubation steps as the IP reaction for accurate comparison of the starting and IPed material. Recombinant erlin-2-V5, FLAG-SREBP-2, and Insig-1-Myc were detected in Western blotting by antibodies against the epitope tags. Hamster (<italic>Cricetus griseus</italic>) Scap was analyzed using an antibody specific for Scap from this species (labeled cgScap throughout this paper).</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy and image analysis</title><p>To evaluate activation of SREBP-2 by immunofluorescence, cells were grown on 35-mm glass bottom cell culture dishes for 36 h, fixed, and labeled with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal transcription factor portion of SREBP-2 (Cayman) followed by antiârabbit Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) and the DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Samples were covered with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) before imaging. Images were acquired at room temperature using a 40Ã plan apo objective (1.4 NA) on a DM-IRE2 fluorescent microscope (Leica), and analyzed using ImageJ software v1.43u (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) as follows. To assess nuclear levels of the N-terminal transcription factor portion of SREBP-2, nuclei were identified according to their staining with Hoechst. The nuclear SREBP-2 fluorescence signal was quantified and normalized to the fluorescent DNA signal in the same nucleus (SREBP-2<sub>nuc.</sub>/DNA). To determine nuclear enrichment of SREBP-2, the SREBP-2 fluorescence signal was measured along a 5-pixel-wide line drawn through a cell. This line was split into nuclear and cytoplasmic segments by reference to Hoechst staining. The average pixel intensities of SREBP-2 in the nuclear (SREBP-2<sub>nuc.</sub>) and cytoplasmic segments (SREBP-2<sub>cyt.</sub>) were computed and the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio calculated as SREBP-2<sub>nuc.</sub>/SREBP-2<sub>cyt.</sub>.</p><p>Inducible erlin focus formation experiments exploited the rapamycin-dependent interaction between FKBP12 and the FRB domain of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klemm et al., 1997</xref>). HeLa cells were transfected as described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>) with constructs for the expression of erlin-1-FKBP, erlin-2-GFP-FRB, and Insig-1-mCherry mixed at a 1:1:3 ratio (10 Âµg DNA total) using 10 Âµl Lipofectamine 2000 for reverse transfection of 3 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells. Cells were seeded and incubated in phenol redâfree complete medium on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation) for â¼20 h. Where indicated, 200 ng/ml rapamycin was added for 20 min before imaging live cells at room temperature in normal atmosphere. Images were acquired with a 60Ã Plan-Apochromat (1.4 N.A.) oil immersion objective on an Eclipse TE2000-T fluorescence microscope (Nikon), using a dual excitation light source and a TwinCam dual emission camera system (Cairn Research) for simultaneous acquisition of images in the FITC (erlin-2-GFP-FRB) and Texas red (Insig-1-mCherry and CANX-mCherry) fluorescent channels. Imaging was concluded within 60 min of rapamycin addition. Colocalization between erlin-GFP and Insig-1-mCherry foci was evaluated using NIH ImageJ v1.43u software as follows. Red (Insig-1-mCherry) and green (erlin-2-GFP-FRB) channels of an image were separated into individual grayscale images. Typically â¼6â12 easily identifiable foci in the Insig-1-mCherry image were chosen and outlined by circles 3â6 pixels in diameter. A mask was created with these regions of interest (ROIs) and transferred to the identical position on the erlin-GFP image. If the circles from the red channel surrounded foci in the green channel, this indicated that a corresponding erlin-GFP focus existed and foci were scored as colocalized. Further characterization of this inducible clustering system and fluorescence intensity characterization of erlin-GFP foci is described in Fig. S3.</p><p>To assess ER morphology, pSec61-GFP transfected cells grown on 35-mm glass bottom dishes in complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) were labeled for 15 min with Hoechst 33342 and imaged live through a 60Ã plan apo objective (1.4 NA) on a 710 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a live-cell chamber (37Â°C, humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere). A pinhole setting of 1 Airy Unit was used. Images created by Zen2008 software (Carl Zeiss) were viewed, converted, and cropped in ImageJ.</p><p>All images shown are representative of the situation observed during microscopy. Adjustments to brightness and contrast, as far as they were necessary for publication purposes, were minimal, linear, and applied evenly to the entire image.</p></sec><sec><title>Erlin purification and lipid binding assay</title><p>Recombinant human erlin-1-V5 was expressed in Schneider S2 insect cells using the DES TOPO TA Expression Kit (Invitrogen). In brief, S2 cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding human erlin-1 and labeled at the C-terminal end with the V5 epitope and a hexahistidine tag, which was under the control of the copper inducible metallothionein promoter (pMT-erlin-1-V5). Cells were grown in suspension to a density of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml before induction of protein expression with 0.5 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> for 48 h. Cells were pelleted and lysed in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. This crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The resulting cleared lysate was processed by FPLC purification of the recombinant protein using metal-chelate affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was highly enriched in a single fraction eluting at 500 mM imidazole.</p><p>Erlin-1-V5 was further purified and prepared for lipid binding assays from the imidazole eluate by immunoadsorption. In brief, anti-V5 antibody was cross-linked to protein G dynabeads at 0.1 Âµg antibody/Âµl beads, using BS<sup>3</sup> (Invitrogen). Non-specific control beads were prepared identically except that normal mouse IgG (Invitrogen) was used. Anti-V5 and control beads were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with aliquots of the erlin-1-V5âcontaining imidazole fraction. Beads were then washed twice with buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.1, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.2% Triton X-100) containing 250 mM NaCl, followed by two washes with buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. The washed beads were pulled down again and resuspended in storage buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.01% Triton X-100) before use in lipid binding reactions. Each sample for a binding experiment contained â¼400 ng of highly purified erlin-1-V5 (&gt;90% pure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).</p><p>Native erlin complex was purified from microsomal preparations isolated from the livers of young adult mice by differential centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walter and Blobel, 1983</xref>) as follows. Livers from 10 C57B6/J mice (five male and five female, â¼3 mo old) fed ad libitum with normal chow were collected at the end of the dark cycle. Livers were washed in PBS, followed by hypotonic buffer (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, and 10 mM KCl). Typically 5â6 g of tissue were minced, transferred to a Potter homogenizer, and mixed with 3.5 weight volumes (â¼20 ml) of hypotonic buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitor cocktail. The tissue was homogenized on ice with seven strokes from a motorized pestle revolving at 1,500 rpm. The homogenate was transferred to a 50-ml conical tube and subjected to a first centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 <italic>g</italic>. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was collected, adjusted to contain 0.25 M sucrose, and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,600 <italic>g</italic> in a 45Ti rotor to pellet mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous gradient made from layers of (bottom to top) 2 M sucrose, 1.3 M sucrose, and the 0.25-M sucrose containing post-mitochondrial material. The step gradients were centrifuged for 4 h at 27,000 rpm (â¼131,300 <italic>g</italic>) in a SW28 rotor. The flocculent layer at the interface between 1.3 and 2 M sucrose, identified by Western blotting to be most highly enriched for erlin protein, was collected and used for the preparation of magnetic beads for cholesterol binding reactions.</p><p>Magnetic beads for binding reactions containing endogenous erlins were produced by coupling 6 Âµg of antiâerlin-2<sup>310</sup> antibody, affinity purified from our rabbit polyclonal antiâerlin-2 serum against the synthetic peptide CGGLGKQFEGLSDDKLG (representing amino acids 310â325 of erlin-2), to protein G Dynabeads (see above). The resulting antiâerlin-2 beads were incubated with a lysate of 200 Âµl microsomes (0.65 mg protein/ml) in 30 mM Hepes, pH 7.1, 200 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4Â°C. Control beads were produced by incubating the microsomal lysate with antiâerlin-2<sup>310</sup> beads together with 0.1 mg/ml antigenic peptide. Beads were washed four times with 500 mM NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 100 Âµl of storage buffer immediately before use in binding reactions. The erlin-specific bead preparations contained on average a total of â¼200 ng of strongly enriched erlin complex.</p><p>The lipid binding analysis was adapted from the procedure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Infante et al. (2008b)</xref>. Lipid binding reactions contained 3 Âµl beads (erlin-1-V5, native erlin, or matching control beads), lipids at the indicated concentrations, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and Triton X-100 at the subcritical micellar concentration of 0.005% (wt/vol) in a total volume of 50 Âµl. For binding saturation and competition experiments, cholesterol and other lipids, including a defined trace amount of <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol (5 pmol/reaction), were dissolved and/or mixed in ethanol at 40Ã final concentration before diluting the lipids into a reaction master mix. Reactions were started by addition of beads, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with buffer, and eluted with 200 mM glycine, pH 1.9, 0.005% Triton X-100, and eluates were analyzed by scintillation counting. To determine erlin-specific binding, the amount of eluted radioactivity from control reactions was subtracted from that of erlin-containing reactions. Binding data were analyzed mathematically as described in the Statistical analysis section.</p></sec><sec><title>FRAP analysis</title><p>Living pErlin-2-GFPâ or pLBR-GFPâtransfected HeLa cells, kept in DMEM supplemented as indicated in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> (lipid complete, depletion conditions, with or without tunicamycin), were visualized on a 710 scanning laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a live-cell chamber (37Â°C, humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere) and controlled by Zen2008 software. Imaging used a 63Ã plan apo objective (1.4 NA) and a pinhole setting of 1 Airy unit. Pre- and post-bleach images were recorded using the 488-nm emission of a 40-mW argon laser at 7% power and a fast line speed of 10. After five prebleach scans, a 4-Âµm<sup>2</sup> bleach spot was generated in the cytoplasmic/ER region of a selected cell using 80% laser power with a slower line speed setting of 5 for eight iterations. Post-bleach fluorescence intensity was monitored by recording an image every 3 s for 65 cycles using the original laser and line speed settings. Simultaneously, fluorescence data from an unbleached, unrelated 4-Âµm<sup>2</sup> area within the same cell was recorded for normalization purposes. Numerical fluorescence intensity data from bleached and control regions, generated by the Zen2008 software, were exported into Excel 2007 (Microsoft). Data from the bleached ROI were corrected for the loss of fluorescence owing to post-bleach imaging by normalization to the nonbleached region in the same cell as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>). Data from at least three separate experiments (5â10 cells/condition) were averaged and further evaluated as described in the Statistical analysis section. Selected images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> were exported from Zen2008 in TIFF format and processed and labeled in ImageJ v1.43u.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values presented are averages from multiple biological repeats of an experiment. Error bars indicate SD. Significance of results was determined by unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test between control and experimental samples. Functions that best describe lipid binding and FRAP data were determined by F-test, and best-fit values were calculated based on averages of at least three samples per data point. Covariation of nuclear SREBP-2 concentration and the SREBP-2 nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was determined by Pearson correlation. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism versions 4.03 and 5.04 (GraphPad Software) and Excel 2007.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>This section contains supplemental figures showing q-RT-PCR data for activation of SREBP target genes in HepG2 cells, PCR analysis of the UPR status in erlin-silenced cells, and micrographs illustrating the ER morphology in erlin-silenced cells (Fig. S1); SREBP-2 activation after erlin silencing determined by IF and image analysis (Fig. S2); and a biochemical and microscopic characterization of the rapamycin-inducible erlin/Insig-1 clustering system (Fig. S3).
