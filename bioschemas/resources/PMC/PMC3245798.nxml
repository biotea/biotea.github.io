        <p id="P1">Measles (MV) is an aerosol-transmitted virus that affects more than 10 million children each year and accounts for approximately 120,000 deaths<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. While it was long believed to replicate in the respiratory epithelium before disseminating, it was recently shown to initially infect macrophages and dendritic cells of the airways using the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) as receptor<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These cells then cross the respiratory epithelium and ferry the infection to lymphatic organs where MV replicates vigorously<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. How and where the virus crosses back into the airways has remained unknown. Based on functional analyses of surface proteins preferentially expressed on virus-permissive epithelial cell lines, we identified nectin-4<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (poliovirus-receptor-like-4) as a candidate host exit receptor. This adherens junction protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily interacts with the viral attachment protein with high affinity through its membrane-distal domain. Nectin-4 sustains MV entry and non-cytopathic lateral spread in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial sheets infected basolaterally. It is down-regulated in infected epithelial cells, including those of macaque tracheas. While other viruses use receptors to enter hosts or transit through their epithelial barriers, we suggest that MV targets nectin-4 to emerge in the airways. Nectin-4 is a cellular marker of several types of cancer<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, which has implications for ongoing MV-based clinical trials of oncolysis<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>

    <p id="P2">Analysis of the spread of a wild type MV expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in human airway well-differentiated epithelial sheets revealed that MV infects only columnar cells connected by the apical adhesion complex<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Thus we thought that MV might target an intercellular junctional protein to enter the airway epithelium. To narrow the search for this receptor, we initially compared genome-wide transcription in permissive (H358 and H441) and non-permissive (H23 and H522) airway epithelium cell lines<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. For these cells high quality genome-wide microarray analyses are available (GEO microarray data GSE8332)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We identified 175 transmembrane proteins preferentially expressed in permissive cells. Among these, we expressed cDNAs of 22 that either had top preferential expression ratios, or interesting biological characteristics. None of these proteins, including four claudins from the tight junction, and E-cadherin and nectin-3 from the adherens junction (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>, footnote), conferred susceptibility to MV infection.</p>
    <p id="P3">Next we performed a genome-wide expression analysis based on mRNA extracted from all seven epithelial cell lines from human airways or bladder previously characterized as permissive (3 lines) or not (4 lines)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. This time, we observed significant enrichment of 222 mRNAs for surface-associated proteins (GEO microarray data GSE32155). We selected 16 genes with high expression ratios in both screens, interesting biological characteristics, or both. In addition, we selected the genes with the top 12 expression ratios not already represented in the first analysis (for details see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). Non-permissive Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with expression plasmids and subsequently infected with GFP-expressing MV.</p>
    <p id="P4">In one instance, we observed GFP expression followed by syncytia formation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>, central panel). The plasmid transfected in these cells coded for adherens junction protein PVRL4/nectin-4. The corresponding mRNA had the 9<sup>th</sup> highest preferential expression ratio in the second screen (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>, #9). Nectin-4 is a single pass type I transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Its long (3.7 kb) mRNA was initially detected only in human trachea among somatic tissues<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, but a recent study documented expression in skin, lung, prostate, and stomach<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">We assessed the levels of nectin-4 protein expression in the seven epithelial cell lines used for gene expression profiling. FACS analyses with specific antibodies confirmed high levels of expression in the three cell lines permissive for MV infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref></bold>, top row). Three of the non-permissive cell lines did not express nectin-4, while the fourth showed variable expression levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref></bold>, bottom row). We also purchased four nectin-4 specific siRNAs, and assessed whether transfection of H358 cells with these affects MV entry. Indeed, three siRNAs strongly reduced infection, and in particular siRNA 4_1 almost completely abolished it (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref></bold>, right panel). We then documented that nectin-4 is functionally equivalent to the proposed epithelial receptor EpR<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> through cell fusion assays (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). We also showed that neither the other three human nectins nor the related poliovirus receptor PVR/CD155<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> have MV receptor function (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Remarkably, alpha-herpesviruses use ubiquitous nectin-1 as receptor, and the same is true for nectin-2<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. While this paper was in review, another group documented in cancer cells that nectin-4 is an epithelial cell receptor for MV<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">All four nectins share the same overall structure defined by three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (V and two C2-type domains, VCC), a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular domain. To map the domain interacting with MV H, we took advantage of two recombinant soluble forms of nectin-4: VCC-Fc and the shorter V-Fc<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, which were used to block MV infection. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref></bold>, both forms were similarly effective: 1 Î¼g/ml solutions sufficed for about 50% reduction of syncytia formation.</p>
    <p id="P7">An independent mapping approach relied on two nectin-4 specific antibodies, N4.40 and N4.61. While N4.40 recognizes one of the two C domains, N4.61 recognizes the V domain<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Again, different dilutions of either antibody were added before virus inoculation. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref></bold> shows that while a 0.5 Î¼g/ml N4.61 solution inhibited entry almost completely, 100 times more concentrated N4.40 did not inhibit virus entry. Thus the soluble nectin-4 V domain and anti-V antibodies block infection.</p>
    <p id="P8">To further characterize the interactions of soluble H and purified virus particles with nectin-4 and SLAM, we separated the same amount of soluble forms of both receptors by non-reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred them to membranes. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref></bold> documents that binding of H to partially denatured nectin-4 (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> lanes) is at least as strong as binding to partially denatured SLAM (1<sup>st</sup> lane). <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref></bold> documents stronger binding of virus (left panel) and of soluble H protein (top right panel) to VCC-Fc than to V-Fc nectin-4 (left panel).</p>
    <p id="P9">We then sought to determine the kinetic parameters of binding native nectin-4 (VCC-Fc) to native H. The soluble complete extracellular domain of SLAM was used as control (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref></bold>). The measured dissociation constant (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) of SLAM was 93.5 nM, which compares well with 80 nM measured previously<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of H and nectin-4 was 20 nM: while the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> of both reactions was similar, the <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> of nectin-4 and H was almost 5 times faster than that of SLAM and H (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref></bold>). Since the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of the CD46 and vaccine H interaction is about 79 nM<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, nectin-4 is the cellular protein bound by H with strongest affinity. However, when CHO cells stably expressing either SLAM or nectin-4 were infected, we documented about 5 times more efficient MV infection in the SLAM-expressing CHO cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>)</bold>. Thus parameters other than the <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>, like accessibility of the receptor-binding region, influence virus spread in this system.</p>
    <p id="P10">To assess the relevance of nectin-4 expression for MV infection in humans, we relied on primary human airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. These cellular sheets closely resemble the human airway: cells develop apical adhesion complexes with tight and adherens junctions, and a well-differentiated morphology consisting of a pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet and basal cells. In these epithelia, we confirmed nectin-4 mRNA expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref></bold>) at levels slightly higher than those of the Calu3 cell line, which supports efficient MV infection<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We next transfected the epithelia with specific siRNAs, achieving 90% decrease in nectin-4 mRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref></bold>). We then infected the cultures and counted on average 4 infectious centers in the negative control siRNA-treated cells while no infectious center, or infected cell, was detected in nectin-4 siRNA treated cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref></bold>). Thus MV infection depends on the presence of nectin-4.</p>
    <p id="P11">A second assay of nectin-4 function in well-differentiated human airway epithelia relied on MV-nectin4<sup>blind</sup> (originally named MV-EpR<sup>blind</sup>), a virus with two amino acid mutations in its H protein disallowing cell entry through the epithelial receptor<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref></bold> documents that while MV infectious centers included more than 100 cells, the rare MV-nectin4<sup>blind</sup> infections were limited to 1-2 cells. Thus MV must recognize nectin-4 to enter human airway epithelial sheets, and to efficiently spread laterally.</p>
    <p id="P12">The fact that nectin-4 is transcribed at the highest level in the trachea<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> prompted us to consider a mechanism targeting virus emergence to the tracheobronchial airways. To analyze whether MV replicates in nectin-4 expressing cells in an infected host, we inoculated cynomolgus monkeys (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) that can develop the clinical signs of measles<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. To facilitate detection of infectious centers, a GFP-expressing virus was used. Tissues were collected near the peak of acute disease 12 days post-inoculation, and analyses of tracheal sections revealed the expected pathological pattern (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>,</bold> panels a-d).</p>
    <p id="P13"><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref></bold> is a correlative analysis of nectin-4 expression and MV replication in epithelia: strongly nectin-4 positive cells were located directly adjacent to infectious centers. These centers consistently included many DAPI (blue) counterstained nuclei, and always lined the tracheal lumen (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref></bold>, two overlay panels at right; see also paraffin sections in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>,</bold> panels e-g). Remarkably, within infected cells nectin-4 was sometimes expressed at low levels, suggesting virus-induced downregulation. Indeed <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref></bold> documented that median nectin-4 cell surface expression in infected lung and bladder epithelial cell lines is about 5 times lower than in uninfected cells.</p>
    <p id="P14">Having considered that in cells where nectin-4 is not expressed MV replication cannot occur, we assessed the levels of viral nucleocapsid and nectin-4 mRNA in the trachea and lung tissues of the five infected animals by real-time PCR. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref></bold> documents a high correlation coefficient (r=0.77) between viral and nectin-4 mRNA levels. Moreover, it indicates high nectin-4 expression levels in the trachea and lungs, suggesting that nectin-4 distribution in the airways of cynomolgus macaques is similar to humans.</p>
    <p id="P15">MV begins its circuit through selected organs of the human body within SLAM-expressing alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, which ferry it through the epithelial barrier<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref></bold>). Analyses in primate models indicate that vigorous MV replication occur in primary and secondary lymphatic organs, including tracheobronchial lymph nodes, already 3-5 days after infection<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. A few daysâ later, most infected cells in the trachea are of lymphoid or myeloid origin, and located in the sub-epithelial cell layer<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We collected here tissues at the peak of acute disease, and documented large infectious centers in nectin-4 expressing epithelial cells adjacent to the tracheal lumen. We also observed good correlation between MV and nectin-4 mRNA levels in different parts of the lungs. These data and the experimental demonstration that a virus unable to recognize nectin-4 cannot cross the airway epithelium and is not shed<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, are consistent with targeting of a protein expressed in the trachea for site-directed host exit. Emergence into the tracheobronchial airways appears ideal for aerosol droplet release through coughing and sneezing, filling the air with virus particles ready to infect the next host, and accounting for the extraordinary high reproductive rate of MV in naÃ¯ve populations<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P16">Nectin-4 is highly expressed in lung, breast and ovarian cancer, for which it is used as a marker<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. MV replicates preferentially in cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and spontaneous regressions of different forms of lymphoma were repeatedly observed after natural MV infections. These oncolytic effects are attributed to SLAM-overexpression in transformed lymphocytes<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. On the other hand, a vaccine-lineage MV, which recognizes ubiquitous CD46 in addition to SLAM as receptor, is currently used in ovarian cancer clinical trials<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Since most ovarian cancers are of epithelial origin, nectin-4 expression is worth testing as a retrospective correlate of MV oncolytic activity. In addition, MV-based clinical trials of lung and breast cancer should be considered. Interestingly, most viruses in oncolysis clinical trials<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> exploit junction proteins as receptors<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that general accessibility of junction proteins in disordered cancer tissue facilitates viral entry, contributing to efficient oncolysis.</p>

          <p id="P20">Data from the first round of profiling were analyzed by the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Mayo Clinic. After data normalization and determination of the sensitivity of the array, 21,163 probe sets were compared for transcript expression (average permissive/average non permissive). The data were further filtered for membrane-associated proteins, resulting in a list of 1,531 probe sets. A total of 254 probe sets, representing 175 proteins, were overexpressed at least 5 times in the cells permissive to wild type MV compared to non-permissive cells. Of these 22 were expressed; the complete list of these proteins is presented in a footnote of <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>. This Table also presents the data from the second round of profiling. Here, quality-verified RNA of all previously characterized 7 epithelial cell lines<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> were prepared in triplicates and analyzed with Agilent's Microarray Scanner System based on the one-color Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol (Agilent Technologies, Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Detected signals of probe sets (41,000) were normalized and signal intensities were compared for transcript expression (median permissive versus median non-permissive) resulting in 2,952 up-regulated probe sets in permissive cells. These were further filtered for membrane-associated proteins (259 probe sets), representing 222 up-regulated proteins. The table presents a selection of these 222 proteins sorted for the median distance (last row) of permissive versus non-permissive cellsâ signal intensities, expressed as log2 values. The respective factor of mRNA overexpression in permissive cells, i.e. the total signal intensity differences, can be deduced by calculating factor 2 to the power of the median distance. Microarray data are available in the GEO database with the accession number GSE32155.</p>

          <p id="P27">Primary cultures of human airway epithelia were prepared from trachea and bronchi by enzymatic dispersion and seeded onto collagen-coated, semipermeable membranes with an 0.4-Î¼m pore size (Millicell-HA; surface area, 0.6 cm<sup>2</sup>; Millipore Corporation) as previously described<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Only well-differentiated cultures (&gt;2 weeks old; resistance, &gt;500 Ohms/cm<sup>2</sup>) were used. Transepithelial resistance was measured with a volt-ohm meter (World Precision Instruments). Values were corrected for the blank filter resistance and further standardized against baseline readings and uninfected cultures. Neither corrected nor raw numbers resulted in a statistically significant variation from measurements in uninfected epithelia as determined by ANOVA. For transfections, Costar transwell permeable supports (3470 clear) were coated overnight with collagen and washed the following day with PBS (1% Penicillin-Streptomycin). 200,000 freshly dissociated human tracheal epithelial cells were transfected in each transwell using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX with 100 nM dsRNA oligonucleotides: 5'-GCAGUAUUAAUGAUGCAGAGGUUGG-3' and 5'-CCAACCUCUGCAUCAUUAAUACUGCUC-3'. Apical media was aspirated 6 hrs post-transfection and Ultroser G (Pall corporation) media was added to the basolateral surface. For infections, MV preparations were diluted in sterile PBS to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (as determined on Vero-SLAM cells), and 100 Î¼l of the solution was applied to the basolateral surface. We did note that human airways polarized, well-differentiated cells have a much lower susceptibility to MV infection than Vero-SLAM cells. This was expected since these transformed cells have reduced innate immunity, including the absence of interferon responses, and their barriers to infection are reduced compared to a differentiated epithelium.</p>

        <p><bold>a,</bold> Nectin-4 mediates MV entry. CHO-K1 cells were not transfected (mock), or transfected with the expression plasmids nectin-4 or MST1R. Top row: after transfection cells were infected with a MV expressing GFP. Bottom row: expression of nectin-4 and MST1R (interrupted black lines), as documented by FACS analysis. Dark grey lines: isotype controls; light grey shadings: unstained controls. <bold>b,</bold> FACS analysis of nectin-4 expression levels in different cells. Cell lines H358, H441 and HT1376, top row, are permissive for MV infection. Cell lines H23, H522, T24, and SCaBER are non-permissive. Antibody LS-C37483 was used. <bold>c,</bold> siRNA-mediated knock-down of nectin-4 expression in H358 cells (left panels). Control (top row) or nectin-4 specific 4_1 siRNA (bottom row) were transfected. After transfections cells were infected with a MV expressing GFP. FACS analysis (right panels) indicated more than 90% reduction of nectin-4 expression on the cell surface.</p>

        <title>V domain of nectin-4 supports strong binding to MV H</title>
        <p><bold>a</bold> and <bold>b,</bold> MV infection competition assays in H358 cells. For (a), N4VCC-Fc (grey bars) with all three immunoglobulin domains, and N4V-Fc (black bars) with only the V domain were used. As control soluble immunoglobulin superfamily protein CTLA4-Fc (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, also named CD152) was used (white bars). For (b), antibodies N4.40, recognizing one of the C domains, or N4.61 recognizing the V domain, were used. All assays were done in triplicate (n=3); mean and standard deviation of the number of observed syncytia per well are indicated on the vertical axis. Concentration of the undiluted protein solution is indicated on the horizontal axis. For dimeric N4VCC-Fc 10 Î¼g/ml are 71 nM; no, no protein added. <bold>c</bold> and <bold>d,</bold> non-reducing gel electrophoresis analysis of binding of soluble H and purified virus particles to different soluble receptors. Molecular weight markers are indicated. N4VCC-Fc and N4V-Fc are dimeric proteins of 140 kDa and 90 kDa respectively<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The 260 kDa observed for N4VCC-Fc probably corresponds to association of two dimers through C domain dependent homophilic interactions. For (d), CTLA4-Fc loaded at the same concentration did not cross-react with soluble H (right top panel), but was detected by protein A-HRP with the same efficiency (right bottom panel). <bold>e,</bold> surface plasmon resonance analyses of H binding to SLAM. Multiple cycles of association and dissociation were performed using receptor concentrations ranging from 50 to 800 nM (color coding on top). Horizonal axis: time in seconds; vertical axis, absorbance units. <bold>f,</bold> surface plasmon resonance analyses of H binding to nectin-4.</p>

        <title>Nectin-4 is necessary for MV infection of well-differentiated human airway epithelia</title>
        <p><bold>a,</bold> nectin-4 mRNA expression assessed by quantitative RT PCR and presented as fold change relative to Calu-3 cells. For human airway epithelial cells (hAEC), the bar represents data from 6 different donor samples (n=6). For cell lines (Calu-3, HEK293, Huh7) each bar represents 3 separate RNA preparations (n=3). <bold>b,</bold> knockdown of nectin-4 mRNA in hAEC. Levels of nectin-4 mRNA were assessed 72 hours after transfection of a control siRNA (left column) or a nectin-4 specific siRNA (right column) (n=6). <bold>c,</bold> lack of MV infection in hAEC after nectin-4 mRNA knockdown. GFP-positive infectious centers were counted 3 days following MV infection of hAEC transfected with a negative control siRNA (left column) or nectin-4 siRNA (n=9, nine epithelial preparations from a single donor lung). All data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. We note that if the well with 17 infectious centers is excluded, p improves to 0.0055. However, the infectious center average drops to 2.75 in the non-treated control.</p>
