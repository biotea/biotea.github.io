        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Directional cell migration involves reorientation of the secretory machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that control this reorientation are not well characterised. Here, we identify a new Rho effector protein, named FAM65A, which binds to active RHOA, RHOB and RHOC. FAM65A links RHO proteins to Golgi-localising cerebral cavernous malformation-3 protein (CCM3; also known as PDCD10) and its interacting proteins mammalian STE20-like protein kinases 3 and 4 (MST3 and MST4; also known as STK24 and STK26, respectively). Binding of active RHO proteins to FAM65A does not affect the kinase activity of MSTs but results in their relocation from the Golgi in a CCM3-dependent manner. This relocation is crucial for reorientation of the Golgi towards the leading edge and subsequent directional cell migration. Our results reveal a previously unidentified pathway downstream of RHO that regulates the polarity of migrating cells through Golgi reorientation in a FAM65A-, CCM3- and MST3- and MST4-dependent manner.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Establishment of frontâback polarity is crucial for directional migration of mesenchymal-like cells (<xref rid="JCS198614C12" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville, 2008</xref>). In addition to the asymmetric organisation of the cytoskeleton, which is achieved through recruitment as well as local synthesis of proteins (<xref rid="JCS198614C28" ref-type="bibr">Mardakheh et al., 2015</xref>), polarised cells reorient their secretory traffic towards the direction of migration (<xref rid="JCS198614C30" ref-type="bibr">Mellor, 2004</xref>). Such exocytic cargos, which originate from the Golgi, contain additional membrane, cell-surface receptors and extracellular matrix components that are required for the maintenance of the leading edge (<xref rid="JCS198614C30" ref-type="bibr">Mellor, 2004</xref>). Crucially, reorientation of the secretory traffic is needed for polarised cell movement, suggesting that biased secretion at the front of the cell is an important component of directional migration (<xref rid="JCS198614C51" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The exact molecular events that trigger the reorientation of the Golgi during cell migration are poorly characterised, but reorganisation of the microtubule network has been shown to be important for repositioning of the Golgi (<xref rid="JCS198614C50" ref-type="bibr">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). The Rho family of small GTPases are principle regulators of the cytoskeleton (<xref rid="JCS198614C38" ref-type="bibr">Sadok and Marshall, 2014</xref>). In particular, the Rho-GTPase family member CDC42 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of polarity (<xref rid="JCS198614C11" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>). CDC42 is activated in response to external stimuli such as chemoattractants or matrixâintegrin engagement, and acts to induce cytoskeletal polarisation and Golgi reorientation through establishing the PAR6âPAR3âaPKC polarity complex (<xref rid="JCS198614C11" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville, 2004</xref>). This complex leads to localised stabilisation of microtubule filaments (<xref rid="JCS198614C13" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C14" ref-type="bibr">Etienne-Manneville et al., 2005</xref>) and engages with dynein to induce the pulling of astral microtubules (<xref rid="JCS198614C31" ref-type="bibr">Palazzo et al., 2001</xref>), resulting in reorientation of the centrosome, which is closely associated with the Golgi. The involvement of other Rho-GTPases in the regulation of cell polarity, however, is less-well understood.</p>
      <p>Importantly, in addition to the abovementioned cytoskeletal processes, specific signalling events within the Golgi are also required for reorientation of the secretory apparatus. For instance, ERK phosphorylation of the Golgi structural protein GRASP65, which promotes Golgi unstacking, is necessary to allow centrosome repositioning in response to polarity cues (<xref rid="JCS198614C2" ref-type="bibr">Bisel et al., 2008</xref>). Golgi-localised activities of YSK1 and MST4 (also known as STK25 and STK26, respectively), which belong to the germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) subfamily of STE20-like protein kinases, also regulate Golgi dispersion and reorientation towards the leading edge (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>), although the upstream regulators of these kinases in the context of Golgi reorientation have not been determined.</p>
      <p>We here report FAM65A as a new effector for members of the RHO subfamily of Rho-GTPases. FAM65A associates with GTP-bound RHO proteins (RHOA, RHOB and RHOC) through an N-terminal HR1 domain. FAM65A also contains a C-terminal HEAT/Armadillo repeat motif (ARM) domain, which is constitutively associated with CCM3 (also known as PDCD10), MST4 and, to a lesser extent, MST3 (also known as STK24). Upon binding of RHO to FAM65A, MST4 is relocated from the Golgi to cytoplasmic punctae. This relocation is not only dependent on active RHO and FAM65A but also on CCM3. Importantly, we demonstrate that RHO-triggered relocation of MST proteins is crucial for reorientation of the Golgi and efficient directional migration. Our results reveal a new pathway downstream of RHO that controls Golgi reorientation and directional migration through regulation of MST protein localisation.</p>

        <title>FAM65A is a new RHO effector</title>
        <p>To identify new proteins that interact with RHO, we performed pulldown assays with purified immobilised GTP-bound GSTâRHOA as bait, coupled with quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labelling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>A). Most known RHO effectors, as well as several upstream regulators were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B; <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S1</uri>). We also identified a number of new RHO-interacting proteins, one of which, named FAM65A, was amongst the top enriched proteins in our pulldowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>B; <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S1</uri>). FAM65A is an uncharacterised 132-kDa protein with no apparent catalytic domains. Amino-acid sequence analysis of FAM65A revealed the presence of a RHO-GTP-binding HR1 domain in the N-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>C), consistent with it being a RHO effector (<xref rid="JCS198614C16" ref-type="bibr">Flynn et al., 1998</xref>). Accordingly, FAM65A bound to a constitutively active RHOA mutant but not to a dominant-negative RHOA mutant that was defective in effector binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>D). Using RHO-isoform-specific antibodies (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S1A</uri>), we could show that FAM65A interacts with all endogenous RHO subfamily members when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>E), and at least with RHOA and RHOB at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>F). Collectively, these results reveal FAM65A as a new effector of the RHO subfamily of GTPases.

        <title>FAM65A links active RHO to CCM3, MST4 and MST3</title>
        <p>To reveal the proteins that interact with FAM65A in addition to the RHO subfamily members, we overexpressed GFP-tagged FAM65A in HeLa cells and performed anti-GFP immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative proteomics analysis using SILAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>A; <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S2</uri>). As expected, all RHO-subfamily proteins were amongst the interactors of FAM65A. In addition, we identified CCM3, MST3 and MST4, as well as several YWHA/14-3-3 proteins amongst the specific FAM65A-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>A; <uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S2</uri>). MST3 and MST4 are members of the GCKIII family of kinases, which are known to bind to CCM3 (<xref rid="JCS198614C5" ref-type="bibr">Ceccarelli et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the three proteins are likely to be associated with FAM65A as a complex. The third GCKIII-family member, YSK1, was not identified in FAM65A immunoprecipitations, either by using mass spectrometry (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S2</uri>) or immunoblotting (data not shown), indicating that FAM65A selectively interacts with MST3 and MST4. Using intensity Based Absolute Quantification (iBAQ), we estimated the relative stoichiometry of the FAM65A interactions (<xref rid="JCS198614C42" ref-type="bibr">Smits et al., 2013</xref>). YWHAE, CCM3 and MST4 were the most abundant interactors in FAM65A immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>B). MST3, however, was around fourfold-less abundant in FAM65A immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>B), indicating that the main kinase interactor of FAM65A is MST4, with MST3 associating with the complex at lower levels. Interestingly, the combined iBAQ values of MST3 and MST4 were comparable to that of CCM3, in line with the fact that CCM3 and MSTs can form a 1:1 dimer (<xref rid="JCS198614C5" ref-type="bibr">Ceccarelli et al., 2011</xref>).

Values from two duplicate experiments were plotted. (C) Interaction of endogenous CCM3, MST3 and MST4 with FAM65A is independent of RHO binding. HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for GFPâFAM65A, or GFP-only as control, and subjected to TAT-C3 or mock treatment for 4âh before lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody. Input lysates as well as anti-GFP immunoprecipitation eluates were subsequently analysed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Although the RHOA and YWHA interaction with FAM65A was abrogated upon TAT-C3 treatment, interactions of CCM3, MST3 and MST4 were unaffected. Quantification of protein levels in each immunoprecipitation condition relative to the input are displayed below the blots (arbitrary units).

        <p>To test whether FAM65A interaction with CCM3, MST3 and MST4 was dependent on RHO, we treated GFPâFAM65A-expressing cells with a cell-permeable RHO inhibitor (TAT-C3) (<xref rid="JCS198614C40" ref-type="bibr">Sahai and Olson, 2006</xref>) and assessed FAM65A interactions by using immunoprecipitation analyses. Although inhibition of RHO proteins resulted in their dissociation from FAM65A as expected, the CCM3, MST3 and MST4 interaction with FAM65A was unaffected by TAT-C3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>C), suggesting that their binding to FAM65A is independent of RHO. In contrast, FAM65A interaction with YWHA/14-3-3 proteins was abrogated when RHO proteins where inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>C), suggesting that their binding to FAM65A is RHO dependent.</p>
        <p>In addition to an N-terminal HR1 domain, amino-acid sequence analysis of FAM65A against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Conserved Domains Database (CDD) (<xref rid="JCS198614C26" ref-type="bibr">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015</xref>) suggested the presence of a C-terminal HEAT/ARM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>D). ARM domains form a defined repeated structure that functions as a proteinâprotein interaction module (<xref rid="JCS198614C6" ref-type="bibr">Coates, 2003</xref>). Importantly, deletion of the ARM domain abrogated FAM65A interactions with CCM3, MST3 and MST4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>E). In contrast, HR1-domain deletion did not abrogate FAM65A interaction with CCM3, MST3 and MST4, but abrogated RHOA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>E). The binding of YWHA/14-3-3 proteins was also HR1 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>E), in line with finding that their association with FAM65A was dependent on RHO. Collectively, these results suggest that FAM65A is likely to act as an adaptor protein, linking active RHO proteins to MST3 and MST4 kinases. In support of this notion, endogenous MST3 and MST4 could be co-immunoprecipitated with a constitutively active RHOA mutant, in the presence of full-length FAM65A but not an ARM-domain-deleted mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Active RHO and FAM65A do not regulate MST activity</title>
        <p>As FAM65A provides a link between active RHO and MST proteins, we next assessed whether RHO activity can regulate MST activity in a FAM65A-dependent manner. The biochemical hallmark of the kinase activity in GCKIII kinases is phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue within the activation segment (Thr190, Thr178 and Thr174 on MST3, MST4 and YSK1, respectively), which can be monitored by using an antibody against phosphorylated GCKIII (<xref rid="JCS198614C19" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>). Following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of different GCKIII kinases, we observed that the majority of endogenous GCKIII activity corresponded to MST4, with a smaller proportion corresponding to MST3; in contrast, no proportion of the active-GCKIIII signal seem to come from YSK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>A). Furthermore, CRISPR knockout of both MST3 and MST4 completely abrogated GCKIII activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>B), collectively suggesting that MST4 and, to a lesser extent, MST3, but not YSK1, constitute all endogenous GCKIII kinase activity. Neither serum stimulation, which activates RHO proteins, as indicated by an increase in myosin light chain (MLC, specifically MYL9, MYL12A and MYL12B) phosphorylation (<xref rid="JCS198614C23" ref-type="bibr">KÃ¼mper et al., 2016</xref>), nor TAT-C3 treatment, which inactivates them (<xref rid="JCS198614C40" ref-type="bibr">Sahai and Olson, 2006</xref>), affected GCKIII activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>A,B). Similarly, CRISPR knockout of FMA65A did not have an impact on GCKIII activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>C). Taken together, these results suggest that neither RHO nor FAM65A regulate the kinase activity of MST3 and MST4.

        <title>Active RHO regulates MST4 localisation through FAM65A</title>
        <p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that MST4 can interact with another ARM-domain-containing adaptor protein named MO25 (also known as CAB39), which is part of the polarity-regulating complex that also comprises LKB1 and STRAD (also known as STK11 and STRADA). Binding of MST4 to MO25 does not affect MST4 kinase activity but instead regulates its localisation by mediating translocation from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in response to LKB1 induction (<xref rid="JCS198614C44" ref-type="bibr">Ten Klooster et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that by analogy, ARM-domain-dependent interaction of FAM65A with MST might have a role in the regulation of MST subcellular localisation downstream of active RHO. We focused on regulation of MST4 localisation because MST4 is the most active kinase in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>A,B), as well as the most abundant kinase that interacts with FAM65A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>B). We assessed the subcellular localisation of endogenous MST4 and FAM65A by performing immunofluorescence analysis using specific MST4 and FAM65A antibodies (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S1B</uri>). In non-confluent serum-starved HeLa cells, a fraction of MST4 was localised to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>A). However, in response to serum stimulation, this MST4 relocated from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>A). FAM65A colocalised with the Golgi-localised MST4 in starved cells and was relocated in a similar manner upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>B). Higher magnification confocal analysis of serum-stimulated HeLa cells revealed that relocated MST4 and FAM65A were not diffusely distributed but instead localised to some cytoplasmic punctae (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S1C</uri>). Importantly, subcellular fractionation of the starved and serum-stimulated cells revealed that the distribution of FAM65A and MST4 between the cytosol and total membrane fractions did not significantly change upon stimulation (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S1D</uri>), suggesting that the cytoplasmic punctae to which both proteins relocated upon stimulation is likely to be a vesicular compartment. Crucially, inhibition of RHO activity by TAT-C3 blocked MST4 relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>C,E), suggesting that this relocation depends on RHO activity. Similarly, CRISPR knockout of FAM65A abrogated MST4 relocation, with TAT-C3 having no further additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F4">Fig.Â 4</xref>D,E). Similar results were observed with siRNA-mediated depletion of FAM65A (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S2</uri>), suggesting that the observed effects are due to the specific loss of FAM65A and not off-target effects of either CRISPR or RNAi. We also found that the Golgi localisation of MST4 was regulated by cell density, with MST4 relocating to a similar extent to that seen upon serum stimulation to cytoplasmic punctae at high confluence, but this relocation was independent of RHO activity or FAM65A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>A). Cell-density-dependent relocation of MST4 was also independent of the LKB1âSTRADâMO25 polarity complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>B). These results suggest that active RHO controls MST4 localisation through FAM65A, but this regulation is dependent on cell density. We have also assessed localisation of MST3 in our system, and although we detect a small proportion of MST3 being localised to the Golgi in starved cells, the vast majority of MST3 was found outside of the Golgi (data not shown). These findings are in line with the notion that the main kinase interactor of FAM65A is MST4, with MST3 associating with FAM65A at lower levels.

        <title>RHO regulates Golgi reorientation and cell migration through FAM65A and MST</title>
        <p>It has been reported that Golgi-localised YSK1 activity is necessary for Golgi reorientation (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, inhibition of YSK1 activity has been shown to block cell migration, and MST4 activity seems to oppose that of YSK1 (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). As active RHO regulates MST4 relocation from the Golgi through FAM65A, we hypothesised that this relocation could be important for Golgi reorientation and directional migration. To test this, we assessed Golgi reorientation in response to wounding. Three hours post wounding, over 50% of HeLa cells at the edge of the wound reoriented their Golgi towards the direction of migration. However, this was significantly impaired when RHO activity was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>A,B). CRISPR knockout of FAM65A impaired Golgi reorientation to a similar extent, with RHO inhibition having no further additional impact on Golgi reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>C,D), suggesting that active RHO functions through FAM65A in reorienting the Golgi. In contrast, CRISPR knockout of either MST3 or MST4 did not have an impact on RHO-mediated regulation of Golgi reorientation. However, double knockout of MST3 and MST4 rendered Golgi reorientation insensitive to RHO inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F6">Fig.Â 6</xref>C,D). Similar results were observed with siRNA-mediated depletion of FAM65A and MST3 and MST4 (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S3</uri>), together suggesting that MSTs inhibit Golgi reorientation but that this inhibition is relieved upon their relocation from the Golgi by active RHO and FAM65A. Interestingly, although MST4 is the most active GCKIII kinase and the major interactor of FAM65A, MST3 seems to be able to functionally compensate for MST4 loss given that only the combined loss of both MST3 and MST4 had an impact on the regulation of Golgi reorientation by RHO.

        <p>Next, we investigated the effects of FAM65A and MST loss on the directional migration of the cells. CRISPR knockout of FAM65A impeded directional migration of HeLa cells following wounding, whereas double knockout of MST3 and MST4 did not have a significant impact on migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>A,B). Crucially, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FAM65A also impeded directional migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>C,D), but this effect could be rescued by the double CRISPR knockout of MST3 and MST4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>C,D). These results further support the notion that Golgi-localised MST proteins function to inhibit Golgi reorientation and directional migration, which is relieved upon their FAM65A-dependent relocation.

        <title>CCM3 connects FAM65A to MST</title>
        <p>CCM3 has been shown to be important for the regulation of Golgi reorientation, and this has been shown to depend on its ability to bind to GCKIII kinases (<xref rid="JCS198614C15" ref-type="bibr">Fidalgo et al., 2010</xref>). Binding of CCM3 to GCKIII kinases has been shown to increase their stability. Thus, it has been postulated that the function of CCM3 with regards to Golgi reorientation could be dependent on GCKIII stabilisation (<xref rid="JCS198614C15" ref-type="bibr">Fidalgo et al., 2010</xref>). We found that although the depletion of CCM3 resulted in a decrease in MST protein levels as previously reported, this decrease was not sufficient to fully abrogate their kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>A). However, similar to the loss of FAM65A, depletion of CCM3 inhibited relocation of MST4 from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>B,C), suggesting that CCM3 must also have a role in linking RHO to MST. In agreement with this notion, CCM3 depletion abrogated the interaction of endogenous MSTs with GFPâFAM65A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>D). Together, these results suggest that the role of CCM3 is to act as an adaptor between FAM65A and MST proteins.

(E) The proposed mechanism for regulation of Golgi reorientation by RHO. When RHO proteins are inactive, the FAM65AâCCM3âMST complex is localised to the Golgi, where MST proteins act to inhibit reorientation.

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Once bound to GTP, the RHO subfamily members interact with a number of effector proteins through which they can regulate several key aspects of the cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. These effectors include ROCK1 and ROCK2, which induce actomyosin contractility (<xref rid="JCS198614C23" ref-type="bibr">KÃ¼mper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C39" ref-type="bibr">Sadok et al., 2015</xref>), the Diaphanous-related formin protein-1 (DIAPH1), which mediate actin polymerisation, and protein kinases N-1, -2 and -3 (PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3), which have been shown to regulate a host of cytoskeletal and endocytic trafficking processes (<xref rid="JCS198614C45" ref-type="bibr">Thumkeo et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we report that RHO proteins also regulate cell polarity and directional migration by triggering Golgi reorientation through FAM65A. We demonstrate that FAM65A is an adaptor protein comprising an N-terminal HR1 domain and a C-terminal ARM domain. The HR1 domain interacts with RHO proteins in a GTP-dependent manner, whereas the ARM domain constitutively binds to CCM3, which in turn associates with MST3 and MST4. Importantly, we show that MST4 is the most important kinase that interacts with FAM65A as well as the most active GCKIII kinase in our system, but MST3 can functionally compensate for MST4 upon its loss. FAM65A and RHO activity do not have an impact on MST3 and MST4 kinase activity, but active RHO binding to FAM65A results in relocation of MST4 from the Golgi to some cytoplasmic punctae, in a FAM65A- and CCM3-dependent manner. Because RHO proteins are membrane-anchored through isoprenylation (<xref rid="JCS198614C35" ref-type="bibr">Ridley, 2013</xref>), these cytoplasmic punctae are likely to be active RHO-containing vesicular compartments. Based on our results, we propose that the Golgi-localised MST kinases function as inhibitors of Golgi reorientation. Upon RHO activation, RHOâGTP binds to FAM65A and relocates the FAM65AâCCM3âMST complex from the Golgi, thus relieving the inhibitory effects of MSTs on Golgi reorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>E).</p>
      <p>As mentioned above, a parallel pathway has been described in gut epithelial cells in which another ARM-domain-containing protein, MO25, interacts with MST4 and mediates its relocation from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="JCS198614C44" ref-type="bibr">Ten Klooster et al., 2009</xref>). This relocation is triggered by induction of the polarity master regulator LKB1 and results in phosphorylation of Ezrin by MST4 at the plasma membrane in a RAP2A-GTPase-dependent manner (<xref rid="JCS198614C44" ref-type="bibr">Ten Klooster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C18" ref-type="bibr">Gloerich et al., 2012</xref>). It is, however, unclear whether the relocation of MST4 from the Golgi through MO25 also regulates Golgi reorientation. Moreover, although Ezrin phosphorylation is well known to be regulated by RHO (<xref rid="JCS198614C41" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C29" ref-type="bibr">Matsui et al., 1999</xref>), neither FAM65A nor MSTs were involved in mediating Ezrin phosphorylation in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>AâC). Thus, in spite of the similarities between FAM65A- and MO25-dependent MST4 relocation events, these proteins seem to serve in functionally distinct processes. We found that confluence can also regulate MST localisation, but this regulation was independent of both RHOâFAM65A and LKB1âSTRADâMO25 pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>A,B), suggesting that an as yet unknown third pathway must exist, which specifically regulates MST localisation in response to cell density.</p>
      <p>The Golgi is generally in close association with the centrosome through the cis-Golgi-resident protein GMAP210, which directly binds to Î³-tubulin (<xref rid="JCS198614C21" ref-type="bibr">Infante et al., 1999</xref>), and reorientation of the Golgi is known to be regulated through reorganisation of the centrosome-connected microtubule network (<xref rid="JCS198614C50" ref-type="bibr">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). However, Golgi-localised signalling events that regulate the structure and assembly of the Golgi stacks also play a key role in mediating Golgi reorientation, in addition to the microtubule network (<xref rid="JCS198614C50" ref-type="bibr">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). GCKIII kinases are likely to be key regulators of such localised signalling events (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C15" ref-type="bibr">Fidalgo et al., 2010</xref>). Crucially, of the three GCKIII kinases, we found that only MST3 and MST4 interacted with FAM65A. The third GCKIII kinase, YSK1, was not found to be active in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>A,B). This is in line with previous studies that have demonstrated YSK1 to be specifically activated in response to oxidative stress (<xref rid="JCS198614C52" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, in agreement with our data that MST3 and MST4 locally act to inhibit Golgi reorientation, MST4 has been previously shown to negatively regulate directional migration, whereas YSK1 has been shown to be a positive regulator of Golgi reorientation and directional migration (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). Although this difference could be due to YSK1 and MST4 having different Golgi-specific substrates (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>), our results suggest that the opposing effects could also be due to differential association with FAM65A.</p>
      <p>GCKIII kinases, along with their interacting protein CCM3, are known to be constituents of a conserved multi-protein complex known as the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex (<xref rid="JCS198614C20" ref-type="bibr">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to GCKIII kinases and CCM3, STRIPAK contains the catalytic and scaffolding subunits of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) along with a specific family of regulatory subunits known as striatins (STRN1, STRN3 and STRN4), as well as STR-interacting proteins STRIP1 and STRIP2, Mob-domain-containing protein MOB3 and the membrane-anchoring protein SLMAP (<xref rid="JCS198614C20" ref-type="bibr">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C22" ref-type="bibr">Kean et al., 2011</xref>). The STRIPAK complex has been shown to negatively regulate MST3 and MST4 kinase activities, most likely by dephosphorylating their activation segments through PP2A (<xref rid="JCS198614C25" ref-type="bibr">Madsen et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we did not detect striatins, MOB3, SLAMP or STRIP1 and STRIP2 amongst FAM65A-intercating proteins, either by mass spectrometry (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S2</uri>) or immunoblotting (data not shown) analyses. Instead, two other PP2A regulatory subunits (PPP2R2A and PPP2R5E) along with the catalytic and scaffolding PP2A subunits were identified amongst the FAM65A-interacting proteins (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">TableÂ S2</uri>). These results indicate that although a specific PP2A complex is likely to be associated with FAM65A, this complex is distinct from STRIPAK as it lacks several key STRIPAK components. The functional relevance of the FAM65A-associated PP2A complex remains to be determined. We also identified several YWHA/14-3-3 proteins that interact with FAM65A in a RHO-dependent manner. YSK1, but not MST4, has been shown to phosphorylate YWHAZ/14-3-3Î¶ on Ser58, and this has been suggested to be important for the regulation of cell polarity and directional migration (<xref rid="JCS198614C32" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). We did not detect any change in YWHAZ/14-3-3Î¶ phosphorylation in response to RHO, FAM65A or MST3 and MST4 loss (data not shown), suggesting that YWHA/14-3-3 proteins are unlikely to be substrates of the FAM65A-associated MSTs. It remains to be determined whether YWHA/14-3-3 association with FAM65A is functionally relevant to the regulation of Golgi reorientation.</p>
      <p>FAM65A has two orthologues in humans named FAM65B and FAM65C. Nothing is known about FAM65C, but FAM65B has also been recently shown to interact with RHOA (<xref rid="JCS198614C37" ref-type="bibr">Rougerie et al., 2013</xref>). However, FAM65A and FAM65B only share 47% protein sequence similarity, and accordingly, there seems to be several functional differences between the two orthologues. First, although FAM65A only associates with active RHO proteins, interaction of FAM65B with RHOA seems to be constitutive (<xref rid="JCS198614C37" ref-type="bibr">Rougerie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C17" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Second, FAM65A and FAM65B seem to localise differently within the cell, with FAM65B being primarily localised to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="JCS198614C9" ref-type="bibr">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C17" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), as opposed to the Golgi and cytoplasmic punctae containing FAM65A. Nevertheless, we have observed that loss of FAM65A can trigger RHO hyper-activation (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S4A</uri>), and crucially, the main function ascribed to FAM65B is to act as an inhibitor of RHOA activity (<xref rid="JCS198614C37" ref-type="bibr">Rougerie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C17" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, we have observed that depletion of CCM3 and MSTs can also result in RHO hyperactivation (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S4B</uri>), although the mechanism by which this hyperactivation occurs is unclear at the moment. It remains to be determined whether FAM65B can also interact with CCM3 and MSTs, and if so, whether the negative regulation of RHO activity reported for FAM65B is dependent on these interactions. As FAM65B was not expressed in our cells, we could not assess the functional similarities and differences between the two orthologues in this study.</p>
      <p>Mutations of the <italic>CCM3</italic> gene have been linked to cerebral cavernous malformations â vascular abnormalities characterised by dilated leaky cerebral lesions that can lead to brain haemorrhage (<xref rid="JCS198614C10" ref-type="bibr">Draheim et al., 2014</xref>). The exact mechanism by which cerebral cavernous malformations arise is still subject to debate, with deregulation of several signalling pathways such as RHO (<xref rid="JCS198614C34" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C43" ref-type="bibr">Stockton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C3" ref-type="bibr">Borikova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C48" ref-type="bibr">Whitehead et al., 2009</xref>), TGFÎ² (<xref rid="JCS198614C24" ref-type="bibr">Maddaluno et al., 2013</xref>), Î²-catenin (<xref rid="JCS198614C4" ref-type="bibr">Bravi et al., 2015</xref>) and MEKK3âKLF2 or MEKK3âKLF4 (<xref rid="JCS198614C8" ref-type="bibr">Cuttano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C53" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="JCS198614C33" ref-type="bibr">Renz et al., 2015</xref>) having been demonstrated to be involved in development and progression of the disease. Crucially, loss of the CCM3 interaction with GCKIII kinases seems to be the crucial feature of all disease-associated <italic>CCM3</italic> mutations (<xref rid="JCS198614C15" ref-type="bibr">Fidalgo et al., 2010</xref>). We here reveal that in the context of polarity regulation, CCM3 functions by linking MSTs to FAM65A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCS198614F8">Fig.Â 8</xref>E). It remains to be determined whether disruption of the RHOâFAM65AâCCM3âMST pathway could be involved in triggering the formation of cerebral vascular lesions, presumably through an initial defect in cell polarisation. Interestingly, FAM65A provides a link between RHO and CCM3, and hyperactivated RHO signalling in endothelial cells has been shown to be a common feature of cerebral cavernous malformations (<xref rid="JCS198614C34" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that such hyperactivation could be due to disruption of the RHOâFAM65AâCCM3âMST cascade (<uri xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jcs.198614.supplemental">Fig.Â S4</uri>). Determining whether inhibition of Golgi reorientation downstream of RHO is involved in initiating the formation of vascular lesions in cerebral cavernous malformations, as well as revealing the mechanism through which Golgi-localised MSTs regulate reorientation, could prove to be crucial for devising novel therapeutic approaches against the early molecular events that trigger the disease.</p>
