      <abstract>
        <p>Endocytosis of cell surface proteins is mediated by a complex molecular machinery that assembles on the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Here, we report the identification of two ubiquitously expressed human proteins, stonin 1 and stonin 2, related to components of the endocytic machinery. The human stonins are homologous to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> stoned B protein and exhibit a modular structure consisting of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal proline-rich domain, a central region of homology specific to the stonins, and a COOH-terminal region homologous to the Î¼ subunits of adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Stonin 2, but not stonin 1, interacts with the endocytic machinery proteins Eps15, Eps15R, and intersectin 1. These interactions occur via two NPF motifs in the proline-rich domain of stonin 2 and Eps15 homology domains of Eps15, Eps15R, and intersectin 1. Stonin 2 also interacts indirectly with the adaptor protein complex, AP-2. In addition, stonin 2 binds to the C2B domains of synaptotagmins I and II. Overexpression of GFPâstonin 2 interferes with recruitment of AP-2 to the plasma membrane and impairs internalization of the transferrin, epidermal growth factor, and low density lipoprotein receptors. These observations suggest that stonin 2 is a novel component of the general endocytic machinery.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The internalization of plasma membrane proteins is critical to many important physiological processes such as synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These processes are mediated by a complex molecular machinery that is recruited from the cytosol to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where it assembles into a supramolecular structure known as a protein coat (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OwenandLuzio2000">Owen and Luzio 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kirchhausen2000">Kirchhausen 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SlepnevandDeCamilli2000">Slepnev and De Camilli 2000</xref>). The coat selects integral membrane proteins destined for internalization and participates in the formation of endocytic vesicles. The main structural constituent of plasma membrane coats is the protein clathrin. Assembly of clathrin coats onto the plasma membrane is initiated by binding of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complex, AP-2, to a member of the synaptotagmin family of integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1994">Zhang et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hauckeetal2000">Haucke et al. 2000</xref>). Clathrin triskelions then polymerize onto the membrane-bound AP-2 to form a lattice that serves as a scaffold for the protein coat. Integral membrane proteins containing either tyrosine-based or dileucine-based endocytic signals are concentrated within the assembling coats by interaction of these signals with AP-2 (for review see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BonifacinoandDellAngelica1999">Bonifacino and Dell'Angelica 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Heilkeretal1999">Heilker et al. 1999</xref>). Various accessory proteins (e.g., amphiphysins, Eps15, intersectins, dynamins, etc.) become associated with the coat by either direct or indirect interaction with clathrin and/or AP-2. These accessory proteins are thought to regulate coat assembly and vesicle budding, as well as interactions of the endocytic machinery with signal transduction pathways and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kirchhausen2000">Kirchhausen 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OwenandLuzio2000">Owen and Luzio 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SlepnevandDeCamilli2000">Slepnev and De Camilli 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Novel components of the machinery are still being identified through biochemical and genetic approaches. A particularly useful approach to identify physiologically critical components of the endocytic machinery has been the study of temperature-sensitive paralytic mutants of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> pioneered by David Suzuki and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Grigliattietal1973">Grigliatti et al. 1973</xref>). Some of these mutants bear defects in genes involved in synaptic vesicle recycling from the plasma membrane. Inactivation of these genes upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature results in an inability to reform synaptic vesicles after exocytosis. One of these mutant genes, <italic>shibire</italic>, was found to encode a <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> homologue of mammalian dynamins (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chenetal1991">Chen et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="vanderBliekandMeyerowitz1991">van der Bliek and Meyerowitz 1991</xref>). Another paralytic mutant, <italic>stoned</italic>, was found to bear mutations in a dicistronic transcript encoding two structurally unrelated proteins, stoned A and stoned B (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andrewsetal1996">Andrews et al. 1996</xref>). Although stoned A has no homology to any other known protein, stoned B comprises a COOH-terminal domain with homology to the Î¼2 subunit of AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andrewsetal1996">Andrews et al. 1996</xref>). Combination of hypomorphic <italic>shibire</italic> and <italic>stoned</italic> mutations produces synthetic lethality, suggesting that the products of these genes participate in either the same or parallel pathways of synaptic vesicle biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Petrovichetal1993">Petrovich et al. 1993</xref>). It remains to be established, however, whether the <italic>stoned</italic> gene products play a role in endocytosis itself, and whether this role is limited to neurons or general to all cells.</p>
      <p>To investigate the possible involvement of <italic>stoned</italic> gene products in endocytosis in a system that is more amenable to biochemical and cellular analyses, we sought to identify human homologues of these proteins. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two ubiquitously expressed human homologues of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned B protein named stonin 1 and stonin 2. The results of our study suggest that stonin 2 is a component of the general endocytic machinery in higher eukaryotes.</p>

        <title>Cloning of Stonin 1 and Stonin 2 cDNAs</title>
        <p>A search of DNA databases for human homologues of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned B identified the SALF protein (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Upadhyayaetal1999">Upadhyaya et al. 1999</xref>) and a related fetal lung protein encoded by a novel cDNA sequence (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. AI734225). Primers corresponding to SALF were used in 5â²- and 3â²-RACE PCR on a Marathon-Readyâ¢ human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) to isolate a novel transcript, herein termed Stonin 1 (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. AF255310), encoding the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 711 of the 1,182âamino acid SALF. The complete ORF of the second human cDNA, herein termed Stonin 2 (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession no. AF255309) was similarly obtained from a Marathon-Readyâ¢ human spleen cDNA library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.), using primers designed on the basis of partial genomic DNA sequences (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession nos. AC010582 and AL136040). The identical stonin 1 and stonin 2 full-length sequences were amplified by RT-PCR from mRNA of multiple human cell lines (HeLa, Jurkat, 293T, and Caco-2A). The above PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced.</p>

        <title>Northern Blotting</title>
        <p>Northern blot analysis was performed on multiple human tissue blots (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DellAngelicaetal1997">Dell'Angelica et al. 1997</xref>). Stonin 1 and stonin 2 cDNA probes were obtained by PCR. For stonin 1, two different probes were used in separate experiments: the proline-rich domain probe comprised nucleotides 1â615 and the Î¼-homology domain probe comprised nucleotides 1187â2509 of the full-length stonin 1 cDNA. The probe for stonin 2 corresponded to the complete coding sequence.</p>

        <title>Antibodies</title>
        <p>Polyclonal antibodies to human stonin 1 and stonin 2 were generated by immunizing rabbits with the corresponding proline-rich domains fused to a deca-histidine tag. The fusion proteins were recovered from inclusion bodies by extraction in 6 M urea. A monoclonal antibody to human Eps15 and a polyclonal antibody to <italic>Xenopus</italic> intersectin were gifts from Dr. Pier Paolo Di Fiore (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) and Dr. Peter McPherson (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), respectively. The following monoclonal antibodies were also used: HA.11; to the hemagglutinin epitope and 9E10; to the Myc epitope (Covance), 100/3; to Î³1-adaptin and AP.6; to Î±-adaptin (Sigma-Aldrich), clones 7.1 and 13.1; to the green fluorescent protein (GFP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and H4A3; to lamp-1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). The following polyclonal antibodies were also used: anti-GFP antiserum (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co.) and serum antiâcaveolin antiserum (Transduction Laboratories).</p>

        <title>Recombinant DNA Constructs</title>
        <p>GFP fusion constructs, comprising the proline-rich domain of human stonin 2, namely GFPâstonin 2<sub>PRD</sub> (residues 1â223) and the full-length GFPâstonin 2, were cloned into the pEGFP-C1 (HindIII-SmaI) vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The complete ORF of human stonin 1 was fused to GFP by cloning into pEGFP-C2 (GFPâstonin 1, KpnI-BamHI). Epitope-tagging at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of stonin 2 was performed through PCR amplification of the full-length stonin 2 cDNA using 5â²-primer containing the nucleotide sequence for the Myc epitope. This product was cloned into the XhoI-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). The PRD + SHD domains of stonin 2 were subcloned into the XhoI-XmaI sites of the pCI-neo vector (Myc-stonin 2<sub>PRD+SHD</sub>; residues 1â359) using the same approach. Two-hybrid constructs in the pGBKT7 (TRP1) vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) were prepared by cloning of nucleotide sequences coding for the following amino acid residues: 1â296 of human Eps15 (Eps15âEps15 homology (EH); NdeI-BamHI); 1â395 of human Eps15R (Eps15R-EH; EcoRI-BamHI); and 1â333 of human intersectin 1 (intersectin 1-EH; NdeI-XmaI). Similarly, the stonin 1 (full-length; XhoI-XmaI), stonin 2 (full-length; NdeI-XmaI), stonin 2<sub>PRD+SHD</sub> (NdeI-XmaI), and human epsin 2 (full-length; NdeI-EcoRI) cDNAs were cloned into the pGADT7 (LEU2) vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) to obtain the corresponding GAL4 transcription activation domain (GAL4ad) fusion constructs. The constructs (protein names and amino acid numbers indicated in parentheses) glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)âintersectin 1-EH (intersectin 1, 1â333), GSTâsynaptotagmin I-C2AB (murine synaptotagmin I, 96â421), GSTâsynaptotagmin I-C2A (synaptotagmin I, 96â265), GSTâsynaptotagmin I-C2B (synaptotagmin I, 248â421), GSTâsynaptotagmin II-C2AB (murine synaptotagmin II, 124â422), GSTâsynaptotagmin II-C2A (synaptotagmin II, 124â272), and GSTâsynaptotagmin II-C2B (synaptotagmin II, 249â422) were cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GSTâEps15-EH was generated by cloning of the cDNA sequence corresponding to residues 1â296 of Eps15 into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For protein expression and purification, competent <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains DH5Î± (PGC Scientific) or BL21 (DE3) (Novagen Inc.) cells were transformed with the above constructs. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified by using glutathioneâSepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and amino acid substitutions in the proline-rich domain of stonin 2 (N110A, P111A, F112A, P127A, and F128A) were made using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

Human HeLa or M1 cells, grown on glass coverslips, were transfected by using FuGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were incubated with 7 mM Na-butyrate for 12 h before fixation. At 24 h after transfection, cells were either fixed and processed for immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DellAngelicaetal1997">Dell'Angelica et al. 1997</xref>) or used directly for analysis of rhodamine-EGF (500 ng/ml), Dil-LDL (10 ng/Î¼l), or Cy3-transferrin (530 ng/ml) internalization (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Benmerahetal2000">Benmerah et al. 2000</xref>; Cy3-transferrin was a gift from Timothy McGraw, Weill Medical College, New York, NY). The internalization of rhodamine-EGF was performed using the same conditions as for Cy3-transferrin, with the exception that the serum starvation was much longer (12 h) and was done in the presence of 0.5% (vol/vol) serum. Images were acquired on an LSM 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.).</p>

        <p>Metabolic labeling of cells in culture with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine, preparation of Triton X-100, detergent-free extracts of post-nuclear membranes, ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients, and immunoprecipitationârecapture were carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DellAngelicaetal1997">Dell'Angelica et al. 1997</xref>). For cell fractionation, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose with a cocktail of protease inhibitors) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DellAngelicaetal1997">Dell'Angelica et al. 1997</xref>) by 20 passages through a 25-gauge needle on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C, and the resulting supernatants (postnuclear supernatant) were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 105,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4Â°C to obtain cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. For extraction experiments, the membrane fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer and divided into six equal aliquots. Aliquots were then incubated for 45 min at 4Â°C in lysis buffer containing either 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 M NaCl, 0.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (pH 11.3), 1.6 M urea, 2% (wt/vol) Triton X-100, or left untreated. After the incubation period, samples were centrifuged at 105,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h, and both pellets and supernatants were collected for further analysis. To obtain a fraction enriched in detergent-resistant membranes, cellular extracts were subjected to a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="IlangumaranandHoessli1998">Ilangumaran and Hoessli 1998</xref>), with the exception that 0.9-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Then, 0.5 ml of each fraction was diluted 1:1 in immunoprecipitation buffer and used for immunoprecipitationârecapture with the antibodies described in the corresponding figure legend. For in vitro translation of Myc-stonin 2<sub>PRD+SHD</sub>, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT<sup>Â®</sup> Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). Postribosomal supernatants were then generated by centrifugation at 200,000 <italic>g</italic> and used for GST pull-down assays.</p>

        <title>Identification of Human Stonin 1 and Stonin 2</title>
        <p>Two distinct human transcripts encoding homologues of the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned B protein were identified through searches of GenBank. The complete ORFs for these proteins, herein referred to as stonin 1 and stonin 2, were obtained by a combination of 5â² and 3â² RACE and PCR amplification. Unlike the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster stoned</italic> transcripts, the human stonin transcripts were monocistronic and did not encode stoned Aârelated products. In fact, our searches did not turn up homologues of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned A in any other organism. The human stonin 1 transcript encodes a protein of 735 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of â¼83 kD, whereas the stonin 2 transcript encodes a protein of 702 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of â¼79 kD. Residues 1â711 of stonin 1 are almost identical to residues 1â711 of the 1,182âamino acid product of the SALF transcript (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Upadhyayaetal1999">Upadhyaya et al. 1999</xref>). This transcript has been proposed to encode a protein with an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region homologous to the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned B protein and a COOH- terminal region homologous to the general transcription factor TFIIAÎ±/Î² (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Upadhyayaetal1999">Upadhyaya et al. 1999</xref>). It has been suggested that SALF is a product of two separate but adjacent human genes, which is formed from a pre-mRNA transcript that initiates at an upstream Stoned Bâlike factor gene and continues into the ALF gene (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hanetal2001">Han et al. 2001</xref>). The stonin 1 transcript reported here differs from the SALF transcript in that it has an inframe termination codon after the stonin 1 sequence and does not contain the TFIIAÎ±/Î²âhomologous sequence. The existence of the stonin 1 transcript was confirmed by RT-PCR from total RNA of multiple cell lines and by PCR amplification from human heart and spleen libraries. Orthologues of both human stonin 1 and stonin 2 were found in the mouse (Martina, J.A., and J.S. Bonifacino, unpublished observations). Single homologues of these proteins exist in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> (i.e., stoned B) and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> (i.e., hypothetical protein C27H6.1), but none in yeast and prokaryotes.</p>

        <title>Domain Organization of Human Stonin 1 and Stonin 2</title>
        <p>The two human stonins, as well as their <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> counterparts, exhibit a modular structure consisting of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal proline- and serine-rich domain (herein referred to as proline-rich domain), a central domain specific to the stonins (stonin homology domain), and a COOH-terminal domain homologous to the signal-binding domain of the Î¼ subunits of AP complexes (Î¼-homology domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A). The proline-rich domains of the human, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> homologues are of variable length and exhibit little or no significant sequence homology to one another, except for the abundance of proline and serine residues. The proline-rich domain of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned B displays seven NPF motifs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andrewsetal1996">Andrews et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Stimsonetal1998">Stimson et al. 1998</xref>), which in general have been shown to mediate interactions with Eps15 homology (EH) domains (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Salcinietal1997">Salcini et al. 1997</xref>). Despite the lack of overall homology in this region, the proline-rich domain of stonin 2, but not that of stonin 1, has two NPF motifs separated by 13 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B). A similar arrangement of NPF motifs is found in epsin 1 and epsin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chenetal1998">Chen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yamabhaietal1998">Yamabhai et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hussainetal1999">Hussain et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rosenthaletal1999">Rosenthal et al. 1999</xref>). Not only are the NPF motifs in stonin 2 and the epsins similarly spaced but they also flank an intervening sequence containing additional conserved residues. Most notable is the presence of an L residue after the first NPF motif, a feature that has been shown to enhance interaction with certain EH domains (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="deBeeretal2000">de Beer et al. 2000</xref>). Another short stretch of amino acids in the proline-rich domain of stonin 2 is highly similar to a stretch in the proline-rich region of amphiphysin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Leprinceetal1997">Leprince et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Ramjaunetal1997">Ramjaun et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wiggeetal1997">Wigge et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next to the proline-rich domain lies an â¼140âamino acid domain (stonin homology domain) that is conserved in both human stonins, as well as their <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. C</xref>). This domain has not been described in other proteins and may thus be unique to members of the stonin family. Immediately adjacent to this domain in all stonin homologues is an â¼350âamino acid domain homologous to the YXXÃ signal-binding domain of Î¼2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Aguilaretal1997">Aguilar et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OwenandEvans1998">Owen and Evans 1998</xref>), a subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. C</xref>). A similar domain is found in the related Î¼1 (A and B isoforms), Î¼3 (A and B isoforms), and Î¼4 subunits of the heterotetrameric AP complexes, AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4, respectively (for review see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="HirstandRobinson1998">Hirst and Robinson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BonifacinoandDellAngelica1999">Bonifacino and Dell'Angelica 1999</xref>). These theoretical analyses thus indicate that the stonins share several structural features with known components of the sorting machinery.</p>

        <title>Ubiquitous Expression of Human Stonin 1 and Stonin2</title>
        <p>Because mutations in the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster stoned</italic> locus result in severe neurological dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Petrovichetal1993">Petrovich et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andrewsetal1996">Andrews et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fergestadetal1999">Fergestad et al. 1999</xref>), it was of interest to determine the pattern of tissue and cell expression of the human stonins. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 6.5-kb stonin 1 mRNA and a 11.3-kb stonin 2 mRNA in most human tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). To study expression of the corresponding proteins, we raised polyclonal antibodies to their proline-rich domains. These antibodies were used to identify the proteins by immunoprecipitationârecapture from metabolically labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BonifacinoandDellAngelica1998">Bonifacino and Dell'Angelica 1998</xref>). The antibodies to stonin 1 and stonin 2 were found to immunoprecipitate major species of â¼81 and â¼88 kD, respectively, in reasonable agreement with their predicted molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). The bands detected by these antibodies were specific, as they were not detected using preimmune sera (PI) or antisera absorbed with the corresponding immunogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). Use of these antibodies allowed us to demonstrate expression of both stonins in neuronal (H4) as well as nonneuronal (RD4, M1, HeLa, and 293T) human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C). Thus, both stonins are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, suggesting that their role might not be restricted to the nervous system.</p>

        <title>Both Human Stonins Exist as Cytosolic and Peripheral Membrane Proteins</title>
        <p>Fractionation of metabolically labeled HeLa cells showed that stonin 1 was mostly recovered in a cytosolic fraction (C), with a small amount being associated with membranes (M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A). Stonin 2 was present in equal amounts in the cytosolic and membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A). The membrane-bound stonin 1 and stonin 2 could be partially extracted with 1 M Tris or NaCl, and totally extracted with 0.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 11.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B), indicating that they behaved as peripheral membrane proteins. Interestingly, a large fraction of both membrane-bound stonins remained insoluble upon extraction with 2% (wt/vol) Triton X-100 at 4Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B). This insoluble stonin 2, however, was not associated with detergent-resistant lipid domains, as determined by its failure to float with caveolin-containing fractions in sucrose density gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C). Thus, the stonins appear to exist in cytosolic and peripheral membrane pools.</p>

        <title>Human Stonins Are Not Subunits of AP Complexes</title>
        <p>As mentioned above, the stonins contain a COOH-terminal domain homologous to the YXXÃ signal-binding domain of the Î¼ subunits of the heterotetrameric AP complexes, AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Aguilaretal1997">Aguilar et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="OwenandEvans1998">Owen and Evans 1998</xref>). However, the stonins lack another domain present in the Î¼ subunits that mediates assembly with the Î² subunits of the corresponding AP complexes (Î²-binding domain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> C, BBD) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Aguilaretal1997">Aguilar et al. 1997</xref>). In agreement with this, we did not observe coprecipitation of stoichiometric amounts of either stonin 1 or stonin 2 with subunits of any of the four AP complexes (data not shown). Analysis of the cytosolic stonins by sedimentation velocity analysis on sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Marks1998">Marks 1998</xref>) revealed that both proteins sedimented as if they were much smaller than a typical heterotetrameric AP complex, AP-1 (sedimentation coefficient 7.7S, molecular mass â¼270 kD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> D). In fact, the size of both stonins corresponded to that of monomers or small oligomers.</p>

        <title>Interaction of Stonin 2 with the EH Domains of Eps15, Eps15R, and Intersectin 1 in the Yeast Two-Hybrid System</title>
        <p>To gain insight into the possible function of the human stonins, we sought to identify some of their binding partners. The presence of two NPF motifs in the proline-rich domain of stonin 2 pointed to possible interactions with proteins containing EH domains. Moreover, the existence of two similarly spaced NPF motifs in epsin 1 and epsin 2, as well as the conservation of additional amino acids in the intervening sequence of these proteins, suggested that the EH-containing binding partners could be shared with the epsins. Both epsin 1 and epsin 2 have been shown to bind Eps15 and intersectin 1 via NPFâEH domain interactions (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chenetal1998">Chen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yamabhaietal1998">Yamabhai et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hussainetal1999">Hussain et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rosenthaletal1999">Rosenthal et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Sengaretal1999">Sengar et al. 1999</xref>). To examine if the stonins also interact with these proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid analyses. GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4bd) constructs encoding the three NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal EH domains from Eps15 or the related Eps15R protein, or the two NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal EH domains from intersectin 1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bib" rid="DiFioreetal1997">Di Fiore et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Mayer1999">Mayer 1999</xref>), were coexpressed with GAL4ad constructs encoding stonin 1, stonin 2, or mutants of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Stonin 1 did not interact with any of the EH domain constructs, as expected from the absence of NPF motifs in this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Stonin 2, on the other hand, interacted with the EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15R, and more weakly with those of intersectin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Deletion of the Î¼-homology domain from stonin 2 enhanced growth of the cotransformants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A, Stn2<sub>PRD+SHD</sub>), probably due to increased expression of the truncated protein (data not shown). Mutation of the first NPF motif to either NAA or APA in the context of the stonin 2<sub>PRD+SHD</sub> construct decreased interactions with the EH domains of Eps15 and Eps15R and completely abrogated interactions with the EH domains of intersectin 1. Mutation of the second NPF motif to NAA, on the other hand, had little effect on the interactions. Finally, mutation of both NPF motifs to NAA completely abolished interactions with all EH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). All the positive and negative controls yielded the expected results, thus verifying the specificity of the interactions observed. These experiments demonstrated that stonin 2 has the ability to interact with Eps15, Eps15R, and intersectin 1 via the two NPF motifs in its proline-rich region.</p>

        <title>In Vitro and In Vivo Interactions of Stonin 2 with Eps15 and Intersectin 1</title>
        <p>The interaction of stonin 2 with Eps15 was confirmed using in vitro binding assays. An in vitro translated, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled construct comprising the proline-rich and stonin homology domains of stonin 2 tagged with the Myc epitope was found to bind to a GST fusion protein having the three EH domains from Eps15, but not to GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). Mutation of either or both NPF motifs largely abolished binding. This suggested that both NPF motifs are required for binding in vitro in apparent contradiction with the results of two-hybrid analyses, which showed that the first NPF motif was more important for interactions. This discrepancy could be explained by the greater sensitivity of yeast two-hybrid assays to low-affinity interactions. Similar results were obtained by transiently expressing the same stonin 2 constructs in transfected HeLa cells rather than by in vitro translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C). Furthermore, GST fused to the EH domains of Eps15 or intersectin 1 were able to bind endogenous stonin 2, but not stonin 1, from a HeLa cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D).</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated if the endogenous stonin 2, and Eps15 formed a complex in vivo. This was done by immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates with either preimmune sera (PI) or antibodies to stonin 1 or stonin 2, and then blotting for Eps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). In agreement with the two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, we could demonstrate association of stonin 2, but not stonin 1, with Eps15 in vivo. A similar experiment could not be performed for intersectin 1 because the antibody to this protein did not work well for immunoblotting. To circumvent this problem, we performed another experiment in which HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either GFP or GFPâstonin 2. Intersectin 1 was then isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B). Using this approach, we could demonstrate coprecipitation of intersectin 1 with GFPâstonin 2, but not GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B).</p>
        <p>To map the structural determinants for Eps15âstonin 2 interactions in vivo, we transfected HeLa cells with constructs encoding stonin 1, stonin 2, or mutants of stonin 2 fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). We then immunoprecipitated the GFP fusion proteins and tested for the presence of Eps15 by immunoblotting. Again, we found that Eps15 coprecipitated with the stonin 2, but not stonin 1, fusion protein. This in vivo interaction was mediated by the proline-rich domain of stonin 2 and required the two NPF motifs within this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). Since Eps15 has multiple DPF motifs in its COOH-terminal region that bind to the Î±-adaptin subunit of AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Benmerahetal1996">Benmerah et al. 1996</xref>), we also tested for the presence of Î±-adaptin in the anti-GFPâstonin immunoprecipitates. As expected, we found that Î±-adaptin was present only in the immunoprecipitates that contained Eps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C), suggesting that AP-2 is indirectly associated with stonin 2 via Eps15.</p>

        <title>Interaction of Stonin 2 with Synaptotagmins I and II</title>
        <p>Despite the overall homology of the Î¼-homology domain of the stonins to the YXXÃ-binding domain of APâÎ¼ subunits, residues involved in interactions of Î¼2 with YXXÃ signals (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="OwenandEvans1998">Owen and Evans 1998</xref>) (denoted by blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> C) are not conserved in the stonins. In line with this observation, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that neither human stonin was able to bind a panel of 10 different YXXÃ signals (data not shown). Î¼2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hauckeetal2000">Haucke et al. 2000</xref>) as well as <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> stoned B (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Phillipsetal2000">Phillips et al. 2000</xref>) have been shown to bind to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I. We found that 4.9â6.5% of Mycâstonin 2 expressed by transient transfection into HeLa cells bound to GST fusion proteins bearing the cytoplasmic domains of synaptotagmins I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A). This binding was judged to be specific, as only a negligible amount of Mycâstonin 2 was recovered on a GSTâGGA3 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A) or GST (data not shown). Additional GST pull-down assays revealed that Mycâstonin 2 interacted mainly with the C2B domain of both synaptotagmins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B).</p>

        <title>Overexpression of Stonin 2 Impairs Receptor-mediated Endocytosis</title>
        <p>Although our antibodies to stonin 2 allowed us to immunoprecipitate the endogenous protein, they were not sensitive enough for immunofluorescence microscopy. This prompted us to examine the localization of GFPâstonin 2 expressed by transfection into cells. We observed a heterogeneous distribution including dispersed punctate and juxtanuclear structures superimposed over a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. G</xref>). Some of the punctate structures colocalized with AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, MâO, inset). At the highest expression levels, we observed a coalescence of GFPâstonin 2 in the juxtanuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> M). In these cells, we noticed a depletion of AP-2 from plasma membrane clathrin-coated pits and its colocalization with the juxtanuclear GFPâstonin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. O</xref>, arrow). This behavior of stonin 2 was similar to that reported for epsin 2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rosenthaletal1999">Rosenthal et al. 1999</xref>), consistent with the ability of both proteins to interact directly or indirectly with AP-2. Overexpression of GFPâstonin 2 had no effect on the distribution of two other AP complexes, AP-1 and AP-3 (data not shown), indicating that the effects on AP-2 were specific.</p>
        <p>The ability of stonin 2 to interact with several components of the endocytic machinery predicted that overexpression of GFPâstonin 2 could interfere with receptor-mediated endocytosis, as is the case for epsin 2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rosenthaletal1999">Rosenthal et al. 1999</xref>). Indeed, we observed that GFPâstonin 2 overexpression inhibited internalization of Cy3-transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, AâC), rhodamine-EGF (DâF), and Dil-LDL (GâI) by their corresponding receptors. Overexpression of GFP, on the other hand, had no effect on internalization of Cy3-transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, JâL) or the other ligands (data not shown). These observations further emphasize the functional connection of stonin 2 to the endocytic machinery.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we report the identification of two ubiquitous human proteins, stonin 1 and stonin 2, which have a modular structure characteristic of components of the endocytic machinery. In all of our protein interaction analyses, we could only demonstrate weak binding of stonin 1 to synaptotagmins I and II. Thus, at present we do not know if the nature of the stonin 1 modules is indicative of a role in endocytosis or other protein sorting processes. We were more successful, however, in identifying several proteins that interact with stonin 2 (i.e., Eps15, Eps15R, intersectin 1, and synaptotagmins I and II). All of these interaction partners have been previously implicated in endocytosis, which makes it likely that stonin 2 is also a component of the endocytic machinery. In support of this notion, overexpression of stonin 2 perturbs the localization of AP-2 to the plasma membrane and inhibits internalization of several endocytic receptors.</p>
      <p>The proline-rich domain of stonin 2 contains two NPF motifs that mediate interactions with the EH domains of Eps15, Eps15R, and intersectin 1. This property is shared with other NPF-containing endocytic proteins such as epsin 1 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chenetal1998">Chen et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yamabhaietal1998">Yamabhai et al. 1998</xref>), epsin 2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yamabhaietal1998">Yamabhai et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Rosenthaletal1999">Rosenthal et al. 1999</xref>), the 170-kD form of synaptojanin (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Haffneretal1997">Haffner et al. 1997</xref>), nonneuronal members of the AP180/CALM family (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dreylingetal1996">Dreyling et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tebaretal1999">Tebar et al. 1999</xref>), several SCAMP isoforms (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2b308e0N0x37a1cc0">FernÃ¡ndez-ChacÃ³n et al. 2000</xref>), and Numb (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Santolinietal2000">Santolini et al. 2000</xref>). Despite the fact that all of these NPF-containing proteins share the same EH-containing partners, interactions between them and Eps15 need not be competitive since Eps15 is a tetramer (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Cupersetal1997">Cupers et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tebaretal1997">Tebar et al. 1997</xref>) and could thus assemble simultaneously with several NPF-containing proteins. The proline-rich domains of stonin 1 and stonin 2 also contain several PxxP motifs that could potentially interact with SH3 domains of endocytic proteins such as intersectins, amphiphysins, and endophilins (for review see <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SlepnevandDeCamilli2000">Slepnev and De Camilli 2000</xref>), or with other domains that recognize proline-based motifs (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kayetal2000">Kay et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Î¼-homology domains of stonin 1 and stonin 2 are likely to fold into an all Î²-sheet structure similar to that of the YXXÃ-binding domain of the Î¼2 subunit of AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="OwenandEvans1998">Owen and Evans 1998</xref>). This similarity notwithstanding, the human stonins do not appear to bind either tyrosine- or dileucine-based endocytic signals in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). The possibility remains that they could recognize a different type of signal. Nonetheless, the stonins do share with Î¼2 the ability to bind the C2B domain of synaptotagmins I and II, most likely through a conserved interface distinct from the YXXÃ-binding site (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hauckeetal2000">Haucke et al. 2000</xref>). Synaptotagmins have been proposed to function as docking proteins for the AP-2 complex, in what would constitute the first step in the assembly of clathrin coats onto the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1994">Zhang et al. 1994</xref>). By analogy, synaptotagmins could also function to recruit stonin 2 to membranes via C2BâÎ¼-homology domain interactions. The NPF motifs of stonin 2 would then serve as ligands for EH-containing proteins such as Eps15, Eps15R, and intersectin 1. These proteins would, in turn, congregate all of their other binding partners (e.g., epsins, dynamins, synaptojanins, endophilins, and syndapins) at the membrane, and assembly of a clathrin coat and vesicle formation would ensue.</p>
      <p>The AP-2 complex is similarly able to bind to synaptotagmin I via its Î± and Î¼2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zhangetal1994">Zhang et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hauckeetal2000">Haucke et al. 2000</xref>) and to Eps15 and Eps15R via its Î± subunit (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Benmerahetal1996">Benmerah et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Salcinietal1999">Salcini et al. 1999</xref>). It is thus plausible that the role of stonin 2 could be partly redundant or alternative to that of AP-2. Another possibility is that stonin 2 and AP-2 cooperate to stabilize the dynamic network of low-affinity interactions required to assemble a functional endocytic coat. The coprecipitation of endogenous AP-2 with stonin 2, which is likely mediated by Eps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), argues in favor of the latter explanation. The fact that mutations in either the Î± subunit of AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dornanetal1997">Dornan et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2b308e0N0x37a1d20">GonzÃ¡lez-GaitÃ¡n and Jackle 1997</xref>) or stoned B (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Andrewsetal1996">Andrews et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fergestadetal1999">Fergestad et al. 1999</xref>) in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> result in defective synaptic vesicle recycling further suggests that both AP-2 and stoned B (of which stonin 2 appears to be the most closely related human homologue) play unique and essential roles in endocytosis.</p>
      <p>In addition to providing additional linking potential to the assembling coats, stonin 2 could be involved in the selection of specific cargo molecules for incorporation into the budding vesicles. In favor of this hypothesis is the observation that synaptotagmin is mislocalized in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster stoned</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fergestadetal1999">Fergestad et al. 1999</xref>). Moreover, synaptotagmin appears to be degraded more rapidly in <italic>stoned</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fergestadetal1999">Fergestad et al. 1999</xref>). In contrast, the localization and stability of other synaptic vesicle proteins are unaltered in <italic>stoned</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fergestadetal1999">Fergestad et al. 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that stoned B could play a role in the specific retrieval of a subset of synaptic vesicle proteins including synaptotagmin. The dual roles of stonin 2 and stoned B in coat assembly and cargo selection need not be mutually exclusive, as the AP-2 complex is known to participate in both processes.</p>
      <p>The neurological defects of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster stoned</italic> mutants are likely due to perturbation of the high endocytic activity of presynaptic terminals. Although less obvious, other endocytic processes in stonin-deficient organisms may be defective as well. The expression of stonin 2 in most human tissues and cells examined, its ability to interact with several widely-expressed proteins, and the overexpression-induced interference with receptor-mediated endocytosis in nonneuronal cells, all suggest that stonin 2 may play a general role in endocytosis.</p>

        <p>Interactions of stonin 2 (Stn2) with Eps15 and intersectin 1 analyzed using the yeast two-hybrid system (A) and in vitro binding assays (BâD). (A) GAL4 DNA binding domain constructs encoding the three EH domains from Eps15 or the related Eps15R protein, the two EH domains from intersectin 1, or mouse (m) p53 (as a specificity control) were coexpressed with GAL4ad constructs encoding full-length stonin 1, full-length stonin 2, the PRD + SHD domains of stonin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A) or various mutants of this segment, epsin 2, or the SV40 T antigen (as a specificity control). Interactions were tested by monitoring growth on plates containing âHis +Ade, âHis âAde, or +His +Ade (control) media. (B) In vitro translated, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled PRD + SHD domains of stonin 2 tagged with the Myc epitope and mutants of this construct were tested for interaction with either a GST fusion protein bearing the three EH domains of Eps15 or with GST using a conventional pull-down assay. Fractions bound and not bound to the glutathioneâSepharose beads are shown. (C) Similar to B, except that stonin 2 constructs were expressed by transient transfection into HeLa cells, extracted with Triton X-100, and bound and unbound proteins detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. (D) A Triton X-100 extract of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells containing endogenous stonin 1 and stonin 2 was incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins bearing the three EH domains from Eps15 or the two EH domains from intersectin 1. Unbound and bound stonin 1 and stonin 2 were isolated by immunoprecipitationârecapture. The positions of molecular mass markers (in kD) are indicated on the left of BâD.</p>

        <p>Analysis of the association of stonins with membranes. (A) Immunoprecipitationârecapture of stonin 1 (Stn1) and stonin 2 (Stn2) from a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells and from cytosolic (C) and membrane (M) fractions of the PNS after ultracentrifugation. (B) Membrane fractions obtained as in A were extracted for 45 min at 4Â°C with the solutions indicated on top. Pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions were then prepared by ultracentrifugation, and stonin 1, stonin 2, and lamp-1 were isolated by immunoprecipitationârecapture with specific antibodies. (C) [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells were solubilized in 2% (wt/vol) Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min, and the extract was centrifuged on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Stonin 2, caveolin, the Î³1 subunit of AP-1 and lamp-1 were then isolated from the indicated gradient fractions using specific antibodies. The positions of molecular mass markers (in kD) are indicated on the left. (D) Analysis of the size of stonins by sedimentation velocity. A cytosolic fraction of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells was separated by ultracentrifugation on a 4â20% sucrose gradient. Stonin 1, stonin 2, and Î³1-adaptin (a marker for the position of cytosolic AP-1, 7.7S; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nakagawaetal2000">Nakagawa et al. 2000</xref>) were isolated by immunoprecipitationârecapture from gradient fractions.</p>
