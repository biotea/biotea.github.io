      <abstract>
        <p>Src family kinases (SFKs) regulate the completion of cytokinesis through signal transduction pathways that lead to the Rab11-dependent phosphorylation of ERK and its localization to the midbody of cytokinetic cells. We find that UNC119a, a known activator of SFKs, plays essential roles in this signaling pathway. UNC119a localizes to the centrosome in interphase cells and begins to translocate from the spindle pole to the spindle midzone after the onset of mitosis; it then localizes to the intercellular bridge in telophase cells and to the midbody in cytokinetic cells. We show that the midbody localization of UNC119a is dependent on Rab11, and that knocking down UNC119a inhibits the Rab11-dependent phosphorylation and midbody localization of ERK and cytokinesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that UNC119a interacts with a Src family kinase, Fyn and is required for the activation of this kinase. These results suggest that UNC119a plays a key role in the Fyn signal transduction pathway, which regulates the completion of cytokinesis via Rab11.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, a cell containing two duplicated nuclei physically separates into two daughter cells. This process requires the orchestrated interaction of various cellular activities, including signal transductions, the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the transportation and fusion of membrane components to the dividing site (for a review, see refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Src family kinases (SFKs) transduce signals from the extracellular environment to intracellular signal transduction pathways and, hence, are involved in various cellular functions such as cell proliferation and differentiation, organization of the cytoskeleton, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, motility and migration (for a review, see refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p>

      <p>Several lines of evidence suggest that UNC119a may be involved in the SFK signal transduction pathway that controls cytokinesis: (1) UNC119a is a known activator of different SFKs (Fyn,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><sup>31</sup></xref> Lyn,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><sup>29</sup></xref> Lck<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><sup>30</sup></xref>); (2) SFK signaling that determines the completion of cytokinesis is dependent on Rab11<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><sup>10</sup></xref>; and (3) UNC119a interacts with and activates Rab11.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><sup>32</sup></xref> Based on this hypothesis, we tested whether UNC119a functions in the SFK signal transduction that leads to the completion of cytokinesis. In this paper, we report that UNC119a localizes to the midbody of dividing animal cells in a Rab11-dependent manner and plays essential roles in transmitting Fyn kinase signals to Rab11, suggesting that UNC119a plays an essential role in the completion of cytokinesis.</p>

        <title>UNC119a localizes to the midbody of cytokinetic cells</title>
        <p>To examine the distribution of UNC119a in mammalian cells, we fixed HeLa cells with cold methanol and immunostained the cells with an anti-UNC119a antibody (UNC-Ab) raised against mouse UNC119a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>; see âMaterials and Methodsâ for details). In interphase cells, UNC119a was concentrated in one or two distinct spots. Double immunostaining of cells with UNC-Ab and monoclonal Î³-tubulin-antibody (Ab) indicated that UNC119a was concentrated at the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1A</xref>). In metaphase cells, UNC119a was mainly found at the spindle poles and in some of the spindle fibers. Many punctate UNC119a spots were also found throughout the cytoplasm. In early anaphase cells, UNC119a was concentrated at the spindle poles, as in metaphase cells, and at the spindle midzone in numerous spots. In late anaphase cells, UNC119a was not observed at the spindle poles but was concentrated at the intercellular bridge of the cells. In telophase and cytokinetic cells, UNC119a was concentrated at the intercellular bridge and midbody of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1A</xref>). Pre-incubation of UNC-Ab with GST (glutathione-s-transferase)-tagged UNC119a completely inhibited the binding of the Ab in the fixed cells, suggesting that UNC-Ab binding was specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1B</xref>). Western blotting experiments with cell extracts prepared at different stages of the cell cycle showed no significant changes in the cellular content of UNC119a during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1C</xref>). This cell cycle-dependent localization of UNC119a was also observed in five different cell types fixed using the same method (three human cell lines, HEK293, U2OS and htRPE-1; and two mouse cell lines, NIH3T3 and MEF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S1</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>As it has been reported that UNC119 is associated with membrane vesicles,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><sup>32</sup></xref> we also examined the distribution of UNC119a in cells fixed using a different method that well preserved the staining of the membrane vesicle-associated protein, p230<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><sup>39</sup></xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S2A</bold></xref>). In these experiments, where cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (see âMaterials and Methodsâ) and then immunostained with UNC-Ab, we also observed that UNC119a was concentrated in different regions of the cells depending on the cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although the results of these two sets of experiments were basically identical, there were some minor, but reproducible, differences depending on the applied fixation method. In interphase cells fixed with cold methanol, UNC119a was distinctly concentrated at the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1A</xref>). However, in interphase cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, UNC119a was observed as many punctate spots in the cytoplasm and at the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1D</xref>). In metaphase cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, UNC119a was detected as numerous spots along spindle fibers. Although some of the UNC119a spots were concentrated at the spindle poles, the localization to the poles was not as distinct as it was in methanol-fixed cells (see metaphase cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1A and D</xref>). Concentration of UNC119a at the intercellular bridges of cytokinetic cells was evident in cells fixed with either method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1A and D</xref>); however, concentration of UNC119a at the midbody was not observed in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1D</xref>). Instead, there was a clear gap in the middle of the intercellular bridges, corresponding to the presumed site of the midbody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.Â 1D</xref>). It has been reported that the midbody is surrounded by electron-dense material of an unknown nature,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><sup>42</sup></xref> suggesting that the paraformaldehyde fixation and permeabilization procedure was not sufficient to allow UNC-Ab to penetrate the surrounding material. We obtained essentially identical immunostaining results when U2OS cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized as described above (data not shown). Alternatively, we observed that UNC119a was concentrated at centrosomes and midbodies when GFP-UNC119a was expressed in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S2B</bold></xref>). These results showed that the localization of UNC119a is regulated during the cell cycle in these cells and suggested that this process is associated with vesicle-transport during the cell cycle.</p>

        <title>Different regions of UNC119a are required for the cell cycle-regulated localization of UNC119a</title>
        <p>To identify domains that function in the cell-cycle regulated localization of UNC119a, we constructed five deletion mutants of human UNC119a and expressed the GFP-tagged deletion mutants in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). We first identified domains involved in the centrosomal localization of UNC119a by fixing transfected cells with cold methanol 12 h after transfection and immunostaining the cells with monoclonal Î³-tubulin-Ab. When the GFP-tagged C-terminal domain of UNC119a (amino acids 121â240, GFP-C) was expressed, concentration of GFP-C at the centrosome was observed in 73.3% of the cells expressing the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). Centrosomal localization of a truncation mutant including amino acids 60â240 (GFP-MC) and that of wild type UNC119a (GFP-T) was observed in 39% and 30% of cells expressing the fusion proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). Although western blotting results indicated that all GFP-tagged mutant UNC119a proteins were synthesized in similar amounts in the transfected cells (data not shown), the distribution of amino acids 1â59 (GFP-N) or that of amino acids 60â120 (GFP-M) was difficult to detect in cells fixed with cold methanol. These results suggested that the C-terminal half of UNC119 (amino acids 121â240) was required for the centrosomal localization of the protein and that the N-terminal half of UNC119a was likely associated with vesicles (see above).</p>
        <p>To identify domains involved in the midbody localization of UNC119a, we incubated cells for 48 h after transfection to obtain a sufficient number of cells undergoing cell division and fixed the cells with paraformaldehyde as the above results suggested that the N-domain (amino acids 1â59) and M-domain (amino acids 60â120) of UNC119a were associated with vesicles. The cells were then immunostained with monoclonal Î±-tubulin-Ab, and the cytokinetic cells expressing GFP were scored. Concentration of GFP-N and of GFP-M at the midbody was observed in 82.4% and 60% of the cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). Fusion of the two domains (GFP-NM) had no additive effect on the midbody localization (53%). Only 6.3% of the cells showed midbody localization when GFP-C was expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). Together, these results suggested that amino acids 1â120 and 121â240 of UNC119a were each strongly involved in the midbody localization and centrosomal localization of UNC119a, and that the midbody localization of UNC119a might be related to vesicle transport.</p>

        <title>UNC119a is required for the completion of cytokinesis</title>
        <p>Because UNC119a was concentrated at the intercellular bridge and midbody in cytokinetic cells, we next tested whether UNC119a was involved in cytokinesis by treating HeLa cells with siRNAs targeting human UNC119a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>). RT-PCR and western blotting experiments showed that the siRNA treatment effectively decreased the cellular concentration of UNC119a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2A and B</xref>) but had no effect on the cellular concentration of UNC119b mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2B</xref>). To test the effect of UNC119a siRNA on cell division, siRNA-treated HeLa cells were fixed and double immunostained with UNC-Ab and monoclonal Î±-tubulin-Ab. UNC119a siRNA treatment significantly increased the percentages of bi-nucleated cells and cytokinetic cells containing a long intercellular bridge with a centrally located midbody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2C</xref>). In control cells, the percentages of bi-nucleated cells and cytokinetic cells were approximately 4.47% and 2.36%, respectively, while in UNC119a siRNA-transfected cells, the percentages increased to 19.86% and 7.58%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2D</xref>). The siRNA treatment had no detectable effect either on the organization of cytoplasmic microtubules in interphase cells or the formation of spindle fibers in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2E</xref>). These results suggested that UNC119a is required for the completion of cytokinesis, but not for either the organization of cytoplasmic microtubules or the formation of spindle fibers. Identical results were obtained when similar experiments were performed in htRPE-1 cells (data not shown).</p>

        <p>To examine the possible cell cycle-dependent interaction between UNC119a and Rab11a, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using UNC-Ab and HeLa cell extracts prepared from asynchronously growing cells, G<sub>2</sub>/M-arrested cells and cells undergoing cell division (âMaterials and Methodsâ). Western blottings with Rab11a-Ab showed that Rab11a co-precipitated with UNC119a, and that there was a noticeable increase in the co-precipitated amount of Rab11a in the mitotic cell extract, suggesting that UNC119a and Rab11a specifically interacted in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.Â 3B</xref>). The interaction between Rab11a and UNC119a was confirmed by immunoprecipitating Rab11a in mitotic cell extracts and western blotting this with UNC-Ab (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S4A</bold></xref>).

The interaction between UNC119a and Rab4 could not be confirmed by a reverse immunoprecipitation.

        <title>Midbody localization of UNC119a is dependent on Rab11a activity</title>
        <p>We next examined the localization of UNC119a in HeLa cells treated with Rab11a siRNA to test whether Rab11a functions in the cell cycle-dependent localization of UNC119a. Rab11a siRNA treatment drastically decreased the amount of Rab11a in the treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.Â 3C</xref>) and inhibited the completion of cytokinesis as determined by the increase in both the number of bi-nucleated cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><sup>11</sup></xref> and the number of cytokinetic cells with long intercellular bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.Â 3D</xref>). Double immunostaining cells with monoclonal Î±-tubulin-Ab and UNC-Ab showed that this siRNA treatment also inhibited the localization of UNC119a to the intercellular bridge and the midbody of cytokinetic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.Â 3E and F</xref>). The Rab11 siRNA treatment had no effect on the concentration of UNC119a either at the centrosome of interphase cells or at the spindle poles of mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.Â 3E</xref>). In contrast, UNC119a siRNA treatment had no effect on the localization of Rab11a either in the pericentrosomal region in interphase cells or at the intercellular bridge of cytokinetic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.Â 3G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that the transport of UNC119a to the intercellular bridge and midbody, possibly via associated endosomes, is dependent on Rab11a activity and is required for the completion of cytokinesis. These results also suggested that Rab11a is not involved in the centrosomal concentration of UNC119a in interphase cells. Because human cells exhibit two Rab11 isoforms, Rab11a and Rba11b, which are 91% identical in their amino acid sequences, we further examined the distribution of UNC119a in HeLa cells treated with siRNAs targeting both Rab11 isoforms. Even though the double-siRNA treatment effectively decreased the amounts of both Rab11 isoforms below the detection limit, the inhibitory effect of the double-siRNA treatment on the completion of cytokinesis and on the localization of UNC119a was almost identical to that of treatment with siRNA targeting Rab11a alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S4B</bold></xref>). These results suggested that Rab11a plays an important role in the midbody localization of UNC119a (see âDiscussionâ).</p>

Western blotting experiments using UNC119a siRNA-treated HeLa cell extracts showed that depletion of UNC119a inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but had no effect on the cellular concentrations of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.Â 4A</xref>).

Western blotting experiments showed that the kinases Fyn and Yes, but not Src, co-immunoprecipitated with UNC119a.

        <p>Our results suggested that UNC119a binds to and activates Fyn kinase after that activated Fyn-UNC119a complex interacts with Rab11a. To test this possibility, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using Rab11 (a + b) siRNA-treated cell extracts and examined whether Fyn co-immunoprecipitated with UNC119a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.Â 5D</xref>). The results indicated that Fyn-UNC119a interaction was independent of Rab11. We next examined the effect of Fyn knockdown on the midbody localization of UNC119a and on the phosphorylation and midbody localization of ERK. Fyn siRNA treatment increased the percentage of bi-nucleated cells, suggesting that cytokinesis was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.Â 5E</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of Fyn did not induce the accumulation of cytokinetic cells with long intercellular bridges, as was observed in UNC119a (or Rab11) siRNA-treated cells, but instead significantly decreased the number of cytokinetic cells. Whereas approximately 2% of the cell population was usually undergoing cytokinesis in control cells, only 72 out of more than 7,000 cells (~1%) were undergoing cytokinesis in the Fyn siRNA-treated cells. Localization of UNC119a at the midbody was not observed in the majority of these cells (75%; n = 72). Fyn siRNA treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation and midbody localization of ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.Â 5F and G</xref>), though it did not have a noticeable effect on the interaction between UNC119a and Rab11a (data not shown). Fyn siRNA treatment had no effect on the concentration of UNC119a at centrosomes and spindle poles (data not shown). Together, these results suggested that the activity of Fyn, UNC119a and Rab11a are necessary for the phosphorylation and midbody localization of ERK, even though we did not measure Fyn kinase activity in this process. These results also suggested that UNC119a interacts with Rab11 in a manner independent of Fyn activity.</p>

        <title>Distinct regions of UNC119a are required for the cell cycle-dependent localization of UNC119a</title>
        <p>Our data suggested that the C-terminal domain (amino acids 121â240) of UNC119a is essential for the localization of UNC119a at the centrosome, and that the centrosomal localization of UNC119a is not dependent on Rab11a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). At present, we do not understand how UNC119a localizes to centrosomes. Although our data suggest that UNC119a is not required either for the organization of cytoplasmic microtubules or the formation of spindle fibers, the concentration of the protein at centrosomes implies that UNC119a may function in other cellular events that are not examined in our current study. In this regard, it is interesting that Naegleria UNC119, which lacks the N-terminal 60 amino acid of human UNC119a but shows 46% amino acid sequence identity to the C-terminal 3/4 of human UNC119a (amino acids 60â240), is concentrated at the basal body,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><sup>17</sup></xref> though is not involved in cytokinesis (Lee, unpublished observation).</p>
        <p>The N-terminal domain of UNC119a (amino acids 1â59) was clearly involved in midbody localization. Gorska et al. (2004) previously showed that this domain is essential for the activation of Fyn by UNC119a, and our current results demonstrate that the activity of Fyn is necessary for the midbody localization of UNC119a. Collectively, this implies that the N-terminal domain plays a key role in transmitting Fyn signals to Rab11a and in the Rab11a-mediated midbody localization of UNC119a (see below). However, it has not yet been determined whether this domain alone can function in mediating the transmission of Fyn signals to Rab11a for the completion of cytokinesis.</p>
        <p>The middle (M) domain of UNC119a (amino acids 60â120) was also capable of localizing to the midbody, suggesting this domain may interact with protein(s) other than Fyn and form a protein complex distinct from the Fyn-UNC119a complex. These different complexes may interact with either a common protein, Rab11a, or with distinct proteins for the midbody localization.</p>
        <p>Simultaneous binding of two distinct proteins to the N- and M-domains of one UNC119a molecule might have a negative effect on the midbody localization of UNC119a, resulting in the less efficient midbody localization of GFP-NM (amino acids 1â120) than that of either GFP-N or GFP-M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref>). Wild type UNC119a fused to GFP (GFP-T) also showed weaker centrosomal localization (30%) and midbody localization (51.7%) compared with the centrosomal localization of GFP-C (73.3%) and to the midbody localization of GFP-N (82.4%). These data suggest that overexpression of UNC119a and, hence, unregulated and/or simultaneous binding of different proteins to the respective binding sites in UNC119a inhibits the regulated localization of UNC119a, and that UNC119a is a multi-functional protein that interacts with diverse proteins. Indeed, in addition to the interaction of UNC119a with different SFKs via the N-terminal SH3-binding motif,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><sup>29</sup></xref> interactions of UNC119a with various other proteins have been reported.

        <title>Possible function of UNC119a in cytokinesis</title>
        <p>Our results showed that UNC119a interacts sequentially with Fyn and Rab11a and is necessary for the completion of cytokinesis, suggesting that UNC119a plays important roles in mediating SFK signals for the completion of cytokinesis. However, there are several important points to be explored to fully understand the role of UNC119a in mediating SFK signals for the completion of cytokinesis.</p>
        <p>If Fyn is the SFK that functions in regulating cytokinesis by interacting with UNC119a, it is expected that the depletion of Fyn and of UNC119a might have a similar inhibitory effect on the completion of cytokinesis. However, our results showed that depletion of UNC119a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2D</xref>) is significantly more effective in inhibiting cytokinesis than depletion of Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.Â 5E</xref>). Our data also showed that the phenotype of UNC119a siRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>) (and cells treated with PP2 treatment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.Â 4C</xref>) is different from that of Fyn siRNA-treated cells. These results suggest the presence of other SFKs that are involved in the regulation of cytokinesis by interacting with UNC119a. We found that both Fyn and Yes interact with UNC119a, and that the depletion of UNC119a inhibits the activation of both kinases. However, we focused our study on Fyn, because the depletion of UNC119a had a more significant inhibitory effect on the activation of Fyn than on the activation of Yes. Hence, future studies addressing the role of Yes and possibly other SKFs will be needed to fully elucidate the role of SFKs in the completion of cytokinesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><sup>10</sup></xref> Localization of Yes at the midbody of cytokinetic cells has recently been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49"><sup>49</sup></xref>
</p>
        <p>Similarly, the depletion of UNC119a was significantly more effective in inhibiting cytokinesis than the depletion of Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs.Â 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). As discussed above, our data suggested that N-domain and M-domain of UNC119a can independently mediate the midbody localization of the protein. Our data also showed that the depletion of Rab11 was very effective but not complete in inhibiting the midbody localization of UNC119a. Taken together, our results suggest that, even though Rab11 might be the major protein that interacts with UNC119a to mediate SFK signals for the completion of cytokinesis, there are possibly other proteins that interact with UNC119a to mediate SFK signals for the completion of cytokinesis. Future studies on proteins that interact with UNC119a in cell cycle-dependent manner are necessary to fully understand the role of UNC119a in cytokinesis.</p>
        <p>In addition, we demonstrated that knockdown of Rab11a alone or of both Rab11 isoforms in HeLa cells inhibited the completion of cytokinesis in the cells to a similar degree. One simple explanation for this finding is that Rab11a is important for the completion of cytokinesis, but Rab11b is not. Indeed, several reports have suggested that Rab11a and Rab11b play distinct roles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50"><sup>50</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52"><sup>52</sup></xref> However, if Rab11a and Rab11b play different, but necessary, roles in a common pathway leading to the completion of cytokinesis, knockdown of either Rab11a alone or both Rab11 isoforms would have a similar inhibitory effect. Further studies are needed to clarify these two possibilities.</p>
        <p>Human and mouse cells exhibit two UNC119 genes that encode two different proteins, UNC119a and UNC119b, which are approximately 60% identical in their amino acid sequences. However, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two proteins shows that the shared amino acid sequence identity between the two proteins mainly occurs in the C-terminal half of the proteins (amino acids 121â240), and that the SH3-binding motif, which is required for the interaction with SFKs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><sup>29</sup></xref> is not present in UNC119b. Recently, different localization patterns of the two UNC119 isoforms were also reported (UNC119a, centrosome; UNC119b, basal body and the primary cilium).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><sup>37</sup></xref> These data suggest that UNC119a is the major protein functioning in SFK signal transduction leading to the completion of cytokinesis; however, this matter should be more definitively determined in future studies.</p>

        <p>We cloned the full-length mouse UNC119a cDNA, synthesized the protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> as an MBP-fusion protein, and raised a polyclonal antiserum by injecting the bacterially synthesized MBP-UNC119a into rabbits. The obtained polyclonal anti-UNC119a antibody (UNC-Ab) recognized both human and mouse UNC119a, which are 91% identical in their amino acid sequences. Western blotting experiments showed that the Ab recognized a human protein with a relative molecular mass of 36 kDa and a mouse protein with a relative molecular mass of 34 kDa, despite the fact that the calculated molecular weights of the two proteins are almost identical (26.99 kDa and 26.95 kDa, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S5B</bold></xref>). The nature of this difference between the relative molecular masses of the two proteins was not clear. Pre-incubation of UNC-Ab with GST-tagged UNC119a completely inhibited the binding of the Ab to the presumed UNC119a proteins in each cell extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S5B</bold></xref>). Additionally, the Ab bound more intensely to the mouse protein than to the human protein in a reproducible manner, which could be due to mouse cells containing more UNC119a than the human cells or the Ab showing a stronger affinity for mouse UNC119a than for human UNC119a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SUP"><bold>Fig. S5B</bold></xref>).</p>
