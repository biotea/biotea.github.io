      <abstract>
        <p>Claudins constitute the major component of tight junctions and regulate paracellular permeability of epithelia. Claudin-10 occurs in two major isoforms that form paracellular channels with ion selectivity. We report on two families segregating an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized anhidrosis, severe heat intolerance and mild kidney failure. All affected individuals carry a rare homozygous missense mutation c.144C&gt;G, p.(N48K) specific for the claudin-10b isoform. Immunostaining of sweat glands from patients suggested that the disease is associated with reduced levels of claudin-10b in the plasma membranes and in canaliculi of the secretory portion. Expression of claudin-10b N48K in a 3D cell model of sweat secretion indicated perturbed paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport. Analysis of paracellular permeability revealed that claudin-10b N48K maintained cation over anion selectivity but with a reduced general ion conductance. Furthermore, freeze fracture electron microscopy showed that claudin-10b N48K was associated with impaired tight junction strand formation and altered cis-oligomer formation. These data suggest that claudin-10b N48K causes anhidrosis and our findings are consistent with a combined effect from perturbed TJ function and increased degradation of claudin-10b N48K in the sweat glands. Furthermore, affected individuals present with Mg<sup>2+</sup> retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism and mild kidney failure that suggest a disturbed reabsorption of cations in the kidneys. These renal-derived features recapitulate several phenotypic aspects detected in mice with kidney specific loss of both claudin-10 isoforms. Our study adds to the spectrum of phenotypes caused by tight junction proteins and demonstrates a pivotal role for claudin-10b in maintaining paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> permeability for sweat production and kidney function.</p>

        <title>Author summary</title>
        <p>Claudins are tight junction proteins forming paracellular barriers that are critical for normal development and homeostasis. The tissue specific paracellular barrier properties are determined by the protein composition of tight junctions that regulates the permeability of solutes and water between different compartments of the body. We show, for the first time, that a mutation in claudin-10b, forming paracellular cation channels in different tissues, causes perturbed Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity through altered tight junction formation and function as well as increased degradation of the protein. The mutation is associated with the inability to sweat (anhidrosis) and heat intolerance as well as abnormal cation reabsorption, hypermagnesemia and kidney damage. Our combined findings show that the claudin-10b-mediated paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport is required for normal sweat production and for the regulation of cation homeostasis in the kidneys.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epithelial and endothelial cells constitute sheets that divide organs into functional compartments. Homeostasis of different organ and body compartments are dependent on epithelial cells and their paracellular barrier that prevents solutes and water from leaking between the cells. The tissue specific paracellular barrier properties are determined by the protein composition of tight junctions (TJs) [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Some TJs form truly impermeable barriers whereas others contain paracellular channels for selective exchange of small ions between compartments. The selectivity is largely determined by the expression of specific members of the claudin protein family [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In mammals, the claudin protein family comprises 27 members consisting of small, highly conserved transmembrane proteins with four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The first extracellular loop contributes to ion selectivity in channel-forming claudins [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the second extracellular loop is of importance for claudin-claudin interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The critical roles for claudin proteins in development and homeostasis are documented by mouse models as well as by some rare human diseases. Early lethality or specific phenotypes have been identified in mice targeted for the genes encoding claudin 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16 18, and 19, respectively [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In humans, variants in the <italic>CLDN16</italic> and <italic>CLDN19</italic> genes are associated with hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (OMIM #248250 and OMIM #248190), <italic>CLDN14</italic> mutations causes a form of autosomal recessive deafness (OMIM #614035) and <italic>CLDN1</italic> mutations have been described in rare patients with ichthyosis, leukocyte vacuoles, alopecia, and sclerosing cholangitis (ILVASC; OMIM#607626) [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
      <p><italic>CLDN10</italic> encodes two distinct isoforms that differ in their amino terminal transmembrane helix and the first extracellular loop [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Expression of isoform 10a is restricted to the kidney and uterus while isoform 10b is ubiquitously expressed. Claudin-10a forms an anion-selective channel whereas claudin-10b forms a water-impermeable cation-selective channel with preference for Na<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In mice, loss of claudin-10b in the distal segments of the nephron has been shown to cause impaired Na<sup>+</sup> permeability as well as increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> resorption that lead to hypermagnesemia and nephrocalcinosis [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the effect of impaired claudin-10 function in humans has remained unknown.</p>
      <p>Here, we report on a homozygous <italic>CLDN10b</italic> variant c.144C&gt;G, p.(N48K), in 13 individuals from two kindreds presenting with anhidrosis, alacrima (inability to produce tears), xerostomia (dry mouth) and kidney failure associated with hypermagnesemia. We demonstrate that the claudin-10b N48K variant has pathogenic consequences, since it alters paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport in a model for sweat secretion, claudin oligomerization tight junction formation at cell-cell contacts, electrophysiological properties of epithelial monolayers and the amount of claudin-10b in the cell membrane. Together, our data reveal mechanisms caused by impaired claudin-10b function and its phenotypic consequences.</p>

        <p>Two distantly related Pakistani kindreds segregating heat intolerance and generalized anhidrosis from birth were identified. Altogether 13 affected individuals were ascertained and several loops of consanguinity suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The anhidrosis was associated with inability to produce tears (alacrima) and dry mouth (xerostomia) in all 13 individuals. In addition, several affected members suffered from recurrent kidney pain due to nephrolithiasis with onset in adolescence (individuals 4, 7, 12 and 14). Heat intolerance was assessed by exposure to heat during 20 minutes (ind. 4 and ind. 11) and resulted in a rapidly increased body temperature from 37Â°C to 39.6Â°C when compared to gender- and age-matched control individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The increased skin temperature was accompanied with an increase in heart rate from 106 bpm to 170 bpm. Perspiration was sparse or absent in patients when using the starch-iod test applied on different body parts consistent with generalized anhidrosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006897.s002">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

Strong occludin staining (red) is found lining the main lumen of the sweat gland. In the patient, claudin-10 signal (green) is observed in membranes facing the lumen but shows a more even intracellular distribution without accumulation in canaliculi but in spots resembling vesicles. A strong occludin signal (red) is observed both in the canaliculi and in membranes lining the main lumen. Scale bars: 20Î¼m.</p>

        <p>Analysis of serum electrolytes revealed increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels but no other overt abnormalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006897.t001">Table 1</xref>). An abnormal renal reabsorption of cations was reflected in urine spot samples that showed low concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> in six affected individuals. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was analyzed in two affected individuals and revealed a two- and three-fold increase, respectively, when compared to normal levels. The same two individuals had reduced 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels. In combination, these observations suggested secondary hyperparathyroidism and kidney damage and further supported by an eGFR in the lower normal range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1006897.t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, creatinine, urea and bicarbonate in serum were normal (n = 4) as well as the 24h urine production (n = 2; 1400ml and 1450ml, respectively). Computer tomography (CT) scans of kidneys (n = 2) were normal. Pancreatic function was assessed by analysis of amylase and lipase levels that turned out normal (n = 2). Lung functions were investigated by spirometry and turned out normal (n = 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006897.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of the <italic>CLDN10b</italic> missense variant c.144C&gt;G, p(N48K) associated with anhidrosis and kidney damage</title>
        <p>Autozygosity mapping of the family identified a homozygous region of 235 consecutive SNPs spanning a 2 Mb region on chromosome 13q32. Fine mapping using microsatellite markers confirmed homozygosity and linkage analysis resulted in a maximum two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 4.25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We enriched genomic DNA spanning the candidate region on chromosome 13q32 (average fold enrichment x386) from one affected family member. Variant detection using v2.1 of the LifeScope Software (Life Technologies) revealed only two homozygous missense variants in the linked homozygous region: A c.144C&gt;G, p.(N48K) in <italic>CLDN10b</italic> (NM_006984.4) and a c.982T&gt;G, p.(S328A) in <italic>UGGT2</italic> (NM_020121.3), respectively. The c.982T&gt;G variant in <italic>UGGT2</italic> was annotated as a SNP in dbSNP132 (rs816142, mean allele frequency 0.14; ExAC) and without predicted severe impact on function.

        <title>Localization of claudin-10b and other tight junction proteins in sweat glands</title>
        <p>The finding of a homozygous missense variant in the <italic>CLDN10b</italic> gene suggested altered paracellular ion permeability as a mechanism of disease. Anhidrosis was an early and prominent symptom of the disease and hence we performed histological investigations of sweat glands in forearm punch biopsies of two affected individuals. The morphology and number of sweat glands appeared normal and immunohistochemical analysis of claudin-10b, the single claudin-10 isoform expressed in sweat glands, revealed strong signals in cells of the secretory portions without visible differences between patients and healthy controls. Immunofluorescence staining of sweat glands revealed that claudin-10b is localized in the periphery of cells from the secretory portions (corresponding to the clear cells), most likely in the basal membrane infoldings, as well as in the plasma membranes lining the canaliculi and, to a lesser extent, the lumen. Claudin-10b staining co-localized with that of the âsealingâ claudin-1 and claudin-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006897.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, co-staining of claudin-10b and the TJ protein occludin confirmed an overlap in membranes lining the canaliculi and the lumen. In addition, occludin co-localized with the TJ protein ZO1 in both canalicular and luminal membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006897.s003">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Compared to healthy subjects, the claudin-10b staining in sweat glands of two affected individuals (ind. 4 and ind. 15) showed staining in membranes facing the lumen, but was otherwise mainly intracellular and dramatically reduced in the canaliculi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). The pattern suggested impaired association of claudin-10b to TJ and an intracellular accumulation, possibly as degraded products, in vesicles. In contrast, immunofluorescence staining of the TJ protein occludin did not reveal any differences in distribution when comparing sweat glands from patient to those of healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Claudin-10b induced lumen expansion of MDCK-C7 cysts is reduced by claudin-10b N48K</title>
        <p>To mimic sweat secretion in a model system we cultured MDCK-C7 cells in Matrigel. Under these conditions, MDCK-C7 cells form three-dimensional cysts (apical side towards the lumen). As demonstrated by Bagnat et al. 2007, lumen formation and expansion in MDCK cells depends on transcellular Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion that is accompanied by paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> movement. The resulting osmotic gradient drives water into the cyst lumen. Cyst lumen diameters were shown to increase, when cells were transfected with the cation channel-forming zebrafish claudin-15 [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the presence of the cation channel forming claudin-10b should similarly enhance fluid secretion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g002">Fig 2Aâ2C</xref>, this is indeed the case: claudin-10b expression in MDCK-C7 cells resulted in an increase in the mean lumen diameter (untransfected control, 33.5 Â± 2.6 Î¼m, n = 10 different z-stacks [total of 151 cysts]; claudin-10b WT clone #3, 70.7 Â± 4.7 Î¼m, n = 9 [140], p &lt; 0.01; claudin-10b WT clone #39, 70.6 Â± 5.6 Î¼m, n = 11 [187], p &lt; 0.01, studentâs t-test with Bonferroni-Holm correction, mean Â± SEM).

        <title>Claudin-10b N48K affects relative permeability P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> and show increased tendency for degradation</title>
        <p>Claudin-10b acts as a paracellular cation channel that is expressed in multiple tissues. To determine a possible effect of the claudin-10b N48K variant on ion permeability we generated MDCK-C7 cells stably expressing the mutated and the WT proteins. Starting 21 days after transfection we measured dilution potentials at weekly intervals. Initially, the dilution potentials, and thus the ratio for Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> permeabilities (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub>), were similar for cell layers expressing claudin-10b WT and claudin-10b N48K, but considerably increased when compared to control cell layers containing an empty vector. However, whereas dilution potentials of claudin-10b WT transfected cell layers remained stable over several passages, dilution potentials of cell layers expressing claudin-10b N48K progressively decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), signifying a time-dependent reduction in permeability ratio P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub>. Transepithelial resistance (TER) was considerably reduced in claudin-10b WT expressing cell layers, as expected for a channel-containing tight junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, the TER reduction in cell layers expressing claudin-10b N48K was less pronounced and similar to cell layers with a weak expression of claudin-10b WT. Relative permeabilities for the monovalent cations Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs in claudin-10b N48K-expressing cell layers followed Eisenman sequences, resembling cell layers with weak expression of claudin-10b WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These observations strongly suggest a reduced selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over other cations mediated by the p.N48K variant, or a reduced amount of claudin-10b within the tight junction.</p>

        <p>To clarify if increased degradation of claudin-10b N48K may contribute to the reduced Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity, we analyzed the turn-over of the protein in HEK293 cells stably expressing claudin-10b fused to CFP or YFP. For claudin-10b N48K, a higher proportion of cells showed cytosolic CFP/YFP fluorescence, when compared to that of claudin-10b WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006897.s004">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). This indicates that presence of p.N48K increases cleavage of the CFP/YFP moiety from the fusion protein.

        <title>The claudin-10b N48K mutation perturbs formation and ultrastructure of tight junction strands</title>
        <p>Since claudin-10b is a TJ protein we sought to further investigate the effect of the p.N48K mutation on claudin-10b-mediated formation of TJs despite apparently normal immunofluorescence staining of occludin in sweat glands of patients. To this end, we expressed claudin-10b in HEK293 cells without endogenous TJs [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Formation and reconstitution of TJs after transfection with either YFP-claudin-10b WT or N48K, respectively, were analyzed by freeze fracture electron microscopy (EM). Stable expression of YFP-claudin-10b WT resulted in the formation of typical epithelial TJs with complex meshwork of continuous and branched TJ strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Smooth strands with continuity of intramembranous particles were detected on the protoplasmic fracture face (P-face) of the plasma membrane.

In addition, the strands consisted of separated intramembranous particles and partly two-dimensional particle arrays were observed.

(A) Stable expression of wt claudin-10b led to formation of complex mesh-works of branched tight junction strands.

(B) Stable expression of claudin-10b N48K resulted in few tight junction strands and less complex meshworks. Strands were detected on the P-face as rows of rather separated intramembranous particles (black arrow) and two- dimensional particle arrays (white arrow). (C) Similar to the stable expression, transient expression of wt claudin-10b led to mesh-works of continuous tight junction strands detected on the P-face (arrow) and E-face (arrowhead). (D) For transient expression of claudin-10b N48K, tight junction mesh-works were infrequent. Particle-type strands were detected as noncontinuous rows of separated, beaded intramembranous particles (black arrow) on the P-face. Scale bars, 200 nm.

Arrowheads indicate plasma membrane outside of contacts between two claudin-expressing cells.

        <p>To corroborate our findings, we analyzed the capability of claudin-10b for homophilic trans-interaction. We performed a cellular contact enrichment assay in which trans-interaction of claudins is measured from the selective enrichment of the construct of interest at contacts between two claudin-expressing cells [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We observed that both YFP-claudin-10b WT and N48K localized primarily to the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). Cells transiently expressing YFP-claudin-10b WT showed a strong contact enrichment indicating trans-interactions whereas cells expressing YFP-claudin-10b N48K showed no contact enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Similar results were obtained after stable expression of the two fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). However, detection of the contact enrichment was more intricate in cells with stable expression when compared to the transient expression due to fragmented enrichments of the claudins at cell contacts. Hence, we used co-cultures of HEK293 cells expressing either YFP- or CFP-fusion proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Accordingly, we quantified the enrichment of YFP and CFP that co-localized at the mixed cell contacts to discriminate between trans-interacting claudins and other potential local claudin enrichments in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006897.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). The enrichment at contacts with co-localization of CFP and YFP was significantly lower for claudin-10b N48K than for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g004">Fig 4H</xref>).

        <p>Claudins assemble both in trans (between opposing membranes) and in cis (within one membrane) to form paracellular ion channels or barriers. To test whether the p.N48K mutation affects cis-oligomerization of claudin-10b we employed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay on HEK293 and MDCK-C7 cells expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged claudin-10b [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast to HEK293, MDCK-C7 cells contain endogenous claudins and form TJs. In both cell types the maximum FRET efficiency was significantly higher for YFP-claudin-10b N48K/CFP-claudin-10b N48K than for YFP-claudin-10b WT/CFP-claudin-10b WT. In addition, after co-transfection in HEK293 cells, maximum FRET efficiency for both YFP- claudin-10b N48K/CFP-claudin-10b N48K and YFP-claudin-10b WT/CFP-claudin-10b WT were significantly higher than that for YFP- claudin-10b N48K /CFP-claudin-10b WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Hence, the p.N48K mutation affects, but does not prevent, cis-oligomerization of claudin-10b.

Such indirect effects of p.N48K on oligomerization are further supported by the fact that the corresponding N47 residue of claudin-15 is not part of an intermolecular interface in a polymer model reported previously [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our work demonstrates that a homozygous missense mutation in the <italic>CLDN10b</italic> gene, encoding the TJ protein claudin-10b, is responsible for a phenotype characterized by generalized anhidrosis, xerostomia, alacrima and kidney damage. The missense mutation p.N48K is located in the first extracellular loop (ECL1) that distinguishes the ubiquitously expressed isoform 10b from the kidney specific isoform 10a. The loop determines the opposing electrophysiological properties of the two proteins: Isoform 10b is selective for cations and isoform 10a for anions. Notably, the N48 residue in claudin-10b is included in the consensus motif shared by all mammalian claudins.</p>
      <p>Evidence for the pathogenic nature of the claudin-10b p.N48K was obtained by a combination of in vitro experiments. To model the effect of claudin-10b N48K on sweat production we cultured MDCK-C7 cell in matrigel to produce cysts. The expansion of cysts is driven by an osmotic gradient caused by transcellular Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion and paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport that, in a similar way, drive sweat production. However, expression of claudin-10b N48K caused a reduced lumen expansion when compared to cysts expressing claudin-10b WT. This observation suggests that the mutation reduces overall Na<sup>+</sup> conductance of the cysts that may be brought about by a reduction in single cell conductance or by a reduction of the number of paracellular channels. A reduction in single channel conductance cannot be excluded although dilution and bionic potential measurements indicate that claudin-10b N48K is still able to form charge and size-selective channels. However, claudin-10b N48K showed a tendency for intracellular accumulation in MDCK cells and in sweat glands of our patients. Thus, our observations suggest that the anhidrotic phenotype is not exclusively caused by the partial loss of function mediated by junctional claudin-10b N48K but also to its reduced incorporation into TJs.</p>
      <p>Since claudin-10b forms TJ strands and paracellular ion-channel we sought to investigate the capability of the mutated protein for TJ strand formation by ultrastructural analysis. The p.N48K substitution of claudin-10b was associated with fewer TJ strands arranged in a less complex meshwork and in contrast to claudin-10b WT, the strands formed by claudin-10b N48K consisted of separated intra-membranous particle arrays similar to those found for claudin-2, claudin-5 and claudin-3/claudin-5 and claudin-10a/claudin-10b chimeric mutants [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been suggested that these ultrastructural changes are related to altered claudin subtype-specific oligomerization properties [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The claudins interact in trans as well as in cis and we show an aberrant assembly mediated by the p.N48K substitution in cis accompanied by a marked decrease in trans-interactions at cell-cell contacts. Thus, the combined data strongly suggest that p.N48K alters both trans- and cis-interactions resulting in perturbed TJ formation. However, TJ formation is not fully prevented by the N48K mutation. Furthermore, in a 3D model based on the crystal structure of the highly homologous murine claudin-15, the N48 residue is predicted to form hydrogen bonds bridging the NLW-motif in the ECL1 with the transition between trans-membrane helix one and the ECL1. These interactions seem to be disrupted by replacing the polar asparagine for the longer and positively charged lysine. The modeling and the fact that the corresponding N47 residue of claudin-15 is not part of an intermolecular interface of a previously reported claudin-15 polymer model suggests that p.N48K indirectly affects oligomerization of claudin-10b by altering intramolecular interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the kidneys, an important proportion of Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption takes place within the ascending limb (TAL) of Henleâs loop through both transcellular and paracellular transport. The concerted action of apical and basolateral ion transporters generates a transepithelial voltage that drives the reabsorption of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Within the kidney, claudin-10a is expressed exclusively in cortical proximal tubulus segments of the nephron, whereas claudin-10b is highly expressed in the medulla where 50% of the reabsorbed Na<sup>+</sup> takes the paracellular route. Interestingly, ablation of the claudin-10b isoform in mouse kidney results in hypermagnesemia due to an increase in renal Mg<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption. The absence of claudin-10b in the TAL results in elevated transepithelial resistance, an increased transepithelial voltage and consequently, in an increased driving force for the paracellular reabsorption of cations [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, absence of claudin-10b in TAL tubules resulted in increased paracellular permeability for divalent cations, possibly due to increased expression of claudin-16 and claudin-19. However, absence of claudin-10b or presence of claudin-10b N48K should not affect the claudin 16/19 pore directly since claudin-10b does not physically interact with either claudin-16 or claudin-19 [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The mouse model further revealed that the reduced paracellular reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> in the TAL did not result in sodium loss. Given the observations in the mouse model and the elevated levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in serum of our patients we hypothesized that claudin-10b p.N48K disturbs the cation permeability and in particular the paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport. Indeed, we observed that the p.N48K mutation was associated with a reduced selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over Cl<sup>-</sup> and with a preserved transepithelial resistance in MDCK-C7 cell layers. Still, claudin-10b N48K retained the ability to interact with the hydration shell of monovalent cations Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs as judged from the higher Eisenman sequence. Furthermore, the reduction in P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> for the mutated protein was time dependent in culture and similar to that for clones with a weak expression of claudin-10b WT. These observations suggest that the paracellular channels formed by claudin-10b p.N48K have a subnormal Na<sup>+</sup> permeability and that the number of channels is greatly reduced. In addition, the observed increased proteolytic cleavage of mutated YFP- and CFP- claudin-10b and the staining of sweat glands in our patients suggest that the N48K mutation leads to increased degradation of claudin-10b that contributes to the reduced formation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels. The active transcellular transport of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the sweat glands as well as in the TAL generates a transepitheleal voltage and a driving force for paracellular cation transport. In the kidney, the severely reduced Na<sup>+</sup> conductivity caused by the N48K mutation is thus a likely contributing mechanism for the increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption that results in kidney damage in our family as shown by reduced eGFR values, reduced levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and increased PTH levels. Furthermore, the increased reabsorption of Mg<sup>2+</sup> that is associated with claudin-10b p.N48K is consistent with the kidney specific lack of claudin-10 in mice showing decreased Na<sup>+</sup> permeability in the TAL accompanied by increased reabsorption of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, the increased Mg<sup>2+</sup> mediated by claudin-10b p.N48K contrasts with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> wasting observed in patients who carry claudin-16 or claudin-19 mutations. In combination, these findings highlight the complex renal mechanisms mediated by claudins to maintain cation homeostasis.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our data support that claudin-10b N48K causes a disturbed relative overall permeability for cations that results in increased reabsorption of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and hypermagnesemia.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the kidney specific isoform claudin-10a, the claudin-10b isoform is ubiquitously expressed and presumably of importance for paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport in multiple organs. In our family, affected members presented with heat intolerance due to anhidrosis, and alacrima as first symptoms in early childhood. Sweat production is mediated by IP3 acting as an intracellular messenger and the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that opens Cl<sup>-</sup> channels to the glandular lumen and thus activates transcellular Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion energized by the basolateral Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>-</sup> symporter [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The resulting electrochemical gradient drives paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> flux that, together with AQP5 mediated water flux leads to a net secretion of a largely isotonic NaCl solution into the secretory portions of the glandular lumen [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our IHC analyses show claudin-10b staining in cells of the secretory portion of normal sweat glands with intense staining lining the canaliculi. This is consistent with a role for claudin-10b in the paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> flux into the lumen. Compared to healthy individuals, the immunohistochemical staining of sweat glands in affected individuals showed a pronounced reduction of claudin-10b N48K in the cell peripheries and canaliculi. In sum, our data suggests that the likely mechanism behind abolished sweat production in our patients is a reduced incorporation of claudin-10b N48K into TJs mediated by altered trans- and cis-interaction properties accompanied by increased degradation of the mutated protein. Accordingly, the plausible explanation for alacrima and xerostomia is a reduced paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> transport in the lacrimal and salivary glands, respectively, leading to a perturbed secretion of NaCl and water into the lumen of secretory portions [<xref rid="pgen.1006897.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we show that a mutation in the claudin-10b isoform results in abolished or reduced sweat production as well as a relative shift in cation resorption in the kidneys that leads to kidney damage. The affected organs contain epithelia in which transepithelial transport of NaCl is paralleled by paracellular transport of Na<sup>+</sup> that is impaired by claudin-10b N48K. The combined findings expand our knowledge on the role of claudin-10b and the complex functional networks of claudins that may be useful in identifying the genetic basis for additional phenotypes caused by altered paracellular ion transport.</p>

          <p>Claudin-10 <bold>(</bold>cldn10) shows strong staining of membranes facing the canaliculi as well as the gland lumen (A-C) whereas neither claudin-1 (cldn1) nor claudin-3 (cldn3) stain membranes facing the canaliculi (A and B; see exclusively green canalicular staining in the merged figures in A and B) (arrows). Claudin-1 and claudin-10 show strong extra-junctional staining (A) which could represent basal infoldings. Furthermore, claudin-1 is detected in all cells of the sweat gland coil whereas claudin-10 is not (see merge figure A). Like claudin-10, occludin (Occl) and ZO-1 show strong staining of membranes facing the canaliculi as well as adjacent to the glandular lumen (C, D) but, in contrast to claudin-10b, no basal staining is observed. Scale bars: 20Î¼m; arrows, canaliculi; arrow heads, basal staining.</p>

          <p>Live cell imaging of co-culture of stable HEK293 lines expressing (A) CFP- (green) or YFP-claudin-10b WT (red) and (B) CFP- (green) or YFP-claudin-10b N48K (red). Cytosolic fluorescence was found much more frequent for cells expressing claudin-10b N48K when compared to cells expressing claudin-10b WT, indicating CFP/YFP cleavage of the fusion protein. Living HEK293 cells were imaged by laser scanning microscopy (LSM). Plasma membrane of cells was labeled with CellmaskTM (blue) and imaged together with the CFP and YFP. Bar 20 Î¼m. (C) Western Blot analysis after SDS-PAGE of cell lysates of stable HEK293 lines expressing claudin-10b WT (10Bwt) or claudin-10b N48K (10BN48K). For all constructs, beside a band corresponding to the full length CFP/YFP-claudin-10b fusion protein (~50 kDa, upper arrow) cleavage products (lower arrows) were found (representative blot). Degradation products were more prominent for CLDN10b p.N48K. (D) Densitometric quantification of the ratio between full length to degradation bands revealed a significantly lower ratio in cultures expressing claudin-10b N48Kwhen compared to cultures expressing claudin-10b WT. CFP- and YFP- fusions were grouped, n = 8â12, * = p&lt;0.01, unpaired t-test). Error bars are presented with Â± standard error (SEM).</p>

          <title>Inhibition of trans-interactions and perturbed formation of tight junction strand for C-terminallly tagged claudin-10b-N48K-GFP.</title>
          <p>(A, B) LSM analysis of subcellular distribution of claudin-10b constructs with C-terminal AcGFP-tag (GFP-variant). (A) Similar as for YFP-claudin-10b-wt (N-terminal GFP-variant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) claudin-10b-wt-AcGFP was often enriched at contacts between claudin-expressing cell (arrows) but showed only weak signals in other areas of the plasma membrane (arrowheads). (B) In contrast, claudin-10b-N48K-AcGFP showed no contact enrichment (arrows) but more uniform distribution through out the plasma membrane (arrowheads), also similar to YFP-claudin-10b-N48K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). In general the C-terminally tagged constructs (A, B) showed more intracellular signals than the N-terminally tagged constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). Bar, 5 Î¼m. (C-D) Freeze fracture electron microscopy of HEK293 cells transiently expressing Claudin-10b-AcGFP constructs. (C) Similar as for YFP-claudin-10b WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006897.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), for claudin-10b WT-AcGFP complex meshworks of branched continuous-type tight junction strands were detected on the protoplasmic face (P-face, PF) and as mainly particle-free grooves (arrowhead) on the exoplasmic face (E-face, EF) of the plasma membrane. (D) In contrast, but similar to YFP-claudin-10b N48K, for claudin-10b N48K AcGFP only few tight junction strands and less complex meshworks were detected on the P-face as rows of rather separated intramembranous particles (white arrow). Bar, 200 nm.</p>
