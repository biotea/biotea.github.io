          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Hydranencephaly is a congenital anomaly leading to replacement of the cerebral hemispheres with a fluid-filled cyst. The goals of this work are to describe a novel autosomal-recessive syndrome that includes hydranencephaly (multinucleated neurons, anhydramnios, renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia and hydranencephaly (MARCH)); to identify its genetic cause(s) and to provide functional insight into pathomechanism.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to identify recessive mutations in a single family with three affected fetuses. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and imaging in cell lines, and zebrafish models, were used to explore the function of the gene and the effect of the mutation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in <italic>CEP55</italic> segregating with MARCH. Testing the effect of this allele on patient-derived cells indicated both a reduction of the overall <italic>CEP55</italic> message and the production of a message that likely gives rise to a truncated protein. Suppression or ablation of <italic>cep55l</italic> in zebrafish embryos recapitulated key features of MARCH, most notably renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia and craniofacial abnormalities. These phenotypes could be rescued by full-length but not truncated human <italic>CEP55</italic> message. Finally, we expressed the truncated form of CEP55 in human cells, where we observed a failure of truncated protein to localise to the midbody, leading to abscission failure and multinucleated daughter cells.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>
<italic>CEP55</italic> loss of function mutations likely underlie MARCH, a novel multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. This association expands the involvement of centrosomal proteins in human genetic disorders by highlighting a role in midbody function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hydranencephaly is a congenital anomaly with a frequency of â¼1 in 10â000 births.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is defined as the almost complete absence of the cerebral hemispheres, replacement of the missing neural tissue with fluid-filled sacs, relative preservation of the posterior fossa structures and a normal intracranial compartment. On prenatal ultrasonography, hydranencephaly may resemble extreme hydrocephalus, but can be differentiated through fetal or postnatal MRI. It is usually an isolated anomaly, although there are reports of syndromic associations. Underlying causes are thought to include teratogens (eg, congenital infections, valproic acid exposure), chromosomal disorders (eg, trisomy 13, triploidy) and single-gene disorders (eg, proliferative vasculopathy, X-linked hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The pathophysiology in the majority of cases of hydranencephaly is thought to be early intracranial vascular obstruction in a fetus, leading to necrosis and cystic degeneration of the cerebral hemispheres, although there may be other mechanisms.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â4</xref>
</p>
      <p>Here we report a family with an apparently autosomal recessive form of hydranencephaly that includes additional congenital anomalies and dysmorphisms. Literature review shows that this is a rare, but consistent, syndromic association and provides additional evidence for a recessive inheritance pattern. Neuropathological analysis identified a unique pathophysiology underlying the hydranencephaly likely related to arrested neuronal mitosis, suggesting that this anomaly is probably caused by non-vascular mechanisms. Through the combined application of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, we identified the likely causative genetic defect, a nonsense mutation in <italic>CEP55</italic> (c.1274C&gt;A; p.S425X), which encodes centrosomal protein-55âkDa (CEP55). Although not implicated previously in any genetic disorder, CEP55 is known to be essential for the final step of cytokinesis, abscission and has also been found to be upregulated in some tumours.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> More recently, loss of <italic>cep55l,</italic> the zebrafish ortholog of <italic>CEP55</italic>, was also shown to result in various developmental defects in zebrafish embryos.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the present study, we link aberrant fetal development in humans with a <italic>CEP55</italic> mutation; we reproduce several of the key phenotypes in zebrafish models and we show that the observed C-terminal truncation of the protein likely interferes with the midbody functions of CEP55, thereby providing insight into pathomechanism.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Patient material</title>
        <p>The study was conducted on a single Canadian family of Dutch-German Mennonite ancestry. Postmortem sampling, pathological analysis, karyotype and comparative genomic hybridisation were done during the provision of clinical care using standard protocols. All subjects (or legal guardians) gave written informed consent to participate.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>Genetic mapping</title>
        <p>Genotyping of the nuclear family was performed using Illumina Human Omni 2.5 SNP arrays at the Centre for Applied Genomics, Toronto, Canada. These data were analysed using the AutoSNPa and Phaser SNP mapping tools developed at the University of Leeds.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, X-linked markers were sorted manually in a spreadsheet to determine X-chromosome segregation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>Exome sequencing</title>
        <p>Sequencing and analysis were conducted as described.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Briefly, we enriched for the coding sequence regions with the Agilent SureSelect 50âMb (V3) All Exon Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). The resultant library was sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq platform to generate &gt;14âGb of 100âbp paired-end reads. Read alignment to the reference genome (hg19) was done with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Picard and ANNOVAR were used to identify and annotate variants. Variants of low quality that did not meet objective criteria (read depth (DP)&gt;5; quality (Q) â¥50; mapping quality (MQ)â¥4; quality by depth (QD)&lt;1.5) were excluded. Coverage of Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) bases was assessed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit. We assessed population frequency of variants using dbSNP132, the 1000 Genomes data set (2012/04 release) and the 6500 exomes in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. In addition, we assessed variant frequency using the Genome Quebec Innovation Centre database (â¼800 exomes). We confirmed all candidate variants using Sanger sequencing.</p>

        <title>RNA isolation from patient cells and expression studies using RT-PCR</title>
        <p>We isolated total RNA from fibroblasts derived from a healthy individual (3384) and a multinucleated neurons, anhydramnios, renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia, and hydranencephaly (MARCH) patient using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was made using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System and oligo(dT)20 primers (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions. We PCR amplified cDNA using a Veriti 96-well Thermal Cycler (model 9902, Applied Biosystems) and the following conditions: 95Â°C for 5âmin, followed by 27 cycles of 95Â°C, 60Â°C and 72Â°C of 30âs periods each and 7âmin of 72Â°C. Specifically, we amplified <italic>CEP55</italic> exons 7â9 (390â and 262âbp) and exons 2â3 (287âbp), respectively, and a <italic>GAPDH</italic> control fragment (288âbp). We obtained primers from Sigma-Aldrich. The <italic>CEP55</italic> 390âbp fragment I was amplified with forward and reverse (5â²-3â²) primers âCCAGTTTCTTTACACATCTCTGCâ and âCAGTATTCCACATGGACAAGCâ, the 262âbp fragment II with âCCAGTTTCTTTACACATCTCTGCâ and âTCTGTTTTCAGTCTCTCCTTGGâ, and the 287âbp fragment III with âAAGTAAGTGGGGATCGAAGCâ and âTCTCTTCCAGCTGTTCAAGCâ. The 5â²-3â² sequences of the <italic>GAPDH</italic> primers are âTCTCCTCTGACTTCAACAGCGAâ and âTACATGGCAACTGTGAGGAGGGâ.

        <p>The family visited our genetics clinic with their first pregnancy after an ultrasound examination at 20âweeks gestation showed anhydramnios, small dysplastic kidneys and hydranencephaly. The mother was 25âyears old and the antenatal history was unremarkable, with normal prenatal screening and no known teratogenic exposures. Both parents had Dutch-German Mennonite ancestry, suggesting a possible degree of relatedness, but they were not aware of any consanguinity. The family history was otherwise non-contributory. This fetus was stillborn at 30âweeks gestation (infant 303). Our fetal assessment unit followed three subsequent pregnancies from the first trimester. Two of these fetuses were also found to have abnormalities similar to the first fetus and were each delivered in the third trimester; one male died within minutes of birth at 35âweeks gestation (infant 305) and the other male was stillborn at 32âweeks gestation (infant 306).</p>
        <p>Postmortem examination of all three affected children showed evidence of Potter sequence including microretrognathia, limb contractures, single transverse palmar creases, fifth finger clinodactyly, talipes equinovarus and pulmonary hypoplasia. We noted additional dysmorphisms that included a pinched nose with a bulbous tip, choanal narrowing, broad hands with a short fifth digit and cutaneous syndactyly of the toes with a wide first web space (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F1">figure 1</xref>A and online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplement 2</xref> for detailed pathologic description). The two infants who had full autopsies (303 and 306) showed dysplastic aortic valves, dilated left ventricles and only vestigial remnants of renal tissue with a few glomeruli in a background of collagenous tissue. The third infant (305) had an incomplete autopsy because advanced autolysis compromised tissue examination. All three had hydranencephaly with a normal head size relative to the rest of the body and cystic replacement of most of the neural tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F1">figure 1</xref>BâD). The cerebellum, brain stem, basal nuclei and the basal portions of the temporal and frontal lobes were present, although hypoplastic. The bulk of the cerebral cortex was absent or reduced to islands of tissue attached to a leptomeningeal sac (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary figure S2.5A, B</xref>). To assess pathology further, we conducted microscopic examination; these analyses showed that the temporal cortex was disorganised. Approximately 5â10% of neurons and glial cells were multinucleated in all regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F1">figure 1</xref>E, F) as well as in retroperitoneal sympathetic ganglia adjacent to the kidney tissue (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary figure S2.10B</xref>) and the ganglion cell layer of the retina (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplemental figure S2.10E</xref>). Normal human brain, even at an early developmental stage, does not have such abnormal neurons, although they have been reported recently in association with a severe form of primary microcephaly caused by autosomal recessive mutations in <italic>CIT</italic>, a gene involved in cytokinesis.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We did not appreciate any evidence of infection, inflammation or vascular obstruction.</p>

            <p>Morphological and histological phenotypes of MARCH syndrome. (A) Postmortem photographs depicting consistent dysmorphology among the three infants. Features secondary to Potter deformation sequence are evident: microretrognathia, flattened face, fifth finger clinodactyly, single palmar creases, talipes equinovarus and proximal flexion contractures (not depicted here). Also evident is a pinched nose with a bulbous tip, anteverted nares, choanal narrowing, small palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds (infant 305), low set ears, shortened neck with redundant skin and microstomia. Infant 306 had a particularly small mouth with ankyloglossia. The hands show brachydactyly with tapered fingers and a shortened fifth finger. The feet show variable degrees of cutaneous (and in one case osseous) syndactyly with a wide first webspace. (B) In utero sonograms showing the progression of the hydranencephaly in infant 305. Gestational age is in the upper corner of each photograph. A cystic hygroma is highlighted by the white arrowhead. (C) Postmortem MRI scan of infant 305. Shown is a slightly off-sagittal view of the cranium depicting the almost complete absence of the cerebral hemispheres. The hypoplastic tissue in the frontotemporal region and from within the posterior fossa are evident. (D) Postmortem view inside the cranial vault of infant 305. The view is from an occipital opening and the lack of most neural structures is evident. The top of the cerebellum and brainstem is visible as is the remnants of the frontotemporal lobes. (E) NeuN immunolabelling of frontal lobe sections at 100Ã magnification. A multinucleated neuron is highlighted by the strong NeuN staining. Such neurons represent 5â10% of the neurons amongst all sections. (F) Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunolabelling of a frontal lobe section at 60Ã magnification. Multiple nuclei within a glial cell (astrocyte) are highlighted by black arrowheads. Multinucleated glial cells tended to be less common than multinucleated neurons in all sections.</p>

        <p>Several known syndromes have hydranencephaly as a rare feature, including Cousin syndrome (OMIM#260660), Neu-Laxova (OMIM#256520) or Roberts syndrome (OMIM#268300). However, hydranencephaly is the primary feature only in proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (OMIM#225790), microhydranencephaly (OMIM#605013) and hydranencephaly with abnormal genitalia (OMIM#300215). None of these coincide clinically with our patients' presentation due to the lack of vascular abnormalities in the brain; proportionate head size; normal genitalia; renal dysplasia and characteristic dysmorphic features. The closest match with our patients is a single case report of two male siblings with hydranencephaly and renal aplasia (OMIM#236500).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Through further literature searches, we identified four more reports of infants with the combination of hydranencephaly and renal dysplasia/aplasia.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24â28</xref> These nine reported infants all had remarkably similar phenotypes to our patients (<xref rid="JMEDGENET2016104296TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>); they all have hydranencephaly and eight of the nine have renal aplasia or severe renal dysplasia. One child had presumably functioning kidneys (given that he survived for more than 1 month), but it is not clear whether there was renal dysplasia since he was not investigated in this respect.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> He likely has the same disorder, given that his sister had the full phenotype. Of those patients with neuropathological examination, a high incidence of multinucleated neurons was described.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> At least five of the infants had unusual feet, including large first web spaces and/or syndactyly.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Of the nine cases, two were singletons and seven were from families with two or three affected children each. Four of the nine reported cases were female. Combined with our family, these data argue strongly for an autosomal-recessive aetiology, particularly since our family is from a population with a strong founder effect, although we cannot definitively rule out alternative aetiologies such as an X-linked inheritance or multiple independent genetic effects.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We propose that this phenotype be known as MARCH syndrome.</p>

        <title>Gene identification</title>
        <p>We obtained postmortem DNA samples from all three fetuses. An amnion sample from Infant 303 had a 46,XY karyotype at 400 band resolution. DNA from infant 305 that was extracted from cultured fibroblasts showed a normal chromosomal microarray, ruling out the possibility of significant copy number abnormalities (180K Oligoarray, CombiMATRIX Diagnostics, Irvine, California, USA). Given the high recurrence rate and degree of similarity between the affected children, we suspected a single-gene aetiology, probably through the inheritance of an ancestral Mennonite founder allele.</p>
        <p>Given an expectation of either homozygosity by descent or X-linked inheritance, we used SNP genotyping to identify candidate regions. All four siblings had multiple regions of homozygosity. Total levels of homozygosity ranged from 2.5% to 4.0% of the genome, supporting our suspicion of distant relatedness due to founder effect. One region of 9.4âMb on chromosome 10 showed segregation consistent with an autosomal-recessive disease model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F2">figure 2</xref>A). In addition, there were two regions (28.7 and 3.2âMb) on the X chromosome that showed segregation consistent with an X-linked disease model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F2">figure 2</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Next we performed exome sequencing on one of the affected infants. Mean CCDS coverage was 141X with 92% of bases covered by &gt;20 reads. We identified â¼147â000 variants that exceeded quality thresholds. Filtering for rare non-synonymous/splice variants (&lt;0.1% based on variant frequencies from publicly available and in-house exome datasets) in the candidate regions identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F2">figure 2</xref>A, B), we narrowed the list to a single candidate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F2">figure 2</xref>C): a homozygous nonsense mutation in <italic>CEP55</italic> (rs201430235, c.1274C&gt;A, p.S425X (NM_001127182.1)). This variant has been reported previously in a large-scale variant identification project in two separate individuals, both of whom were heterozygous (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Exome_Chip_Design">http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Exome_Chip_Design</ext-link>). The ExAC database reports an allele frequency of 0.0016% (January 2016). The variant maps to the final exon of the gene and is predicted to escape nonsense mediated decay, resulting in a truncation of 40 amino acids at the C-terminus.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Orthologs from 31/32 primates and placental mammals show conservation of this region, especially three serine residues (S425, S428 and S436), which have all been shown to be phosphorylated, and are essential for the function of this protein.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Sanger sequencing in the family confirmed that the variant showed segregation consistent with autosomal-recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F2">figure 2</xref>D). In an effort to identify additional variants that could contribute to the phenotype, we analysed the exome data using relaxed variant filtering (not shown). We included all regions that segregate under a compound heterozygous model and the frequency cut-offs were increased to &lt;1%. Under these criteria, we only identified a single additional candidate gene, <italic>R3HCC1L</italic> (homozygous rs147674187)<italic>.</italic> Although we cannot exclude the possibility of involvement, it has not been implicated in human disease and the variant is unlikely to be pathogenic (CADD score 1.5).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Thus, <italic>CEP55</italic> remains the most likely candidate molecular driver of disease.</p>

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34â38</xref> To investigate the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>CEP55</italic>, with emphasis on the developing human brain, we interrogated the Brainspan transcriptome database for <italic>CEP55</italic> mRNA levels in the human brain during different time points of gestation.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The highest levels of <italic>CEP55</italic> expression were in fetuses 8â12âweeks gestation, with a decline by 16âweeks and minimally detectable levels by 37âweeks, which continued into adulthood.

        <title>Modelling the effect of CEP55 truncation in vivo</title>
        <p>To investigate the relevance of CEP55 disruption to the hallmark features of MARCH syndrome, we targeted the sole <italic>CEP55</italic> ortholog in zebrafish (<italic>cep55l</italic>). A recent report showed that <italic>cep55l</italic> is expressed near-ubiquitously in developing zebrafish embryos, and that either transient suppression or stable mutation of <italic>cep55l</italic> leads to gross developmental defects likely due to altered Akt stability.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Notably, these homozygous mutants display cell cycle dysregulation and massive apoptosis in anterior structures subsequent to the depletion of maternal transcript.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> To complement these studies, and to test the pathogenic potential of p.S425X, we first obtained two MOs that target the splice donor sites of <italic>cep55l</italic> exons 2 and 5 (sb1 and sb2, respectively; online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">supplementary figure S4.1A</xref>). First, we confirmed that both MOs reduce endogenous <italic>cep55l</italic> message. We injected 5âng of each MO into zebrafish embryos at the one-to-two-cell stage, harvested RNA at 1 dpf and evaluated <italic>cep55l</italic> splicing near MO target sites with RT-PCR. For each of sb1 and sb2, we observed a reduction of detectable quantities of WT <italic>cep55l</italic> message in morphants, likely due to MO-induced aberrant splicing that introduced premature termination codons (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">supplementary figure S4.1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>Next, we fixed and immunostained sb2 MO-injected larvae to evaluate brain structures at 4âdpf. Demarcation of the axon tracts using an anti-acetylated Î±-tubulin antibody<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> revealed a significant reduction in the size of brain structures. Similar to the cerebellar hypoplasia observed in MARCH cases, we saw an â¼28% reduction in dorsal cerebellar area of <italic>cep55l</italic> morphants in comparison to controls (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F4">figure 4</xref>C, D). To determine whether <italic>cep55l</italic> morphants display renal atrophy, we marked the renal tubules of 4âdpf larval batches with anti-Na+/K+ ATPase antibody. We observed a significant reduction in the lateral area and convolution of the proximal tubule in sb2 MO-injected batches (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F4">figure 4</xref>E, F). Importantly, each of the brain and renal phenotypes could also be rescued significantly by co-injection of MO with capped human <italic>CEP55</italic> mRNA. Finally, on the cellular level, we reproduced the previously reported and apparently normal M-phase marker staining (phospho-histone H3) with concomitant apoptosis in <italic>cep55l</italic> sb2 morphants (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">supplementary figure S4.2AâD</xref> and ref. <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm further that the observed anatomical and cellular phenotypes were specific, we targeted the zebrafish <italic>cep55l</italic> locus with CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing and repeated a subset of phenotyping measures. Consistent with the transient <italic>cep55l</italic> model, F0 mutants displayed altered craniofacial patterning with a significantly more obtuse ceratohyal angle than controls (p&lt;0.0001), and atrophy of the proximal renal tubules (p=0.0016 vs. controls). A next-generation sequencing approach estimated that targeted mutation was present in as much as 76% of cells sequenced from 2âdpf embryos, but decreased to 17â25% by 4âdpf (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">supplementary figure S4.1F, G</xref>). The most likely explanation for the reduction is apoptosis in cells with <italic>cep55l</italic> disruption, which is supported by TUNEL assay at 2âdpf (see ref. <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">supplementary figure S4.2C, D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Prompted by the observations that <italic>CEP55</italic> mRNA harbouring p.S425X was detectable by RT-PCR from patient tissue and is predicted to produce a truncated protein, we carried out in vivo complementation assays to determine variant pathogenicity. First, we confirmed our assay specificity by comparing the rescue efficiency of human WT message (encoding p.H378) to that of message encoding a common variant at the same amino acid position, which was also identified in the affected fetuses (p.L378; rs2293277, allele frequency 0.70 in ExAC). For each of the craniofacial (ceratohyal angle measurement) and cerebellar area phenotyping approaches, we observed that <italic>CEP55</italic> p.L378 also rescued the sb2 MO defects significantly (p&lt;0.0001; both phenotypes, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F5">figure 5</xref>B, D). However, co-injection of sb2 MO with <italic>CEP55</italic> mRNA harbouring the p.S425X variant produced jaw phenotypes that were significantly worse than WT mRNA (p.H378 or p.L378) but not significantly different from MO alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F4">figure 4</xref>B). The trend was similar in the cerebellar assay, but significant only for the p.L378 encoding mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F4">figure 4</xref>D). Taken together, our <italic>cep55l</italic> transient and F0 mutant data show relevance of gene disruption to the primary clinical features of MARCH syndrome and indicate that the <italic>CEP55</italic> is a functional null variant.</p>

Î±-tubulin (green) marks mitotic bridges and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). mRFP-CEP55 is shown in red. Scale bars represent 10âÎ¼m. (B) Histogram showing the localisation of mRFP-tagged CEP55 proteins in COS-7 cells following 24 and 48-hour transfections, respectively. Wild-type mRFP-CEP55 and mRFP-CEP55 with polymorphisms p.H57Q or p.H378L localised to the midbody near the end of cytokinesis, while the mutant (p.S425X) did not. The differences between wild-type, polymorphisms and mutant conditions were significant (p&lt;0.0001). The number of mitotic cells that were counted for the 48-hour transfection are n=52 (wild-type), n=51 (p.S425X), n=50 (p.H57Q) and n=50 (p.H378L). The number of mitotic cells analysed in the 24-hour transfection are n=79 (wild-type), n=52 (p.S425X), n=62 (p.H57Q) and n=69 (p.H378L). The 24-hour and 48-hour transfections were performed in duplicate. (C) Western blot analysis of mRFP-CEP55 in COS-7 cells. Lower bands (indicated by *) show the expected sizes: 81âkDa for mRFP-fused wild-type CEP55 and CEP55 with polymorphisms, and 77âkDa for the mutant protein. No CEP55 expression was detected in cells transfected with the empty vector. The origin of the higher band evident in the first four lanes is unclear. One potential explanation is a post-translational modification of the tagged CEP55 occurring in COS-7 cells.</p>

        <p>Previous studies have shown that CEP55 localises to the centriole during interphase and to the midbody on the intracellular bridge between two daughter cells during cytokinesis.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Abnormal phosphorylation at the C-terminus of the protein prevents the association with the midbody and causes abscission failure.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The mutation identified in our patients (c.1274C&gt;A; p.S425X) is predicted to truncate the protein, causing a loss of all three key phosphorylated serines. We hypothesised that the patient mutation would lead to a similar mislocalisation of CEP55. To test this idea, we transfected COS-7 cells with four different full-length cDNA <italic>CEP55</italic> constructs that contain an mRFP tag. These constructs encode WT mRFP-CEP55, mutant mRFP-CEP55 (p.S425X) or mRFP-CEP55 with a common polymorphism (p.H57Q, minor allele frequency 0.23 in ExAC; or p.H378L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F5">figure 5</xref>A, B). At 24âhours or 48âhours post transfection, we examined protein localisation. As expected, WT and polymorphism-containing mRFP-CEP55, but not the S425X-encoding mutant localise to the midbody in dividing cells. On western blot with anti-CEP55 antibody, either WT or polymorphism-containing mRFP-CEP55 migrate to the expected size (81âkDa), while mutant CEP55 is truncated (77âkDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JMEDGENET2016104296F5">figure 5</xref>C); these observations support our imaging studies and together suggest that the last 40 amino acids of CEP55 are essential for targeting CEP55 to the midbody of dividing cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we report the identification of a homozygous truncating mutation in <italic>CEP55</italic> as the likely cause of a new perinatal lethal syndrome we term MARCH. The genetic data that led to the identification of the <italic>CEP55</italic> mutation is from a single family, and therefore, it is difficult to rule out the possibility of multiple genetic effects leading to this phenotype. However, our functional data strongly support CEP55 as the sole contributor to this complex condition.</p>
      <p>
<italic>CEP55</italic> encodes, a 464 amino acid peptide that contains three central coiled-coil domains.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> CEP55 is an essential regulator of the final stages of mitosis; in cultured fibroblasts, the protein localises to the centrosome and pericentriolar matrix during most of the cell cycle but diffuses throughout the cell at the onset of mitosis (prophase). Later in mitosis (anaphase/telophase) CEP55 aggregates at the midzone, where cell separation will eventually take place. During cytokinesis, it is concentrated in the midbody, the protein complex present in the cytoplasmic bridge between the two daughter cells.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> There, it recruits the Endosome Sorting Complex Required for Transport machinery, and other components involved in membrane fission, to promote the formation of the cleavage furrow and eventually induce abscission of the two cells.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The disassociation of CEP55 from the centriole appears to be dependent on phosphorylation of the two C-terminal serines, p.S425 and p.S428, by the protein kinases Erk2 and Cdk1.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Subsequently, myotubularin proteins connect CEP55 to another protein kinase, PLK1, which phosphorylates CEP55 at p.S436. This stabilises the protein and leads to its orderly introduction into the midbody.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> If either of these phosphorylation events does not occur then cytokinesis fails with mitosis taking place but the daughter cells being unable to separate, leading to a binucleated cell.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p>
      <p>We show that the nonsense mutation (c.1274C&gt;A; p.S425X) identified in our family likely truncates CEP55. In cell culture experiments, the truncated version of CEP55 does not localise to the midbody during cytokinesis. Given the loss of the three phosphorylated residues, our data suggest the presence of multinucleated cells in the affected fetuses is a consequence of failed cytokinesis. We also show that <italic>cep55l</italic> knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 mutation in zebrafish recapitulates most key features of the syndrome: we reproduce the cellular apoptosis and neurological abnormalities reported previously in zebrafish F2 mutants harbouring a homozygous c.115C&gt;T; p.E39X mutation;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> we quantify further the cerebellar, renal and craniofacial features of our <italic>cep55l</italic> zebrafish models; and show that these phenotypes can be rescued by full length, but not truncated human <italic>CEP55</italic> mRNA. It is possible that the lack of overt hydranencephaly in zebrafish morphants or mutants is due to interspecies differences, particularly with regard to brain development and anatomy.</p>
      <p>The mechanism by which this nonsense mutation in CEP55 ultimately leads to such a dramatic human neurological phenotype remains incompletely understood. We know that there are large numbers of multinucleated cells in what remains of the patient brain tissue, suggesting that abscission failure likely plays some part in the creation of this anomaly. It is not clear how the production of multinucleated neurons along with a potential migration abnormality would induce such widespread cell death in the cerebral hemispheres. One potential mechanism is through suppressed PI3K/AKT signalling as this pathway has been found previously to be downregulated in zebrafish with absent CEP55 function.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Previous work has shown that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway protects against cerebral ischaemic damage in animal models and protects cultured neurons against hypoxic and excitotoxic injury.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47â49</xref> A similar pathway is involved in ischaemic damage to kidney.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Deficient PI3K/AKT signalling may thus help explain the destructive features in the brains of the fetuses affected with MARCH. Interference with the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway by virtue of mutant CEP55 could allow ischaemic-type damage in vulnerable organs, such as the parts of the brain with distal circulation, thereby leading to destruction of the cerebrum with resultant hydranencephaly.</p>
      <p>In summary, we report a novel human phenotype that combines hydranencephaly, renal dysplasia, multinucleated neurons, syndactyly and characteristic dysmorphism that we have named MARCH syndrome. We provide evidence that it is caused by autosomal-recessive loss-of-function mutation in <italic>CEP55</italic>, a gene not associated previously with human disease. Our data provide insight into the developmental functions of CEP55 particularly as it relates to brain development. Future directions in our research include exploring the role of CEP55 in the creation of new neurons and understanding how PI3K/AKT may be involved in hydranencephaly in this syndrome and other conditions that include this anomaly. We propose that both measuring AKT activity in animal models of this disorder, and also testing the hypothesis that amelioration of AKT signalling might improve some of the observed neuroanatomical defects will provide further insight into the basis of this syndrome.</p>
