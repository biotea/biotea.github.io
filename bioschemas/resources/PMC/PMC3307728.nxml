      <abstract>
        <p>Deformed Epidermal Autoregulatory Factor 1 (DEAF1) is a transcription factor linked to suicide, cancer, autoimmune disorders and neural tube defects. To better understand the role of DEAF1 in protein interaction networks, a GST-DEAF1 fusion protein was used to isolate interacting proteins in mammalian cell lysates, and the XRCC6 (Ku70) and the XRCC5 (Ku80) subunits of DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex were identified by mass spectrometry, and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit was identified by immunoblotting. Interaction of DEAF1 with Ku70 and Ku80 was confirmed to occur within cells by co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins, and was mediated through interaction with the Ku70 subunit. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> GST-pulldowns, interaction between DEAF1 and the Ku70 subunit was mapped to the DEAF1 DNA binding domain and the C-terminal Bax-binding region of Ku70. In transfected cells, DEAF1 and Ku70 colocalized to the nucleus, but Ku70 could not relocalize a mutant cytoplasmic form of DEAF1 to the nucleus. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, DEAF1 was phosphorylated by DNA-PK in a DNA-independent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that DEAF1 or Ku70/Ku80 did not interfere with the DNA binding of each other, but DNA containing DEAF1 binding sites inhibited the DEAF1-Ku70 interaction. The data demonstrates that DEAF1 can interact with the DNA-PK complex through interactions of its DNA binding domain with the carboxy-terminal region of Ku70 that contains the Bax binding domain, and that DEAF1 is a potential substrate for DNA-PK.</p>

DEAF1 was first identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a DNA binding protein that recognizes direct repeats of TTCG within the transcriptional promoter of the hox gene <italic>Deformed</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0033404-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. DEAF1 binds to DNA with TTCG motifs through an alpha-helical, surface patch containing the positively charged amino acid sequence KDWK that is located within a conserved structural fold called the âSANDâ domain <xref rid="pone.0033404-Bottomley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition to the SAND domain, the DEAF1 DNA binding domain also consists of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a zinc binding motif which function in DEAF1-DEAF1 protein interaction <xref rid="pone.0033404-Jensik1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A second DEAF1-DEAF1 interaction domain occurs in a region adjacent to the DNA binding domain and contains a leptomycin B sensitive nuclear export signal (NES) <xref rid="pone.0033404-Jensik1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The NES, the NLS and DEAF1-DEAF1 protein interaction provide a mechanism for shuttling the protein between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments where DEAF1 may have distinct functions. Protein-protein interactions are also likely to affect location and function. The LIM only protein 4 (LMO4) was shown to interact with amino acids 334â588 of mouse Deaf1 <xref rid="pone.0033404-Sugihara1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This region of DEAF1 includes the nuclear export signal and the second DEAF1-DEAF1 interaction domain. LMO4 interactions were also observed with the N-terminal domain of DEAF1, although they appeared to be weaker. Using yeast two-hybrid experiments and GST pulldown analysis, DEAF1 was also shown to interact with LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1/CLIM2) <xref rid="pone.0033404-Sugihara1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we use GST-DEAF1 pulldowns from cell lysates followed by mass spectrometric analysis to isolate and identify DEAF1 protein interaction with the Ku70 subunit of the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex. DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric protein complex composed of three subunits: Ku70, Ku80, and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). The protein regions necessary for DEAF1 and Ku70 interaction were identified. We also examined the ability of DNA-PK to phosphorylate DEAF1 and the effects of DNA on DEAF1 and Ku70 protein-interactions.</p>

        <title>DEAF1 Interacts with Components of the DNA-PK Complex</title>
        <p>To identify proteins that interact with DEAF1, GST-DEAF1 pull-down experiments were performed using cell lysates from the PC-3 human prostate cell line. Two prominent protein bands of 70 kDa and 80 kDa were found unique to the GST-DEAF1/PC-3 cell lysate lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and were subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry for identification of tryptic peptides. Peptide masses and matching peptides from a ProFound search are supplied in the Supplemental Data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0033404.s001">File S1</xref>). For the 70 kDa protein, ProFound gave a score of 1.0 for Ku70 (gi|4503841) with 22% of the peptide masses matching and a Mascot search identifying the same protein. For the 80 kDa protein, a ProFound search gave a probability score of 1.0 for Ku80 (gi|108639450), with a Mascot search identifying the same protein, and 29% of the peptide masses matching. In analogous experiments, GST-DEAF1 pull-downs with human kidney 293T/17 and monkey kidney CV1 cell lysates produced similar banding profiles indicating that this interaction is not unique to PC-3 cells (data not shown). Ku70 and Ku80 are known to form a heterotrimeric complex with the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) and effect repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. To examine the potential interaction with this complex, GST-DEAF1 pull-downs were repeated and Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody against DNA-PKcs. A strong signal was observed for DNA-PKcs confirming that DEAF1 interacts with the DNA-PK complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>The interaction domains of Ku70 and DEAF1 were further delineated by using various GST-Ku70 fusion proteins in pull-downs with two <italic>in vitro</italic> translated DEAF1 peptides: an amino-terminal (N-terminal) deletion of DEAF1 (amino acids 167â565) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and an internal peptide (amino acids 155â326) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Both of these peptides contain the DNA binding domain of DEAF1 (amino acids 167â306). The N-terminal deletion of DEAF1 interacted with all Ku70 N-terminal deletions that retained the carboxy-terminus (C-terminus) from amino acid 550â609 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The internal peptide of DEAF1 interacted with full-length Ku70 and the C-terminal protein of amino acids 396â609, but failed to interact with Ku70 proteins that lacked the C-terminus beyond amino acid 580, indicating that the C-terminal end of Ku70 is required for DEAF1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The experimental design was then reversed using GST-DEAF1 to pull-down <italic>in vitro</italic> translation products of Ku70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

        <title>Ku70 Does Not Interfere with DEAF1 Binding to DNA</title>
        <p>Both the Ku complex and DEAF1 bind to DNA, therefore electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to determine if either protein would affect the DNA binding activity of the other. A double-stranded oligonucleotide called N52-69 has been previously shown to be a DNA binding target of DEAF1. It contains two TTCG motifs required for DEAF1 binding and binding is lost upon substitution of the two CG dinucleotides with two TT dinucleotides (Mut 2) <xref rid="pone.0033404-Bottomley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033404-Jensik1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

Full-length DEAF1-FLAG isolated from mammalian cells produced a doublet of shifted bands with the N52-69 probe, but produced no shift with the Mut 2 probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, right panel). The observed doublet is not consistently observed and is possibly due to mammalian-specific protein modification of DEAF1 that does not occur when bacterially-expressed, shorter DEAF1 peptides are used <xref rid="pone.0033404-Bottomley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033404-Jensik1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The Ku70/Ku80 complex bound both N52-69 and Mut 2 oligonucleotides, consistent with the Ku complex having a preference for free DNA ends rather than sequence specificity. Combination of the three proteins had no apparent affect on Ku or DEAF1 binding to N52-69 or Mut 2, indicating their interactions do not alter their respective DNA binding activity. In addition, there were no observed supershifts of the DNA probes, indicating that DEAF1, Ku, and DNA do not form a DNA-binding complex with an altered mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>The effects of DNA on the interactions between Ku70 and DEAF1 were also analyzed in GST pull-down experiments. We narrowed the study to the use of the C-terminal region of Ku70 (550â609), which binds DNA <xref rid="pone.0033404-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and interacts with DEAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated DEAF1 (amino acids 167â565). The addition of closed-circular plasmid DNA containing the DEAF1 promoter with multiple DEAF1 binding sites markedly decreased the interaction between DEAF1 and Ku70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The addition of increasing amounts of double-stranded N52-69 oligonucleotide with a single DEAF1 binding site produced a modest decrease in the interaction between DEAF1 and Ku70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>), while addition of Mut 2 oligo at levels equal to the maximal concentration of N52-69 oligo used, had no affect on DEAF1/Ku70 interaction. These results indicate that DNA with DEAF1 binding sites can displace or prevent Ku70 from binding to DEAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6C and 6D</xref>), while Ku70 is unable to displace DNA bound to DEAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>DNA-dependent protein kinase is a heterotrimeric protein complex composed of three subunits: Ku70, Ku80, and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). DNA-PK has established functions in the non-homologous repair of DNA double strand breaks (NHEJ), immunoglobulin V(D)J gene rearrangement, and telomere maintenance (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0033404-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>). DNA-PKcs may have functions independent of the holoenzyme and appears to interact directly with p53 to repress transcription of p21 and promote apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0033404-Hill2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Similarly, Ku70/Ku80 may function independently of DNA-PKcs by participating in an alternative pathway for the lengthening of telomeres <xref rid="pone.0033404-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Also, Ku70 has been reported to have an independent function from the DNA-PK holoenzyme, where it can function in the cytoplasm to bind and sequester Bax to reduce apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0033404-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033404-LeesMiller1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0033404-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we found that DEAF1 interacts with the DNA-PK complex through direct interaction with the Ku70 subunit. Deletion studies identified the interacting regions of the proteins as the centrally located DNA binding domain of DEAF1 and the C-terminal, Bax-interacting domain of Ku70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g003">Fig. 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g004">4</xref>). Both DEAF1 and Ku70/Ku80 can bind double-stranded DNA, however no supershifting of DNA was observed that would indicate formation of a complex among the three proteins and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). DEAF1 binding to DNA was not affected by the addition of Ku70/Ku80, while DNA containing DEAF1 binding sites decreased DEAF1 interaction with Ku70. The EMSA results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6</xref> support the pulldown data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and indicate that DEAF1 interacts with Ku70 through its DNA binding domain but this interaction is suppressed with an appropriate DNA ligand of DEAF1.</p>
      <p>DEAF1 was <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylated by DNA-PK in a DNA independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Similarly, DNA independent DNA-PK phosphorylation has been demonstrated for the thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein <xref rid="pone.0033404-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thyroid hormone receptor-binding protein also interacts with DNA-PK through the Ku70 subunit and this may indicate that certain interactions with Ku70 eliminate the need for DNA to obtain DNA-PK kinase activity <xref rid="pone.0033404-Ko1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. DNA-PK is able to phosphorylate substrate proteins at S/T-Q motifs <xref rid="pone.0033404-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Analysis of the DEAF1 primary amino acid sequence indicates potential DNA-PK phosphorylation sites at S43 and S48 (Scansite program) and T213 and T289 (NetPhosK program). T213 and T289 are both followed by a leucine residue such that these sites correspond to the S/T-hydrophobic amino acid motif demonstrated to be a target for DNA-PK phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0033404-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Further studies are needed to determine the precise phosphorylation sites in DEAF1, whether DEAF1 is an <italic>in vivo</italic> substrate for DNA-PK, and if DNA-PK phosphorylation influences DEAF1 functions.</p>
      <p>As expected, DEAF1 and Ku70 showed nuclear co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0033404-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Previous studies had demonstrated that nuclear DEAF1 was able to relocalize DEAF1 with a NLS mutation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0033404-Jensik1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Relocalization of mutant DEAF1 by nuclear DEAF1 was dependent on the second DEAF1-DEAF1 interaction domain that contains the DEAF1 nuclear export signal and has a potential coiled-coiled motif structure <xref rid="pone.0033404-Jensik1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In contrast, nuclear Ku70 was unable to relocalize the cytoplasmic DEAF1 NLS mutant protein, suggesting that the Ku70-DEAF1 protein interaction is weaker than the self-interaction mediated by the coiled-coiled region of DEAF1.</p>
      <p>The data presented in this study suggests that DEAF1 could be a target for phosphorylation, or modulate signal transduction of the DNA-PK complex through interaction with the Ku70 subunit. Alternatively, because DEAF1 binds at the C-terminal Bax binding domain of Ku70, DEAF1 might potentially affect apoptotic function when it is cytoplasmically localized and/or not bound to DNA. Future studies that examine the influence of DEAF1 on DNA-PK and Ku70 mediated apoptotic function appear warranted.</p>
