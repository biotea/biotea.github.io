      <abstract>
        <p>We previously identified the ZTRE (<underline>z</underline>inc <underline>t</underline>ranscriptional <underline>r</underline>egulatory <underline>e</underline>lement) in genes involved in zinc homeostasis and showed that it mediates transcriptional repression in response to zinc. We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE. ZNF658 was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâtime of flight mass spectrometry of a band excised after electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in <italic>SLC30A5</italic> (ZnT5 gene), <italic>SLC30A10</italic> (ZnT10 gene), and <italic>CBWD</italic> transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Coordinated regulation of suites of genes in response to fluctuations in zinc availability is a cornerstone of cellular zinc homeostasis, which is essential across the phyla to allow adaptation to different environmental or nutritional conditions. For example, zinc must be tightly regulated for the correct population of protein metal binding sites and for other functions such as modulation of neurotransmission and intracellular signaling. These zinc-regulated genes include cell membrane zinc transporters and intracellular zinc storage proteins such as metallothionein.</p><p>Many transcription factors that control the expression of these genes have been identified and probed mechanistically at the molecular level to develop an understanding of how cells control the availability of zinc under conditions of a variable supply. The main players in bacteria fall into two groups. The ArsR and MerR families are transcriptional derepressors, where zinc binding induces a conformational change to inhibit DNA binding and allow expression of proteins that confer zinc tolerance. Transcription factors in the Fur family (specifically Zur) bind to DNA in the metal-bound form to repress transcription of zinc resistance genes (reviewed in reference <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> the transcription factor ZAP1 coordinates the expression of genes involved in zinc homeostasis generally, although not exclusively (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), through a transcriptional activating function when zinc-limiting conditions promote binding to DNA. ZAP1 targets include genes coding for transporters that increase cytosolic zinc concentration under these conditions, notably the high-affinity zinc uptake transporter ZRT1 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and the vacuolar zinc exporter ZRT3 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the fission yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces pombe</named-content> the transcription factor Loz1 plays a role in zinc homeostasis through responding to zinc excess to repress a suite of genes including those coding for the high-affinity zinc uptake transporter Zrt1 and for Adh4, a putative mitochondrial iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase that is expressed preferentially to the abundant, zinc-dependent Adh1 when zinc is limiting (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In mammals the transcription factor MTF1 responds to zinc to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and to bind to the metal response element (MRE). Binding of zinc to the outermost zinc fingers (1, 5, and 6) of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which comprises six Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers, appears to be responsible for the zinc-sensing function (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Acidic, proline-rich, and serine/threonine-rich domains in the carboxyl half of the protein together form the transcription activation domain (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The classical MTF1-induced response is activation of transcription, including transcription of the <italic>SLC30A1</italic> (ZnT1) gene (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), whose product mediates efflux of zinc from the cell (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and of metallothionein genes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, MTF1 can also repress gene transcription, as observed for <italic>Slc39a10</italic> (ZIP10) genes in both zebrafish (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and for human and mouse selenoprotein H genes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) has a role in the inducing transcription of the <italic>Slc39A4</italic> (Zip4) gene in mouse intestine under conditions of restricted zinc supply (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), but potential wider-ranging actions of this transcription factor in zinc homeostasis have not been reported.</p><p>Major gaps in knowledge and understanding of transcriptional regulatory processes important in zinc homeostasis remain. Notably, the identity of a metazoan transcriptional regulatory protein with a function to repress transcription of multiple genes to coordinate a homeostatic cellular response under conditions of elevated zinc availability has not been uncovered. Our recent identification of a regulatory DNA sequence element as the binding site for a protein with this functionâthe ZTRE (<underline>z</underline>inc <underline>t</underline>ranscriptional <underline>r</underline>egulatory <underline>e</underline>lement) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)âadvanced our understanding of this process. We report here the identity of a transcription factor that acts through the ZTRE to mediate transcriptional repression in response to zinc of a suite of genes in human cells. We also report that this transcription factor plays a role in the control of ribosome biogenesis, thus coordinating this highly zinc-demanding process with the available zinc supply.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Cell culture, transfection, and treatment with zinc.</title><p>Caco-2 cells were grown and passaged under standard conditions as described previously (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and seeded at 3.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells/9.6-cm<sup>2</sup> well in six-well plates 24 h prior to transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) or with a control siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 0.35 Î¼g of siRNA per well (10 nM). Medium containing the siRNA transfection mixture was replaced with complete medium after 24 h.

To measure the effect of ZNF658 knockdown on the response of promoter-reporter plasmid constructs to zinc, the cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and using 1 Î¼g of plasmid DNA per well, which was added after the cells had been maintained in complete medium for 24 h after ZNF658 knockdown.

The effect of siRNA on expression of ZNF658 protein was investigated by Western blotting, using an anti-myc antibody and extract from cells expressing recombinant ZNF658 from a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with a C-terminal myc epitope tag. Although the reduction in protein expression achieved was modest (15%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), as expected based on the high level of overexpression of the recombinant protein from the CMV promoter, together the data demonstrated efficacy of siRNA-mediated knockdown of ZNF658 protein, as well as mRNA. We used two complementary approaches to determine whether ZNF658 mediated transcriptional regulation of the panel of three genes in response to zinc. First, we sought to determine whether the reduced expression of ZNF658 abrogated the effect of zinc to reduce expression of each corresponding endogenous transcript. Second, we investigated whether the effect of zinc to repress expression of a reporter gene driven by <italic>SLC30A5</italic> (ZnT5 gene), <italic>SLC30A10</italic> (ZnT10 gene), and <italic>CBWD</italic> promoters in promoter-reporter constructs was affected by knockdown of ZNF658. Both approaches generated data consistent with ZNF658 being required for the response to zinc. The levels of all three mRNAs were reduced at 100 Î¼M compared to 3 Î¼M zinc in Caco-2 cells transfected with the control siRNA, replicating the response we measured previously (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, when expression of ZNF658 was reduced by either of the two targeted siRNAs these responses were abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Seventy-seven probes on an Illumina HT12 bead chip microarray detected transcripts that were increased by knockdown of ZNF658 and 69 probes detected transcripts that were reduced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). rRNA 18S5 showed the biggest change in abundance, being reduced by 9.70-fold. rRNA28S5 was reduced by 2.6- to 1.68-fold. Also, 29 of the probes corresponding to transcripts increased by ZNF658 knockdown corresponded with ribosomal proteins or ribosomal protein pseudogenes. A search for the ZTRE motif âC-A/C-C-T/A/G-C-C-T/C-N(0-50)-G/A-G-A/T/C-G-T/G-Gâ 1 kb on either side of the TSS of the human 45S rRNA precursor and 1 kb on either side of the 5â² end of each of the mature rRNAs generated through its posttranscriptional processing (18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs) revealed 10 copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We considered the possibility that the ribosomal protein pseudogenes upregulated by knockdown of ZNF658 are, in fact, functional genes repressed by ZNF658 when the zinc supply is adequate and expressed to substitute for other (zinc-dependent) ribosomal proteins when zinc supply is limited. However, a search for the ZTRE in the 1 kb of sequence on either side of the first exon in each of these 13 genes revealed copies in only two of the genes, so this scenario is unlikely. Microarray analysis does not distinguish reliably between ribosomal protein pseudogenes (which, by definition, should not be expressed) and expression of the corresponding functional ribosomal protein genes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); thus, we assume that matches to ribosomal protein pseudogenes represent the corresponding functional gene. On this basis, our analysis detected 13 ribosomal protein genes expressed at higher levels under conditions of ZNF658 knockdown, and in which the ZTRE occurs infrequently (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>; see Fig. S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). The remarkable clustering of ZTREs in the rRNA precursor, along with the large changes in abundance of rRNAs brought about by reducing ZNF658 expression, is a strong indication that ZNF658 has a role (as yet undefined) in rRNA expression. In preliminary work we attempted to determine whether ZNF658 acting at ZTREs in the 45S rRNA precursor was required for transcription <italic>per se</italic> or for correct processing to the mature rRNAs. We used RT-qPCR to determine whether knockdown of ZNF658 caused a substantial shift in the relative proportion of the 45S rRNA precursor to 18S rRNA. The level of 18S rRNA was approximately 1.3 Ã 10<sup>3</sup>-fold greater than the level of the 45S precursor molecule, requiring the use of 20-fold less of the RT reaction for its measurement. The difference between <italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> values for the two molecules was not affected by knockdown of ZNF658 (6.54 Â± 0.32 for control versus 6.36 Â± 0.12 with knockdown of ZNF658 (means Â± the standard errors of the mean [SEM]; <italic>n</italic> = 4). Thus, there was no change in relative abundance of the precursor and mature rRNAs of sufficient magnitude to be detectable using this assay. However, relative quantification was limited severely by the huge difference in abundance of the two species. The likelihood that the two rRNA species have very different half-lives further confounds interpretation of these data. Hence, we do not draw any conclusions at this stage. We also investigated whether zinc affected rRNA levels, using the 18S rRNA primers and Î²-actin as the reference gene. We observed that the level under conditions of zinc supplementation was ca. 50% of the level when zinc was depleted (using TPEN) (1.0 Â± 0.06 versus 0.54 Â± 0.06 [means Â± the SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001]), a finding consistent with the ZTREs in the 45S rRNA precursor being functional with respect to mediating effects of zinc. We speculated that if ribosome biogenesis is controlled by the action of ZNF658 at the ZTRE, then the expression of RNA Pol I may also be regulated through this mechanism. Supporting this idea, we found two copies of the ZTRE close to the TSS in each of <italic>POLR1D</italic> and <italic>POLR1E</italic>, which code for two of the five subunits of RNA Pol I for which we found annotated genes (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Transcripts detected at altered levels under conditions of ZNF658 knockdown compared to control<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="T1F1"><sup><italic>a</italic></sup></xref></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zmb00615-0760-t01a"/><graphic xlink:href="zmb00615-0760-t01b"/><graphic xlink:href="zmb00615-0760-t01c"/><table-wrap-foot><fn fn-type="other" id="T1F1"><label>a</label><p>The genes listed are those for which transcript levels were detected at levels that differed by 1.2-fold (to 2 significant figures) or greater by hybridization of RNA to DNA oligonucleotide microarrays.

We also demonstrate that recombinant ZNF658 binds specifically to the ZTRE in a cell-free system. Previously, we showed that the ZTRE mediates transcriptional repression at elevated zinc concentrations (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We thus show that ZNF658 plays a role in repressing transcription of these genes at higher zinc concentrations by binding to the ZTRE. In addition, we show that binding of ZNF658 to the ZTRE requires both sides of the palindromic sequence to be present and is through the zinc finger domain that corresponds with the DNA binding domain of ZAP1, the most similar protein in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, which coordinates zinc-homeostatic gene expression changes when zinc becomes limiting. Moreover, we uncovered evidence that ZNF658 regulates ribosome biogenesis. These findings are of fundamental importance in understanding mechanisms of zinc homeostasis and consequences of its perturbation in metazoans. First, ZNF658 is the first identified transcription factor that represses the expression of multiple genes in response to zinc, thus providing the basis of a coordinated cellular response to restore zinc balance. Second, the involvement of ZNF658 in the control of ribosome biogenesis links directly this fundamental process into which a large proportion of zinc in the cell is channeled with zinc homeostasis.</p><p>The fact that ZAP1is the yeast protein most similar to ZNF658 may reflect common ancestry or acquisition of a similar DNA binding domain that is exquisitely sensitive to zinc occupancy. We confirm here that binding of ZNF658 to the ZTRE is through the zinc finger domain of ZNF658 that aligns with the DNA binding region of ZAP1. Each of the five zinc fingers in this region of ZAP1 is individually necessary for binding to DNA (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Elucidation of whether or not any of the separate zinc fingers in the DNA binding domain of ZNF658 is dispensable for binding should be an avenue for future work to characterize the mechanism of ZNF658 function in more detail. The fact that ZAP1 is a transcriptional activator and ZNF658 an inhibitor is presumably attributable to the dissimilar regions of the two proteins interacting with regulatory proteins that have contrasting actions. A scenario in which ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE in complex with other proteins is likely given that regulation of transcription in general, including regulation in response to zinc through the MRE (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), is mediated by protein complexes, rather than single proteins.</p><p>Knockdown of ZNF658 also reduced the endogenous transcript level of the three genes we studied. With the exception of ZnT10, where both siRNAs reduced endogenous levels of transcript, this effect was observed only with siRNA2. The reason for this difference is unknown but, speculatively, may be due to the two siRNAs targeting different ZNF658 splice variants, which is formally possible since they target different exons (exon 5 for siRNA1 and the exon 3/4 boundary for siRNA2). We confirmed that siRNA1 reduced ZNF658 protein (as well as mRNA) and thus exclude lack of efficacy at the level of protein expression as the reason for the difference between the effects of the two siRNAs. The fact that the ZTRE in the <italic>SLC30A10</italic> (ZnT10) gene is located downstream of the transcription start site, but upstream in <italic>SLC30A5</italic> (ZnT5 gene) and <italic>CBWD</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), may be a reason for the difference.</p><p>When ZNF658 was expressed in cells at levels reduced by siRNA a number of transcripts were detected at higher levels by microarray analysis consistent with ZNF658 having a repressive effect on their expression, which is the classical action of KRAB-zinc finger proteins (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, other transcripts were detected at lower levels. These effects could be secondary to repression of direct gene targets of ZNF658. However, positive regulation of the expression of specific genes by ZNF658 should not be ruled out. Indeed, there are reports in the literature of KRAB-zinc finger proteins binding directly to genes in parallel with transcripts increasing in abundance (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>A surprising but important finding was that knockdown of ZNF658 resulted in a large (up to 9.7-fold) reduction in levels of rRNAs. This observation was authenticated by the discovery of multiple copies of the ZTRE in the 45S rRNA precursor. Two main factors point toward the role of ZNF658 in rRNA expression being at the level of RNA processing rather than transcription. First, the rRNA precursor is transcribed by RNA Pol I, whereas the proven gene targets of ZNF658 (<italic>SLC30A5</italic>, <italic>SLC30A10</italic>, and <italic>CBWD</italic>) are, like other protein-coding genes, transcribed by RNA Pol II. Although it appears not without precedent that a common transcription factor can be involved in the control of Pol I- and Pol II-mediated transcription (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), this appears an uncommon paradigm. Second, the ZTREs in the rRNA precursor sequence are clustered not around the TSS but, most densely, several hundred bases upstream of the sequence of the first mature transcript, 28S rRNA. It is not implausible that ZNF658 (possibly expressed as different splice variants) has a dual role, regulating both (Pol II-mediated) transcription of specific target genes and RNA processing given that other members of the KRAB-domain containing ZNF protein family appear to have such a dual role (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">â</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). An effect on rRNA abundance of changing posttranscriptional processing could be due to differences in turnover rates of the precursor versus the mature transcripts. The position within the 45S rRNA precursor sequence of the three probes on the array through which a change in rRNA expression was detected (two within the 18S rRNA sequence and one within the 28S rRNA sequence; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) means that the analysis would not distinguish between a change in the abundance of the full 45S rRNA precursor and a change in processing to mature rRNAs with different half-lives. However, <italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> values derived using RT-qPCR indicated that the 45S rRNA precursor was at a level more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the processed 18S rRNA transcript. Thus, the effect detected is likely to reflect a change in the levels of the mature rRNAs. This large difference in abundance between the 45S rRNA precursor and the processed 18S rRNA product confounded our attempt to detect whether the ratio of the precursor to mature product was affected by knockdown of ZNF658 using RT-qPCR. Further work is thus required to provide insight into the precise function of ZNF658 in rRNA biosynthesis by determining whether 45S rRNA transcription or processing is affected by knockdown of this factor. A battery of approaches is likely to be required to tease out the affected points and could include metabolic labeling of nascent 45S rRNA with [<sup>3</sup>H]uridine, nuclear run-on measurements, psoralen cross-linking (to distinguish rRNA genes undergoing active transcription from genes in a repressed chromatic configuration), and RNA Pol I chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Zinc is essential for ribosome biogenesis because RNA Pol I, like the other major eukaryotic RNA polymerases, requires zinc (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and also because zinc-binding proteins are abundant in the ribosome. Our discovery of ZTREs in the genes for subunits D and E of RNA Pol I in positions likely to confer zinc-responsive transcriptional control suggests that control of RNA Pol I biosynthesis is an additional mechanism through which ZNF658 regulates ribosome biogenesis according to zinc availability. It has been suggested that the suppression of ribosome biogenesis seen in yeast under conditions of zinc deficiency is a mechanism to prioritize the synthesis of essential RNA Pol II-transcribed proteins (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). There is thus strong rationale for there being a tight link between the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cellular processes for zinc homeostasis. The indications we uncovered that ZNF658 acting through the ZTRE coordinates these two processes highlights the urgent need to elucidate the details of this process, which is potentially of substantial fundamental importance in the understanding of basic cell function with possible widespread translational implications, for example, in better harnessing the ability of cells to express commercially important proteins.</p><p>An effect on ribosome biogenesis of knocking down expression of ZNF658 was indicated also by a change in the expression of a raft of ribosomal protein genes. The ZTRE occurs at even lower frequency in the region around the TSS of these ribosomal protein genes than it does in their closest adjacent genes, suggesting that the ribosomal protein genes are not direct targets of ZNF658 and that these changes in expression are secondary to other perturbed processes. Thus, the fact that expression of these genes was increased, opposing the effect on rRNAs, may be a compensatory response driven by mechanisms separate from ZNF658. Linkage of these observations in this manner requires that the control of ribosome biogenesis in mammalian cells differs from yeast, where it has been reported that the activity of RNA Pol I determines and coordinates the RNA Pol II-mediated expression of the RP genes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Given that the process in yeast and mammals differs in several ways, this scenario is not implausible.</p><p>In summary, we report here for the first time the identity of a protein, ZNF658, that has a dual function in cellular zinc homeostasis and allocation in metazoans. First, ZNF658 can coordinate a homeostatic response to changes in cellular zinc availability through effects on the transcription of multiple genes. Second, the same protein can act on rRNA to affect ribosome biogenesis, a process into which a substantial proportion of zinc in the cell is allocated. We identify a specific region of zinc fingers necessary for binding to the double-stranded DNA target. To uncover more details about the actions of ZNF658 in metal homeostasis, future work should probe the identity of putative proteins that interact with ZNF658 (for example, by coimmunoprecipitation), explore the full range and identity of nucleic acid targets to which ZNF658 binds (for example, by ChIP-seq, rRNA-targeted ChIP approaches, and UV cross-linking, partial RNase digestion followed by sequencing of cDNA [CRAC]), and elucidate how the individual zinc fingers and domains of the protein contribute to its function (for example, by further mutagenesis and also the application of biophysical techniques to probe structure and zinc binding). The function of <italic>CBWD</italic> genes, regulated by zinc through this mechanism, has not been elucidated. However, our current research indicates a role in protecting cells against extremes of zinc concentration, a finding consistent with a homeostatic function, which we are currently probing in more depth.</p></sec>
