        <title>Abstract</title>
        <p>Mitochondrial polycistronic transcripts are extensively processed to give rise to functional mRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs; starting with the release of tRNA elements through 5â²-processing by RNase P (MRPP1/2/3-complex) and 3â²-processing by RNase Z (ELAC2). Here, we show using <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments that MRPP1/2 is not only a component of the mitochondrial RNase P but that it retains the tRNA product from the 5â²-processing step and significantly enhances the efficiency of ELAC2-catalyzed 3â²-processing for 17 of the 22 tRNAs encoded in the human mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, MRPP1/2 retains the tRNA product after ELAC2 processing and presents the nascent tRNA to the mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme. Thus, in addition to being an essential component of the RNase P reaction, MRPP1/2 serves as a processing platform for several down-stream tRNA maturation steps in human mitochondria. These findings are of fundamental importance for our molecular understanding of disease-related mutations in MRPP1/2, ELAC2 and mitochondrial tRNA genes.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Mitochondria, powerhouses of the eukaryotic cell, have their own genome and gene expression system. Functional mitochondrial gene expression is crucial for the biogenesis of the respiratory chain, and thereby for cellular metabolism. Defects in mitochondrial gene expression are a direct cause for debilitating mitochondrial diseases, but also imply age-related diseases and ageing (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>The human mitochondrial genome is 16.6 kB long, circular and encodes 37 genes including 13 mRNAs, 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs. The genome resides in nucleoids, which are discrete, compact structures about 100 nm in diameter (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The genome is transcribed bi-directionally to produce long polycistronic heavy- and light-strand precursor RNA transcripts. These transcripts must be further processed to release the mature mitochondrial RNAs essential for organellar translation, and hence for respiratory chain biogenesis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The large majority of mRNA and rRNA elements are flanked by one or more tRNA elements. In what is known as the tRNA punctuation model (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), excision of the tRNA elements releases all other elements and is a prerequisite for RNA maturation. This extensive processing is presumably co-transcriptional, and is mainly performed in distinct mitochondrial RNA granules located close to the nucleoid (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Mitochondrial RNA maturation is a complex process which involves a battery of nucleases and a more detailed molecular understanding is desired to link aberrant RNA processing to mitochondrial disease (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
      <p>The 5â²- and 3â²-processing of the mitochondrial tRNA elements are performed by the mitochondrial RNase P and RNase Z endonucleases, respectively, both of which are located within or close to the mitochondrial RNA granules (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). After maturation of the tRNA ends, the 3â²-terminal cytosine-cytosine-adenine (3â²-CCA) triplet is added by the mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme, completing the three core processing steps required for nearly all mitochondrial tRNAs. The human mitochondrial RNase P is composed of three protein subunits: mitochondrial RNase P proteins 1, 2 and 3 (MRPP1, MRPP2 and MRPP3, respectively) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). MRPP1 and MRPP2 form a strong protein complex (MRPP1/2) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), which is not only involved in 5â²-processing of the tRNA elements by RNase P but is also responsible for the <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methylation of adenosine and guanosine at position 9 (m<sup>1</sup>A9 and m<sup>1</sup>G9, respectively) of human mitochondrial tRNAs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). MRPP2 is a multifunctional protein involved in other cellular processes unrelated to mitochondrial RNase P activity such as amino acid catabolism and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Interestingly, the 5â²-processing and <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methylation processes of MRPP1/2 are uncoupled (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The endonuclease activity of mitochondrial RNase P is mediated by MRPP3, but is strictly dependent on the presence of MRPP1/2 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
      <p>RNase Z mediates tRNA 3â²-processing, which involves removing extra 3â² nucleotides immediately after the discriminator base from tRNA precursors. The RNase Z proteins belong to the metallo-Î²-lactamase superfamily ELAC1/2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Mammals encode multiple forms of RNase Z with ELAC1 located in the nucleus and in the cytosol (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), while ELAC2 resides in the nucleus and in mitochondria (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>â<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
      <p>The tRNA genes present in the mitochondrial genome do not encode for the 3â²-terminal CCA triplet; hence, the next essential step in tRNA maturation is the post-transcriptional addition of the conserved 3â²-CCA sequence required for aminoacylation. The reaction is catalyzed by the CCA-adding enzyme, which uses cytidine triphosphate and adenosine triphosphate as substrates to catalyze a sequence-specific nucleotide polymerization without a requirement for a nucleic acid template (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has been shown that the three core processing steps of human mitochondrial tRNA maturationâ5â²-cleavage, 3â²-cleavage and the 3â²-CCA additionâfollow an ordered process (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) without evidence for a direct link between the different steps. However, during earlier work on the crystal structure of the nuclease domain of mitochondrial RNase P (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we noted that RNase P was not able to perform multiple-turnover reactions. Here, we have further investigated this issue, and observed that, although MRPP3 performs multiple-turnover reactions, the MRPP1/2 complex is only capable of single-turnover catalysis in the RNase P catalyzed tRNA 5â²-processing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MRPP1/2 is not only responsible for mitochondrial RNase P-based 5â²-leader removal, but also that it remains attached to the tRNA substrate to enable further downstream processing steps including 3â²-tail removal by ELAC2 and 3â²-CCA addition by the CCA-adding enzyme. Specifically, for the large majority of human mitochondrial tRNAs, the MRPP1/2 complex significantly enhances ELAC2-catalyzed tRNA 3â²-processing. The MRPP1/2 complex thereby takes an unexpected central role in the core processing steps required for human mitochondrial tRNA maturation.</p>

The gene encoding human mitochondrial zinc phosphodiesterase ELAC protein 2 (ELAC2; UniProt: Q9BQ52; residues 31â826) was synthesized (DNA2.0) and cloned into the pJExpress 411 vector, which adds an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and a TEV cleavage site to the N-terminus of the protein. The gene encoding human mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme (UniProt: Q96Q11; residues 42â434; also called mitochondrial CCA tRNA nucleotidyltransferase 1, TRNT1) was synthesized (Gen9) and cloned into the pNIC28-Bsa4 expression vector (GenBank: EF198106), which adds an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and a TEV cleavage site to the N-terminus of the protein.

The reaction mixes (in triplicates) were incubated at 30Â°C for 10 min before separation on 4% agarose EX E-gels (Invitrogen) at 4Â°C.

        <title>tRNA remains bound to MRPP1/2 after RNase P cleavage</title>
        <p>To characterize the effects of the relative enzyme concentrations on human mitochondrial RNase P-cleavage efficiency, we initially used pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(38,17) as a substrate (where (X,Y) indicates the number of additional nucleotides of the 5â²-leader and 3â²-tail, respectively). The pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> is located at the 5â²-end of the cluster of tRNA genes Tyr-Cys-Asn-Ala located on the light-strand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). We varied the amounts of MRPP1/2 complex or MRPP3 in separate runs. The results showed that 5â²-processing of pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(38,17) by mitochondrial RNase P exhibited different dependencies on MRPP1/2 and MRPP3 concentrations. MRPP3 displayed full activity at sub-stoichiometric ratios of protein:tRNA indicative of multiple-turnover reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, top panel). In contrast, when there was less MRPP1/2 complex than tRNA substrate, there was a quick decline in activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, bottom panel). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that MRPP1/2 remains attached to the 5â²-processed tRNA. To test this, we reconstituted MRPP1/2 with pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(5,6). This resulted in the formation of a complex that was stable during gel filtration (Peak 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">F</xref>). When MRPP3 was added to the pre-formed MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(5,6) complex, the 5â²-leader of the pre-tRNA was removed, while the 5â²-processed pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,6) remained attached to MRPP1/2 (Peak 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">F</xref>).</p>

        <p>We then continued with a more complex mitochondrial tRNA substrate from the heavy-strand: pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(25,S); where S corresponds to the complete 59 nucleotide-long tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). tRNA<sup>His</sup> is located at the 5â²-end of a cluster of tRNAsâHis-Ser(AGY)-Leu(CUN)âlocated between the ND4 and ND5 coding sequences. For tRNA<sup>His</sup>(25,S), we observed the same general pattern as with pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>. Specifically, there was a strong concentration dependency on the MRPP1/2 complex, while MRPP3 appeared to perform multiple-turnover reactions in the mitochondrial RNase P cleavage reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Interestingly, RNase P did not process the His-Ser(AGY) junction, shown by the fact that the incubation of pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(25,S) with RNase P gave only pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S) and not pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,0) and pre-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>(0,0) as products. Gel filtration experiments confirmed that MRPP1/2 was able to form a strong complex with pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(25,S) (Peak 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref>).

        <title>MRPP1/2 enhances the activity of ELAC2 for the majority of mitochondrial tRNAs</title>
        <p>Since MRPP1/2 remained bound to the 5â²-processed pre-tRNA generated by mitochondrial RNase P cleavage in both our experiments reported here, we asked whether MRPP1/2 also played a role in the ensuing tRNA 3â²-tail removal catalyzed by ELAC2. To this end, we assayed ELAC2 activity on pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,17) both in the absence and presence of MRPP1/2. We found that ELAC2 alone was only active under non-physiological conditions with low ionic strength characterized by a low cleavage rate and a significant amount of mis-cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, when MRPP1/2 was present, the tRNA 3â²-tail was efficiently cleaved off under all experimental conditions tested, with maximal cleavage efficiency under physiological conditions (100â150 mM KCl) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The mis-cleavage of pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,17) observed for ELAC2 under low-ionic strength conditions was completely abolished in the presence of MRPP1/2. For the heavy-strand substrate, pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S), we observed a similar pattern, whereby ELAC2 alone cleaved only under non-physiological conditions at very low ionic strength (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As in the case of pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, in the presence of MRPP1/2 we observed cleavage of pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S) under all experimental conditions with maximum activity in the physiological salt range.</p>

        <p>To test if the MRPP1/2 complex played a general role in ELAC2 3â²-tRNA processing, we analyzed the effect of MRPP1/2 on ELAC2 activity for all 22 pre-tRNA substrates present in human mitochondria. The results demonstrated that for the large majority of human mitochondrial tRNAs, 3â²-tail removal catalyzed by ELAC2 was enhanced in the presence of MRPP1/2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Specifically, once the MRPP1/2 complex was present, the ELAC2-cleavage efficiency was strongly enhanced for 12 tRNA substrates, and moderately enhanced for five tRNA substrates. For the heavy-strand substrate, tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup>, as well as for the light-strand substrates, tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> and tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>, there were no significant differences with and without added MRPP1/2 complex. Interestingly, ELAC2 activity on tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>(0,tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup>+15) was drastically inhibited in the presence of MRPP1/2. To confirm that it was the MRPP1/2 complex, and not any of the individual proteins, that supported the ELAC2-catalyzed removal of the 3â²-tail, we also tested the activity of ELAC2 in the presence of MRPP1, MRPP2 and MRPP1/2 complex. The results confirmed that only the full MRPP1/2 complex supported the ELAC2-cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>tRNA remains bound to MRPP1/2 after ELAC2 cleavage</title>
        <p>To investigate the interplay between MRPP1/2 and ELAC2 in more detail, we varied the relative concentrations of the components. Specifically, we varied the concentrations of ELAC2 and MRPP1/2 under physiological conditions using pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,17) as a substrate. We found that ELAC2 took part in multiple-turnover reactions, whereas MRPP1/2 only performed a single-turnover reaction in the RNase Z catalyzed tRNA 3â²-processing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Further analysis using gel filtration revealed that the incubation of a preformed MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(5,6) complex with MRPP3 and ELAC2 resulted in the formation of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,0), which remained attached to MRPP1/2 (Peak 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). Low amounts of ELAC2 also remained bound to the resulting MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,0) complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), which suggests a weak interaction between ELAC2 and MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,0) even after 3â²-tail removal.</p>

        <p>A similar pattern was observed for pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S), where RNase Z processing of the His-Ser(AGY) junction released tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,0) and tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>(0,0). Here, the ELAC2 activity declined below a 1:1 molar ratio of MRPP1/2 to pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). ELAC2 was also able to process pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S) in the absence of MRPP1/2, but with a 125-fold reduction in cleavage efficiency. Moreover, we treated a preformed MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S) complex with ELAC2, and followed this by gel filtration analysis. The resulting chromatogram showed two main peaks corresponding to MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,0) and free tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>(0,0) (Peaks 2 and 3 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">H</xref>). Peak 3, which contains free tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>(0,0), also contained low amounts of pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,0), presumably originating from carry-over from Peak 2. Since the tRNAs studied above were from tRNA clusters we tested if the 3â²-processing of a single-gene tRNA follows the same pattern. To this end, we varied the concentrations of ELAC2 and MRPP1/2 under physiological conditions using pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(0,15) from the heavy strand as a substrate. Once again, we found that ELAC2 took part in multiple-turnover reactions, whereas MRPP1/2 only performed a single-turnover reaction in the RNase Z catalyzed tRNA 3â²-processing and that MRPP1/2 very significantly enhanced ELAC2 catalyzed tRNA 3â²-processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>The order of tRNA processing is unchanged even in the presence of MRPP1/2</title>
        <p>We had now shown for tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,17) and tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,S) that MRPP1/2 was needed for both 5â²- and 3â²-tRNA maturation. However, the mitochondrial tRNA processing order was established <italic>in vivo</italic> or using mitochondrial extracts (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and not individually purified proteins in reconstituted complexes as in the work presented here. To test whether the RNA-processing order was altered by the presence of MRPP1/2 during the 5â²- and 3â²-processing steps, we used pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(38,17) and pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(25,S) as substrates in cleavage reactions with mitochondrial RNase P and RNase Z. The results showed that the <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation of tRNA continued to follow the canonical order (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>). Specifically, RNase P first had to remove the 5â²-leader from the pre-tRNA before ELAC2 was able to remove the 3â²-tail. This held true even in the presence of the MRPP1/2 complex and during prolonged incubation (90 min). However, for tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>(0,tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup>+15), we found that ELAC2, in the presence of MRPP1/2, removed the 15 nucleotide long 3â² tail from tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup> even in presence of the 5â² uncleaved tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>MRPP1/2 retains tRNA during and after 3â²-CCA addition</title>
        <p>After establishing that MRPP1/2 retained the 5â²- and 3â²-processed pre-tRNA resulting from the cleavage reactions by MRPP3 and ELAC2, we continued by analyzing the tRNA-binding capacity of MRPP1/2. To this end, we reconstituted MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA complexes using pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> samples of different processing status (pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(5,6), pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,6), pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,0) and pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,CCA)). Using gel filtration, we found that MRPP1/2 was able to form stable complexes with all four tRNA maturation intermediates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Since the MRPP1/2-complex was able to bind pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,CCA), we asked whether MRPP1/2 also plays a role in the ensuing CCA-addition reaction catalyzed by the CCA-adding enzyme. To assess this, we analyzed the activity of the CCA-adding enzyme on pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,0) and pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(0,0) in the absence and presence of MRPP1/2 at low (30 mM) or physiological (150 mM) salt concentrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>). We found that at non-physiological, low salt concentrations, the CCA-adding enzyme alone was error-prone; specifically, after 15 min of incubation, more nucleotides than the expected CCA sequence were added to the pre-tRNA substrate. Furthermore, after 60 min incubation, severe hyperactivation with long 3â²-tails for pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> was observed. In the presence of MRPP1/2, this hyperactivity was completely abolished. At physiological salt concentrations, there was no difference in the efficiency and fidelity of tRNA 3â²-CCA addition regardless of presence or absence of the MRPP1/2 complex.</p>
        <p>To test if the 3â²-CCA addition was performed on MRPP1/2 bound pre-tRNA substrate, we treated a reconstituted MRPP1/2:pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,0) complex with CCA-adding enzyme in the presence of ribonucleotides, and applied the reaction mixture to a gel filtration column. A stable complex between pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,CCA) and the MRPP1/2 complex could be unambiguously confirmed (Peak 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">G</xref>). The CCA-adding enzyme in Peak 2 eluted in the same volume as free CCA-adding enzyme. There was a small amount of pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(0,CCA) visible also in Peak 2 (Peak 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">G</xref>), which is presumably a tailing effect from Peak 1. In summary, these results showed that the CCA-adding enzyme can perform multiple turnover reactions on mitochondrial tRNA substrates bound to MRPP1/2, leaving behind a stable reaction product of 5â²- and 3â²-mature pre-tRNA still bound to the MRPP1/2 complex. Further analysis of the three core processing reactions on both pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (38,17) and pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup>(25,S)âincluding RNase P cleavage, RNase Z cleavage and 3â²-CCA additionâconfirmed that the presence of the CCA-adding enzyme did not enable MRPP1/2 to perform multiple turnover reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Here, we have shown that the MRPP1/2 complex is not only an essential component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), but that it is also important for the ensuing tRNA 3â²-tail removal by ELAC2, at least <italic>in vitro</italic> and for the majority of human mitochondrial tRNAs. Furthermore, for two representative tRNAs, 3â²-CCA addition catalyzed by the CCA-adding enzyme can be performed while the substrate tRNA is bound to the MRPP1/2 complex. The MRPP1/2 complex thereby plays an unexpectedly versatile role as a processing platform in human mitochondrial tRNA maturation.</p>
      <p>To investigate the role of MRPP1/2 in the core processing steps of human mitochondrial tRNA maturation, we selected two representative tRNA samples: tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> from the light-strand and tRNA<sup>His</sup> from the heavy-strand. For these two tRNAs, the MRPP1/2 complex of RNase P binds stoichiometrically to substrate tRNA, enables cleavage by sub-stoichiometric amounts of MRPP3 and then retains the 5â²-mature tRNA product for 3â²-tRNA processing (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In the subsequent 3â²-processing step, the MRPP1/2 complex ensures efficient and specific cleavage by ELAC2 under all conditions tested, whereas ELAC2 by itself lacked both efficiency and specificity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Similar to our observations regarding the RNase P reaction, MRPP1/2 binds the tRNA substrate stoichiometrically, and the tRNA product remains bound to MRPP1/2 as ELAC2 performs multiple turnover reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Even though the presence of MRPP1/2 drastically enhances the activity of ELAC2, the tRNA maturation still follows the canonical order in which the 5â²-processing precedes the 3â²-processing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>).</p>
      <p>We then expanded our analysis to all mitochondrial tRNAs, showing that under physiological salt conditions, 17 of the 22 tRNAs required MRPP1/2 for efficient and specific 3â²-cleavage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Hence, for the majority of human mitochondrial tRNAs, the MRPP1/2 complex is a general factor required for both 5â²- and 3â²-tRNA processing. To our knowledge, all previous studies have used artificially low-ionic strength buffers to investigate ELAC2-based 3â²-cleavage (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We note that conditions of low ionic strength promote partial unfolding of tRNA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which may explain the unspecific cleavage that we observe for tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Moreover, under low ionic-strength conditions, the specificity and overall efficiency of ELAC2 is greatly reduced relative to its activity under physiological conditions when supplemented with MRPP1/2.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, there are four mitochondrial tRNAs for which there was no difference in the 3â²-processing efficiency in the absence and presence of MRPP1/2. These include the heavy-strand substrate tRNA<sup>Leu(UUR)</sup> as well as the light-strand substrates tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> and tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>. Thus, either the MRPP1/2 complex is not required to support the ELAC2-based 3â²-processing in these few cases, or our experimental setup is not sensitive enough to allow visualization of this difference (e.g. a time issue). For tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup> this might be explained by the short D-loop and the slightly extended anti-codon stem but most probably not dependent on the lack of N<sup>1</sup>-methylation of A/G at position 9 since ELAC2-processing of tRNA<sup>Met</sup>, which contains a C at position 9, is strongly enhanced by MRPP1/2. There is a trend that the unsupported light-strand tRNA substrates tRNA<sup>Ser(UCN)</sup>, tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> and tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> contain G as the discriminator base. This trend is, however, contradicted by the observation that tRNA<sup>Trp</sup>, which also contains a G as the discriminator base, is strongly supported by MRPP1/2 during 3â²-processing. The experiments in this study were performed in the presence of SAM to ensure that the tRNA substrates were not bound to MRPP1/2 because of a lack of methylation at position 9. Moreover, the tRNA processing efficiency of ELAC2 does not correlate with the location of the tRNA in the genome.</p>
      <p>We characterized the processing mechanism of the tightly packed tRNA cluster His-Ser(AGY)-Leu(CUN) from the heavy-strand, in which the three tRNAs directly follow each other. Our data are consistent with previously reported observations that pre-tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> is released indirectly following ELAC2-processing of pre-tRNA<sup>His</sup> and cleavage of tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup> by RNase P (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The observation that MRPP1/2 does not bind tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> during gel filtration experiments leads us to postulate that MRPP1/2 controls the processing mechanism of the His-Ser(AGY)-Leu(CUN) cluster as it recognizes tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup> and tRNA<sup>His</sup>, and thereby supports the cleavage reactions catalyzed by mitochondrial RNase P and RNase Z, respectively, the consequence of which enables the release of tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>. It is notable in this context that tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> exhibits a truncated cloverleaf structure with absence of the D-arm and an extended anticodon stem (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This unusual arrangement might be responsible for the failure of MRPP1/2 to recognize tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup>, providing a potential hint to the importance of the D-arm for tRNA interaction with the MRPP1/2 complex. Interestingly, processing of the Ser(AGY)-Leu(CUN) junction by ELAC2 is possible, but is severely inhibited in the presence of MRPP1/2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), potentially through the binding of MRPP1/2 to tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup>. We further observed that in the presence of MRPP1/2, ELAC2 was capable of removing the 3â²-tail from tRNA<sup>Leu(CUN)</sup> even in the presence of tRNA<sup>Ser(AGY)</sup> at its 5â²-end, yet with a significantly reduced cleavage rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1C and D</xref>). This peculiar observation contradicts the canonical processing order in which RNase P precedes RNase Z processing (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
      <p>The last core processing step, 3â²-CCA addition by the CCA-adding enzyme, is required for all human mitochondrial tRNAs. In this study, we have shown that the CCA-adding enzyme can perform the 3â²-CCA addition while the tRNA substrate remains bound to MRPP1/2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast to MRPP3 and ELAC2, the presence of MRPP1/2 is not essential for the activity of the CCA-adding enzyme. Importantly, it has been reported previously that the mammalian mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme does not strictly recognize the conserved T-loop sequence, which is one of the major recognition element for most CCA-adding enzymes from other organisms (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This altered recognition mechanism may explain why the human mitochondrial CCA-adding enzyme can process MRPP1/2-bound tRNA substrates. Still, we were surprised to see that 3â²-CCA addition did not release the tRNA from MRPP1/2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">G</xref>) even if the affinity is slightly lower for tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> with CCA addition than without (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5D</xref>). The question remains as to how and when does the tRNA leave the MRPP1/2 complex. To answer this question, the roles of aminoacyltransferases, or tRNA-modifying enzymes, will need to be evaluated in future experiments.</p>
      <p>Our results allow us to propose an interaction mode between MRPP1/2 and its pre-tRNA substrates. Firstly, the recognition of the pre-tRNA substrate does not seem to involve recognition of the 5â²- and 3â²-ends. This appears reasonable from a steric point of view, because only then would the termini be accessible for other processing enzymes. Further, we speculated above that the D-arm may be crucial for tRNA-recognition by MRPP1/2. Possibly, MRPP1/2 directs the temporal order of processing events while stabilizing the structurally diverse mitochondrial tRNAs until fully processed.</p>
      <p>For mitochondrial RNase P-based removal of the 5â²-leader, we have previously suggested that MRPP1/2 induces, and stabilizes, structural rearrangements in MRPP3 that lead to its activation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition to proteinâRNA interactions, this is expected to involve specific proteinâprotein interactions. Moreover, human mitochondrial ELAC2 is not the only RNase Z whose activity is influenced by other proteins. Yeast La homologous protein 1 (Lhp1p) is required for tRNA 3â²-processing by acting as an RNA chaperone that facilitates correct folding of certain pre-tRNAs to allow subsequent endonucleolytic processing (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Considering the structural complexity of human mitochondrial tRNAs, including intricate modification patterns (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), the need for a stable processing platform, such as that offered by MRPP1/2, would seem advantageous and reasonable. It remains to be investigated whether other maturation enzymes, such as methyltransferases and aminoacyltransferases, are also able to use MRPP1/2-bound tRNA as substrate. Noteworthy, the interaction of MRPP1/2 with ELAC2 and CCA-adding enzyme is supported by the complex formation of MRPP1 with ELAC2 and CCA-adding enzyme using affinity-capture mass spectrometry (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) as well as of MRPP2 with ELAC2 by co-fractionation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Further, ELAC2 and RNase P components co-localizes <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mitochondrial DNA nucleoids (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mutations in MRPP1/2 have been linked to a range of diseases (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>â<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Until now, the effects of mutations have been placed in relation to either the function of MRPP2 (which also performs other metabolic functions), or to an influence on mitochondrial RNase P function (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>â<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Additionally, in previous <italic>in vivo</italic> work, it has been found that patterns of mitochondrial RNA processing intermediates observed when MRPP1 or MRPP2 were knocked down or out clearly differed from patterns observed when MRPP3 was knocked down or out (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Though this was clearly observed and noted as putative distinct functions for MRPP1/2 in mitochondrial RNA processing outside their role in the RNase P complex, there was, until now, no molecular basis for this aberrant RNA processing.</p>
      <p>The results presented here show that the MRPP1/2 complex plays an important role in downstream mitochondrial tRNA processing and this should be carefully considered in the future when evaluating the effects of MRPP1/2 mutations on 5â²-cleavage, 3â²-cleavage, 3â²-CCA addition and most probably other steps along the tRNA maturation pathway.</p>
