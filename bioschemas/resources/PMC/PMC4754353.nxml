        <title>Summary</title>
        <p id="P2">Selective neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which counter-intuitively are often caused by mutations in widely-expressed genes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathies, for which there are no effective therapies<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. A subtype of the diseasesâCMT2Dâis caused by dominant mutations in <italic>GARS</italic>, encoding the ubiquitously expressed enzyme glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS). Despite the broad requirement of GlyRS for protein biosynthesis in all cells, mutations in this gene cause a selective degeneration of peripheral axons leading to deficits in distal motor function<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. How mutations in GlyRS (GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup>) are linked to motor neuron vulnerability has remained elusive. Here we report that GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> acquires a neomorphic binding activity that directly antagonizes an essential signaling pathway for motor neuron survival. We find that CMT2D mutations alter the conformation of GlyRS, enabling GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> to bind the Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) receptor. This aberrant interaction competitively interferes with the binding of the cognate ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Nrp1. Genetic reduction of Nrp1 in mice worsens CMT2D symptoms, whereas enhanced expression of VEGF improves motor function. These findings link the selective pathology of CMT2D to the neomorphic binding activity of GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> that antagonizes the VEGF/Nrp1 interaction, and indicate the VEGF/Nrp1 signaling axis is an actionable target for treating CMT2D.</p>

    <p id="P3">CMT diseases are a group of inherited disorders that specifically affect the peripheral nervous system and are characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy in the hands and feet<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Recent progress in neurogenetic studies has uncovered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as the largest gene family implicated in CMT. Among them, <italic>GARS</italic>, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) is the first member identified, whose mutations cause a dominant axonal form of CMT (CMT2D)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The canonical function of this evolutionarily ancient cytoplasmic enzyme is to catalyze the ligation of glycine to the 3â-end of its cognate tRNA as the first step of protein synthesis. Interestingly, emerging evidence has revealed that GlyRS in multi-cellular organisms, like several other tRNA synthease family members, has acquired the ability to be secreted from cells and as an extracellular protein can influence cell signaling<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">More than a dozen missense <italic>GARS</italic> mutations (GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup>) have been found in CMT2D patients with varying degrees of genetic evidence for disease-association<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Among them, three mutations (E71G, L129P and G240R) are the most tightly linked to the disease<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Spontaneous and ENU-induced missense mutations in mouse <italic>Gars</italic> also cause CMT2D-like phenotypes<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These dominant mutations are found throughout the primary sequence of GlyRS, with some affecting the aminoacylation enzyme activity whereas others do not<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Mice with a heterozygous deletion of the <italic>Gars</italic> gene and a 50% reduction in glycyl-tRNA synthetase activity are normal<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, overexpression of the wild-type GlyRS (GlyRS<sup>WT</sup>) in a CMT2D-disease mouse fails to rescue the neuropathy<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These genetic experiments indicate that CMT2D may arise from an abnormal activity gained by GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> rather than a general defect in tRNA aminoacylation as initially suspected.</p>
    <p id="P5">Like most class II tRNA synthetases, GlyRS functions as a dimer for aminoacylation. Interestingly, despite being dispersed in three separate domains of GlyRS, all known CMT2D-causing mutations are located near the dimer interface in the GlyRS crystal structure<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>). We found that 5 different human mutations associated with CMT2D caused a conformational opening in GlyRS that exposes new protein surfaces to solution<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). To test if this conformational change also occurs in P234KY-GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> linked to CMT-like phenotypes in mice, we performed hydrogen-deuterium exchange labeling on P234KY-GlyRS and found that the mouse mutation likewise opens new surfaces of the GlyRS protein to solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). These findings suggest that the abnormal âopeningâ is shared by many CMT2D mutants.</p>
    <p id="P6">The new surfaces exposed by mutations in GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> could lead to neomorphic protein-interactions. This prompted us to search for binding partners unique to GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup>. We performed a candidate-protein screen by <italic>in vitro</italic> protein pull-down assays. Because motor neurons are the most frequently affected neuronal type in CMT2D<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, our initial screen focused on molecules that are highly expressed by motor neurons and that have been linked to motor neuron diseases/defects. We detected strong binding between the receptor Nrp1 and several GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> mutants including P234KY and the three (E71G, L129P, and G240R) with the strongest link to CMT2D in patients<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In contrast, GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> did not bind Nrp1 strongly, and GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> failed to bind to other motor neuron proteins such as TrkB, DCC, Robo1, and Unc5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>). To confirm that this binding-specificity occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed immunoprecipitations using neural tissues from WT and P234KY-CMT2D mouse littermates. Anti-Nrp1 antibodies co-precipitated significantly more GlyRS from CMT2D mice than WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating P234KY-GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> binds to Nrp1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we also found that the GlyRS-Nrp1 interaction is significantly stronger in CMT2D patients carrying the L129P mutation than in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To quantify these interactions we used biolayer interferometry (BLI) and a biosensor with immobilized Nrp1 on the surface. GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> binding was undetectable at 1 ÂµM; whereas GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> bound significantly stronger with a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of 29.8Â±6.3 nM for L129P and 208.7Â±53.8 nM for P234KY.</p>
    <p id="P7">Next, we mapped the site where GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> binds to Nrp1 using pull-down assays with domain-deletion constructs. Removal of the extracellular a and c domains of Nrp1 did not alter GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> binding, whereas the extracellular Nrp1-b1 domain alone was sufficient to bind P234KY-GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Because the b1 domain is the binding site of VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>, this finding raised the possibility that GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> might influence the binding of VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> to this region of Nrp1. Using pull-down assays, we found that increasing concentrations of P234KY or L129P GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> compete with VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> binding to the b domains of Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Conversely, increasing levels of VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> displaced P234KY or L129P-GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> from the b domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">These observations led us to focus on GlyRS protein in the extracellular environment. Recent studies of GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> detected secretion from immune cells<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, so we first examined whether GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> is released by cell types relevant to the peripheral nervous system and motor function. Indeed, endogenous GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> was detected in the culture media of mouse motor neuron and differentiated myotube cell lines, but not of undifferentiated myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3aâe</xref>). We found that secreted GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> was enriched from extracellular sources using procedures that concentrate micro-vesicles (30â100nm, "exosomes") (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Extracellular levels of GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> were diminished by application of the exosome-pathway inhibitor GW4869 and enhanced by exosome-pathway activators monensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3aâf</xref>). Next, we checked if CMT2D-causing mutations affect the secretion of GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup>. Our results showed that P234KY-GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> was detected at levels similar to GlyRS<sup>WT</sup> in the media of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Nrp1 is a well-established receptor needed for motor neuron axon guidance and cell body migration<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Our finding that GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> and VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> compete for access to Nrp1 raised the possibility that CMT2D-mice may phenocopy some features of VEGF-A<sub>164</sub> (the mouse equivalent of human VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>) and Nrp1 mutant mice<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. VEGF/Nrp1 signaling is necessary for the caudal migration of facial motor neurons from rhombomere (r) 4 to r6 during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g, j</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This provided us with an excellent <italic>in vivo</italic> assay to examine the effect of GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> on a well-characterized system known to depend on VEGF/Nrp1 signaling. To track facial motor neuron migration we crossed CMT2D mice to transgenic ISL<sup>MN</sup>:GFP-F reporter animals that selectively label facial motor neurons<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We found CMT2D mutant embryos developed at a normal rate, appeared overtly normal based on their overall morphology, and the expression levels of a variety of neuronal proteins were comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a, b</xref>). However, GFP-labeled facial motor neuron somata were found in ectopic anterior rhombomere locations in E13.5 GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> mutant embryos and manifested as an elongated stream across multiple rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). In contrast, most facial cells had completed their caudal migration to r6 in littermate controls at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). This observation was confirmed by immunostaining with the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Isl that is selectively expressed in the nuclei of facial branchiomotor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k, l</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). This facial motor neuron migration defect closely resembles the phenotypes of Nrp1-null and VEGF-A<sub>164</sub>-null mice as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Taken together, the protein binding studies and embryological defects associated with GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> suggested that GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> inhibits VEGF/Nrp1 signaling.</p>
    <p id="P10">VEGF signaling is thought to protect neurons from a variety of damaging insults<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, deficient VEGF signaling leads to the selective degeneration of motor neurons in mice<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. To examine whether the VEGF/Nrp1 pathway is involved in motor deficits that arise from GlyRS mutations, we tested whether a genetic interaction could be detected between <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> and <italic>Nrp1</italic>. Although the data above suggest that GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> attenuates the normal Nrp1-signaling, it is still possible that GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> might activate aberrant signaling through Nrp1 and cause motor defects. In the first case motor phenotypes should get more severe as <italic>Nrp1</italic> gene dosage is reduced in CMT2D-mice, and in the second case motor phenotypes should improve. To test these possibilities, we intercrossed <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Nrp1</italic> heterozygous (<italic>Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic>) animals and characterized the motor behavior of the single and double mutant offspring. At 2 weeks when motor behavioral changes were not observed in either <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> or <italic>Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mutant mice, 20% of the compound heterozygous <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup>/Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mutant mice had developed neuromuscular dysfunction based on a hindlimb extension test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a, b</xref>). At 4 weeks, CMT2D-like symptoms including overt neuromuscular dysfunction and an altered walking stride become apparent in <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> mutants, whereas <italic>Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mice appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3aâd</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>). Strikingly, by 4 weeks, 50% of the <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup>/Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mutant mice had entirely lost the ability to spread their legs and toes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>), and exhibited severely abnormal gait patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). After postnatal week 4, <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup>/Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mutant mice began to die. Consistent with our biochemical studies showing GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> binds poorly to other signaling receptors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), intercrosses between <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> and <italic>TrkB<sup>+/â</sup></italic>, <italic>DCC<sup>+/â</sup></italic>, <italic>Robo1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> and <italic>Unc5C<sup>+/â</sup></italic> heterozygous mice did not worsen the neuromusclular phenotypes in the compound heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P11">The motor defects in <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> and <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup>/Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mutants were accompanied with significant pathological changes in the peripheral nerves and synaptic contacts with muscle fibers.

The loss of nerve terminals at NMJs was markedly increased in <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup>/Nrp1<sup>+/â</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>).

    <p id="P12">These findings prompted us to test whether VEGF overexpression could counteract GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> and help to slow the loss of motor function in CMT2D mice. A lentiviral vector encoding either VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> or GFP was injected bilaterally into the hindlimb muscles of <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> mutant mice at postnatal day 5 prior to the onset of overt motor defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). By 4 weeks of age, we began to observe a reduction of limb strength in the control GFP-treated <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> animals using an inclined plane test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-treated animals retained greater neuromuscular capacity with significantly higher scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). By 7 weeks, <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> animals exhibited a disrupted gait pattern with shortened hindlimb stride length, while VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-treated animals maintained a significantly longer walking stride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Likewise, VEGF treatment significantly improved the motor performance of <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> mutants in the rotarod test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). To minimize the possible influence from the natural variation in disease progression among individual animals, we compared the effect of VEGF treatment to GFP controls by separately treating each hindlimb from the same animal. Lentiviral vectors encoding VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> or GFP were injected unilaterally into each hindlimb of the same <italic>Gars<sup>CMT2D</sup></italic> mutant mouse at postnatal day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). At 5 weeks, GFP-treated hindlimbs developed severe muscle weakness, largely losing their ability to extend. In contrast, the contralateral hindlimbs treated with VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> retained significant function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9bâe</xref>). These results suggest that VEGF treatment significantly ameliorates the loss of motor function in CMT2D mice.</p>
    <p id="P13">A number of neurotropic factors have been tested as broad-spectrum strategies to enhance neuronal survival and treat motor diseases<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. This raised the possibility that VEGF might slow the progression of CMT2D pathology by functioning as a generic trophic factor rather than a specific agent to restore normal VEGF/Nrp1-signaling. Therefore, we tested the effects of lentivirus-mediated expression of GDNF, a potent neurotrophin that has been used to enhance motor function and survival in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.

Next we tested whether VEGF-mediated motor sparing is dependent upon Nrp1-binding by exploiting the binding specificity of VEGF protein isoforms. VEGF-A<sub>121</sub> has overlapping functions with VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> but lacks high-affinity Nrp1 binding<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.

These data support a model in which VEGF treatment helps to guard against the motor loss arising from the aberrant activity of GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> by restoring VEGF/Nrp1 signaling.</p>
    <p id="P14">Our results identify the <italic>Nrp1</italic> gene as an important genetic modifier for CMT2D, and link the selective pathology of this disease to the neomorphic binding of GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> to the receptor Nrp1. Although we found the same neomorphic binding to Nrp1 in several human GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> mutants that are strongly disease-associative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that some GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> mutants may interact with other extracellular and/or intracellular targets. Nevertheless, our findings strongly suggest that the VEGF/Nrp1 pathway is an actionable target for treating CMT2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). While the exact role of VEGF in the motor system remains poorly defined, VEGF-deficient mice selectively develop symptoms of motor neuron disease over time<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The direct antagonism of VEGF/Nrp1 signaling by GlyRS<sup>CMT2D</sup> found here further indicates that deficient VEGF-signaling may represent a common pathogenic pathway that is susceptible to abnormal activity in other motor neuron diseases. A broad implication from this work is that the molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases may arise from the neomorphic activity of misfolded proteins interacting with susceptible signaling targets in specific cell types. This conceptual framework may be applied for identifying additional drugable-targets to treat neurodegenerative diseases including other forms of CMT.</p>

Cocktails of the following primary antibodies were used to visualize nerves: rabbit anti-NF (AB1991, Millipore; 1:1000), rabbit anti-Synaptophysin (A0010, Dako; 1:2000), and mouse anti-SV2 (DSHB, 1:1000). Secondary antibodies were Alexa-488 or -647 conjugated (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen; 1:1000). Tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated Î±-bungarotoxin (T-1175, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen; 1:1000) was used to visualize acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on muscles. The occupancy of NMJs is measured by examining the overlap of the motor nerve terminal (green) with AChRs on the muscle (red). At least 40 randomly selected NMJs were examined from each of three mutant and three control mice. The flat-mount preparations of hindbrains were performed as previously described<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Rabbit anti-Isl1/2<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> was used to label facial motor nuclei by whole-mount immunostaining. The distance between facial motor nucleas and trigeminal nucleas was measured for each embryo. Each distance was further normalized to relative distance of WT facial motor nucleas. Rabbit anti-VEGF (ab52917, Abcam, 1:200) was used to determine the expression of VEGF in muscle fibers.</p>
        <p id="P28">Bright field and fluorescence images of whole embryos were obtained using a 0.8 Ã objective on Zeiss Lumar.V12 fluorescence stereomicroscope. Confocal images were obtained using 10Ã and 20Ã objectives on Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope.</p>

        <title>Hindlimb extension test</title>
        <p id="P29">Mice were suspended by the tail and the extent of hindlimb extension was observed over 10 s. A score of 2 corresponded to a normal extension reflex in hindlimbs with splaying of toes. A score of 1 corresponded to clenching of hindlimbs to the body with partial splaying of toes. A score of 0 corresponded to clasping hindlimbs with curled toes. Three tests were performed for each mouse with 5-s intervals. A score of 1.5 or 0.5 corresponded to behaviors between 2 and 1, or between 1 and 0, respectively.</p>

      <sec id="S14">
        <title>Footprint test</title>
        <p id="P30">Blue ink was applied to the hind paws of each mouse and the animal was placed in a narrow alley (9Ã80Ã25 cm) with the floor covered with white paper. A home cage was placed at the end of the alley for the animal to walk to while leaving its footprints on the paper. Stride length was assessed by measuring the average distances of at least three consecutive steps on each side.</p>

      <sec id="S15">
        <title>Inclined plane test</title>
        <p id="P31">Hindlimb strength was assessed at postnatal 4 weeks using the inclined plane test. Briefly, animals were placed on an inclined plane, and the angle of incline was gradually increased starting from 15Â°. The maximum angle at which the animal could maintain its position for 5 sec constituted the inclined plane score. The test was performed 3 times for each mouse.</p>

      <sec id="S16">
        <title>Rotarod test</title>
        <p id="P32">Motor coordination was assessed with a rotarod apparatus (Economex, Columbus Instruments). The mice were first placed on the stationary rod (0 rpm) to acclimate them to the apparatus, followed by a trial at a rotation speed of 1rpm for 3 min or until a fall occurred. For testing, the rotation of the rotarod was accelerated from 0 rpm with an accelerating rate (0.1 rpm/min). Latency of each mouse to fall was monitored for three consecutive trials and the intra-trial interval for each animal was about 20 min. The average time of three trials was used as a measure of motor performance.</p>

        <title>Virus preparation and injection</title>
        <p id="P33">The cDNAs encoding GDNF, VEGF-A<sub>121</sub>, or VEGF-A<sub>165</sub> were cloned into lentiviral vector (p156RRLsinPPTCMVGFPPRE) between BamHI and SalI sites. All lentiviruses were produced by GT3 core facility at Salk Institute with a titer of 1 Ã 10<sup>12</sup>â2 Ã 10<sup>13</sup> genome copies/mL. Injections were performed at P5 (Â±1 day) after anesthetizing pups on ice. Multiple injections (n â¥ 8) of virus (5 ÂµL for each limb) into a variety of hindlimb muscles were performed with a Hamilton syringe. Based on the expression pattern of GFP reporter, we found that the lentiviruses mainly infect muscle fibers.</p>

        <title>Nerve Histology and Imaging</title>
        <p id="P34">Mouse sciatic nerves were dissected and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Nerve samples were then osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded in araldite resin. Transverse nerve sections (1 Âµm) were cut on a Leica RM2065 microtome and stained with methylene blue Azure II. Images were collected on a Leica DMR microscope or an Olympus BX61 microscope. Axon numbers were determined from two non-overlapping fields (50Ã50 Âµm) from each of three mutant and three control nerve samples. Axon diameters were measured by Image J.</p>

        <title>Statistics</title>
        <p id="P35">All graphs and data generated in this study were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 Software (MacKiev) or Excel (Microsoft). Two-tailed unpaired t-tests with Welchâs correction using parametric distribution, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test using unparametric distribution, or two-tailed paired Wilcoxon test using unparametric distribution were performed to measure differences from at least three independent biological replicates. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. These tests do not require similar variance of the data between the groups that are being statistically compared. The normality of the data was determined by D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally used in the field.</p>
        <p id="P36">For all animal studies, analyses were performed on approximately equal numbers of male and female mice selected randomly from populations, and no sex-specific differences in the disease progression were identified. All behavioral experiments were performed in double-blind fashion, and stressed animals were excluded from the analysis.</p>
