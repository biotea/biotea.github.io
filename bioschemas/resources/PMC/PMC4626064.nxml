        <p>Mouse double-minute 1 (<italic>Mdm1</italic>) was originally identified as a gene amplified in transformed mouse cells and more recently as being highly up-regulated during differentiation of multiciliated epithelial cells, a specialized cell type having hundreds of centrioles and motile cilia. Here we show that the MDM1 protein localizes to centrioles of dividing cells and differentiating multiciliated cells. 3D-SIM microscopy showed that MDM1 is closely associated with the centriole barrel, likely residing in the centriole lumen. Overexpression of MDM1 suppressed centriole duplication, whereas depletion of MDM1 resulted in an increase in granular material that likely represents early intermediates in centriole formation. We show that MDM1 binds microtubules in vivo and in vitro. We identified a repeat motif in MDM1 that is required for efficient microtubule binding and found that these repeats are also present in CCSAP, another microtubule-binding protein. We propose that MDM1 is a negative regulator of centriole duplication and that its function is mediated through microtubule binding.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Centrosomes are the main microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells and are important for cell division, cell motility, signaling, and intracellular trafficking. They are composed of two centrioles, which are associated with a matrix of pericentriolar material (PCM). The older of the two centrioles has specialized appendages at its distal end, allowing it to dock with the plasma membrane and nucleate the formation of a primary cilium in interphase. Mutations in genes important for the formation, structure, and function of centrosomes and cilia are associated with ciliopathies, a class of diseases marked by common phenotypes, including neurodevelopmental defects, polycystic kidneys, obesity, polydactyly, and retinal degeneration (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hildebrandt <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In most cell types, centrioles duplicate once per cell cycle. Maintaining centriole number is important both for proper cell division in development (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Marthiens <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>) and for prevention of aneuploidy and uncontrolled proliferation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Basto <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ganem <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Silkworth <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Godinho <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). We will use the convention of referring to the centrioles of a G1-phase cell as parental centrioles and newly formed centrioles as procentrioles. Procentrioles begin forming orthogonally to the parental centriole at the G1/S-phase transition, coincident with the onset of DNA replication, and elongate throughout S and G2 phases (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kuriyama and Borisy, 1981</xref>). Many proteins important for forming procentrioles have been identified, including the kinase PLK4, which is capable of initiating the formation of multiple daughter centrioles when overexpressed (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Habedanck <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and the PCM proteins CEP192 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sonnen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), CEP63 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Sir <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brown <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and CEP152 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cizmecioglu <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dzhindzhev <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hatch <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sonnen <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which are involved in recruitment of PLK4 to the origin of duplication. Subsequent to recruitment of PLK4, the proteins SASS6 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nakazawa <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), CEP135 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), STIL (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Stevens <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and CPAP (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) initiate procentriole formation by assembling the cartwheel, a ninefold-symmetric structure that templates the formation of new microtubule barrels.</p><p>Although a number of proteins and mechanisms that control initiation of centriole duplication have been identified, the mechanisms that complete the process of centriole duplication and prevent reduplication are less well understood. A well-studied example of a negative regulatory circuit is the autoregulation of the stability of PLK4 by trans-autophosphorylation, rendering it a substrate for SLIMB/b-TrCP and the Skp1-Cull-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cunha-Ferreira <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Rogers <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Holland <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, centriole length is negatively regulated in part by the distal end protein CP110, depletion of which leads to elongation of centrioles from the distal end (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Franz <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Other described negative regulators of centriole duplication include the origin recognition complex subunit ORC1, which prevents centriole reduplication through interactions with cyclins A and E (Hemerly <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009), centriolar satellite protein CCDC14, which mediates centriolar recruitment of CEP63 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Firat-Karalar <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), nuclear paraspeckle and cytosolic protein RBM14, which is proposed to prevent interaction between CPAP and STIL (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Shiratsuchi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), and the CP110 interaction partners NEURL4 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), which is believed to regulate duplication by promoting ubiquitylation of CP110, and CEP76 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Tsang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A recent genetic screen in mammalian cells identified the ubiquitin ligase TRIM37 as a negative regulator of centriole formation, although targets of this protein are not known (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Balestra <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In contrast to the paradigm of positive regulation of centriole duplication, where proteins are hierarchically recruited to the origin of duplication and form observable structures, negative regulation of centriole duplication appears to affect duplication by a variety of mechanisms.</p><p>We identified a previously uncharacterized protein, Mouse double minute 1 (MDM1), as being highly transcriptionally up-regulated during the formation of centrioles and cilia in multiciliated epithelial cells (MCCs) derived from cultures of mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hoh <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)âtagged MDM1 localized to the centrosome in cultured mouse cells. <italic>Mdm1</italic> was originally identified in a transformed mouse 3T3 cell line as a gene present on small, amplified chromosome fragments termed double minutes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cahilly-Snyder <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Snyder <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). The well-studied oncogene <italic>Mdm2</italic> was also identified in this way (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cahilly-Snyder <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1987</xref>) and is near <italic>Mdm1</italic> in the mouse and human genomes; the two proteins share no homology despite their common name. In addition, an <italic>Mdm1</italic> nonsense mutation was suggested to be the causal mutation underlying an age-related retinal degeneration phenotype of a wild mouse strain (the <italic>Arrd2</italic> mouse; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here we report that MDM1 is a microtubule-binding protein that localizes to centrioles, MDM1 overexpression results in stabilization of microtubules and reduced centriole number, and depletion of MDM1 results in an increase in granular material that likely represents early intermediates in centriole formation. These results suggest that MDM1 is a negative regulator of centriole duplication and that its action might be mediated through direct contact with microtubules of the centriole barrel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>MDM1 localizes to the lumen of parental centrioles</title><p>We previously identified MDM1 as a centrosome component based on greatly elevated expression during ciliogenesis in mouse MCCs and colocalization of MDM1-GFP with Î³-tubulin at the centrosome in cultured cells (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hoh <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). To confirm this localization for the endogenous protein, we used two anti-MDM1 polyclonal antibodies that recognize the N- or C-terminus of the human MDM1 protein (Supplemental Figure S1). We were unable to visualize endogenous MDM1 by Western blot (Supplemental Figure S1, A and B), consistent with a previous report of low-level expression (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Snyder <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). Both antibodies showed that MDM1 localized to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle in hTERT-immortalized human RPE-1 cells (henceforth, RPE-1), appearing as two foci per cell in G1 through G2 phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and four foci per cell beginning in prophase of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The antibodies were specific for MDM1 in human cells, as shown by loss of centrosomal MDM1 signal upon MDM1 depletion (e.g., see later discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6, A and B</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S4, A and B). This suggests that MDM1 is associated with centrioles and only localizes to the procentrioles at the onset of mitosis, when centriole duplication is complete and centrosomes undergo several maturation events. In addition, MDM1 remained associated with centrioles of RPE-1 cells that were arrested in G0 phase by serum withdrawal and had formed a primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also examined whether MDM1 localizes to centrioles in MCCs derived from tracheal epithelium. MTEC cultures were fixed 4 d after induction of differentiation by shifting cells to airâliquid interface culture (ALI+4). We determined the localization of MDM1 with respect to CEP164, a marker of fully formed centrioles. Both CEP164 and MDM1 antibodies labeled foci in the apical domain of MCCs, consistent with localization to centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>MDM1 localizes to centrioles.

MDM1 localization was determined in reference to markers of the centriole distal appendages (CEP164), distal lumen (CETN3), proximal end (C-NAP1), and PCM (CEP152) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). MDM1 localized to the mid-proximal region of centrioles between the distal markers CETN3 and CEP164 and the proximal-end marker C-NAP1. The MDM1 signal was associated with each parental centriole and frequently observed to be bilobed in appearance. Whereas distal appendage and PCM proteins form rings resolvable by 3D-SIM, MDM1 localized in the center of the CEP164 and CEP152 rings, suggesting that MDM1 is in the lumen of the centriole. Consistent with this interpretation, MDM1 localized in the center of the centriole, as visualized by labeling polyglutamylated tubulin, a marker for the modified tubulin in the centriole barrels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that MDM1 resides in the centriole lumen between centrin and C-NAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, in cases in which the bilobed appearance was observed, all MDM1 signal colocalized with the polyglutamylated tubulin signal of the parent centrioles and not to SASS6 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, as with wide-field imaging, 3D-SIM imaging showed that MDM1 only associated with the two parental centrioles in postduplication interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, AâC</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>MDM1 localizes to the centriole lumen.

A distinct MDM1 focus was observed inside of each CEP164 ring, in agreement with the results in RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In late-stage ALI+20 MTECs, MDM1 staining was dim and diffuse in most ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), only having the defined centriole labeling typical of early-stage cells in the few newly differentiating cells present at this stage. We conclude that MDM1 localizes to MCC centrioles during MCC differentiation but declines in abundance at centrioles in fully mature MCCs.</p></sec><sec><title>MDM1 is a microtubule-binding protein</title><p>Given the original identification of MDM1 on amplified genome fragments in cancer cells, we examined the effects of overexpression of MDM1.

Here we report that MDM1 is component of centrioles and localizes close to the centriole microtubule barrel. We found that MDM1 associates with microtubules when overexpressed in cells and binds microtubules directly in vitro. Overexpression of MDM1 inhibits centriole formation, whereas depletion results in formation of structures resembling assembly intermediates. Together these data suggest that MDM1 negatively regulates centriole formation and that microtubule binding is likely to be an important part of that function.</p><p>MDM1 normally localizes only to centrioles but, when overexpressed, also associates with cytoplasmic microtubules. How might a microtubule-binding protein be limited to only a subset of microtubules? The microtubules of the centriole barrel are modified by posttranslational modifications and have a unique triplet microÂ­tubule structure. We note that CCSAP, a microtubule-binding protein that has repeats similar to those of MDM1, preferentially associates with polyglutamylated microtubules (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Backer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Similarly, MDM1 might have a higher affinity for these structurally unique microtubules of the centriole or might be directed there by interaction with other proteins that do. Based on the overexpression phenotype, it is likely that MDM1 contributes to the stability of the centriole microtubules. Although no obvious centriole barrel defects were observed in MDM1-depleted cells, a number of other centriole-associated proteins, including CEP120 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), CEP135 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho-Santos <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), CCSAP (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Backer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and CPAP (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Hsu <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), are also microtubule-binding proteins, and thus there are likely to be redundant mechanisms contributing to barrel stability.</p><p>We also identified repeats of a novel motif, (S/T)EYxxx(F/Y), which are highly conserved in MDM1 orthologues. We found that the centriole-associated microtubule-binding protein CCSAP (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Backer <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) also has two copies of this motif, which are also conserved. This motif in MDM1 was important for both in vitro binding of MDM1 to microtubules and MDM1-mediated microtubule stabilization. We note that mutating the repeat sequences in MDM1 could have a nonspecific effect on protein structure, as is true for any mutant, although we consider it unlikely, given that the wt and repeat mutant forms of MDM1 behave similarly with respect to expression, solubility, and centrosome localization. It is likely that sequences outside of these repeats are also important for the microtubule associations observed, since the repeat mutant MDM1<sup>rm</sup> partially associated with microtubules both in vivo and in vitro. Most MDM1 orthologues contain at least two repeat motifs, and the microtubule association required two or more of the motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref> and Supplemental Figure S2, C and D). The repeats might be involved in directly binding microtubules, as observed for repeated motifs in other microtubule-binding proteins, such as TAU and MAP2 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005</xref>). The repeats also might be subject to posttranslational modification that modulates the interaction between MDM1 and microtubules.</p><p>Our results suggest that MDM1 is a negative regulator of centriole duplication and that MDM1-microtubule binding is likely to be important for this function. MDM1 is recruited to procentrioles near the onset of mitosis, when procentrioles finish duplication and begin a maturation process required to become parental centrioles in the next cell cycle (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). MDM1 overexpression and depletion experiments both revealed phenotypes consistent with it functioning as a negative regulator of centriole duplication. OverÂ­expression of MDM1 blocked both centriole duplication in cycling RPE-1 cells and centriole reduplication in S phaseâarrested U2OS cells. Because reduplication is believed to derive from repeated rounds of centriole disengagement and centriole formation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Loncarek <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), this suggests that MDM1 functions in the canonical duplication pathway, thus affecting both. This is in contrast to the mechanism of ORC1, which was also shown to be a negative regulator of centriole duplication and specifically blocks reduplication and not canonical duplication (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hemerly <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Of interest, expression of MDM1<sup>rm</sup> failed to block centriole reduplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and was defective at blocking normal centriole duplication (Supplemental Figure S3D), despite the fact that it localized to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that MDM1âmicrotubule binding is important for the inhibition of centriole duplication caused by MDM1 overexpression. A possible mechanism for the MDM1 inhibition of duplication is that overexpressed MDM1 binds to its sites at the proximal end of centrioles and physically blocks the recruitment of a protein or complex required for duplication. This would also be consistent with the seemingly paradoxical observation that MDM1 is highly up-regulated in MTECs, which are making hundreds of centrioles; centrioles in MTECs are made by a different pathway, initiated by deuterosomes rather than preexisting centrioles (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and MDM1 might block duplication from newly formed centrioles in these cells. A recent study suggested that SASS6 localizes to the proximal lumen of parental centrioles at the G1/S transition and that this localization is involved in templating cartwheel formation for the new procentriole (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fong <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). It is possible that excess MDM1 interferes with the reentry of SASS6 into the parental centriole proximal lumen, in turn blocking duplication.</p><p>Depletion of MDM1 was associated with an increase in centrin foci that appeared as dense granules by EM. We also detected increased foci of CPAP, a centriole duplication protein, by immunofluorescence. Such foci are characteristic of early stages of centriole formation in the de novo centriole duplication pathway (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Prosser <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and similar centrin+/CPAP+ structures have been observed in cases in which other negative regulators of centriole duplication are depleted, such as is the case for RBM14 (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Shiratsuchi <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and NEURL4 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). We stress that we did not observe extra, bona fide centrioles in these experiments. The presence of existing centrioles inhibits the de novo formation pathway by an unknown mechanism (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">La Terra <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recruitment of MDM1 to procentrioles in late G2 could serve as a signal that duplication is complete and that further recruitment of centriole components should cease. In this model, the extra centrin foci might represent centriole material transported to the centrosomes of cells that have structurally complete centrioles but lack this âcompletionâ signal. Another possibility is that procentrioles may have structural defects in the absence of MDM1 and that the centrin foci might be material recruited to repair procentrioles. Again, we did not observe obvious centriole structural defects in the cells with extra centrin foci observed by CLEM, suggesting that if this latter model is correct, any defects would likely be minor.</p><p>Finally, we note that MDM1 was originally identified as part of an amplicon in mouse tumor cells that includes MDM2, an inhibitor of p53 that is otherwise unrelated to MDM1 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cahilly-Snyder <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Snyder <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 1988</xref>). Clearly, overexpression of MDM2 provides benefits to a cancer cell by blocking p53-mediated events such as apoptosis, but it is possible that overexpression of MDM1 is also relevant to the phenotypes of cancer cells in which it is amplified. Our results show that MDM1 overexpression results both in centriole loss and microtubule stabilization, and either could be involved in the commonly observed cancer phenotypes of genome instability, altered cell motility, and invasiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>A full-length cDNA clone of human <italic>MDM1</italic> (GenBank accession no.
